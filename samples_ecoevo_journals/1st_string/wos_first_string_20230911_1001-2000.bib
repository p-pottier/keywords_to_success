Abstract = {IntroductionIn order to accurately model the IC reactor of the
   wastewater treatment system and efficiently control and adjust the water
   treatment process, this paper proposes a method to predict the operation
   effect of the IC reactor using an artificial neural network model. This
   paper takes the IC reactor section of a papermaking wastewater treatment
   plant as the research object, and predicts the COD value of its effluent
   through the neural network model established. The experimental results
   show that the simulation prediction value of BP neural network is
   basically consistent with the change trend of the actual value, and has
   a certain prediction ability. Among the 20 groups of sample data for
   simulation prediction, the prediction relative error value of 9 sample
   data pairs is less than 5\%, that is, the prediction error of 45\%
   sample data pairs is within 5\%; The relative error value of 15 sample
   data pairs is less than 10\%, that is, 75\% of sample data pairs have a
   prediction error of less than 10\%; The maximum relative error is
   18.6\%. Through the regression analysis of the real value and the
   predicted value, the correlation coefficient is 0.7431. ConclusionThe BP
   neural network can capture the non-linear mapping relationship between
   the selected input factors and the output, and can predict the COD value
   of the effluent of IC reactor in advance.},

Title = {Agricultural practices of the Qin people from the Warring States period
   to the Qin Dynasty: A case from the Matengkong site in Guanzhong Basin,
   China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {In archeological studies, the Qin people have often been a subject of
   research. The areas of investigation about the Qin include their origin,
   structure of tombs, funeral rites and interment processes, and cities
   and settlements. Although there are some studies on the Qin people's
   diet which were conducted through isotope analyses, research on the
   agricultural system of the Qin people is still limited, especially
   during the period from the Qin people's settlement in the Guanzhong
   Basin to the First Emperor bringing the seven states under his dominion.
   In the backdrop of the Warring States Period, it is necessary to
   investigate the nature of the Qin people's agricultural economy and how
   it impacted their social progress. This study evaluates the Qin people's
   agricultural practices based on flotation results from the Matengkong
   site, located southeast of the Guanzhong Basin in Shaanxi province. The
   results showed that the inhabitants practiced multi-cropping, and the
   crop assemblage comprised five categories, including dominant foxtail
   millet (Setaria italica) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), important
   broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), less important soybean (Glycine
   max) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), less utilized barley (Hordeum
   vulgare), and cannabis (Cannabis sativa), and rice (Oryza sativa) of the
   lowest utilization. Wheat planting played a consistent and important
   role in agricultural production, and it appears to have had a high yield
   as same as foxtail millet. However, it appears to have contributed a
   small part of dietary intake. Rice does not appear to have been an
   important part of the Qin people's subsistence at the site and there is
   no supporting evidence that rice was grown at Matengkong. Rather, it is
   possible that rice might have been imported from Chu, a neighboring
   state to the south of Qin, through the ancient mountain passage. Adzuki
   bean, as a kind of crop resource, was widely used during the Zhou
   Dynasty. Moreover, Chenopodium sp. and Vitex negundo appear to have been
   intentionally used because of the high density in each single sample,
   but they might be multifunctional in nature.},

Abstract = {This study combines plant stable isotope and archaeobotanical analyses
   to explore how ancient pastoral communities in varying landscapes of
   eastern Tianshan managed their barley fields. The question is less
   archaeologically investigated, as recent discussions have focused on
   pastoral and nomadic activities. Results show that diversified
   cultivation strategies were employed in barley cultivation at different
   locations in eastern Tianshan. We also observed a diachronic transition
   toward less labour-intensive crop management corresponding to a growing
   pastoral lifeway from the late Bronze Age (1300-800 BCE) to historical
   periods (400 BCE-300 CE). These results inform us about the mechanism by
   which southwest Asian originated domesticates were adapted to the Inner
   Asian environments in the context of the early food globalisation.},

Title = {Study on the change monitoring of typical estuarine wetland and its
   effect on ecological factors in Bohai Rim region, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Estuarine wetlands provide an especially ecological home for various
   flora and fauna, with fragile ecological structures and functions easily
   affected by the external disturbances of both anthropogenic and natural
   activities. Recently, wetlands (such as water and marsh) of the Bohai
   Rim region have been, and continue to be, lost or altered under the
   influence of both local urbanization and economic development. There is
   an increasing need for crucial essential wetland change detection as one
   of the most critical works for relevant research. The paper's objective
   focuses on detecting the annual and interannual changes at a large
   spatial scale for understanding the mainly changed cover type of
   estuarine wetlands and measuring its impact on coastline ecological
   factors. Two typical study areas, including the Shuangtai Estuary
   wetland and Yellow River Delta, are selected for the assessment of
   changes to wetlands in Bohai Rim region, China. Additionally, Landsat
   TM/OLI images between 2005 and 2015, as the standard years for change
   detection, are used as the experimental data resources. To realize the
   rapid and automatic detection of change to wetland at a larger scale, a
   method is constructed to extract the change information from satellite
   images integrating the dynamic ratio and the max-difference algorithm.
   Based on the remote sensing base ecological index (RSEI), three
   ecological indexes include water body index, vegetation index, and soil
   index, calculated the annual maximum difference and the inter-annual
   dynamic rate of change to wetland. Furthermore, wetland changes are
   graded and evaluated five significant levels from the annual yearly and
   interannual scales. Results show several significant findings: (1) from
   2005 to 2015, the ecological change with an overall improvement trend
   was in two monitoring areas of Bohai Rim region. The annual change of
   ecological factors in the positively changed area (improve) was more and
   more significant, with the mainly converted type of the expansion of
   paddy field. In the negatively changing area (degrade), annual
   ecological change was more and more insignificant, with the main
   expansion of bare land. (2) The significantly increased accumulation of
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the main ecological
   change feature of the Shuangtai Estuary wetland. The significant
   regional changes in the Yellow River Delta were the interaction of
   ecological factors, included modified normalized difference water index
   (MNDWI), NDVI, and normalized difference soil index (NDSI). The study on
   the change detection of wetland and its influence on ecological factors
   in Bohai Rim region between two different periods enriches remote
   sensing monitoring technology of change to wetlands, betters
   quantitative evaluation of ecological factors, and provides updated data
   support for the wetland natural resource inventory at the various
   scales.},

Title = {Reconstructing diets of hunted sika deer from Torihama Shell Midden site
   (ca. 6,000 years ago) by dental microwear texture analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Sika deer (Cervus nippon) is the most abundant ruminant in the Japanese
   archipelago and has been the primary hunting target, including during
   the prehistoric ages. Abundant skeletal remains of sika deer have been
   excavated from archeological sites of the Jomon periods (ca.
   15,000-2,400 BP). We reconstructed the feeding habits of sika deer from
   the Torihama Shell Midden site in Fukui Prefecture, western Japan. The
   Torihama site is one of the most well-preserved archeological sites of
   the Jomon period, and we investigated materials from the layers of the
   Early Jomon period (ca. 6,000 BP). In this study, we obtained
   three-dimensional tooth surface texture from the lower molars of
   excavated deer and measured microwear texture using international
   surface roughness parameters (ISO 25178-2) to infer their habitat use.
   Next, we estimated the percentage of grasses in the diet by using the
   reference dataset for extant sika deer with known diets. The results
   show that the Torihama deer overlapped with mixed feeding and grazing
   sika deer populations. Moreover, the proportion of grasses in the diet
   was estimated to be 50.7\% on average but showed a wide range among the
   Torihama deer. This result implied that Torihama deer were mixed feeders
   of dicot leaves and grasses and had a flexible diet adapted to the
   vegetation of its habitat. Our results support the paleoenvironmental
   estimation that the Torihama Shell Midden site contained mixed
   vegetation of evergreen, deciduous, and coniferous trees around the
   Mikata Five Lakes in the Early Jomon period. These findings provide
   insights into the highly plastic diets of the extant sika deer in the
   Japanese archipelago.},

Title = {Multivariate drought stress response of Norway spruce, silver fir and
   Douglas fir along elevational gradients in Southwestern Germany},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The conifer tree species Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies
   alba) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are important elements in
   tree species composition and forest management of Central European
   forests, but their potential to thrive under anticipated climatic
   changes is still debated controversially. This study contributes a
   multivariate analysis of resilience components based on increment cores
   sampled at breast height of Norway spruce, silver fir and Douglas fir
   trees growing along elevational gradients in Southwestern Germany. We
   aimed to gain novel insights into the species-specific and elevational
   response of tree growth and wood density variables during the extreme
   drought events of the years 2003 and 2018. Our results for Norway spruce
   corroborate projections of its ongoing decline during climate change as
   the reductions of wood density and biomass production indicated high
   drought sensitivity at all elevations. Moreover, resilience indices of
   mean tree-ring density, maximum latewood density, tree-ring width and
   biomass production were even lower after the drought of 2018 compared to
   the previous drought of 2003. Silver fir, a potential substitute tree
   species for Norway spruce, showed unexpected results with resistance and
   resilience indices being significantly lower in 2018 compared to 2003
   indicating that silver fir might be more vulnerable to drought than
   previously expected, especially at low elevations. In contrast, the
   superior growth rates and higher levels of drought tolerance of Douglas
   fir were especially pronounced during the drought of 2018 and visible
   across the entire elevational gradient, even though high coning
   intensity was present for all investigated tree species as a possible
   confounding factor to exacerbate the drought stress effects in the study
   region.},

Title = {Exploring the trophic niche characteristics of four carnivorous
   Cultrinae fish species in Lihu Lake, Taihu Basin, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {This study found significant differences between the standard length
   distributions of humpback and redfin culter and between Mongolian culter
   and topmouth culter. A stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) was used to investigate the interspecies differences between the
   feeding habits and trophic niches of four carnivorous species of
   Cultrinae fish. The results showed that the delta C-13 and delta N-15
   values were significantly correlated with the standard length and
   species. However, the delta C-13 values of humpback and redfin culter
   were not significantly different, suggesting that these two fish species
   had similar food sources. The delta N-15 values of Mongolian culter and
   topmouth culter were the highest, suggesting that they occupied a higher
   trophic level and that animal prey was more important in their diets.
   Moreover, variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 indicated considerable
   niche overlap and interspecific competition among the four species. We
   also evaluated trophic niches, diversity, redundancy, and evenness
   utilizing isotopic niche metrics, and we estimated asymmetrical niche
   overlaps. The analysis revealed that four carnivorous species of
   Cultrinae displayed similar trophic niche sizes and trophic diversity.
   The trophic traits of topmouth culter clearly defined them as a trophic
   generalist in terms of the inter-individual variability in their
   isotopic niches. A significant finding was that the average niche
   overlap between them was as high as 64.02\%; topmouth culter had the
   greatest trophic overlap with redfin culter (95.52\%) and humpback
   (90.38\%), followed by Mongolian culter onto redfin culter (85.32\%),
   indicating that topmouth culter and Mongolian culter benefit the most
   from the food supply in the habitat, or they are more competitive in the
   presence of limited resources.},

Abstract = {The emotional health of urban residents is increasingly threatened by
   high temperatures due to global heating. However, how high temperature
   affects residents' emotional health remains unknown. Therefore, this
   study investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of temperature's impact on
   residents' irritability using data from summer high-temperature
   measurement and emotional health survey in Beijing, combined with remote
   sensing images and statistical yearbooks. In detail, this study
   formulated a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model,
   to study the differentiated and spatial influence of high-temperature
   factors on emotion. Results show: From 09:00 to 20:00, irritability
   level rose first then gradually dropped, with a pattern of
   ``aggregation-fragmentation-aggregation.{''} Irritability is very
   sensitive to intercept and building density (BD). Other variables all
   have spatial heterogeneity {[}except for fraction vegetation coverage
   (FVC) or road network density (RND) as they are global variables],
   including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), water surface
   rate (WSR), floor area ratio (FAR), and Modified Normalized Difference
   Water Index (MNDWI) (sorted from the smallest to the largest in scale).
   Irritability is negatively correlated with NDVI, WSR, and RND, while
   positively correlated with intercept, MNDWI, FVC, FAR, and BD. Influence
   on irritability: WSR < NDVI < BD < MNDWI < RND < intercept < FVC < FAR.},

Title = {Seedling age of Abies georgei var. smithii reveals functional trait
   coordination in high-altitude habitats in southeast tibet},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Functional trait-based plant ecology is often used to study plant
   survival strategies and growth processes. In this work, the variation
   regularity of functional traits and their correlations were studied in
   Abies georgei var. smithii seedlings of different seedling ages found
   along the altitude gradient (3,800-4,400 m) in Sejila Mountain,
   Southeast Tibet. The following functional traits of seedlings in five
   age classes were determined: above-ground functional traits similar to
   leaf thickness (T), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf
   dry matter content (LDMC); below-ground functional traits similar to
   specific stem length (SSL), specific root length (SRL), specific root
   surface area (SRA), root tissue density (RTD), and root dry matter
   content (RDMC). Results showed that (1) except for LDMC, most of the
   functional traits of the seedlings at different altitudes showed a
   regular change trend over time. The changes in traits caused by seedling
   age had significant effects on other traits (p < 0.05). Altitude only
   had significant effects on T, LA, SLA, SRA, RTD, and RDMC (p < 0.05).
   (2) The correlation between the above- and below-ground traits was more
   significant in 5-6-year-old seedlings than in other age classes (p <
   0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that LA and SLA
   were the dominant traits of fir seedlings in five age categories Pearson
   correlation analysis indicated a correlation between RTD and
   above-ground traits, thus validating the correlation between the above-
   and below-ground traits of seedlings of Abies georgei var. smithii of
   different ages. (3) Available potassium, total potassium, and total
   organic carbon (TOC) had the greatest influence on the traits of
   5-6-year-old seedlings. This study revealed that the functional traits
   of Abies georgei var. smithii seedlings at different
   altitudesdynamically change with seedling age. The findings help in
   understanding the growth strategies of seedlings during early
   development. Future research on the combination of soil factors and
   seedling traits will provide a theoretical basis for artificial
   cultivation and protection of native vegetation.},

Title = {Study on coupling coordination and collaborative optimization system of
   water-energy-grain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {In order to solve the problem that water resources in a certain province
   are relatively scarce and the spatial matching effect of resources is
   poor, which causes the w-e-f system to face the problem of trade-off,
   the water-energy-food coupling coordination and collaborative
   optimization system is proposed. By constructing the w-e-f
   multi-objective collaborative optimization model, the multi-objective
   optimization schemes under different weight scenarios are compared, and
   scenario 2 with better effect is selected as the best scheme for
   collaborative optimization. The results show that, on the basis of
   meeting the constraint conditions, by adjusting the crop planting
   structure and making efficient use of resource elements, the water
   resource consumption of major grain crops can be reduced by 7.3\% and
   the total energy consumption can be reduced by 2.5\% by 2030 compared
   with 2019. ConclusionThe system provides solutions to alleviate the
   pressure on water resources and ecological environment to a certain
   extent. Compared with the single objective optimization scheme,
   multi-objective optimization can effectively alleviate the trade-off
   conflict between w-e-f.},

Title = {Variations in phenotypic plasticity in a cosmopolitan copepod species
   across latitudinal hydrographic gradients},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Studies assessing latitudinal variations in habitat conditions and
   phenotypic plasticity among populations yield evidence of the mechanisms
   governing differentiation in the potential to adapt to current/future
   habitat changes. The cosmopolitan copepod species Acartia tonsa thrives
   across ocean clines delimiting Seasonal (30-40 degrees S) and Permanent
   (10-30 degrees S) Upwelling coastal provinces established during the
   middle-late Pliocene (3.6-1.8 Ma) alongshore the South East Pacific
   (SEP), nowadays exhibiting contrasting variability features related to
   several ocean drivers (temperature, salinity, pH, and food
   availability). Latitudinal variation across the range of environmental
   conditions of the coastal provinces can contribute toward shaping
   divergent A. tonsa's phenotypes, for example, through specific patterns
   of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and physiological traits and
   tolerance to environmental drivers. With the aim of contributing to the
   understanding of these adaptive processes in a relatively little studied
   oceanic region, here we compared the expression of parental (i.e., adult
   size, egg production, and ingestion rate) and offspring (i.e., egg size)
   traits in relation to variation in environmental habitat conditions
   across different cohorts of two distant (> 15 degrees latitude) A. tonsa
   populations inhabiting estuarine and upwelling habitats located in the
   Seasonal and Permanent Upwelling province, respectively. Mean conditions
   and ranges of variability in the habitat conditions and phenotypic
   plasticity of parental and offspring traits within and among cohorts of
   A. tonsa populations varied significantly across the different examined
   regions (i.e., Seasonal vs. Permanent). We also found significant
   differences in the coupling of habitat variability and trait expression,
   suggesting that the differences in trait expressions might be related to
   habitat variability. The phenotypic divergence was translated to
   cohort-related patterns of trait trade-offs regulating reproduction and
   tolerance of egg production efficiency that can jointly determine the
   level of plasticity, genetic structure, or local adaptation. The current
   findings provide novel evidence of how divergent phenotypes might
   sustain A. tonsa populations across variable coastal provinces of the
   SEP.},

   soil depth (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm) at Quzhou Experimental Station of
   China Agricultural University, Hebei, China during October and December,
   2016. The effect of farming practices on soil microbial abundance and
   diversity was studied by phospho-lipid fatty acid (PLFA) and DNA
   high-throughput sequencing methods. The findings revealed that soil is
   neutral to slightly alkaline in nature with highest water content under
   organic farming (ORF) at 0-20 cm and least under conventional farming at
   20-40 cm depth. It was found that the ORF significantly increased the
   contents of total organic carbon (TOC), total carbon (TC), ammonium
   nitrogen, available nitrogen (AN), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus
   (TP), and available phosphorus (AP) followed by low input and
   conventional farming modes in both October and December soil samples.
   The correlation analysis showed significantly (at p <= 0.05 and 0.01)
   strong positive relationship within different physical and chemical
   properties of the soil under study. ANOVA and MANOVA analysis indicated
   significant effect of interaction between soil depth and farming modes
   on soil parameters. PCA analysis showed the most significant correlation
   between most of the bacterial types (G + bacteria, G- bacteria,
   actinomycetes) and soil AP, total available nitrogen, TOC and soil WC.
   Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between
   microbial phylum groups (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
   Latescibacteria) and microbial class group (Alphaproteobacteria,
   Sphingobacteriia, Flavobacteriia) with most of the soil physicochemical
   properties.},

Title = {Carbon-isotope composition of artiodactyl tooth enamel and its
   implications for paleodiets},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {The stable carbon-isotope composition of mammalian tooth enamel is a
   powerful tool for reconstructing paleodiet and paleoenvironment. Its
   application in the fossil record relies on a thorough understanding of
   the isotopic composition of mammalian diets in modern ecosystems. We
   compiled and evaluated a global dataset of the carbon-isotope values of
   artiodactyl tooth enamel, supplemented by new samples, for 79 extant
   species. After correcting for differences in atmospheric carbon-isotope
   composition, body mass, and digestive physiology, we compared the
   inferred carbon-isotope values of ingested forage (delta C-13(diet))
   among seven feeding categories. The artiodactyl herbivore dietary
   spectrum is expressed through a wide range of delta C-13(diet) values,
   with the most depleted mean value in frugivores and the most enriched in
   obligate grazers. In general, grazing species have a broader range of
   isotope values than browsing species, suggesting a wider dietary niche
   breadth. Notably, variable grazers exhibit a bimodal distribution of
   delta C-13(diet) values, with North American and Asian taxa consuming
   C-3 diets and African taxa consuming C-4 diets, reflecting the amount of
   C-4 vegetation in the environment. Variation in delta C-13(diet) values
   also occurs among terrestrial ecoregions and artiodactyl clades.
   Grassland ecoregions differ significantly from forest ecoregions. We
   detected a low but significant phylogenetic signal in the mean delta
   C-13(diet) values of extant species, with some of the oldest ruminant
   lineages having maintained C-3 feeding and pure C-4 diets being
   restricted to two bovid clades. Determining variation in delta
   C-13(diet) values in different feeding categories and lineages will help
   refine paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the
   rich fossil record of artiodactyls.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Bioluminescent insects have been the subject of scientific interest and
   popular wonder for millennia. But in the 21st century, the fireflies,
   click beetles, and cave glow-worms that brighten our nights are
   threatened by an unprecedented competitor: anthropogenic light
   pollution. Artificial lights can obscure the light-based signals on
   which these and other bioluminescent organisms rely to court mates,
   deter predators, and attract prey. In the following review we summarize
   a recent influx of research into the behavioral consequences of
   artificial light at night for firefly beetles (Coleoptera: Lampyridae),
   which we organize into four distinct courtship signaling systems. We
   conclude by highlighting several opportunities for further research to
   advance this emerging field and by offering a set of up-to-date lighting
   recommendations that can help land managers and other stakeholders
   balance public safety and ecological sustainability.},

Title = {A morphologist, a modeler, and an endocrinologist consider sea turtle
   sex ratios in a changing climate. Some wine was involved},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Because the sex of sea turtles is determined by temperature during
   embryonic development, many populations are vulnerable to increased bias
   in primary sex ratios as global temperatures rise. Higher temperatures
   produce more females, and some populations are already showing years
   with all-female offspring production. But because sea turtles take
   decades to mature and have long adult lifespans, these primary sex ratio
   biases can take years to impact adult sex ratios, and the males from
   cohorts that are produced during cooler years may compensate for the sex
   ratio bias if they can breed more frequently and with multiple females.
   To date, little is known about male sea turtle reproductive behavior,
   making predictions of sex ratio skew impacts highly speculative. We used
   data from southern Florida loggerhead sea turtle nests to parameterize a
   simple population model to explore the effects of an increase in the
   proportion of female hatchlings over time on population trends,
   effective population size (N-e), and quasi-extinction probability. We
   also tested the effects of increasing the frequency of relatively high
   male production years to simulate potential mitigation strategies. While
   heuristic rather than predictive, our results expectedly show a rise in
   nest counts due to the increase in females over time, followed by
   population decline as males become limiting. Population collapse due to
   increased female bias will take many decades to occur, but sex ratio
   skew can have large impacts on N-e, and thus increase the potential for
   inbreeding. An increase in the frequency of male production years, even
   just one additional ``good male year{''} per decade, can help mitigate
   these outcomes if the rate of feminization is not too rapid. Male
   breeding frequency and mating success are critical drivers of the
   results and must be prioritized for research.},

Title = {Terrigenous subsidies in lakes support zooplankton production mainly via
   a green food chain and not the brown food chain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Terrestrial organic matter (t-OM) has been recognized as an important
   cross-boundary subsidy to aquatic ecosystems. However, recent evidence
   has shown that t-OM contributes little to promote secondary production
   in lakes because it is a low-quality food for aquatic consumers. To
   resolve this conflict, we performed a field experiment using leaf litter
   as t-OM. In the experiment, we monitored zooplankton biomass in
   enclosures with and without addition of leaf litter under shaded and
   unshaded conditions and assessed food web changes with stable isotope
   analyses. We then examined whether or not leaf litter indeed stimulates
   lake secondary production and, if it does, which food chain, the
   detritus-originated food chain ({''}brown{''} food chain) or the
   algae-originated food chain ({''}green{''} food chain), contributes more
   to this increase. Analyses with stable isotopes showed the importance of
   t-OM in supporting secondary production under ambient lake conditions.
   However, the addition of the leaf litter increased the zooplankton
   biomass under unshaded conditions but not under shaded conditions. We
   found that phosphorus was leached from leaf litter at much faster rate
   than organic carbon and nitrogen despite its low content in the leaf
   litter. These results showed that leaf litter stimulated the increase in
   zooplankton biomass mainly through the green food chain rather than the
   brown food chain because the leaf litter supplied limiting nutrients
   (i.e., phosphorus) for primary producers.Our results indicate that the
   functional stoichiometry of the subsidized organic matter plays a
   crucial role in determining the relative importance of brown and green
   food chains in promoting production at higher trophic levels in
   recipient ecosystems.},

Title = {Prolonged proximity to humans ensures better performance of semi-captive
   Asian elephants at discriminating between human individuals by voice},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {To avoid risks, organisms must recognize threatening heterospecies from
   non-threatening ones via acoustic cues from a distance. With land-use
   change, humans have encroached considerably into natural areas.
   Therefore, it is beneficial to animals to use acoustic cues to
   discriminate between different levels of threats posed by humans. Our
   study aims at testing this discriminatory ability in Asian elephants
   (Elephas maximus), animals that have been for long history subjected to
   human interaction. We tested whether eighteen semi-captive elephants
   could discriminate between voices of their own mahouts (i.e., who take
   care of the elephants exclusively) and of other mahouts (unfamiliar
   individuals). The results showed that elephants responded successfully
   to the commands from their own mahouts, with an average response rate as
   high as 78.8\%. The more years the mahouts had been as their caretakers,
   the more the elephant showed active responses toward the commands.
   Female elephants responded to the commands more frequently and faster
   than males. Also younger elephants responded more frequently and faster
   than older elephants. We argue that Asian elephants can discriminate
   between familiar and unfamiliar humans by acoustic cues alone. Proximity
   with humans may be a factor, as fundamental as domestication, for
   animals to develop heterospecies discriminatory ability.},

   Chemical Inputs, and Plant Phenotypic Plasticity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {Modern wheat varieties that were selected since the Green Revolution are
   generally grown with synthetic chemical inputs, and ancient varieties
   released before1960 without. Thus, when changes occur in rhizosphere
   microbiota structure, it is not possible to distinguish if they are due
   to (i) changes in wheat genotypes by breeding, (ii) modifications of the
   environment via synthetic chemical inputs, or (iii) phenotypic
   plasticity, the interaction between wheat genotype and the environment.
   Using a crossed factorial design in the field, we evaluated the effects
   of either modern or ancient wheat varieties grown with or without
   chemical inputs (a N fertilizer, a fungicide, and an herbicide) on
   ``microbiome as a phenotype.{''} We analyzed the rhizosphere microbiota
   by bacterial and fungal amplicon sequencing, coupled with microscope
   observations of mycorrhizal associations. We found that plant genotype
   and phenotypic plasticity had the most influence on rhizosphere
   microbiota, whereas inputs had only marginal effects. Phenotypic
   plasticity was particularly important in explaining diversity variations
   in bacteria and fungi but had no impact on the mycorrhizal association.
   Our results show an interest in considering the interaction between
   wheat genotype and the environment in breeding programs, by focusing on
   genes involved in the phenotypic plasticity of plant-microbe
   interactions.},

Title = {Capture Order Across Social Bathyergids Indicates Similarities in
   Division of Labour and Spatial Organisation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The social mole-rats of the family Bathyergidae show elaborate social
   organisation that may include division of labour between breeders and
   non-breeders as well as across non-breeders within their groups.
   However, comparative behavioural data across the taxa are rare and
   contrasts and similarities between species are poorly understood. Field
   studies of social bathyergids usually involve capturing all group
   members until the entire group is captured. Because each animal is only
   captured once and traps are typically placed in close proximity to
   active foraging areas, the order in which animals are captured provides
   an indication of the foraging activity of different individuals and of
   the spatial organisation of the group within the burrow system. Here, we
   compare the association of capture order with breeding status, sex, and
   body mass in four species and subspecies of social bathyergids, which
   vary in group size and represent all three social genera within the
   family Bathyergidae. We show that in naked and Damaraland mole-rats
   (Heterocephalus glaber and Fukomys damarensis), male and female breeders
   are captured later than non-breeders, whereas in two different
   subspecies of the genus Cryptomys only female breeders are captured
   later than non-breeders. The effect sizes vary largely and are 10 times
   larger in naked mole-rats as compared to Fukomys and 3-4 times larger
   than in Cryptomys. Among non-breeders, sex effects are notably absent in
   all species and body mass predicted capture order in both naked and
   Damaraland mole-rats. In naked mole-rats, larger non-breeders were
   captured earlier than smaller ones, whereas in Damaraland mole-rats
   intermediate-sized non-breeders were captured first. Our data suggest
   that there are similarities in behavioural structure and spatial
   organisation across all social bathyergid species, though the most
   pronounced differences within groups are found in naked mole-rats.},

Title = {Seabirds under environmental pressures: Food supplementation has a
   larger impact than selenium on chicks exposed to mercury and a viral
   disease},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Although infectious disease outbreaks represent a serious threat for
   wildlife population viability, the environmental factors that underlie
   such outbreaks are poorly investigated. The French Guiana breeding
   population of Magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens is subjected
   to recurrent episodes of chicks' mortality likely caused by a viral
   disease. We hypothesized that high mercury (Hg) concentrations may be
   responsible for the emergence of clinical signs. We therefore
   investigated whether healthy and sick chicks show different Hg
   concentrations in blood. Because the essential element selenium (Se) may
   be highly depleted during Hg poisoning, we further experimentally tested
   whether an increased intake of dietary Se has an effect on blood levels
   of Hg, increases circulating Se, and improves the oxidative status of
   chicks. Finally, we compared the results of this experiment with a
   previous food supplementation experiment. Our results show similar Hg
   concentrations between healthy and sick chicks with visible clinical
   signs of the disease. Se concentrations were significantly depleted in
   sick chicks. Se concentrations increased while Hg concentrations
   simultaneously decreased in chicks that naturally recovered from the
   disease. Both the Se and fish supplementation experiments significantly
   increased Se concentrations in blood, while Hg levels were only modestly
   affected. Providing food to chicks appeared to have greater benefits
   than only supplementing chicks with Se pills as, although food
   supplementation had an impact on blood Se similar to that of
   supplementation with Se pills, it also reduced the vulnerability of
   chicks to the viral disease, possibly by reducing nutritional stress and
   providing essential nutrients.},

Title = {Effect of non-essential amino acids (proline and glutamic acid) and
   sugar polyol (sorbitol) on brood of honey bees},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Dietary nutrients provide fuel for the growth and development of insects
   as well as chemicals for their tissue construction. Apis mellifera L.,
   an important pollinator, collects nectar and pollens from different
   plants to get their nutritional needs. Honey bees use protein for growth
   and development and carbohydrates as energy sources. Pollens
   predominantly contain proline and glutamic acid (non-essential amino
   acids). This is the first study to evaluate the role of proline,
   glutamic acid and sorbitol on bee broods. The composition of the diet
   can optimize the in vitro rearing process. Therefore, we elaborated on
   the possible impact of these amino acids and sugar alcohol on bee
   broods. This study aimed to achieve this objective by rearing honey bee
   larvae under different concentrations of proline, glutamic acid, and
   sorbitol (1, 4 and 8\%), which were supplemented into the standard
   larval diet. The supplementation of proline helped the quick development
   of larvae and pupae of honey bees, whereas developmental time only
   decreased in pupae in the case of glutamic acid. The duration of the
   total bee brood development was the shortest (20.1 and 20.6 days) on
   Pro8 and Glu4, respectively. Proline only increased larvae survival
   (93.8\%), whereas glutamic acid did not increase the survival of any
   brood stage. Pupal and adult weights were also increased with proline
   and glutamic acid-supplemented diets. Sorbitol did not change the
   developmental period of the honey bee brood but increased larval
   survival (93.7\%) only at the lowest concentration (Sor1). The small
   concentration of sorbitol can be used to increase the survival of the
   honey bee brood. However, a higher concentration (Sor8) of sorbitol
   reduced the body weight of both pupae and adults. This study predicted
   that rearing bee brood could be one of the factors for the selectivity
   of pollen with higher proline and glutamic acid during the foraging of
   bees.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Accurately delimiting phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status is
   important for understanding species diversity and distributions and
   devising effective strategies for biodiversity conservation. However,
   species delimitation is controversial in Gymnocypris eckloni, a
   schizothoracine fish endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The aim of
   this study is robustly identifying the phylogeny of G. eckloni in the
   Yellow River (YR) population and Qaidam basin (QB) population. The
   specific-locus amplified fragments sequencing (SLAF-seq) is employed
   with comprehensively sampling of schizothoracine fishes. In total,
   350,181,802 clean reads and 5,114,096 SNPs are identified from SLAF-seq.
   Phylogenetic analysis recovers a non-monophyletic population of G.
   eckloni between YR and QB populations, representing an independent
   phylogenetic relationship between the two populations. Species
   delimitation analyses by SNAPPER and GMYC methods using the genome-wide
   SNP data confirm that their taxonomic statuses are separated. This study
   highlights the importance of further reconsidering clearer taxonomy,
   which would improve the genetic diversity conservation of Tibetan
   highland fishes.},

Title = {Possible differences in effects on ejaculate morphology between shape
   and size components of the intromittent membranous part of insect male
   genitalia: Phylogenetic comparative analyses in Carabidae},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Male genitalia exhibit extreme morphological diversity among animals,
   but its diversification mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In
   insects, the intromittent membranous part has been barely studied. This
   study performed phylogenetic comparative analysis to examine the
   morphological associations between the intromittent membranous part
   (endophallus) and ejaculate characteristics in two Carabidae taxa with
   different endophallus diversification patterns (genus Amara and tribe
   Pterostichini). Endophallus morphology was analyzed using geometric
   morphometrics, whereby effects of shape and size components can be
   evaluated separately. In both taxa, no morphological associations were
   found between spermatophore and endophallus traits, but an association
   was detected between conjugated sperm length and endophallus shape.
   Considering the available information regarding functional morphology,
   the association between conjugated sperm length and endophallus shape
   may indicate a physical interaction between conjugated sperm and the
   endophallus through the spermatophore. The similarity of results between
   the two taxa implies functional equivalence among different endophallus
   types. Concerning individual sperm, several results were detected, but
   functional interpretation was difficult. Overall, these results imply
   that shape and size have different effects on ejaculate morphology, with
   a larger effect of shape than size. This pattern is consistent with
   previous results for non-intromittent and intromittent sclerotized
   parts, and the diversification mechanism of the intromittent membranous
   part may be similar to those of non-intromittent and intromittent
   sclerotized parts.},

Title = {Development of bamboo- (Bambusa bambos) based bio-fence to protect field
   crops: Insights from a study in India's Bundelkhand region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Stray/wild animals can cause serious damages to crops, leading to
   accusations and counter accusations among villagers. In the Bundelkhand
   region of India, this problem is more severe due to ``Anna Pratha,{''}
   that is, letting loose animals to open graze. Protective measures
   employed by farmers (barbed wire fencing, conventional fencing, etc.)
   are not fully effective and also require periodical maintenance, which
   involves additional costs and manpower. This necessitates the evolution
   of a cost-effective and long-term solution to minimize the problem. The
   current study seeks to evaluate the potential of thorny bamboo (Bambusa
   bambos) as a bio-fence creating deterrence to stray/wild animals at the
   ICAR-IISWC RC, the research farm of Datia, Madhya Pradesh, India. After
   21 months of planting, bamboo plants attained the maximum plant height
   up to 4.47 m with the highest clump spread diameter of 30.50 cm.
   However, the growth of the bamboo bio-fence to be effective depends on
   the edaphic and management conditions. The findings revealed that
   planting bamboo at a distance of 80.00 cm in the continuous trench can
   be an effective bio-fence to avoid man-animal conflict. Huge crop losses
   were reported before the establishment of a bio-fence. In 2021-2022
   (when bamboo plants turned into a closely spaced thicket, making a
   bio-fence), only two incidents of the invasion of animals were reported
   with no crop damage. The initial cost to develop a bamboo bio-fence was
   estimated at INR 5,796 for a length of 100 m. Therefore, the present
   study suggests that bamboo bio-fencing is an economical and effective
   crop protection measure against damage by wild/stray animals.},

Title = {Reproductive senescence in polar bears in a variable environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Reproductive senescence is ubiquitous in mammals. However, patterns of
   senescence vary across reproductive traits, even within populations,
   perhaps because of differences in selection pressures, physiological
   constraints, and responses to environmental conditions. We investigated
   reproductive senescence in wild female polar bears (Ursus maritimus),
   using 31 years of capture-recapture data from the Svalbard area. We
   studied the influence of environmental conditions on age-specific litter
   production and litter size using generalized linear mixed models.
   Further, using a capture-recapture model that handles the dependency
   between vital rates of individuals belonging to the same family unit, we
   assessed maternal-age-related changes in first year cub and litter
   survival. We provide clear evidence for reproductive senescence in
   female polar bears. Litter production and litter size peaked in
   middle-aged females and declined sharply afterward. By contrast cub and
   litter survival did not decline after prime age. We found no evidence of
   terminal investment. The reproductive output of all females was affected
   by sea-ice conditions during the previous year and the Arctic
   Oscillation, with some effects differing greatly between age groups. Old
   females were affected the most by environmental conditions. Our results
   suggest that the decline in reproductive output is a combination of
   fertility and body-condition senescence, with a weak contribution of
   maternal-effect senescence, possibly due to benefits of experience.
   Further, as predicted by evolutionary theory, senescence appears to be a
   consequence of failures in early stages of the reproductive cycle rather
   than in late stages, and environmental variation affected old females
   more than prime-aged females. Our study emphasizes the need to study
   several reproductive traits and account for environmental variation when
   investigating reproductive senescence. Differences in senescence
   patterns across reproductive traits should be interpreted in light of
   evolutionary theory and while considering underlying physiological
   drivers.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of Quercus semecarpifolia Sm.: An ecologically
   and commercially important Himalayan tree},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Himalayan mountain forests have been a potential candidate for the
   investigation of perturbations due to the complex geography in which
   they sustain and the sensitivity of the species toward human disturbance
   and climate change. Among various tree species, brown oak (Quercus
   semecarpifolia), a very important component of the Himalayan mountains,
   has been identified as a keystone species due to its substantial
   economic and ecological benefits. Maintenance of microclimate and
   suitable habitats with a rich source of natural resources makes Q.
   semecarpifolia the most preferred forest for luxuriant growth of ground
   flora, shelter for fauna, and multipurpose uses by the local people. In
   a climax community, it plays a critical role in environmental balance
   both at the local and regional levels. Unfortunately, it has become one
   of the most overexploited tree species of the Himalayan region over the
   last few decades due to its high demand for dry season fodder and
   firewood. The wide range of seedling distribution 348-4,663 individuals
   ha(-1) is evidence of the disturbance accompanied by poor regeneration
   in Q. semecarpifolia forests. Moreover, litter accumulation and grass
   cover adversely affect seed germination. The ecological cost of oak
   forest degradation is perhaps more important and damage is irreversible.
   Thus, continuous demand and extensive threats accompanied by poor
   regeneration have drawn the attention of stakeholders to conserve this
   species. However, propagation protocol, especially the pre-sowing
   treatment of the species, has not been impressive for large-scale
   multiplication. This review is comprehensive information on
   distribution, phenology, regeneration pattern, human threat,
   conservation approaches, and management of Q. semecarpifolia in the
   Himalayan region.},

Title = {Allostasis revisited: A perception, variation, and risk framework},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {The framework of allostasis, allostatic load and overload (i.e.,
   stability through change) attempts to combine homeostasis processes in
   day-to-day responses of physiology and behavior. These include
   predictive changes in environment such as seasons, and facultative
   responses to perturbations. The latter can be severe, occur at any time,
   and may present considerable additional challenges to homeostasis.
   Hormonal cascades, such as the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortex
   (HPA) axis, play a key role in responses to perturbations across
   vertebrate taxa. Glucocorticoids have been implicated in these processes
   in relation to energy balance that plays a role in determining responses
   to energetic demand (allostatic load) and influencing subsequent
   physiology and behavior associated with coping. Circulating
   glucocorticoid levels are likely regulated in part based on an
   individual's proximity to energetic crisis, identified as the
   perturbation resistance potential (PRP). In the model of allostatic
   load, PRP is quantified as the difference between available resources
   and all energetic costs of allostatic load such as daily routines, life
   history stages (breeding, migration, molt and so on), and the impact of
   environmental perturbations. PRP can change gradually or abruptly and
   may be reflected by spikes in blood hormone levels. The pattern of
   individual responsiveness to PRP may vary and has specific implications
   for the activation of mineralocorticoid vs glucocorticoid-type
   receptors, hormone metabolizing enzymes and other downstream factors in
   target tissues. However, PRP is a difficult metric to measure. Here, we
   examine the variety of cues that animals may use to inform them about
   the status of their PRP and probability of energetic crisis. We consider
   (1) elevation in glucocorticoids as an endocrine ``decision,{''} and (2)
   error management strategies in evaluating responsiveness to cues that
   may reflect or predict an impending energetic crisis. The potential for
   differential receptor activation as well as further integrative
   ``decisions{''} to determine the diverse and sometimes contradictory
   effects of receptor activation and its downstream actions are important
   to the consideration of error management. This perspective offers
   insight into the basis of intra- and inter-individual variability in
   responsiveness and opens an avenue toward improving compatibility of the
   allostasis model with more classical views on ``stress{''}.},

Title = {Diverging olfactory sensitivities to yeast volatiles reflect resource
   partitioning of tephritids and drosophilids},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {As pests of fruits and vegetables, ovipositing tephritid fruit flies are
   infamous for their frugivory. Yet, adult tephritids have remained
   saprophytic in their feeding behavior, as they require decomposing,
   protein rich media for sexual maturation and oogenesis. Drosophilid
   fruit flies, in contrast, are saprophytic both during oviposition and
   feeding. Here we compared the sensory and behavioral responses of two
   tephritid (Bactrocera dorsalis and Ceratitis capitata) and two
   drosophilid species (Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila suzukii) to
   differentially aged cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We
   assessed convergence and divergence in the detection of and behavioral
   response to these attractive substrates, and how these might be linked
   to the roles of the substrates for the different taxa. The headspace
   shifted substantially as broth cultures transitioned from active (1-day)
   to inactive (8- and 15-days). Interestingly, Drosophila flies were
   significantly attracted to actively fermenting 1-day old yeast cultures,
   whereas the preference shifted to older cultures for the tephritids.
   Bactrocera dorsalis flies preferred inactive, lysing cultures (8- and
   15-days old). We identified compounds from the 1- to 8-days old broth
   cultures that elicited antennal responses in each species. Synthetic
   blends composed of antennally active compounds evoked similar behavioral
   responses as broth cultures. Similarly, the attractiveness of less
   attractive broth cultures (1- and 8-days old for drosophilids and
   tephritids, respectively) could be augmented by adding volatiles of the
   more attractive cultures. The results show that the volatile profiles of
   fermenting substrates evolve quantitatively and qualitatively, and that
   fly species key into volatile blends that indicate suitability of the
   substrates for their purposes. For drosophilids early arrival at
   fermenting substrates confers a competitive advantage to offspring. In
   contrast, for tephritid the concentration and availability of protein is
   facilitated by older, lysed yeast cultures. The data from this
   comparative study are also instrumental in the development of novel
   lures for these pests.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a special rare and
   endangered species in China and is the flagship species for global
   biodiversity conservation. This study used different methods including
   Kernel density, statistical analysis, and logistic regression analysis
   to investigated the spatial distribution, migration in different seasons
   and different distribution areas, as well as the foraging patch
   selection strategies of wild giant pandas in Meigu Dafengding National
   Nature Reserve in the Liangshan Mountains. The results demonstrated
   that, in the study area, giant pandas were mainly distributed in the
   Wahei-Yizi Yakou Habitat Corridor with an activity area of 144.93 km(2),
   which accounted for 28.59\% of the whole reserve. The core distribution
   area of the species was 92.07 km(2) and the population density was 0.24
   pcs km(-2). There were two significant seasonal domains for the
   activities of giant pandas: the low-altitude winter habitat of Yushania
   maculata Yi and Yushania ailuropodina Yi bamboo species, as well as the
   high-altitude summer habitat of Bashania fangiana species. With seasonal
   changes, giant pandas migrated among different bamboo distribution
   regions. Giant pandas were mainly distributed in high-altitude areas
   that had secondary forest, tall trees with a large diameter at breast
   height (DBH) and bamboo forest. The spatial distribution pattern and
   microhabitat selection of giant pandas in Meigu Dafengding National
   Nature Reserve were determined. The findings of this study provide
   scientific implications for the local conservation and management of the
   habitat of wild giant pandas.},

Title = {Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction can benefit biodiversity
   conservation in a Japanese agricultural landscape},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) has attracted
   increased attention as a sustainable way to achieve both disaster risk
   reduction and biodiversity conservation, although there have been few
   quantitative evaluations of the potential impacts of Eco-DRR on
   biodiversity. Here, we examined the influences of flood hazard and
   land-use patterns on biodiversity by focusing on the species richness of
   plants, butterflies and odonates, and the abundance of two frog species
   in a rural landscape of Wakasa town, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. The direct
   effect of exposure to flood hazard on the studied taxa was not
   significant, whereas landscape factors associated with flood hazard
   significantly influenced either of the taxa in different magnitudes. We
   then exercised a scenario analysis by replacing urban land-use by
   non-urban, agricultural land-use (paddy fields in this case) to reduce
   exposure to flood hazard and projected the impacts on biodiversity. Our
   results demonstrated that the land-use replacement potentially reduces
   the risk of flooding by up to 5.19 billion yen (ca. 46 million US\$)
   and, at the same time, positively influences the species richness and
   abundance, although the ecological impacts are different depending on
   taxon and spatial location. The land-use replacement was expected to
   result in the increase of plant richness and abundance of Daruma pond
   frog at a location by up to 16 and 25\%, respectively. On the other
   hand, butterfly richness at a location was presumed to decrease by until
   -68\%, probably due to their dependence on domestic gardens. The
   abundance of Japanese wrinkled frog did not show such a clear spatial
   variation. This study highlights the significance of land-use
   replacement as an Eco-DRR measure to reduce the disaster risk and
   conserve biodiversity in the agricultural landscape.},

Title = {Sex- and tissue-specific expression of chemosensory receptor genes in a
   hawkmoth},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {For the nocturnal hawkmoth Manduca sexta, olfactory and gustatory cues
   are essential for finding partners, food, and oviposition sites. Three
   chemosensory receptor families, odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic
   receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs) are involved in the
   detection of these stimuli. While many chemosensory receptor genes have
   been identified, knowledge of their expression profile in potentially
   chemoreceptive organs is incomplete. Here, we studied the expression
   patterns of chemosensory receptors in different tissues including the
   antennae, labial palps, proboscis, legs, wings and ovipositor. We
   compared the receptors' expression in female and male moths both before
   and after mating by using the NanoString platform. This tool allowed us
   to measure expression levels of chemosensory receptor genes in a single
   reaction using probes designed against 71 OR, 29 IR and 49 GR
   transcripts. In all tissues investigated, we detected expression of
   genes from all three receptor families. The highest number of receptors
   was detected in the antennae (92), followed by the ovipositor (59),
   while the least number was detected in the hindlegs (21). The highest
   number of OR genes were expressed in the antennae (63), of which 24 were
   specific to this main olfactory organ. The highest number of IRs were
   also expressed in the antennae (16), followed by the ovipositor (15).
   Likewise, antennae and ovipositor expressed the highest number of GRs
   (13 and 14). Expression of the OR co-receptor MsexORCo, presumably a
   prerequisite for OR function, was found in the antennae, labial palps,
   forelegs and ovipositor. IR co-receptors MsexIR25a and MsexIR76b were
   expressed across all tested tissues, while expression of the IR
   co-receptor MsexIR8a was restricted to antennae and ovipositor.
   Comparing the levels of all 149 transcripts across the nine tested
   tissues allowed us to identify sex-biased gene expression in the
   antennae and the legs, two appendages that are also morphologically
   different between the sexes. However, none of the chemosensory receptors
   was differentially expressed based on the moths' mating state. The
   observed gene expression patterns form a strong base for the functional
   characterization of chemosensory receptors and the understanding of
   olfaction and gustation at the molecular level in M. sexta.},

Title = {Floral and Bird Excreta Semiochemicals Attract Western Carpenter Ants},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Ant colonies have vast and diverse nutritional needs but forager ants
   have limited mobility to meet these needs. Forager ants would accrue
   significant energy savings if they were able to sense and orient toward
   odor plumes of both carbohydrate and protein food sources. Moreover, if
   worker ants, like other flightless insects, had reduced olfactory
   acuity, they would not recognize the specific odor signatures of diverse
   carbohydrate and protein sources, but they may be able to orient toward
   those odorants that are shared between (macronutrient) food sources.
   Using the Western carpenter ant, Camponotus modoc, as a model species,
   we tested the hypotheses that (1) food sources rich in carbohydrates
   (aphid honeydew, floral nectar) and rich in proteins (bird excreta,
   house mouse carrion, cow liver infested or not with fly maggots) all
   prompt long-distance, anemotactic attraction of worker ants, and (2)
   attraction of ants to plant inflorescences (fireweed, Chamaenerion
   angustifolium; thimbleberry, Rubus parviflorus; and hardhack, Spiraea
   douglasii) is mediated by shared floral odorants. In moving-air Y-tube
   olfactometer bioassays, ants were attracted to two of four carbohydrate
   sources (thimbleberry and fireweed), and one of four protein sources
   (bird excreta). Headspace volatiles of these three attractive sources
   were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and synthetic
   odor blends of thimbleberry (7 components), fireweed (23 components),
   and bird excreta (38 components) were prepared. In Y-tube olfactometer
   bioassays, synthetic blends of thimbleberry and fireweed but not of bird
   excreta attracted ants, indicating that only the two floral blends
   contained all essential attractants. A blend of components shared
   between thimbleberry and fireweed was not attractive to ants. Our data
   support the conclusion that C. modoc worker ants can sense and orient
   toward both carbohydrate and protein food sources. As ants were
   selective in their responses to carbohydrate and protein resources, it
   seems that they can discern between specific food odor profiles and that
   they have good, rather than poor, olfactory acuity.},

Title = {Assessing tree species diversity in forest ecosystems: A new approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {The significance of biodiversity research is to understand the structure
   and function of the community, and then to protect and monitor the
   community. The metric of biodiversity is the base of biodiversity
   conservation. Species richness and evenness are the most common
   descriptors of biodiversity. Whether it is diversity information
   measure, probability measure or geometric measure, they all express the
   combination of species richness and evenness in different ways. This
   study presents a new biologically meaningful measure of species
   diversity, which evaluates species richness and evenness independently,
   designated as D-RE. The novelty of our method is to use ``absolute
   discrepancy{''} to express the dissimilarity between the observed
   community and the uniform distribution community with the same species
   composition and same abundance of each species, and then measure the
   species evenness. The logarithmic transformation of the species number
   is used to measure species richness with values ranging between 0 and 1.
   We test the performance of this measure using simulated data and
   observations of natural and planted forests in different climatic zones.
   The results showed that the new diversity index (D-RE) has superior
   statistical qualities compared with the traditional indices. Especially,
   in extremely uneven communities, the new measure describes the causes of
   diversity changes than the traditional D-RE. In addition, D-RE is more
   sensitive to the abundance changes of rare species in the simulated
   community, and the interpretation of the results is more intuitive and
   meaningful. It is an improved method to evaluate the species diversity
   of any ecosystem.},

Title = {How do ectotherms perform in cold environments? Physiological and
   life-history traits in an Andean viviparous lizard},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Both the mean and the variation in environmental temperature are
   increasing globally. Indeed, the predicted increases in temperature
   range from 2 to 4 degrees C in the next 50 years. Ectotherms control
   body temperature by means of behavior selecting microsites with
   different temperatures, which makes them more susceptible to changes in
   climate. Nevertheless, lizards living in high mountain environments have
   developed several mechanisms to inhabit and colonize variable
   environments with extreme temperatures. These mechanisms include a high
   metabolism to be active at lower temperatures and viviparity to improve
   embryonic development. Despite behavioral thermoregulation acting as a
   buffer to changes in environmental temperature, other traits such as
   life-history traits may be less flexible. Consequently, in an attempt to
   understand how lizards cope with harsh habitats, we evaluated some
   physiological traits and responses of females of Liolaemus bellii from
   two contrasting slope sites with differences in environmental
   temperature and humidity, but at the same altitude in the southern Andes
   range. We collected pregnant females from opposite slopes and maintained
   them until parturition in a common-garden experiment. Females from the
   south-facing slope (S-slope) had higher preferred body temperature
   (T-pref) values before and after parturition and exhibited higher daily
   energy expenditure before parturition. Nevertheless, no difference in
   T-pref was shown by their offspring, suggesting a developmental plastic
   response or adaptation to lower environmental temperature. For instance,
   the higher metabolism during pregnancy could be associated with a
   shorter activity period on the snowy S-slope. Additionally, females from
   the S-slope had larger kidneys and gave birth later than N-slope
   females, likely due to developmental plasticity or genetic
   differentiation. How fixed these traits are, in individuals from the
   contrasting slopes, will determine the response capacity of the L.
   bellii population to climate change.},

Title = {Assessing the effectiveness of management measures in the Ria Formosa
   coastal lagoon, Portugal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {The Ria Formosa is an important transitional and coastal lagoon on the
   south coast of Portugal that provides valuable ecosystem services. The
   lagoon is a protected area under national and international conventions.
   There is a great potential for Blue Growth sectors, such as aquaculture
   and coastal tourism, but these rely on good water quality. European
   environmental legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive,
   requires member states, such as Portugal to implement management
   measures if a surface water body is not of good ecological status. This
   work addresses the effectiveness of management measures, such as
   wastewater treatment plant implementation and dredging, on the water
   quality of the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon system. This is an important
   social-ecological issue, since management measures can be very
   expensive. The ecological status of Ria Formosa was evaluated, according
   to the physico-chemical and biological quality elements of the Water
   Framework Directive. The main indicators were the physico-chemical
   quality elements of nutrient and oxygen condition, and the biological
   quality element chlorophyll a, as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass,
   under the Water Framework Directive. The data for these quality elements
   from the Ria Formosa were analyzed for consistency with the
   classification for the Water Framework Directive water bodies. The data
   after the implementation of management measures was compared with
   historical data to evaluate if these measures had been effective. The
   relation between nutrient pressures, meteorological and hydrological
   conditions was addressed, especially rainfall and runoff. Results showed
   a decrease in nutrient concentration after the management interventions,
   despite the increase of population and intensifying agriculture in the
   catchment. The Ecological Status is spatially variable with an overall
   moderate status, indicating the need for further management measures.
   There is a significant reduction in nutrient pressure on the lagoon
   during drought years. This indicates that climate change may alter the
   structure and function of the lagoon in the future.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Ecological processes are complex, often exhibiting non-linear,
   interactive, or hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, models
   identifying drivers of phenology are constrained by uncertainty
   regarding predictors, interactions across scales, and legacy impacts of
   prior climate conditions. Nonetheless, measuring and modeling ecosystem
   processes such as phenology remains critical for management of
   ecological systems and the social systems they support. We used random
   forest models to assess which combination of climate, location, edaphic,
   vegetation composition, and disturbance variables best predict several
   phenological responses in three dominant land cover types in the U.S.
   Northwestern Great Plains (NWP). We derived phenological measures from
   the 25-year series of AVHRR satellite data and characterized climatic
   predictors (i.e., multiple moisture and/or temperature based variables)
   over seasonal and annual timeframes within the current year and up to 4
   years prior. We found that antecedent conditions, from seasons to years
   before the current, were strongly associated with phenological measures,
   apparently mediating the responses of communities to current-year
   conditions. For example, at least one measure of antecedent-moisture
   availability {[}precipitation or vapor pressure deficit (VPD)] over
   multiple years was a key predictor of all productivity measures.
   Variables including longer-term lags or prior year sums, such as
   multi-year-cumulative moisture conditions of maximum VPD, were top
   predictors for start of season. Productivity measures were also
   associated with contextual variables such as soil characteristics and
   vegetation composition. Phenology is a key process that profoundly
   affects organism-environment relationships, spatio-temporal patterns in
   ecosystem structure and function, and other ecosystem dynamics.
   Phenology, however, is complex, and is mediated by lagged effects,
   interactions, and a diversity of potential drivers; nonetheless, the
   incorporation of antecedent conditions and contextual variables can
   improve models of phenology.},

Title = {Combining catastrophe technique and regression analysis to deduce
   leading landscape patterns for regional flood vulnerability: A case
   study of Nanjing, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Urbanization leads to changes in land use, and the expansion of
   impervious surfaces leads to an increase in flood vulnerability.
   Predicting and analyzing these landscape pattern changes are important
   in the early stages of urban planning. In practice, the threshold for
   obtaining comprehensive and detailed hydrological and meteorological
   data is high, which makes it difficult for landscape and urban planners
   to quickly evaluate urban floods. To compensate for these trends, we
   took Nanjing, China, as the study site and discussed the leading flood
   vulnerability landscape patterns based on quantitative assessments. We
   introduced catastrophe theory to integrate three indicators and seven
   subfactors for flood vulnerability assessment: exposure, including
   precipitation; sensitivity, including elevation, slope, soil and
   drainage density; and adaptability, including land use and forest
   coverage. Then, we calculated the landscape pattern metrics (shape
   index, fractal dimension index, related circumscribing circle,
   contiguity index and landscape division index) at the class level.
   Finally, we divided the city into four subregions, established
   regression models for the subregions and the whole city, and deduced the
   leading flood vulnerability landscape patterns in each region and the
   whole city. We found that the leading landscape patterns varied among
   different regions. According to the research results, the landscape
   pattern indexes identified in this paper can be interpreted intuitively,
   which can provide a reference for modifying the planning layout of
   regional green infrastructure, optimizing the vulnerability of urban
   floods, and providing a basis for further improving Nanjing urban
   planning and alleviating the urban flood vulnerability. The methods
   proposed herein also will benefit land use and green infrastructure
   management in other regions lacking meteorological and hydrological
   data.},

Title = {The paleo-ecological application of mollusks in the calculation of
   saltwater encroachment and resultant changes in depositional patterns
   driven by the Anthropocene Marine Transgression},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Numerous studies address changes in wetland deposition in response to
   saltwater encroachment driven by the accelerating rate of sea-level
   rise, by quantifying temporal changes recovered from a vertical sediment
   sequence. This is the first landscape scale study, based upon 10 core
   transects representing the heterogeneity of the Southeast Saline
   Everglades, Florida. By utilizing the known salinity preferences of
   molluscan assemblages, a Salinity Index was calculated for each core
   sequence and the recorded salinity changes identified and dated.
   Radiometric dating utilizing the Pb-210 method provides the rate of
   sediment accumulation and the date of changes identified in the core.
   The core transects provide the basis for calculation of the rate of
   saltwater encroachment by comparing the date of saltwater encroachment
   and the distance between two cores. Thereby, temporal and spatial
   changes in other sediment parameters in a landscape can also be
   quantified, such as organic carbon. This paleo-ecological approach to
   rapidly changing coastal conditions can be utilized to provide
   scientists and land managers with a record of the past, rate of changing
   conditions and provide the basis for predicting the future trajectory of
   their site. Application of this paleo-ecological approach documented
   increasing rates of saltwater encroachment associated with accelerating
   rate of sea-level rise: an average rate of 49.1 between 1895 and 1940,
   69.2 between 1940 and 1968, 73 between 1968 and 1995 and 131.1 m/yr
   between 1995 and 2015. Approximately 1.79 km of saltwater encroachment
   has occurred since 1995, with three partial reversals because of
   increased freshwater delivery. Associated with saltwater encroachment
   are changes in sediment organic carbon, decreasing area of marl
   production and increasing distribution of mangrove. Although the
   distance of saltwater encroachment is greater in Florida Bay, both
   changes in sediment organic carbon and mangrove distribution are much
   less than in Biscayne Bay coastal basins. This heterogeneity is likely
   the result of differences in tidal ingress efficiency. At the present
   rate of saltwater encroachment, the freshwater wetlands are predictably
   lost within a century.},

Title = {Identifying shared priorities for a bioregional approach to restoration
   in the Northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Natural resource management is often challenged with a mismatch between
   the scale of decision-making and the scale of the biological,
   ecological, and physical processes that control a system. Bioregional
   approaches to adaptive management have emerged as an approach to inform
   natural resource management at ecologically relevant scales and across
   multi-level governance structures. The implementation of adaptive
   management requires the determination of ecological and social
   priorities that can inform a desired system state across multiple
   governing bodies. We use the Northern Gulf of Mexico, United States, as
   a case study for a bioregional approach to adaptive management and
   illustrate a method for developing objectives and management priorities
   across programs and jurisdictions. Through this synthesis, using
   qualitative coding methods to develop a shared vocabulary across the
   diverse dataset, we identified commonalities and differences in
   ecological and human community priorities across the five states which
   line the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Using these shared priorities, we
   conceptualize a network of priority-focused objectives as a starting
   point for further stakeholder engagement and effectively monitoring and
   evaluating progress across boundaries. This approach serves as a
   framework for cross-program adaptive management by illustrating a
   desired system state that reflects the shared priorities among
   decision-making authorities in this region and offering individual
   programs or projects a method to articulate their contributions to the
   broader set of shared priorities Gulf-wide. This method can be used by
   restoration managers in any region of the world to align project
   objectives within cross-jurisdictional boundaries and illustrate the
   value of a bioregional approach to restoration.},

   male red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is a globally invasive
   species and has caused huge damage to aquaculture, biodiversity, and
   ecology worldwide. Antenna-expressed receptors are important for P.
   clarkii to detect chemosensory cues for mate attraction. In this study,
   we tested the behavior of male P. clarkii to the conditioned water from
   female P. clarkii during the mating and non-mating periods, and
   performed RNA sequencing to investigate the chemosensory-related genes
   of the antenna of male P. clarkii. The results of the behavioral assay
   have shown that for the female-conditioned water, male P. clarkii within
   the mating period can be significantly attracted, but not during the
   non-mating period. This suggested that the expressions of
   chemosensory-related genes in the antenna of male P. clarkii may change
   significantly with mating seasonal variation. Antenna transcriptomes
   found that a total of 59,218 unigenes with an average length of 1,056.41
   bp, and 4,889 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs), among which
   2,128 were upregulated, while 2,761 were downregulated were obtained. A
   total of 12 upregulated and nine downregulated DEGs were associated with
   chemical reception, including four ionotropic receptors (IRs) or
   ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), eight G-protein-coupled
   receptors (GPCRs), five transient receptor potential channels (TRP
   channels), one sodium-calcium exchanger, one isomerase, and two
   uncharacterized proteins (chemosensory proteins-like, CSPs). CSPs were
   preliminarily classified as pheromone receptors in the antenna of male
   P. clarkii. Furthermore, the calcium transduction-related pathways may
   play an important role in the sex pheromone reception of the male P.
   clarkii's antenna. The results of quantitative real-time reverse
   transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the trends of expression of
   eight selected unigenes were consistent with RNA-Seq results. Our
   results provide more comprehensive data for chemical communication
   mechanisms after P. clarkii enter the mating period and eventually would
   develop better control strategies in further.},

Title = {The effects of hydrological connectivity blocking on Suaeda salsa
   development in the Yellow River Delta, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Blocking of hydrological connectivity could greatly impact the sediment
   deposition process and change water and salinity conditions, which in
   turn affect plant germination, growth, and development in delta
   wetlands. A 2-year experiment, which included the effects of soil
   burial, water, and salinity on germination, growth, and production, was
   conducted to examine the function of hydrological connectivity blocking
   on the development of Suaeda salsa, a halophyte species. The results
   demonstrated that soil burial, water, and salinity all had significant
   effects on seed germination, plant growth, and production (p < 0.05).
   Seed germination decreased as soil buried depth increased (< 4 cm), and
   seeds did not germinate successfully when the buried depth was > 4 cm.
   Seed germination was the highest at 0 cm burial. However, moderate
   burial was beneficial for seedling emergence; therefore, the survival
   rate was the lowest when seeds were distributed at the surface (0 cm).
   Water and salinity both significantly affected the germination, growth,
   and productivity of S. salsa. Moderate salinity (10-20 g/kg) and
   fluctuating water (0-10 cm water depth) were suitable for seed
   germination and plant growth. Low salinity (< 10 g/kg), High salinity
   (>20 g/kg), drought, and high water levels (long-term flooding with
   water depth > 10 cm) were not conducive to the growth of S. salsa, and
   biomass and seed yield were also reduced. As a halophyte, salinity that
   is too low or too high is unsuitable for S. salsa population. Water and
   salinity also significantly affected S. salsa population (p < 0.05). In
   particular, water can offset the hazards of high salt concentrations.
   Blocking of hydrological connectivity can influence seed germination,
   yield, and vitality. In this case, S. salsa may have died out from the
   coastal wetland due to the lack of hydrological connectivity
   restoration.},

Abstract = {The Sanjiang Plain includes the largest freshwater marsh in China,
   playing an important role in regional carbon cycle. As an important
   indicator of carbon cycle, the net primary productivity (NPP) is a
   crucial index for estimating the carbon storage of marshy wetlands.
   Investigating the association between climate factors and NPP variation
   quantitatively is of great significance for estimating carbon
   sequestration of marsh. Based on NPP data and climatic data from 1954 to
   2014, the spatiotemporal change of NPP in marsh area was analyzed and
   its association with climate factors was investigated in the Sanjiang
   Plain in this study. The results indicated that the NPP showed an
   increase trend in the marsh area of the Sanjiang Plain in the past six
   decades. Temperate growth made the largest contribution to the NPP
   increase among the main climate factors in the last six decades,
   followed by CO2 concentration. Solar Radiation had the largest
   explanatory power on the spatial distribution of NPP among three climate
   factors before 1985. After 1985, temperature played an important role in
   leading the NPP distribution. Results also showed that the explanatory
   power of interactions between climate factors was stronger than that of
   single factor. Our results highlight the asymmetric effects of
   interactions between climate factors on marsh vegetation, which should
   be adequately considered in estimating carbon sequestration in marsh
   area in the Sanjiang Plain.},

Title = {Climate and vegetation and their impact on stable C and N isotope ratios
   in bat guano},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Cave guano deposits represent a relatively untapped paleoecological
   archive that can provide information about past vegetation, climate, and
   bat diet over several millennia. Recent research suggests that carbon
   isotope values (delta C-13) measured in guano accumulations from
   insectivorous bats reflect the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants
   on the landscape while nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) may reflect
   precipitation amount. Together, these proxies can provide useful
   information for restoration practitioners seeking to understand how
   plant species composition has changed over time in relation to climate
   and land use. To better calibrate these proxies for use in restoration,
   we compared instrumental records of precipitation and satellite imagery
   of vegetation with isotope values measured in modern bat guano from Mary
   Lawson Cave, a large limestone cavern located in central Missouri. Mary
   Lawson Cave hosts a maternity colony of insectivorous gray bats (Myotis
   grisescens), and as such, contains significant guano accumulations. In
   the fall of 2018, we collected a 60 cm long guano core that dates to
   1999 cal AD at its base. Guano core delta C-13 values decrease from the
   base toward the surface (from similar to-26 to -27 parts per thousand)
   whereas delta N-15 values increase toward the surface even after
   accounting for ammonia volatilization (from similar to 3 to 5 parts per
   thousand). Presently, the landscape around Mary Lawson Cave is dominated
   by a deciduous forest and pasture. Given that the land cover has changed
   very little over this period, the decline in delta C-13 values toward
   the present likely reflects a shift in land management on farms and/or
   increases in invasive C-3 species. Rainfall amounts from nearby Lebanon,
   Missouri, are significantly positively correlated with guano delta N-15
   values, a relationship that is notably opposite that observed previously
   in soil and plants. We argue that heavy fertilizer application and
   significant grazing intensity could lead to the accumulation of large
   pools of excess labile nitrogen which would be vulnerable to leaching
   during precipitation events. The relationship between guano delta N-15
   values and precipitation may differ for materials from less
   agriculturally impacted locations or periods and should be extended into
   the past with caution.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Bacteria, fungi, and nematodes are major components of soil ecosystems,
   playing pivotal roles in belowground material cycles and biological
   community processes. A number of studies have recently uncovered the
   diversity and community structure of those organisms in various types of
   soil ecosystems based on DNA metabarcoding (amplicon sequencing).
   However, because most previous studies examined only one or two of the
   three organismal groups, it remains an important challenge to reveal the
   entire picture of soil community structure. We examined how we could
   standardize DNA extraction protocols for simultaneous DNA metabarcoding
   of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Specifically, in an Illumina
   sequencing analysis of forest and farmland soil samples, we performed
   DNA extraction at five levels of soil-amount (0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 g).
   We then found that DNA extraction with the 0.5 g soil setting, which had
   been applied as default in many commercial DNA extraction kits, could
   lead to underestimation of alpha-diversity in nematode community. We
   also found that dissimilarity (beta-diversity) estimates of community
   structure among replicate samples could be affected by soil sample
   amount. Based on the assays, we conclude that DNA extraction from at
   least 20 g of soil is a standard for comparing biodiversity patterns
   among bacteria, fungi and nematodes.},

Title = {Human impacts on the world's raptors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Raptors are emblematic of the global biodiversity crisis because one out
   of five species are threatened with extinction and over half have
   declining populations due to human threats. Yet our understanding of
   where these ``threats{''} impact raptor species is limited across
   terrestrial Earth. This is concerning because raptors, as apex
   predators, are critically positioned in ecological food webs, and their
   declining populations can undermine important ecosystem services ranging
   from pest control to disease regulation. Here, we map the distribution
   of 15 threats within the known ranges of 172 threatened and near
   threatened raptor species globally as declared by the International
   Union for the Conservation of Nature. We analyze the proportion of each
   raptor range that is exposed to threats, identify global hotspots of
   impacted raptor richness, and investigate how human impacts on raptors
   vary based on several intrinsic (species traits) and extrinsic factors.
   We find that humans are potentially negatively affecting at least one
   threatened raptor species across three quarters of Earth's terrestrial
   area (78\%; 113 million km(2)). Our results also show that raptors have
   66\% of their range potentially impacted by threats on average (range
   2.7-100\%). Alarmingly, critically endangered species have 90\% of their
   range impacted by threats on average. We also highlight 57 species
   (33\%) of particular concern that have > 90\% of their ranges
   potentially impacted. Without immediate conservation intervention, these
   57 species, including the most heavily impacted Forest Owlet (Athene
   blewitti), the Madagascar Serpent-eagle (Eutriorchis astur), and the
   Rufous Fishing-owl (Scotopelia ussheri), will likely face extinction in
   the near future. Global ``hotspots{''} of impacted raptor richness are
   ubiquitous, with core areas of threat in parts of the Sahel and East
   Africa where 92\% of the assessed raptors are potentially impacted per
   grid cell (10 species on average), and in Northern India where nearly
   100\% of raptors are potentially impacted per grid cell (11 species).
   Additionally, ``coolspots{''} of unimpacted richness that represent
   refuges from threats occur in Greenland and Canada, where 98 and 58\% of
   raptors are potentially unimpacted per grid cell, respectively (nearly
   one species on average), Saharan Africa, where 21\% of raptors are
   potentially unimpacted per grid cell (one species on average), and parts
   of the Amazon, where 12\% of raptors are potentially unimpacted per grid
   cell (0.6 species on average). The results provide essential information
   to guide conservation planning and action for the world's imperiled
   raptors.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Understanding how ecological interactions affect vector-borne disease
   dynamics is crucial in the context of rapid biodiversity loss and
   increased emerging vector-borne diseases. Although there have been many
   studies on the impact of interspecific competition and host competence
   on disease dynamics, few of them have addressed the case of a
   vector-borne disease. Using a simple compartment model with two
   competing host species and one vector, we investigated the combined
   effects of vector preference, host competence, and interspecific
   competition on disease risk in a vector-borne system. Our research
   demonstrated that disease transmission dynamics in multi-host
   communities are more complex than anticipated. Vector preference and
   differences in host competence shifted the direction of the effect of
   competition on community disease risk, yet interspecific competition
   quantitatively but not qualitatively changed the effect of vector
   preference on disease risk. Our work also identified the conditions of
   the dilution effect and amplification effect in frequency-dependent
   transmission mode, and we discovered that adding vector preference and
   interspecific competition into a simple two-host-one-vector model
   altered the outcomes of how increasing species richness affects disease
   risk. Our work explains some of the variation in outcomes in previous
   empirical and theoretical studies on the dilution effect.},

Title = {Hatching Failure in Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) Is Linked to
   Maternal Identity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) have been suffering range-wide
   population declines since the 1900s. Most monitoring efforts of these
   turtles involve population surveys to assess population size and
   viability but relatively few investigate rates of reproductive success.
   We collected four consecutive years (2013-2016) of wood turtle nesting
   data at a nesting site in northwestern New Jersey; population-level
   hatching success was unusually low. Furthermore, annual,
   intra-individual hatch rates and comparisons between natural and
   artificial incubation revealed that approximately half of all females
   usually produced clutches with low (<50\%) hatch rates, regardless of
   incubation conditions. In contrast, the annual hatch rates of other
   females were either consistently high (>50\%) or highly variable,
   ranging from 0 to 100\%. Thus, some adult females are potentially making
   much larger contributions to the next generation than others. A
   repeatability analysis suggested that approximately 60\% of the hatch
   rate variability observed in this population can be attributed to
   maternal identity. The remaining 40\% may be attributed to the random
   environmental factors that are often theorized to be potential reasons
   for reduced hatch rates in turtle populations (e.g., unsuitable
   incubation conditions, flooding, desiccation, egg infertility, egg
   damage due to improper handling by researchers, root and insect
   predation, and microbial infection). The ultimate causes of this
   population's hatching success variability are uncertain, but
   maternally-linked hatching failure in turtle populations could be
   associated with inbreeding, infertility, senescence, inadequate maternal
   diets, or environmental contamination. This study indicates that
   commonly suggested hypotheses for hatching failure, such as unsuitable
   incubation conditions or infertility, are unlikely to explain all of the
   hatch rate variability in some turtle populations. This study also
   reveals a cryptic conservation implication for vulnerable turtle
   populations: that the presence of many nesting females and nests does
   not necessarily assure high or even sustainable reproductive rates. When
   coupled with the high rates of nest predation and low juvenile survival
   rates that are common in most turtle populations, the exceedingly low
   hatch rates observed in this population suggest that recruitment in some
   turtle populations could be severely hindered even when nests are
   protected in the field or incubated in laboratory settings.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The Amazon comprises many of the largest rivers in the planet and also
   houses some of the richest bat communities in the world. Rivers are
   important geographic barriers for the dispersal and distribution of
   different taxa worldwide and, particularly in the Amazon region, they
   form the conceptual and empirical bases for the recognition of the
   so-called Areas of Endemism of terrestrial vertebrates. Despite the vast
   literature on the role of rivers on vertebrate community structure in
   the Amazon Forest, this process has never been investigated using a
   comprehensive dataset of Neotropical bat communities in the region. In
   this study, we aimed at: (1) evaluating the patterns of bat endemism
   across the Amazon Forest; (2) testing for the relationship between the
   distribution of bat species in the Amazon and the interfluve Areas of
   Endemism as currently recognized, and; (3) analyzing the importance of
   major Amazonian rivers in bat beta-diversity (turnover and nestedness)
   in the Amazon. Our results indicate that rivers are not major barriers
   for the current distribution of most bat species, and bat community
   composition breaks were divided into two clusters separating the east
   and west regions, and a third cluster in northern Amazon. In addition,
   there was no significant overlap among species distribution limits and
   the interfluve Areas of Endemism. Interestingly, the geographic patterns
   that we found for bat communities composition breaks highly resembles
   the one recovered using bird communities, suggesting that similar
   ecological and historical drivers might be acting to determine the
   distribution of flying vertebrates in the Amazon. Moreover, Amazonian
   bat distribution and endemism patterns were likely shaped by factors
   other than rivers, such as species interactions and the current
   environmental conditions. In conclusion, our results highlight the
   importance of modern analytical approaches to investigate large scale
   ecological patterns in the Neotropical region, and also challenge the
   widely recognized role of rivers on the determination of community
   structure and endemism patterns in the Amazon Forest, at least for bats.},

Title = {The primate workplace: Cooperative decision-making in human and
   non-human primates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {The success of group foraging in primates is not only determined by
   ecological and social factors. It is also influenced by cognition. Group
   foraging success is constrained, for instance, by the challenges of
   coordination, synchrony and decision-making, and it is enhanced by the
   ability to share, learn from others and coordinate actions. However,
   what we currently know about the cognition of individuals in groups
   comes primarily from experiments on dyads, and what we know of the
   effect of ecological factors on group dynamics comes from larger wild
   groups. Our current knowledge of primate group behaviour is thus
   incomplete. In this review, we identify a gap in our knowledge of
   primate group dynamics between the dyadic studies on primate cooperation
   and the large group observational studies of behavioural ecology. We
   highlight the potential for controlled experimental studies on
   coordination and cooperation in primate groups. Currently, these exist
   primarily as studies of dyads, and these do not go far enough in testing
   limits of group-level behaviours. Controlled studies on primate groups
   beyond the dyad would be highly informative regarding the bounds of
   non-human primate collaboration. We look to the literature on how humans
   behave in groups, specifically from organisational psychology, draw
   parallels between human and non-human group dynamics and highlight
   approaches that could be applied across disciplines. Organisational
   psychology is explicitly concerned with the interactions between
   individuals in a group and the emergent properties at the group-level of
   these decisions. We propose that some of the major shortfalls in our
   understanding of primate social cognition and group dynamics can be
   filled by using approaches developed by organisational psychologists,
   particularly regarding the effects of group size and composition on
   group-level cooperation. To illustrate the potential applications, we
   provide a list of research questions drawn from organisational
   psychology that could be applied to non-human primates.},

Title = {Dominant Dendrobium officinale mycorrhizal partners vary among habitats
   and strongly induce seed germination in vitro},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Dendrobium officinale (Orchidaceae) is an endangered epiphytic orchid
   that has been well studied as a medicinal plant. Although previous
   studies have shown that various fungal isolates promote D. officinale
   seed germination and seedling development in vitro, mycorrhizal
   associations among its wild populations remain poorly understood. In
   this study, we identified mycorrhizal fungi associated with D.
   officinale (36 individuals from six sites) using Sanger sequencing and
   compared fungal communities among sites and habitats (lithophytic vs.
   epiphytic individuals). Among the obtained sequences, 76 belonged to
   orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF), among which Tulasnellaceae accounted for
   45.8\% and Serendipitaceae for 28.1\%. The Serendipitaceae operational
   taxonomic unit (OTU) SE1 was the most dominant partner, accounting for
   27.1\% of all detected fungal sequences, followed by a Tulasnellaceae
   OTU, TU27, which accounted for 15.6\%. The relative frequencies of
   Serendipitaceae and Tulasnellaceae differed greatly between lithophytic
   and epiphytic individuals. Serendipitaceae accounted for 47.3\% of the
   OMF sequences among lithophytes, and Tulasnellaceae for 95.2\% among
   epiphytes. Mycorrhizal community composition also varied among sites. We
   further conducted in vitro symbiotic culture from seeds with six fungal
   isolates. Two Serendipitaceae and two Tulasnellaceae isolates, including
   SE1 and TU27, significantly promoted seed germination and seedling
   development. These results indicate that D. officinale is mainly
   associated with Tulasnellaceae and Serendipitaceae as its main fungal
   partners, which strongly induced seed germination and seedling
   development in vitro, suggesting their association with D. officinale
   through its life cycle.},

Title = {Historical and current distribution and movement patterns of large
   herbivores in the Limpopo National Park, Mozambique},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {This study provides a first attempt to describe the historical
   distribution and movement patterns of selected large herbivore (LH)
   species in Limpopo National Park (LNP), an area in Mozambique today
   connected to a network of transboundary conservation areas. Between 1976
   and the early 2000s, most LH species were absent in this area following
   the civil war in Mozambique followed by intense poaching due to weak law
   enforcement capacity. Through the reconstruction of the historical and
   current distribution and movement patterns of seven LH species in five
   periods, we investigate possible changes in distribution and movement
   patterns over time. Data collection is based on a systematic literature
   search, censuses reports, online databases, dung count transects, and
   camera trap surveys. We mapped all LH observations and movements using
   ArcGIS 10.1. Our results reveal a dramatic collapse of LH populations
   between the peak of the colonial period and the post-colonial/civil war
   period (1800-2001), followed by a slight recovery from the
   post-proclamation of Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park to the current
   period (2002-2021). While LH population decline applied to all seven
   species, there are species-specific differences in the process of
   restoration: African elephant (Loxodonta africana), African buffalo
   (Syncerus caffer), and plains zebra (Equus quagga) appear to recover to
   a greater extent than giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), eland
   (Tragelaphus oryx), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and white
   rhino (Ceratotherium simum). We found evidence of the functioning of
   proposed wildlife corridors in the LNP. The results give reason to
   assume that restoration of populations of LH is still in a very early
   and vulnerable state and that further efforts are necessary to
   strengthen the slowly increasing populations of LH. Our results
   highlight the importance of combining past and current data as a guide
   for the restoration of threatened species in African savannas impacted
   by human activities.},

Title = {No functional contribution of the gustatory receptor, Gr64b,
   co-expressed in olfactory sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Chemosensation is essential for the survival of insects. Activities like
   searching for food, mating, and oviposition in the fruit fly, Drosophila
   melanogaster are to a great extent governed by chemical cues detected
   via olfaction and gustation. This chemical information is conveyed to
   higher brain centers via populations of diverse olfactory sensory
   neurons (OSNs) and gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs) expressing olfactory
   receptors (ORs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), respectively. ORs are
   exclusively expressed in the antenna and in the maxillary palps, while
   GRs are widely expressed in the labellum, tarsi, genitalia etc.
   Interestingly, 14 GRs were previously reported to be expressed in the
   antenna of D. melanogaster. However, the spatial expression pattern for
   all GRs and their functional role are still unclear. Recent data
   challenge the dogma that single OSNs express a single OR. In the present
   study, we studied the expression of 12 previously reported GRs among
   sensory structures on the fly antenna using the Gal4-UAS binary
   expression system. We observed antennal expression of nine out of the 12
   reported. Out of these nine, consistent expression was only apparent for
   Gr64b, and we reconfirmed its presence in OSNs innervating three
   glomeruli in the antennal lobe. These glomeruli are known to be
   innervated by ab5A, ab5B and ab8A OSNs, respectively. Next, we generated
   double labeling crosses with Gr64b and observed co-expression of Gr64b
   with Or47a, which is expressed in the ab5B neuron. To elucidate the
   functional role of Gr64b co-expressed with Or47a, we challenged
   Or47a-expressing OSNs in wild type and Gr64b(-/-) mutant flies with odor
   stimulation using the single sensillum recording technique in two
   satiation states (fed and starved). Notably, we did not observe any
   significant odor sensitivity or specificity changes in Gr64b mutants as
   compared to wild type flies. Taken together, our results reveal
   co-expression of GRs with ORs in olfactory sensory neurons, while the
   functional contribution of the GR in this context remains obscure.},

Title = {Role of socioeconomy and land management in the evolution of
   agrosilvopastoral landscapes in Northern Spain: The case study of Redes
   Biosphere Reserve},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Agrosilvopastoral systems are multifunctional, complex, and
   knowledge-intensive systems with the potential to deliver multiple
   ecosystem services. However, their future is hindered by
   socio-ecological factors which influence the dynamics of the associated
   landscapes by modifying how the natural resources are used over time and
   across the territory. An integrated analysis of the most influential
   factors and the associated dynamics urges due to the strategic potential
   of these systems to provide locally adapted ecosystem services to face
   both local and global challenges. We investigated the changes in the
   demography, productive activities and the strategies of land use, and
   how they influenced the landscape dynamics, in the Redes Biosphere
   Reserve. Datasets with demographic, socioeconomic, and landscape
   parameters from 1956, 1985, and 2016 were created. Landscape metrics
   were calculated for the whole Reserve and for six areas covering the
   bioclimatic variability. Historical data, interviews with the local
   population, and repeated images were used to reconstruct the land uses
   and the landscape maps in each period. The number of inhabitants
   declined 60\% from 1956 to 2016, and only 4.7\% are less than 15 years
   old nowadays. The human group's capacity to maintain sustainable and
   productive activities is highly questionable. During the same period,
   the number of farms decreased by 80\% and the herds evolved from
   multispecific (63\% cattle and 37\% small ruminants) to monospecific
   ones (around 88\% cattle). The complex land management strategies
   simplified: subsistence agriculture almost disappeared and the diversity
   of livestock and agroforestry strategies also decreased. The landscape
   metrics revealed the most drastic changes in the lowlands associated
   with the construction of two water reservoirs and the disappearance of
   croplands and open chestnut forests. At middle altitudes, around 43\% of
   the hay meadows disappeared and the remaining grasslands are only
   grazed, whereas grazed grasslands declined by 77\% at the highest
   altitudes. Two drivers repeated across the three bioclimatic scenarios:
   expansion of dense woodlands (average 220\%) and shrublands (295\%). All
   these changes led to the reduction of the landscape diversity and the
   simplification of the mosaic, with possible environmental implications.
   Integrated approaches including environmental and socioeconomic measures
   are needed to preserve the landscapes and associated services.},

Title = {Individual Identification of Large Felids in Field Studies: Common
   Methods, Challenges, and Implications for Conservation Science},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Large felids represent some of the most threatened large mammals on
   Earth, critical for both tourism economies and ecosystem function. Most
   populations are in a state of decline, and their monitoring and
   enumeration is therefore critical for conservation. This typically rests
   on the accurate identification of individuals within their populations.
   We review the most common and current survey methods used in individual
   identification studies of large felid ecology (body mass > 25 kg).
   Remote camera trap photography is the most extensively used method to
   identify leopards, snow leopards, jaguars, tigers, and cheetahs which
   feature conspicuous and easily identifiable coat patterning. Direct
   photographic surveys and genetic sampling are commonly used for species
   that do not feature easily identifiable coat patterning such as lions.
   We also discuss the accompanying challenges encountered in several field
   studies, best practices that can help increase the precision and
   accuracy of identification and provide generalised ratings for the
   common survey methods used for individual identification.},

Title = {Cattle Grazing Effects on Vegetation and Wild Ungulates in the Forest
   Ecosystem of a National Park in Northeastern China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {There is evidence that cattle grazing in forests limits big cat
   abundance. There is concern, too, about competition with wild ungulate
   prey through bottom-up effects on vegetation. Hence, there have been
   calls to remove or control forest livestock grazing in aid of restoring
   endangered large carnivores and their prey. To help inform scientific
   debate and decision making, we explored cattle-vegetation-prey dynamics
   in Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, northeast China and
   present a reappraisal of livestock grazing in the context of coexistence
   and an integrated approach to land use in China. Inside long-term forest
   grazing enclosures, wild boar (Sus scrofa) density increased with cattle
   density. Roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) density and occurrence
   probability of wild boar and roe deer were not influenced by cattle
   density. Wild ungulate densities were not related with the number of
   annual shoots, i.e., forage plant abundance. The presence/absence and
   abundance of annual shoots was not related with cattle density. Wild
   ungulate density had mixed associations with vegetation structure; arbor
   tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and habitat ``openness{''}
   increased with cattle density. Finally, inside and outside enclosures
   had different vegetation characteristics and wild boar densities, while
   roe deer densities were equal. We conclude that cattle density and
   associated changes to vegetation have positive, negative, and neutral
   effects on two wild ungulate prey species. Each of these factors warrant
   consideration in evidencebased management decisions in regard to
   regulating ungulate community composition to support different large
   predators as preferred prey in core areas and corridors of habitats.},

Abstract = {Diplodiscus japonicus and Diplodiscus mehari (Trematoda: Diplodiscidae)
   are two important parasites in wood frogs, which have large infection
   rates and essential importance of ecology, economy and society. In this
   study, the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of D. japonicus and D.
   mehari were sequenced, then compared with other related trematodes in
   the superfamily Paramphistomoidea. The complete circular mt sequence of
   D. japonicus and D. mehari were 14,210 bp and 14,179 bp in length,
   respectively. Both mt genomes comprised 36 functional subunits,
   consisting of 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
   genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and one non-coding region. The mt
   genes of D. japonicus and D. mehari were transcribed in the same
   direction, and the gene arrangements were identical to those of
   Paramphistomoidea trematodes. In the 12 PCGs, GTG was the most common
   initiation codon, whereas TAG was the most common termination codon. All
   tRNAs had a typical cloverleaf structure except tRNA Ser1. A comparison
   with related Paramphistomoidea trematode mt genomes suggested that the
   cox1 gene of D. mehari was the longest in these trematodes. Phylogenetic
   analyses revealed that Paramphistomoidea trematodes formed a
   monophyletic branch, Paramphistomidae and Gastrothylacidae were more
   closely related than Diplodiscidae. And the further analysis with
   Pronocephalata branch found that the flukes parasitic in amphibians
   (frogs) formed one group, and the flukes from ruminants (cattle, sheep,
   ect) formed another group. Our study demonstrated the importance of
   sequencing mt genomes of D. japonicus and D. mehari, which will provide
   significant molecular resources for further studies of Paramphistomoidea
   taxonomy, population genetics and systematics.},

Title = {Temporal stability of spatial cytotype structure in mixed-ploidy
   populations of Centaurea stoebe},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Spatial segregation of cytotypes reduces the negative effect of
   frequency-dependent mating on the fitness of minority cytotype(s) and
   thus allows its establishment and coexistence with the majority cytotype
   in mixed-ploidy populations. Despite its evolutionary importance, the
   stability of spatial segregation is largely unknown. Furthermore,
   closely related sympatric cytotypes that differ in their life histories
   might exhibit contrasting spatial dynamics over time. We studied the
   temporal stability of spatial structure at a secondary contact zone of
   co-occurring monocarpic diploids and polycarpic tetraploids of Centaurea
   stoebe, whose tetraploid cytotype has undergone a rapid range expansion
   in Europe and became invasive in North America. Eleven years after the
   initial screening, we re-assessed the microspatial distribution of
   diploids and tetraploids and their affinities to varying
   vegetation-cover density in three mixed-ploidy populations in Central
   Europe. We found that overall, spatial patterns and frequencies of both
   cytotypes in all sites were very similar over time, with one exception.
   At one site, in one previously purely 2x patch, diploids completely
   disappeared due to intensive succession by shrubby vegetation. The
   remaining spatial patterns, however, showed the same cytotype clumping
   and higher frequency of 2x despite subtle changes in vegetation-cover
   densities. In contrast to the expected expansion of polycarpic
   tetraploids having higher colonization ability when compared to
   diploids, the tetraploids remained confined to their former microsites
   and showed no spatial expansion. Spatial patterns of coexisting diploids
   and tetraploids, which exhibit contrasting life histories, did not
   change over more than a decade. Such temporal stability is likely caused
   by relatively stable habitat conditions and very limited seed dispersal.
   Our results thus imply that in the absence of a disturbance regime
   connected with frequent human- or animal-mediated seed dispersal,
   spatial patterns may be very stable over time, thus contributing to the
   long-term coexistence of cytotypes.},

Title = {Stable isotopes elucidate body-size and seasonal fluctuations in the
   feeding strategies of planktivorous fishes across a semi-enclosed
   tropical embayment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Reef fish may switch feeding strategies due to fluctuations in resource
   availability or through ontogeny. A number of studies have explored
   these trophodynamics using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15)
   stable isotopes, but additional tracers such as sulfur isotopes (delta
   S-34) show strong potential in systems, where delta C-13 and delta N-15
   results are ambiguous. We tested the utility of adding delta S-34 to
   conventional delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis to detect seasonal and
   body size changes in resource use of two planktivorous damselfish,
   Dascyllus reticulatus and Dascyllus trimaculatus across the Puerto
   Galera embayment in the Philippines. We analyzed stable isotope ratios
   (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34) in multiple fish tissues
   (liver, eye, and muscle) to represent different dietary time frames. We
   then compared fish tissue isotopes against particulate organic matter
   (POM) (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and POM suspension feeder (the
   tunicate Polycarpa aurata: delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34)
   across the same sites. There were size-based and seasonal differences in
   damselfish resource use, the latter of which was most pronounced in the
   fast-turnover liver. Small fish (<70 mm) demonstrated significant
   seasonality, appearing to switch their resource use between the rainy
   season and the dry season, while there was no seasonal variation in
   larger fish (>70 mm). This suggests that smaller fish across the
   embayment employ an opportunistic feeding strategy to take advantage of
   fluctuating resource availability, while larger fish exhibits more
   consistent resource use. Isotope ratios of tunicates and POM further
   confirmed strong seasonality in this system and a lack of a spatial
   isotopic gradient. delta N-15 did not seem to contribute to consumer
   resource use patterns, while by contrast, delta S-34 fluctuated
   significantly between sampling periods and was crucial for demonstrating
   seasonality in resource use. We recommend including delta S-34 when
   attempting to disentangle seasonal differences in resource use in
   aquatic food webs using stable isotopes.},

Title = {Root system-rhizosphere soil-bulk soil interactions in different Chinese
   fir clones based on fungi community diversity change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {The diversity of the rhizosphere arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   community is a crucial factor affecting root-soil interaction. They can
   absorb carbohydrates from the host body and return the nutrient elements
   from the soil to the host. Using 15 Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata
   Lamb. Hook.) clones, the AMF richness, abundance and community structure
   in ``Root system-Rhizosphere soil-Bulk soil{''} were obtained by
   Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina Miseq sequencing
   techniques. The results showed that under the same Chinese fir clone,
   the total amount of AMF was in the order of rhizosphere soil > root
   system > bulk soil. The species diversity and uniqueness of AMF were in
   the order of root system > rhizosphere soil > bulk soil. There was a
   significant correlation between soil-available phosphorus and AMF
   diversity and its dominant genera and species. Regarding AMF abundance,
   Chinese fir clone S18 is the highest, followed by clones Y061 and P17.
   There was a significant difference in AMF richness among different
   clones, and Glomus was the dominant genus of AMF. The AMF species
   diversity of P17 and S2 in roots and rhizosphere soil was high,
   indicating a good symbiosis between roots and the AMF community.
   However, the AMF diversity of clones P11 and P41 was low, and the
   variation of AMF community composition in the group was small. The
   root-soil interaction caused the AMF community to gather in the
   rhizosphere but had less symbiosis present with roots. Still, the AMF
   diversity of the rhizosphere soil of both clones was high. There was a
   significant correlation between the soil-available phosphorus content
   and the species diversity of AMF and its dominant genera and species. In
   conclusion, Clone P17 has high AMF richness and abundance and forms a
   good symbiosis with AMF, which could be a nutrient-efficient clone of
   Chinese fir.},

Title = {Male intrasexual aggression and partial dominance of females over males
   in vervet monkeys},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Females dominate a subset of the males in a minority of mammalian
   species despite male-biased sexual dimorphism. How this may arise is
   suggested by a computational model, DomWorld. The model represents
   male-biased sexual dimorphism through the males' greater initial
   dominance and higher intensity of aggression, meaning that fights
   initiated by males have a greater impact than those by females. The
   model shows that female dominance over males increases with a greater
   proportion of males in the group. This happens because when males are
   involved in a larger fraction of fights this results in greater
   hierarchical differentiation (i.e., steepness). This causes rank overlap
   between the sexes (i.e., partial female dominance). We test the validity
   of these processes in vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus pygerythrus), a
   primate species with partial female dominance. We confirm that the
   proportion of males in the group is significantly positively correlated
   with the degree of dominance by females over males and with the
   steepness of the hierarchy among males exclusively, but not with the
   steepness of the hierarchy among all adults of the group. The steepness
   in male hierarchies correlated positively with female dominance over
   males in these groups. We show that steeper hierarchies among vervet
   males resulted from male-to-male fights being a larger proportion of the
   fights among all adults of the group. We conclude that the higher
   frequency of male intrasexual aggression favors female dominance in
   vervet monkeys. We also show that females received coalitionary support
   when they were in conflict with a male, mainly from other females, and
   that this favors female dominance in this species, but this does not
   explain why partial female dominance increased with the proportion of
   males in the group. We advocate further investigation of the influence
   of male intrasexual aggression on the degree of female dominance over
   males in other species with partial female dominance.},

Title = {Arbovirus infection in Aedes aegypti from different departments of
   Colombia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {The lack of precise and timely knowledge about the molecular
   epidemiology of arboviruses of public health importance, particularly in
   the vector, has limited the comprehensive control of arboviruses. In
   Colombia and the Americas, entomovirological studies are scarce.
   Therefore, this study aimed to describe the frequency of natural
   infection and/or co-infection by Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and
   Chikungunya (CHIKV) in Aedes spp. circulating in different departments
   of Colombia (Amazonas, Boyaca, Magdalena, and Vichada) and identifying
   vector species by barcoding. Aedes mosquitoes were collected in
   departments with reported prevalence or incidence of arbovirus cases
   during 2020-2021, located in different biogeographic zones of the
   country: Amazonas, Boyaca, Magdalena, and Vichada. The insects were
   processed individually for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and
   subsequent detection of DENV (serotypes DENV1-4 by multiplex PCR),
   CHIKV, and ZIKV (qRT-PCR). The positive mosquitoes for arboviruses were
   sequenced (Sanger method) using the subunit I of the cytochrome oxidase
   (COI) gene for species-level identification. In total, 558 Aedes
   mosquitoes were captured, 28.1\% (n = 157) predominantly infected by
   DENV in all departments. The serotypes with the highest frequency of
   infection were DENV-1 and DENV-2 with 10.7\% (n = 58) and 14.5\% (n =
   81), respectively. Coinfections between serotypes represented 3.9\% (n =
   22). CHIKV infection was detected in one individual (0.2\%), and ZIKV
   infections were not detected. All infected samples were identified as A.
   aegypti (100\%). From the COI dataset (593 bp), high levels of haplotype
   diversity (H = 0.948 +/- 0.012) and moderate nucleotide diversity (pi =
   0.0225 +/- 0.003) were identified, suggesting recent population
   expansions. Constructed phylogenetic analyses showed our COI sequences'
   association with lineage I, which was reported widespread and related to
   a West African conspecific. We conclude that natural infection in A.
   aegypti by arbovirus might reflect the country's epidemiological
   behavior, with a higher incidence of serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-2, which
   may be associated with high seroprevalence and asymptomatic infections
   in humans. This study demonstrates the high susceptibility of this
   species to arbovirus infection and confirms that A. aegypti is the main
   vector in Colombia. The importance of including entomovirological
   surveillance strategy within public health systems to understand
   transmission dynamics and the potential risk to the population is
   highlighted herein.},

Title = {Quantifying population and clone-specific non-linear reaction norms to
   food gradients in Daphnia magna},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is normally quantified as a reaction norm which
   details how trait expression changes across an environmental gradient.
   Sometime reaction norms are linear, but often reaction norms are assumed
   to be linear because plasticity is typically quantified as the
   difference in trait expression measured in two environments. This
   simplification limits how plastic responses vary between genotypes and
   may also bias the predictions of models investigating how plasticity
   influences a population's ability to adapt to a changing environment.
   Consequently, there is a pressing need to characterize the real shape of
   reaction norms and their genetic variability across ecologically
   relevant environmental gradients. To address this knowledge gap we
   measured the multi-trait plastic response of 7 Daphnia magna clones from
   the same population across a broad resource gradient. We used a Random
   Regression Mixed Model approach to characterize and quantify average and
   clone-specific responses to resource variation. Our results demonstrate
   that non-linear models outperformed a linear model for all 4 of the
   life-history traits we measured. The plastic reaction norms of all 4
   traits were similar in shape and were often best described by a
   non-linear asymptotic model. Clonal variation in non-linear plastic
   responses was detectable for 3 out of the 4 traits that we measured
   although the nature and magnitude of variation across the resource
   gradient was trait-specific. We interpret our findings with respect to
   the impact that plasticity has on the evolutionary potential of a
   population in different resource environments.},

Title = {Sensory neuroecology and multimodal evolution across the genus
   Drosophila},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {The neural basis and genetic mechanisms for sensory evolution are
   increasingly being explored in depth across many closely related members
   of the Drosophila genus. This has, in part, been achieved due to the
   immense efforts toward adapting gene-editing technologies for
   additional, non-model species. Studies targeting both peripheral sensory
   variations, as well as interspecies divergence in coding or neural
   connectivity, have generated numerous, tangible examples of how and
   where the evolution of sensory-driven animal behavior has occurred.
   Here, we review and discuss studies that each aim to identify the
   neurobiological and genetic components of sensory system evolution to
   provide a comparative overview of the types of functional variations
   observed across both perceptual input and behavioral output. In
   addition, we examined the roles neuroecology and neuroevolution play in
   speciation events, such as courtship and intraspecies communication, as
   well as those aspects related to behavioral divergence in host
   navigation or egg-laying preferences. Through the investigation of
   comparative, large-scale trends and correlations across diverse, yet
   closely related species within this highly ecologically variable genus
   of flies, we can begin to describe the underlying pressures, mechanisms,
   and constraints that have guided sensory and nervous system evolution
   within the natural environments of these organisms.},

Abstract = {Excessive grazing causes a decrease in plant diversity of grassland and
   also leads to changes in the functional traits of grassland plants.
   Based on the relationship between plant diversity and the functional
   traits of constructive species, the patterns of change in plant
   diversity can be predicted based on change in plant functional traits
   under different stocking rates. For the present study, Stipa breviflora
   desert steppe in Inner Mongolia was studied to characterize the plant
   community and population characteristics and plant functional traits of
   S. breviflora in grazing areas with different stocking rates {[}without
   grazing, light grazing (LG, 0.93 sheep unit hm(-2)half yr(-1)), moderate
   grazing (MG, 1.82 sheep unit hm(-2)half yr(-1)), heavy grazing (HG, 2.71
   sheep unit hm(-2) half yr(-1))]. The results showed that: (1) LG
   significantly weakened the competitive advantage of the constructive
   species (S. breviflora) (P < 0.05), while HG significantly strengthened
   its competitive advantage in the community (P < 0.05); (2) Changes in
   plant diversity were generally significantly related to changes in S.
   breviflora root traits. The competitive advantage of S. breviflora in
   the community and the change in root traits could be used to predict the
   change in plant diversity in the desert steppe under different stocking
   rates. This research can provide a theoretical basis for maintaining
   plant diversity and sustainability in the desert steppe.},

Title = {Associational Effects and Indirect Interactions-The Dynamical Effects of
   Consumer and Resource Traits on Generalist-Resource Interactions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Trophic interaction modifications occur in food webs when the direct or
   indirect interaction between two species is affected by a third species.
   These behavioral modification effects are often referred to as
   associational effects. Changes in focal resource availability and
   consumption by a generalist herbivore can affect a range of outcomes
   from resource exclusion to multiple resources coexisting with the focal
   plant species. Here, we investigate the indirect interaction between a
   focal and alternative resource mediated by a generalist consumer. Using
   theoretical approaches we analyse the conceptual link between
   associational effects (both resistance and susceptibility) and the
   theory of apparent competition and resource switching. We find that
   changes in focal resource traits have the potential to affect the
   long-term outcome of indirect interactions. Inclusion of
   density-dependence expands generalist life-histories and broadens the
   range where, through associational effects, the availability of
   alternative resources positively influence a focal resource. We conclude
   that different forms of associational effects could, in the long-term,
   lead to a range of indirect interaction dynamics, including apparent
   competition and apparent mutualism. Our work aims to connects the
   theoretical body of work on indirect interactions to the concepts of
   associational effects. The indirect interactions between multiple
   resources need more thorough investigation to appreciate the range of
   associational effects that could result from the dynamical interaction
   between a generalist consumers and its focal and alternative resources.},

Title = {Toward diverse seed sourcing to upscale ecological restoration in the
   Brazilian Cerrado},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Seed markets are vital to scaling up ecosystem restoration in the
   Brazilian Cerrado, home of the world's most species-rich grasslands and
   savannas. We compiled lists of species traded by four major Cerrado seed
   supply systems to investigate the representativeness of the species
   currently available for seed-based restoration. We also identified
   whether dominant ground-layer species are being sourced for seed
   production. Seeds from 263 Cerrado species can be purchased for
   restoration, of which 68\% are trees, particularly legumes (24\%). 63\%
   of the traded species were found in only one seed supply system. The
   five most dominant graminoids of the Cerrado ground layer were available
   for sale, but two additional species uncommon in old-growth areas
   represented 44\% of the sales of a key seed trader in Central Brazil.
   The expansion of Cerrado seed supply systems should be supported to
   further increase the number of species on the market. Sourcing seeds
   from a diversity of herbaceous species is central to facilitating the
   restoration of species-rich grasslands and savannas in the Cerrado.
   Recovering the diversity and functioning of old-growth open ecosystems
   through seeds will depend on increasing the supply and demand for
   species typical of Cerrado's ground layer.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {One may ask if the transition to bipedalism from the condition of
   quadrupedalism, which occurred about 7 million years ago, has been the
   cause or consequence of a series of fundamental physiological muscular
   aspects including the cost of locomotion, a crucial determinant of
   endurance, which has been found to be significantly lower in humans than
   in apes. This issue strictly links to unsolved issues regarding the
   significance of several muscular structural and functional adaptations,
   classically attributed to bipedalism and its associated locomotions,
   which we cannot simply attribute to the acquisition of the upright
   position and which may directly or indirectly contribute to the observed
   changes in muscle energetics that make the modern human an exceptional
   endurance walker and runner compared to quadrupedals.},

Title = {Lipid residues in ancient pastoralist pottery from Kazakhstan reveal
   regional differences in cooking practices},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The Bronze Age-Iron Age transition in Central Asia (ca. 800 BCE) was a
   period of significant cultural change that was heavily influenced by
   greater population interaction and mobility. Indeed, scholars have
   increasingly emphasized the role that ``food globalization in
   prehistory{''} has played in defining this period. In the mountain
   foothills of Kazakhstan, culinary traditions from across Eurasia were
   combined through the use of Southwest Asian wheat, barley, and livestock
   (cattle, sheep, and goats) with East Asian foxtail and broomcorn
   millets. The development of food cultures during this period has been
   investigated by archaeobotanical and isotopic analysis, yet lipid
   residues from pottery, which directly represent culinary practices, have
   not been adequately examined. In this study, lipid residue analysis was
   conducted on 72 pottery sherds, excavated from three burial mounds and
   one non-burial, ritual site located in Kazakhstan, dating to ca. 700-200
   BCE. A particularly informative observation was the frequency of
   miliacin, a biomarker of broomcorn millet, detected in residues that
   corresponded well with previously published regional differences
   observed in carbon isotope ratios of human remains that indicate the
   consumption of C-4 plants. This study also demonstrates continuity of
   Bronze Age dairying traditions into the Iron Age. Finally, this study
   sheds new light on the diversity of food cultures and mortuary practices
   in this region, which were not uniform across either space or time.},

Title = {Controlled feeding experiments with juvenile alligators reveal
   microscopic dental wear texture patterns associated with hard-object
   feeding},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Dental wear analyses are classically applied to mammals because they
   have evolved heterodont dentitions for sophisticated mastication.
   Recently, several studies have shown a correlation between pre-assigned
   and analytically inferred diet preferences in extant reptiles through
   dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA), a method using quantitative
   assessment of microscopic wear marks to reconstruct the diet material
   properties. The first tentative applications of DMTA to extinct reptiles
   have followed. However, for large and small mammals, microwear analyses
   have undergone a long time of ground-truthing through direct feeding
   observations, stomach content analyses, and feeding experiments. Such
   data are currently lacking for reptiles, but are necessary to further
   extend DMTA, especially to Archosauria, as the application to dinosaurs
   could be of great interest to the scientific community. We herein
   present data from a pilot feeding experiment with five juvenile American
   alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Each individual received a diet
   of assumed different hardness for similar to 4 months: crocodylian
   pellets (control), sardines, quails, rats, or crawfish. All individuals
   initially received the same pellet diet, and we found them to show
   similar dental microwear texture patterns before they were switched to
   their designated experimental diet. From the first feeding bout on,
   dental microwear textures differed across the diets. The crawfish-feeder
   showed consistently higher surface complexity, followed by the
   rat-feeder. Quail- and fish-feeding resulted in similar wear signatures,
   with low complexity. Fast tooth replacement and selective tooth use
   likely affected microwear formation, but we were able to detect a
   general hard (crawfish and rat) versus soft (quail and fish) DMTA
   signature. Such patterns can support the identification of hard-object
   feeding in the fossil record.},

Title = {Mechanisms of flower coloring and eco-evolutionary implications of
   massive blooming events in the Atacama Desert},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth, holds a rich
   biodiversity that becomes most appreciable in years when unusual
   rainfall accumulation triggers a phenomenon of explosive development of
   ephemeral herbaceous and woody desert species known as ``desierto
   florido{''} or ``blooming desert.{''} Despite the scientific importance
   of this unique phenomenon only few studies have addressed the mechanisms
   of flower phenotypic divergence under the fluctuating environment
   provided by this recurrent event. We investigated the mechanisms of
   floral color diversity in Cistanthe longiscapa (Montiaceae), a dominant
   species across the ephemeral blooming landscape of Atacama Desert. Our
   analyses show that the variation in colors of C. longiscapa flowers
   result from petals containing betalain pigments with different
   absorption spectra. The different pigment composition of petals causes
   flower color differences in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) range of
   the spectrum. Through color vision models we show that C. longiscapa
   flowers are highly polymorphic in their color appearance for insect
   pollinators. Our results highlight the variable nature in flower color
   of C. longiscapa varieties blooming simultaneously in a geographical
   restricted area. Given the importance of color in attracting floral
   visitors, the observed color variability could contribute to increased
   cross pollination in extreme desert conditions, while accounting for
   complex and fluctuating histories of plant-pollinator interactions.},

Title = {Beyond functional diversity: The importance of trophic position to
   understanding functional processes in community evolution},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Ecosystem structure-that is the species present, the functions they
   represent, and how those functions interact-is an important determinant
   of community stability. This in turn affects how ecosystems respond to
   natural and anthropogenic crises, and whether species or the ecological
   functions that they represent are able to persist. Here we use fossil
   data from museum collections, literature, and the Paleobiology Database
   to reconstruct trophic networks of Tethyan paleocommunities from the
   Anisian and Carnian (Triassic), Bathonian (Jurassic), and Aptian
   (Cretaceous) stages, and compare these to a previously reconstructed
   trophic network from a modern Jamaican reef community. We generated
   model food webs consistent with functional structure and taxon
   richnesses of communities, and compared distributions of guild level
   parameters among communities, to assess the effect of the Mesozoic
   Marine Revolution on ecosystem dynamics. We found that the trophic space
   of communities expanded from the Anisian to the Aptian, but this pattern
   was not monotonic. We also found that trophic position for a given guild
   was subject to variation depending on what other guilds were present in
   that stage. The Bathonian showed the lowest degree of trophic omnivory
   by top consumers among all Mesozoic networks, and was dominated by
   longer food chains. In contrast, the Aptian network displayed a greater
   degree of short food chains and trophic omnivory that we attribute to
   the presence of large predatory guilds, such as sharks and bony fish.
   Interestingly, the modern Jamaican community appeared to have a higher
   proportion of long chains, as was the case in the Bathonian. Overall,
   results indicate that trophic structure is highly dependent on the taxa
   and ecological functions present, primary production experienced by the
   community, and activity of top consumers. Results from this study point
   to a need to better understand trophic position when planning
   restoration activities because a community may be so altered by human
   activity that restoring a species or its interactions may no longer be
   possible, and alternatives must be considered to restore an important
   function. Further work may also focus on elucidating the precise roles
   of top consumers in moderating network structure and community
   stability.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal analysis of land use changes and their trade-offs on the
   northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {The unprecedented urbanization recently has inevitably intensified the
   changes in land use morphology. However, current studies on land use
   primarily analyze a single morphology, ignoring the relationships
   between different land use morphologies. Taking the northern slope of
   the Tianshan Mountains (NSTM) as the study area, this article quantifies
   the spatiotemporal pattern of land use change, and estimates trade-offs
   and synergies between dominant (patch density, largest patch index, and
   landscape shape index) and recessive (land use efficiency, land use
   intensity, and agricultural non-point source pollution) morphologies to
   fully understand the dynamic characteristics of land use. Results showed
   bare areas and grassland were always predominant land use types, and
   land use change from 1990 to 2020 was characterized by the increase of
   impervious surfaces and the decrease of bare areas. The strongest
   trade-off was found between largest patch index and land use intensity,
   while the synergy between landscape shape index and land use intensity
   was strongest. There are significant disparities in terms of temporal
   and spatial patterns of trade-offs/synergies. The correlation
   coefficients in different study periods were much smaller than their
   estimations in the whole region, and the trade-offs/synergies in the
   eastern NSTM were basically identical with the whole relationships. The
   findings reveal the interactions among various land use characteristics,
   and provide significant references for coordinated land management and
   regional high-quality development.},

Title = {Making the competitive exclusion principle operational at the
   biogeographical scale using fuzzy logic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {In biogeography the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) has been
   confirmed in some cases but not in others. This has fueled an unresolved
   debate between those advocating niche theory or the neutral theory in
   biodiversity and biogeography. We suggest that this situation mainly
   arises from the use of crisp logic, where the CEP is defined as either
   completely true or false. We propose the application of the fuzzy
   concepts of favorability (the degree to which environmental conditions
   are propitious for the occurrence of individual species) and
   favorableness (the degree to which environmental conditions are
   simultaneously favorable for competing species) to operationalize a
   fuzzy version of the CEP. Favorability was obtained by performing
   species distribution models applying favorability functions, while
   favorableness was derived from the application of the fuzzy intersection
   between the favorability for competing species. Then we plotted
   individual favorability values along the gradient of favorableness. Two
   potentially competing species would coexist in high-favorableness
   locations, as the demands of both species would be well fulfilled. In
   locations of low favorableness, the result would be either autecological
   exclusion of both species or autecological segregation, as abiotic
   conditions are unfavorable for at least one of the species. Competitive
   exclusion would occur at the intermediate stretch of the favorableness
   gradient, as the conditions would be good enough for persistence of each
   species separately but not enough for permanent coexistence. According
   to this theoretical framework, the observed probability that a location
   belongs to the intermediate favorableness area given that the two
   species co-occur in this location should be lower than expected
   according to the environmental probability models for the two species.
   We tested this prediction on published data about the distribution of
   pairs of native and introduced deer species in Great Britain, using a
   Bayesian approach. In two thirds of comparisons between a native and an
   introduced deer species the predictions of the fuzzy CEP were
   corroborated, which suggests that these are the pairs of species and the
   specific geographical areas affected by competitive exclusion. This is
   important both theoretically and for biodiversity conservation planning.},

Abstract = {Coordination and interaction among urbanization processes, efficient
   resource utilization, and ecological protection have emerged as key
   challenges for spatial development and protection of a territory. In
   this paper, we quantitatively determined the urbanization level and
   eco-efficiency by utilizing the entropy evaluation method and the SBM
   model with undesirable outputs, and then employed kernel density
   estimation, center movement method, and bivariate Moran's I index method
   to examine the spatial-temporal pattern as well as the interaction
   between the above two factors. This study provides a new framework for
   the measurement of urbanization and eco-efficiency and their
   interaction. The results of the study in the research area demonstrate
   that: (1) From 2013 to 2017, the urbanization level exhibited a steady
   increase from 0.2468 to 0.2789, while eco-efficiency depicted an
   N-shaped development trend before suffering an overall decline from
   0.4364 to 0.3117; (2) the low-level units of urbanization level
   illustrated a strong convergence trend, and each unit possessed low
   eco-efficiency with weak spatial matching in general; (3) an ambiguous
   symbiosis exists between the center of gravity of movements of the two
   factors within each region; and (4) a global positive correlation was
   found between the urbanization level and eco-efficiency in Liaoning
   Province. The global Moran's I index first increased and then decreased.},

Abstract = {The introduction and the later dispersal of domestic cattle in China had
   played an enormous part in food production, handicraft manufacture, and
   ritual activities. However, we lack the details of pastoral economies,
   herding strategies, and utilization patterns of cattle in ancient China.
   This study, for the first time, uses biometrical assessments to
   investigate post-domesticated cattle husbandry and how it changed over
   time. Biometric data from eight sites dating from the Late Neolithic to
   the Late Bronze Age were evaluated using kernel analysis and mixture
   analysis. Results indicated that the general body size of cattle first
   decrease and then increase. By combining the estimated distribution of
   male and female individuals, we can see that the sex ratios affect size
   variation during Bronze Age times. Although no breed improvement has
   been detected so far, the herding and slaughtering strategies over time
   are different.},

Title = {Scrutinizing the paleoecological record of the Maya forest},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Human expansion into and occupation of the New World coincided with the
   great transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch, yet
   questions remain about how we detect human presence in the
   paleoecological record. In the Maya area of southern Mesoamerica,
   archeological evidence of the human imprint is largely invisible until
   similar to 4,000 years ago. How do environmental changes after that time
   correspond and relate to human impacts? Are the archeological signatures
   of initial settlements in the Early Preclassic detected? Later, by
   similar to 2,000 years ago when the Maya had fully settled the
   landscape, how does the evidence of forest compositional changes relate
   to human intervention? This paper evaluates published paleoecological
   data in light of the rise of the Maya civilization and reflects on
   interpretations of how swidden agriculture and the milpa cycle impacted
   the environment. Evaluating the contrast between the long archeological
   sequence of successful Maya development and paleoecological
   interpretations of destructive human-induced environmental impacts
   requires a concordance among pollen data, archeological evidence,
   ethnohistoric observations, ethnological studies of traditional Maya
   land use, and the historical ecology of the Maya forest today.},

Title = {Body temperature and activity patterns modulate glucocorticoid levels
   across lizard species: A macrophysiological approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Environmental and intrinsic factors interact to determine energy
   requirements in vertebrates. Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are key
   mediators of this interaction, as they fluctuate with energetic demands
   and regulate physiological and behavioral responses to environmental
   challenges. While a great body of research has focused on GC variation
   among individuals, the mechanisms driving GC variation across species
   and at broad spatial scales remain largely unexplored. Here, we adopted
   a macrophysiological approach to investigate the environmental factors
   and life-history traits driving variation in baseline GCs across lizard
   species. We tested three hypotheses: (1) If GCs increase with body
   temperature to meet higher metabolic demand, we expect an association
   between average baseline GCs and the mean species' body temperature in
   the field (GC-temperature dependence hypothesis); (2) If GCs mediate
   behavioral responses to avoid thermal extremes, we expect that
   individuals frequently exposed to extreme conditions exhibit higher
   baseline GC levels (Behavioral thermoregulation hypothesis); (3) If GCs
   increase to support higher energy demands in active foragers during
   their period of activity, we expect that active foraging species have
   higher baseline GCs than sit-and-wait foragers, and that GC levels
   increase in relation to the duration of daily activity windows (Activity
   hypothesis). We used biophysical models to calculate operative
   temperatures and the activity patterns of lizards in sun-exposed and
   shaded microenvironments. Then, we tested the association between
   baseline GCs, body temperature, operative temperatures, foraging mode,
   and activity windows across 37 lizard species, using data from
   HormoneBase. Our comparative analyses showed that variation in baseline
   GCs was primarily related to the mean field body temperature and
   foraging mode, with higher baseline GCs in active foragers with higher
   body temperatures. Our results suggest that body temperature and
   foraging mode drive GC variation through their effects on energy
   requirements across lizard species.},

Title = {Comparison of breeding strategies of two sympatric thrush species in an
   alpine environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Closely related birds that occur sympatrically will inevitably differ in
   the acquisition of food resources, nest site selection, and breeding
   times. The successful coexistence of birds that breed in the same area
   can be determined by investigating how they divide limited resources and
   reduce interspecific competition. Our study area is located at the
   eastern foot of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with a high altitude and low
   annual average temperature. In this study, the life history
   characteristics and reproductive ecological parameters of two closely
   related species, the Chestnut Thrush (Turdus rubrocanus) and the
   Kessler's Thrush (Turdus kessleri), were compared in detail in
   April-July of 2020, 2021, and 2022 in the scrub along the Liqiu River in
   Xinduqiao Town, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze, Sichuan. The
   results showed no differences in nesting material, nest cup size, clutch
   size, feeding strategy of nestlings, brood food type, and reproductive
   effectiveness between the Chestnut Thrush and the Kessler's Thrush.
   However, the Kessler's Thrush had a higher nesting height, thicker nest
   wall, earlier breeding time, smaller eggs, fewer brooding frequent and a
   longer brooding time compared to the Chestnut Thrush. In addition, they
   invested more time in parental care, resulting in a faster growth and
   development rate. The results indicate that birds with different ranges
   and breeding in the same range show convergent and divergent life
   history characteristics in terms of reproductive biology. Chestnut
   Thrush with low reproductive altitude shows the characteristics of
   low-altitude bird reproduction in part of reproductive biology, while
   Kessler's Thrush with high reproductive altitude shows the
   characteristics of high-altitude bird reproduction in part of
   reproductive biology.},

Title = {Why grazing and soil matter for dry grassland diversity: New insights
   from multigroup structural equation modeling of micro-patterns},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Grazing is recognized as a major process driving the composition of
   plant communities in grasslands, mostly due to the heterogeneous removal
   of plant species and soil compaction that results in a mosaic of small
   patches called micro-patterns. To date, no study has investigated the
   differences in composition and functioning among these micro-patterns in
   grasslands in relation to grazing and soil environmental variables at
   the micro-local scale. In this study, we ask (1) To what extent are
   micro-patterns different from each other in terms of species
   composition, species richness, vegetation volume, evenness, and
   functioning? and (2) based on multigroup structural equation modeling,
   are those differences directly or indirectly driven by grazing and soil
   characteristics? We focused on three micro-patterns of the Mediterranean
   dry grassland of the Crau area, a protected area traditionally grazed in
   the South-East of France. From 70 plant community releves carried out in
   three micro-patterns located in four sites with different soil and
   grazing characteristics, we performed univariate, multivariate analyses
   and applied structural equation modeling for the first time to this type
   of data. Our results show evidence of clear differences among
   micro-pattern patches in terms of species composition, vegetation
   volume, species richness, evenness, and functioning at the micro-local
   scale. These differences are maintained not only by direct and indirect
   effects of grazing but also by several soil variables such as fine
   granulometry. Biological crusts appeared mostly driven by these soil
   variables, whereas reference and edge communities are mostly the result
   of different levels of grazing pressure revealing three distinct
   functioning specific to each micro-pattern, all of them coexisting at
   the micro-local scale in the studied Mediterranean dry grassland. This
   first overview of the multiple effects of grazing and soil
   characteristics on communities in micro-patterns is discussed within the
   scope of the conservation of dry grasslands plant diversity.},

Title = {Behavioral plasticity mediates adaptation to changes in food
   provisioning following the COVID-19 lockdown in black-headed gulls
   (Larus ridibundus)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown provides an opportunity to assess how the
   anthropause affected the behavior of birds. Black-headed gulls (Larus
   ridibundus) wintering at Dianchi Lake (Yunnan Province, southwestern
   China) prefer to forage on easily accessible human-provided food at
   various sites along the lake. Following the closure of the lake because
   of the pandemic, synthetic food was provided at a single location. We
   expected that the home range size and distribution of gulls would change
   in response to these changes in food provisioning. A total of 91 gulls
   were tagged with satellite transmitters in November 2018 and March 2019,
   and their movements were tracked during the winter months. We analyzed
   their home range size and spatial distribution in four periods, SCP2019,
   SOP2019, SCP2020, and SOP2020 (Scenic Opening/Closing Period in
   2019/2020), and the difference between SOP2019 and SCP2019 was used as
   the control group. The eutrophication level in the wintering periods
   ``Nov. 2018-Apr. 2019{''} and ``Oct. 2019-Apr. 2020{''} was determined
   using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the
   coverage ratio of algal blooms and NDVI were used as indicators of the
   amount of naturally available food. The home range sizes of gulls were
   reduced in SCP2020 compared with SOP2019, SCP2019, and SOP2020. The
   gulls were most abundant in the 600-900 m buffer zone and least abundant
   in the 0-300 m buffer zone in SCP2019; they were most abundant in the
   0-300 m buffer zone and least abundant in the 900-2000 m buffer zone in
   SCP2020. These patterns were consistent with variation in the NDVI and
   the coverage ratio of algal blooms among buffer zones. Changes in
   wintering behaviors in SCP2020 relative to other periods suggested that
   gulls modified their behavior following anthropause-related changes in
   the distribution and provisioning of food. Our findings provide insights
   into the role of behavioral plasticity in mediating adaptation to
   changes in human activities in birds.},

Title = {Mapping seasonal sentiments of people visiting blue spaces in urban
   wetlands: A pilot study on inland cities of China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {To evoke positive human emotions is a critical goal of blue spaces in
   urban wetland parks. However, information is still scarce on how people
   self-express across the spatiotemporal spectrum when they come across
   wetlands which include varying levels of elevation in a single landscape
   and microclimate. In this study, 30 urban wetland parks were selected
   from 17 cities in Central China, where a total of 1,184 portrait photos
   of visitors were obtained from a social media platform (Sina Weibo) to
   analyze their expressed sentiments by rating facial expression scores of
   happy and sad emotions and net positive emotion index (NPE; happy-score
   minus sad-score) in 2020. Landscape metrics were remotely evaluated for
   every wetland park, and microclimatic factors were obtained for the days
   when the photos were taken. Based on regressions of park-level data,
   blue-space areas could be perceived as a positive driver to trigger
   happiness in spring (regression coefficient {[}RC] of 0.20), but it
   triggered negative emotions in autumn (RC of -2.98). The higher
   elevation areas triggered positive emotions in summer and autumn (RC of
   1.35 x 10(-3)), but extreme daily temperature, air humidity, and wind
   velocity together triggered sadness (RC of 0.11, 0.03, and 0.51,
   respectively). Mapped distribution of the area and corresponding
   emotions showed that visiting blue space evoked more smiles in wetland
   parks of northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and eastern Anhui in spring.
   Blue spaces in Shanxi and northwestern Hebei evoked better moods in
   autumn. Smaller blue spaces in wetlands located at higher elevations
   were recommended for nature enthusiasts in warm seasons to overcome the
   prevalent sadness characteristic of that time of the year and location.},

   transmission mode jointly determine the direction and strength of the
   diversity-disease relationship},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Rapid global biodiversity loss and increasing emerging infectious
   diseases underscore the significance of identifying the
   diversity-disease relationship. Although experimental evidence supports
   the existence of dilution effects in several natural ecosystems, we
   still know very little about the conditions under which a dilution
   effect will occur. Using a multi-host Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
   model, we found when disease transmission was density-dependent, the
   diversity-disease relationship could exhibit an increasing, decreasing,
   or non-monotonic trend, which mainly depended on the patterns of
   community assembly. However, the combined effects of the host
   competence-abundance relationship and species extinction order may
   reverse or weaken this trend. In contrast, when disease transmission was
   frequency-dependent, the diversity-disease relationship only showed a
   decreasing trend, the host competence-abundance relationship and species
   extinction order did not alter this decreasing trend, but it could
   reduce the detectability of the dilution effect and affect disease
   prevalence. Overall, a combination of disease transmission mode,
   community assembly pattern, and host community composition determines
   the direction or strength of the diversity-disease relationship. Our
   work helps explain why previous studies came to different conclusions
   about the diversity-disease relationship and provides a deeper
   understanding of the pathogen transmission dynamics in actual
   communities.},

Title = {Transformation of farmland use and driving mechanism in Xinjiang since
   China's Western Development Policy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Since the implementation of China's Western Development Policy, Xinjiang
   has experienced rapid socio-economic development and significant changes
   in its land use patterns. As an important factor in agricultural
   production, farmland is of crucial for realizing the rural
   revitalization strategy. Based the theoretical mechanisms of farmland
   use transformation, this study selected five periods of land use and
   socioeconomic data from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 to study the
   spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics of farmland use
   transformation in Xinjiang since China's Western Development Policy. We
   then explored the driving mechanisms using an optimal geographic
   detector model based on parameters. The results showed that (1)
   Xinjiang's farmland use transitioned toward large scale and
   multifunctionality, and the transition characteristics are mainly of
   fluctuating growth type. The spatial transformation and functional
   transformation characteristics were generally consistent in spatial
   distribution. (2) There was a spatial agglomeration in the
   transformation, which was concentrated in the economic zone of the
   northern slope of Tianshan Mountain, the Yili River Valley and Kashgar
   region. The concentration of functional transformation of farmland has
   increased, but the spatial transformation of farmland has weakened. (3)
   The role of influencing factors on the transformation of farmland use
   differed with periods. Finally, the study concluded that the functional
   transformation of farmland in Xinjiang since China's Western Development
   Policy is still at the stage of mainly production function. We suggest
   that the protection of farmland in Xinjiang in the New Western
   Development period should be achieved by promoting the transformation of
   the function of farmland. The findings of this study provide
   decision-making assistance for the management of farmland use in
   Xinjiang during the New Western Development period and are an effective
   tool for achieving the goals of sustainable farmland use and
   agricultural and rural modernization.},

Title = {Color in motion: Generating 3-dimensional multispectral models to study
   dynamic visual signals in animals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Analyzing color and pattern in the context of motion is a central and
   ongoing challenge in the quantification of animal coloration. Many
   animal signals are spatially and temporally variable, but traditional
   methods fail to capture this dynamism because they use stationary
   animals in fixed positions. To investigate dynamic visual displays and
   to understand the evolutionary forces that shape dynamic colorful
   signals, we require cross-disciplinary methods that combine measurements
   of color, pattern, 3-dimensional (3D) shape, and motion. Here, we
   outline a workflow for producing digital 3D models with objective color
   information from museum specimens with diffuse colors. The workflow
   combines multispectral imaging with photogrammetry to produce digital 3D
   models that contain calibrated ultraviolet (UV) and human-visible (VIS)
   color information and incorporate pattern and 3D shape. These ``3D
   multispectral models{''} can subsequently be animated to incorporate
   both signaler and receiver movement and analyzed in silico using a
   variety of receiver-specific visual models. This approach-which can be
   flexibly integrated with other tools and methods-represents a key first
   step toward analyzing visual signals in motion. We describe several
   timely applications of this workflow and next steps for multispectral 3D
   photogrammetry and animation techniques.},

   efficiency on algae. Studying the quantitative relationship between
   cyanobacteria and cladocera, especially in unmanipulated and
   unpredictable natural ecosystems in the wild, provides the key to
   revealing the mechanism of cyanobacterial blooms and finding effective
   control and prevention methods. This paper proposes a research method to
   detect the threshold for cladocera to control cyanobacteria by using the
   path of ``edge scatter-segment regression.{''} Based on the field survey
   data from 242 sample sites in shallow and slow-flowing rivers in North
   China, the quantitative relationship between the main groups of
   zooplankton and phytoplankton was analyzed, and the standard deviation
   and coefficient of variation were used to test the threshold. This paper
   finally compares the roles of body size and cladocera abundance in
   cyanobacteria control. The results showed that in natural ecosystems,
   cladocera were the best group for controlling the abundance of
   cyanobacteria among zooplankton. The control effect of cladocera on the
   abundance of cyanobacteria is not linear but non-linear, and cladocera
   can only have a stable control effect under certain conditions. The
   total phosphorus concentrations and water temperatures did not interfere
   with the analysis results in this paper. In wild ecosystems, the
   predation process of cladocera on cyanobacteria basically follows the
   ``size-efficiency{''} hypothesis, but when cladocera successfully
   control cyanobacterial abundances, it is often due to ``win by
   quantity{''} rather than ``win by size.{''} The phenomenon of non-linear
   variation in the cladocera density-cyanobacteria density relationship
   fits well with the description of the transition from a stable to
   chaotic state in chaos theory. This paper reveals the complex
   quantitative relationships of plankton food chains in wild aquatic
   ecosystems. The ecological threshold detection of the
   cladocera-cyanobacterial abundances provides a quantitative basis for
   early warning, control and prevention of cyanobacteria blooms. The
   non-linear variations in cladocera density-cyanobacteria density
   revealed in this paper provide insight and evidence for understanding
   the complex changes in aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Potential Futures for Coastal Wolves and Their Ecosystem Services in
   Alaska, With Implications for Management of a Social-Ecological System},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Carnivores across much of the world are declining, leading to loss of
   biodiversity as well as the ecosystem services carnivores provide. In
   2020, the Alexander Archipelago (AA) wolf was petitioned for protection
   under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the third time in 30
   years. Concerns included habitat alteration from industrial timber
   harvest and subsequent declines in prey (deer), human-caused mortality,
   climate change, and genetic inbreeding. However, the underlying
   biogeography and ecology of these wolves continues to suggest resiliency
   across the subspecies' range, even though local populations may go
   extinct. If local wolf populations go extinct, it will result in loss of
   their ecosystem services (e.g., interactions of wolves with their prey,
   which prevents over-browsing and protects carbon sequestration in soils
   and trees), which will likely have major consequences for the local
   social-ecological system. Here, we updated a model we constructed for
   the last ESA listing process (2015) to examine the dynamics of wolf and
   deer populations on Prince of Wales Island (the primary geographic focus
   of all three petitions) in response to future environmental and
   management scenarios developed with stakeholders. Further, we considered
   how changes in deer abundance impact predation services (prevention of
   over-browsing by deer). We found that wolf populations generally
   persisted over 30 years, but dropped below an effective population size
   of 50 wolves in 10-98\% of years simulated. Low wolf abundance resulted
   in higher deer abundance, which increased hunting opportunity, but also
   browsing damages (e.g., 19\% of areas would be over-browsed if wolf
   harvest caps are removed, and >30\% of areas would be over-browsed if
   wolves go extinct). Human harvest of wildlife was a key regulator of
   abundance and ecosystem services within the coastal rainforest
   social-ecological system; wolf abundance was most affected by wolf
   harvest regulations; and deer harvest restrictions increased wolf and
   deer abundances, but also greatly increased browsing impacts (>70\% of
   areas heavily browsed if hunting ceased). Our findings support an
   integrated approach to management of this social-ecological system, such
   that social and ecological sciences are both used to monitor important
   components of the system (e.g., measuring public sentiment and
   likelihood of poaching, alongside wolf and deer numbers). Integration
   and adaptive approaches are needed to ensure that the many ecosystem
   services humans depend on are valued, conserved, and restored, including
   the cryptic predation services wolves have historically provided to the
   timber industry via reduced browsing pressure by deer.},

Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Understory plants are often inadequately represented or neglected within
   analyses of forest ecosystem productivity. Further, the potential
   impacts of the biological factors of age class and growth form on carbon
   cycling physiology, and how it may vary across the growing season and
   amongst species of different native/non-native status, have not been
   thoroughly considered. Our study examines photosynthesis and associated
   physical leaf traits in two understory woody species, Rhamnus
   cathartica, introduced and invasive in North America, and Prunus
   serotina, a common subcanopy species native to North America. We
   estimated leaf-level photosynthesis as measured through light and carbon
   dioxide response curves, dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf
   traits (leaf mass per area and stomatal density) for each combination of
   species and age class at plots in the understory of a temperate
   deciduous research forest in the US Upper Midwest at two time points
   during the growing season, late spring (late May) and mid-summer
   (mid-July). Carbon assimilation rates from light response curves
   (A(sat), A(400)) and fluorescence capacity estimate F-v./F-m all
   increased between the two measurement points in both species and age
   class. Estimates of carbon reaction capacity (V-cmax and J(max))
   exhibited a different directional response to seasonal development,
   declining in seedlings of both species and P. serotina trees (similar to
   8-37 \% reduction in V-cmax, similar to 9-34 \% reduction in J(max)),
   though increased in trees of R. cathartica (+24 \% in V-cmax, +9 \% in
   J(max)). Divergent responses in photosynthetic parameters amongst these
   factors may be explained by species differences in leaf mass per area
   and stomatal density, which together are likely influenced by both
   growth form, canopy position and ontogeny. Overall, we believe our
   findings suggest complex, varied influences on photosynthesis that
   indicate environmental and biological plasticity which may contribute to
   the historic and continued expansion of R. cathartica in the US Upper
   Midwest region.},

Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Plant leaf morphological and photosynthetic physiological
   characteristics are key functional traits in the adaptability of plants
   to heterogeneous environments. Analysis of the correlation between leaf
   morphological traits and photosynthetic physiological characteristics of
   salt marsh plants is helpful to deepen our understanding of how salt
   marsh plants adjust their leaf structure and function to adapt to their
   environment. However, there have been few studies on the relationship
   between leaf morphology and photosynthetic physiological characteristics
   of plants in inland salt marshes under a habitat gradient. A Phragmites
   australis community was divided into three plots based on differences in
   the wetland habitat conditions: a remote water area (plot I, 400-550 m
   from the water margin), a middle water area (plot II, 200-350 m from the
   water margin) and a near water area (plot III, 0-150 m from the water
   margin). The relationship between leaf morphological traits and
   photosynthetic physiological parameters of P. australis in heterogeneous
   habitats was studied. The results showed that as the habitat conditions
   changed from plot I to plot III, the soil characteristics, above-ground
   characteristics of the community and the photosynthetically active
   radiation changed significantly (P < 0.05). Besides, there was a highly
   significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between leaf dry weight
   (LDW) and net photosynthetic rate (P-n), the effective quantum yield of
   PSII photochemistry (Y(II), actual photochemical efficiency of PSII) and
   photochemical quenching (QP); and between leaf area and P-n, Y(II) and
   QP in the three habitats. Moreover, in plot I, P. australis tended to
   have small and thick leaves with a low LDW and specific leaf area. In
   plot III, leaves were large and thin to adapt to the change in habitat
   conditions. This study provides a scientific theoretical basis for
   understanding the ecological adaptation strategies of plants in the
   harsh environment of an inland salt marsh and the conservation and
   management of wetland plants.
   Plant leaf morphological and photosynthetic physiological
   characteristics are key functional traits in the adaptability of plants
   to heterogeneous environments. Our results showed that in the far water
   area of a salt marsh, Phragmites australisplants tended to have small
   and thick leaves. In the near water area, the reed population had large
   and thin leaves to adapt to the change in habitat conditions. Moreover,
   we found that leaf morphological characteristics of P. australiswere
   closely related to photosynthesis. This study provides a scientific

Title = {Phosphorus uptake and toxicity are delimited by mycorrhizal symbiosis in
   P-sensitive Eucalyptus marginata but not in P-tolerant Acacia
   celastrifolia},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Many plant species from regions with ancient, highly weathered
   nutrient-depleted soils have specialized adaptations for acquiring
   phosphorus (P) and are sensitive to excess P supply. Mycorrhizal
   associations may regulate P uptake at high external P concentrations,
   potentially reducing P toxicity. We predicted that excess P application
   will negatively impact species from the nutrient-depleted Jarrah forest
   of Western Australia and that mycorrhizal inoculation will reduce P
   toxicity by regulating P uptake. For seedlings of the N-2-fixing legume
   Acacia celastrifolia and the tree species Eucalyptus marginata, we
   measured growth at P concentrations of 0-90 mg kg(-1) soil and in
   relation to inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF)
   Rhizophagus irregularis. Non-inoculated A. celastrifolia maintained leaf
   P concentrations at <2 mg g(-1) dry mass (DM) across the range of
   external P concentrations. However, for non-inoculated E. marginata, as
   external P concentrations increased, leaf P also increased, reaching >9
   mg g(-1) DM at 30 mg P kg(-1) soil. Acacia celastrifolia DM increased
   with increasing external P concentrations, while E. marginata DM was
   maximal at 15 mg P kg(-1) soil, declining at higher external P
   concentrations. Neither DM nor leaf P of A. celastrifolia was affected
   by inoculation with AMF. For E. marginata, even at 90 mg P kg(-1) soil,
   inoculation with AMF resulted in leaf P remaining <1 mg g(-1) DM, and DM
   being maintained. These data strengthen the evidence base that AMF may
   not only facilitate P uptake at low external P concentrations, but are
   also important for moderating P uptake at elevated external P
   concentrations and maintaining plant P concentrations within a
   relatively narrow concentration range.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are typically thought to facilitate
   phosphorous (P) uptake when external P concentrations are low. However,
   for two species adapted to low-nutrient environments, we investigated
   whether AMF can also control and reduce P uptake at high external P
   concentrations. For one of the species, Eucalyptus marginata, we found
   evidence that AMF not only facilitate P uptake at low external P
   concentrations but are also important for moderating P uptake at
   elevated external P concentrations and maintaining plant P
   concentrations within a relatively narrow concentration range.},

Title = {Post-fire seed dispersal of a wind-dispersed shrub declined with
   distance to seed source, yet had high levels of unexplained variation},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Plant-population recovery across large disturbance areas is often
   seed-limited. An understanding of seed dispersal patterns is fundamental
   for determining natural-regeneration potential. However, forecasting
   seed dispersal rates across heterogeneous landscapes remains a
   challenge. Our objectives were to determine (i) the landscape patterning
   of post-disturbance seed dispersal, and underlying sources of variation
   and the scale at which they operate, and (ii) how the natural seed
   dispersal patterns relate to a seed augmentation strategy. Vertical seed
   trapping experiments were replicated across 2 years and five burned
   and/or managed landscapes in sagebrush steppe. Multi-scale sampling and
   hierarchical Bayesian models were used to determine the scale of spatial
   variation in seed dispersal. We then integrated an empirical and
   mechanistic dispersal kernel for wind-dispersed species to project rates
   of seed dispersal and compared natural seed arrival to typical post-fire
   aerial seeding rates. Seeds were captured across the range of tested
   dispersal distances, up to a maximum distance of 26 m from seed-source
   plants, although dispersal to the furthest traps was variable. Seed
   dispersal was better explained by transect heterogeneity than by patch
   or site heterogeneity (transects were nested within patch within site).
   The number of seeds captured varied from a modelled mean of similar to
   13 m(-2) adjacent to patches of seed-producing plants, to nearly none at
   10 m from patches, standardized over a 49-day period. Maximum seed
   dispersal distances on average were estimated to be 16 m according to a
   novel modelling approach using a `latent' variable for dispersal
   distance based on seed trapping heights. Surprisingly, statistical
   representation of wind did not improve model fit and seed rain was not
   related to the large variation in total available seed of adjacent
   patches.The models predicted severe seed limitations were likely on
   typical burned areas, especially compared to the mean 95-250 seeds per
   m(2) that previous literature suggested were required to generate
   sagebrush recovery. More broadly, our Bayesian data fusion approach
   could be applied to other cases that require quantitative estimates of
   long-distance seed dispersal across heterogeneous landscapes.},

Title = {Re-evaluating Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) conservation units in

Abstract = {Conservation units (CUs) are important tools for supporting the
   implementation of standardized management practices for exploited
   species. Following the adoption of the Wild Salmon Policy in Canada, CUs
   were defined for Pacific salmon based on characteristics related to
   ecotype, life history and genetic variation using microsatellite markers
   as indirect measures of local adaptation. Genomic data sets have the
   potential to improve the definition of CUs by reducing variance around
   estimates of population genetic parameters, thereby increasing the power
   to detect more subtle patterns of population genetic structure and by
   providing an opportunity to incorporate adaptive information more
   directly with the identification of variants putatively under selection.
   We used one of the largest genomic data sets recently published for a
   nonmodel species, comprising 5662 individual Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus
   kisutch) from 149 sampling locations and a total of 24,542 high-quality
   SNPs obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing and mapped to the Coho
   salmon reference genome to (1) evaluate the current delineation of CUs
   for Coho in Canada and (2) compare patterns of population structure
   observed using neutral and outlier loci from genotype-environment
   association analyses to determine whether separate CUs that capture
   adaptive diversity are needed. Our results reflected CU boundaries on
   the whole, with the majority of sampling locations managed in the same
   CU clustering together within genetic groups. However, additional groups
   that are not currently represented by CUs were also uncovered. We
   observed considerable overlap in the genetic clusters identified using
   neutral or candidate loci, indicating a general congruence in patterns
   of genetic variation driven by local adaptation and gene flow in this
   species. Consequently, we suggest that the current CU boundaries for
   Coho salmon are largely well-suited for meeting the Canadian Wild Salmon
   Policy's objective of defining biologically distinct groups, but we
   highlight specific areas where CU boundaries may be refined.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that the process of range expansion will
   lead to differences in life-history and dispersal traits between the
   core and edge of a population. At the edge, selection and genetic drift
   can have opposing effects on reproductive ability, while spatial sorting
   by dispersal ability can increase dispersal. However, the context that
   individuals experience, including population density and mating status,
   also impacts dispersal behavior. We seek to understand the shifts in
   traits of populations expanding across natural, heterogenous
   environments, and the evolutionary and behavioral factors that may drive
   those shifts. We evaluated theoretical predictions for evolution of
   reproductive life-history and dispersal traits using the range expansion
   of a biological control agent, Diorhabda carinulata, or northern
   tamarisk beetle. We find that individuals from the edge had increased
   fecundity and female body mass, and reduced age at first reproduction,
   indicating that genetic load is low and suggesting that selection has
   acted at the edge. We also find that density of conspecifics during
   rearing and mating status influence dispersal of males and that
   dispersal increases at the edge of the range under certain conditions,
   particularly when males were unmated and reared at low density. The
   restricted conditions in which dispersal has increased suggest that
   spatial sorting has exerted weak effects relative to other potential
   processes. Our results support most theoretical predictions about
   evolution during range expansion, even across a heterogeneous
   environment, especially when the ecological context is considered.},

Title = {Adaptive, maladaptive, neutral, or absent plasticity: Hidden caveats of
   reaction norms},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {486-503},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity may improve the response of individuals
   when faced with new environmental conditions. Typically, empirical
   evidence for plasticity is based on phenotypic reaction norms obtained
   in reciprocal transplant experiments. In such experiments, individuals
   from their native environment are transplanted into a different
   environment, and a number of trait values, potentially implicated in
   individuals' response to the new environment, are measured. However, the
   interpretations of reaction norms may differ depending on the nature of
   the assessed traits, which may not be known beforehand. For example, for
   traits that contribute to local adaptation, adaptive plasticity implies
   nonzero slopes of reaction norms. By contrast, for traits that are
   correlated to fitness, high tolerance to different environments
   (possibly due to adaptive plasticity in traits that contribute to
   adaptation) may, instead, result in flat reaction norms. Here we
   investigate reaction norms for adaptive versus fitness-correlated traits
   and how they may affect the conclusions regarding the contribution of
   plasticity. To this end, we first simulate range expansion along an
   environmental gradient where plasticity evolves to different values
   locally and then perform reciprocal transplant experiments in silico. We
   show that reaction norms alone cannot inform us whether the assessed
   trait exhibits locally adaptive, maladaptive, neutral, or no plasticity,
   without any additional knowledge of the traits assessed and species'
   biology. We use the insights from the model to analyse and interpret
   empirical data from reciprocal transplant experiments involving the
   marine isopod Idotea balthica sampled from two geographical locations
   with different salinities, concluding that the low-salinity population
   likely has reduced adaptive plasticity relative to the high-salinity
   population. Overall, we conclude that, when interpreting results from
   reciprocal transplant experiments, it is necessary to consider whether
   traits assessed are locally adaptive with respect to the environmental
   variable accounted for in the experiments or correlated to fitness.},

Title = {Coryanthes macrantha (Orchidaceae: Stanhopeinae) and their floral and

Abstract = {This study brings unprecedented analyses of Coryanthes macrantha, a
   fascinating species of Orchidaceae, with wide occurrence in the
   Brazilian Amazon. This species present an ingenious pollination
   mechanism, due to the peculiar structure of the labellum. Osmophores,
   structures that secrete volatile substances, are located in the labellum
   and are responsible for attracting male Euglossini bees. The attracted
   bees fall into a structure like a bucket (epichile) full of a liquid,
   and later exit through a small lateral passage, thus removing the
   pollinarium. In C. macrantha, ants, nectaries, trichomes, osmophores,
   bees and stomata were observed and relationships between them were
   investigated.
   Coryanthes is one of the most fascinating genera of Stanhopeinae
   (Orchidaceae) because of its complex pollination mechanism and the
   peculiar structures of its flowers. Although Coryanthes macrantha is
   widely studied, investigation of the secretory structures and floral
   biology is important to understand the mechanisms and ecology of
   pollination, which deserve attention despite the difficulties of
   collecting fertile material in nature. We conducted a morpho-anatomical
   analysis of the floral and extrafloral secretory structures of C.
   macrantha to better understand the secretory structures, contribute to
   the knowledge of its floral biology and/or pollination processes and
   understand the ecological function of these structures. The analysis
   revealed that C. macrantha has epidermal osmophores with unicellular
   papillae that were foraged by male Eulaema bees, floral nectaries in the
   sepals and extrafloral nectaries in the bracts. In both the floral and
   extrafloral nectaries, the nectar is exuded by the stomata. Azteca ants
   foraged the bract and sepal nectaries in pre-anthesis and post-anthesis.
   We also described the secretory epidermis of pleuridia, and the mode of
   secretion of osmophores and nectaries and found that they attract
   specific foraging agents.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Giant kelp forests off the west coast of North America are maintained
   primarily by sea otter (Enhydra lutris) and sunflower sea star
   (Pycnopodia helianthoides) predation of sea urchins. Human hunting of
   sea otters in historical times, together with a marine heat wave and sea
   star wasting disease epidemic in the past decade, devastated these
   predators, leading to widespread occurrences of urchin barrens. Since
   the late Neogene, species of the megaherbivorous sirenian Hydrodamalis
   ranged throughout North Pacific giant kelp forests. The last species, H.
   gigas, was driven to extinction by human hunting in the mid-eighteen
   century. H. gigas was an obligate kelp canopy browser, and its body size
   implies that it would have had a significant impact on the system. Here,
   we hypothesize that sea cow browsing may have enhanced forest
   resilience. We tested this hypothesis with a mathematical model,
   comparing historical and modern community responses to marine heat waves
   and sea star wasting disease. Results indicate that forest communities
   were highly resistant to marine heat waves, yet susceptible to sea star
   wasting disease, and to disease in combination with warming. Resistance
   was greatest among systems with both sea cows and sea otters present.
   The model additionally predicts that historical communities may have
   exhibited delayed transitions after perturbation and faster recovery
   times. Sea cow browsing may therefore have enhanced resilience against
   modern perturbations. We propose that operationalizing these findings by
   mimicking sea cow herbivory could enhance kelp forest resilience.},

   Reserve, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Conflicts between humans and Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are
   widespread in Asia and pose challenges to human-bear coexistence.
   Identifying effective mitigation measures requires a thorough
   understanding of human-bear conflicts (HBC). We assessed
   spatial-temporal patterns of HBC and their impact factors around the
   Baoshan Section of the Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve (GNNR) between 2012
   and 2020. The results suggested that crop raiding by bears occurred most
   commonly, followed by beehive loss, livestock depredation, and human
   casualties. HBC hotspots occurred near the protected area where local
   people frequently encountered bears. The landscapes with lower elevation
   and human density were at higher risk of HBC. Furthermore, villages with
   more fragmented forests or less fragmented croplands were more
   vulnerable to HBC. The differences in agricultural structures
   contributed to the diverse composition of HBC between the two regions.
   In addition, crop raiding by bears decreased significantly, probably due
   to the changing landscape composition and configuration derived from
   human behaviors, yet livestock depredation and beehive loss increased.
   Our findings indicated the complex interrelationship between the
   environment, bears, and humans, which could guide the implementation of
   mitigation measures. We recommend multiple approaches based on a
   social-ecological system to mitigate HBC.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of dispersal network heterogeneity on ecosystem
   stability in rock-paper-scissors games},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Intransitive competition, typically represented by the classic
   rock-paper-scissors game, provides an endogenous mechanism promoting
   species coexistence. As well known, species dispersal and interaction in
   nature might occur on complex patch networks, with species interacting
   in diverse ways. However, the effects of different interaction modes,
   combined with spatial heterogeneity in patch connectivities, have not
   been well integrated into our general understanding of how stable
   coexistence emerges in cyclic competition. We thus incorporate network
   heterogeneity into the classic rock-paper-scissors game, in order to
   compare ecosystem stability under two typical modes of interaction:
   species compete to fill empty sites, and species seize each other's
   colony sites. On lattice-structured regular networks, the two
   interaction modes produce similar stability patterns through forming
   conspecific clusters to reduce interspecific competition. However, for
   heterogeneous networks, the interaction modes have contrasting effects
   on ecosystem stability. Specifically, if species compete for colony
   sites, increasing network heterogeneity stabilizes competitive dynamics.
   When species compete to fill empty sites, an increase in network
   heterogeneity leads to larger population fluctuations and therefore a
   higher risk of stochastic extinctions, in stark contrast to current
   knowledge. Our findings strongly suggest that particular attention
   should be devoted to testing which mode of interaction is more
   appropriate for modeling a given system.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the main restrictive elements in
   terrestrial ecosystems, which have an important role in determining the
   community composition of plants and soil microorganisms. However, there
   is still a lack of understanding about whether plant and soil microbes
   respond synchronously to external N and P addition deposition,
   particularly on a short time scale (< 1 year). Here, we conducted a
   short-term experiment (3 months) involving control, N addition, P
   addition, and N + P addition in an alpine grassland on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Responses of plant and soil microbial
   (bacterial and fungal) communities were analyzed using the quadrat
   method and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. N addition
   significantly increased aboveground biomass and changed the plant
   community composition, but had no significant effect on soil microbes.
   Thus, microbial and plant processes were asynchronous following the
   resource availability in this alpine meadow. According to our research,
   the plant community may react to short-term nutrient deposition more
   quickly than the soil microbial community.},

Title = {Can urban green space water planes be quantified? A new way of thinking
   about landscape planning and design},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Water bodies in urban green spaces are important parts of urban
   landscapes, and their planar shapes are an important factor governing
   the creation of waterfront landscapes. To improve the aesthetics and
   functionality of water bodies, this paper takes Nanjing as an example
   for analysis to investigate whether it is possible to scientifically
   quantify the planar shape of urban green space water bodies. First,
   water bodies meeting the conditions within the municipal area were
   selected as the study objects for classification. Second, in view of the
   lack of theoretical and innovative problems in previous studies, the use
   of fractal theory was proposed to improve the scientificity. Finally,
   remote sensing data images were used to extract water body planes, and
   the fractal dimensions were calculated and quantitatively evaluated by
   coupling the box dimension method with fractal theory. The results show
   that the fractal dimension could be used as a quantitative parameter to
   determine the planar morphology of water bodies in urban green spaces,
   and the fractal dimension value is positively correlated with the
   complexity of the water body, which can be used for both quantitative
   assessment of the landscape aesthetics of existing water bodies in urban
   green spaces and theoretical support for the future design of water
   planar morphology.},

Title = {The effect of urban environments on the diversity of plants in unmanaged
   grasslands in Los Angeles, United States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Urbanization is a strong driver of plant diversity and may have complex
   effects on developed ecosystems. Nevertheless, it remains unclear
   whether urban environments increase or decrease plant biodiversity
   compared with rural environments. Further, it is also unclear how
   non-native plant species contribute to spatial diversity patterns and
   ecosystem services. Better understanding these diversity drivers across
   gradients of urbanization has the potential to enhance native species
   conservation (e.g., targeted restoration activities), leading to
   positive feedbacks for broader promotion of biodiversity and societal
   benefits (e.g., links with native biodiversity and human health). In
   this study, we hypothesized that for plant species in unmanaged
   grasslands, urbanization would lead to declines in diversity at both
   small and medium scales. We established a network of remnant grassland
   sites across an urban to rural gradient in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Across
   this gradient we assessed patterns of alpha and beta diversity during
   the 2019 growing season. We found that local plant alpha diversity in
   remnant grasslands declined in urban landscapes (measured by surrounding
   percent development) due mostly to loss of native species. However, at
   intermediate scales across unmanaged parks and greenspaces, we saw
   increases in beta diversity at more urban locations. This was possibly
   due to the patchy dominance of different exotic species at urban
   locations; whereas, in rural locations non-native and native species
   were common across plots. Conservation is often informed by examinations
   of large scale, city-wide assessment of diversity, however, our results
   show that urban plant diversity, particularly native species, is
   affected at all spatial scales and beta-diversity can add important
   insights into how to manage urban ecosystems. Conservation that accounts
   for alpha and beta diversity may promote ``virtuous cycle `` frameworks
   where the promotion and protection of biodiversity simultaneously
   reduces the negative effects of invasion.},

Title = {The importance of wild resources as a reflection of the resilience and
   changing nature of early agricultural systems in East Asia and Europe},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {We examine the changing importance of wild starch rich plant staples,
   predominantly tree nuts, in early agricultural societies in East Asia
   and Europe, focusing on Korea, Japan, and Britain. A comparative review
   highlights variations in the importance of wild plant staples compared
   to domesticated crops. The Korean Middle to Late Chulmun periods (c.
   3,500-1,500 BC) was characterized by a high reliance on nuts alongside
   millet. This declines with the transition to rice agriculture, but
   remains significant during the Mumun period (c. 1,500-300 BC). In Japan,
   the arrival of rice and millets in the Yayoi Period (c. 1,000 BC-250 AD)
   saw continued evidence for high levels of reliance on wild resources,
   which declines only in the Kofun and early historical periods. In Early
   Neolithic Britain (c. 4,000-3,300 BC) cereal agriculture is accompanied
   by high evidence for wild plant foods. But during the Middle to Late
   Neolithic (3,300-c. 2,400/2,200 BC) cereals were abandoned on the
   mainland with hazelnuts becoming a prominent plant staple. Agriculture
   returned in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, followed by a
   strong decline in wild plant food use during the Middle to Late Bronze
   Age (1,700-700 BC). Such patterns have previously been attributed to the
   slow adoption of farming by indigenous peoples, with a continued
   reliance on wild resources. In light of evidence demonstrating that the
   dispersal of agriculture was largely driven by a mixture of
   demic-diffusion and introgression of hunter-gatherers into agricultural
   groups, a reinterpretation of the role of wild foods is needed. It is
   argued that the relative importance of wild plant staples provides an
   indicator of the stability and dependability of agricultural and social
   systems. A heavy reliance on wild foods in early agricultural societies
   is tied to the slow adaptation of domesticated crops to new
   environments, where agricultural and social landscapes are yet to be
   firmly established, and social systems that could mitigate for poor
   harvests and storage were often absent. The retained lengthy persistence
   of wild plant staples in East Asian subsistence systems compared to the
   British Isles likely reflects differences in the ecological and labor
   demands for rice compared to Western Asiatic cereals.},

Title = {Polymorphic scent gland secretions in Nelima harvestmen: ``Sclerosomatid

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {The scent glands of harvestmen (Opiliones) produce secretions of
   taxon-specific composition. One class of compounds, assumed to be a key
   group in opilionid chemosystematics and prevalent among sclerosomatid
   Eupnoi, was termed ``sclerosomatid compounds{''} (SCs). Known compounds
   of this group comprise acyclic 4-methyl-branched ethyl-ketones and
   -alcohols as well as 2,4-dimethyl-branched primary alcohols and
   aldehydes, originally described from several species of North American
   Leiobuninae. We analyzed the scent gland secretions of Nelima ssp.
   (Sclerosomatidae, Leiobuninae) from two continents by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, NMR, stereoselective synthesis, and
   chiral chromatography. We found a surprising chemical dichotomy: while
   North American N. paesserli produced typical acyclic SCs such as
   (E)-4-methyl-4-hexen-3-one, the secretions of European Nelima species
   exhibited a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, namely
   (R)-2-methyl-1-phenyl-pentan-3-one (MPP), 4-phenyl-2-butanone (PB),
   2-phenylacetamide (PA), as well as (2R,4R)-2,4-dimethylhexanoic acid
   (DHA), all of which are new for the secretions of harvestmen.
   Remarkably, in N. sempronii, the secretions of juveniles (containing PB)
   differed from the secretions of adults (containing MPP and DHA). Though
   the chemistry of European Nelima species clearly diverged at first
   sight, all compounds detected either possess specific chemical motifs
   that allow an assignment to the class of SCs or appear to be
   biochemically/ontogenetically connected to SC-components. Thus, we here
   add novel compounds to the pool of SCs along with an extension of the
   definition of SCs to include aromatic compounds with SC-motifs.
   Furthermore, we describe a first case of juvenile-adult polymorphism for
   the exocrine secretions of harvestmen and provide a scheme of how
   secretions are regenerated.},

Title = {Experimental test of the contributions of initial variation and new
   mutations to adaptive evolution in a novel environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Experimental evolution is an approach that allows researchers to study
   organisms as they evolve in controlled environments. Despite the growing
   popularity of this approach, there are conceptual gaps among projects
   that use different experimental designs. One such gap concerns the
   contributions to adaptation of genetic variation present at the start of
   an experiment and that of new mutations that arise during an experiment.
   The primary source of genetic variation has historically depended
   largely on the study organisms. In the long-term evolution experiment
   (LTEE) using Escherichia coli, for example, each population started from
   a single haploid cell, and therefore, adaptation depended entirely on
   new mutations. Most other microbial evolution experiments have followed
   the same strategy. By contrast, evolution experiments using
   multicellular, sexually reproducing organisms typically start with
   preexisting variation that fuels the response to selection. New
   mutations may also come into play in later generations of these
   experiments, but it is generally difficult to quantify their
   contribution in these studies. Here, we performed an experiment using E.
   coli to compare the contributions of initial genetic variation and new
   mutations to adaptation in a new environment. Our experiment had four
   treatments that varied in their starting diversity, with 18 populations
   in each treatment. One treatment depended entirely on new mutations,
   while the other three began with mixtures of clones, whole-population
   samples, or mixtures of whole-population samples from the LTEE. We
   tracked a genetic marker associated with different founders in two
   treatments. These data revealed significant variation in fitness among
   the founders, and that variation impacted evolution in the early
   generations of our experiment. However, there were no differences in
   fitness among the treatments after 500 or 2,000 generations in the new
   environment, despite the variation in fitness among the founders. These
   results indicate that new mutations quickly dominated, and eventually
   they contributed more to adaptation than did the initial variation. Our

Abstract = {Complex genetic and phenotypic relationships are theorized to link
   different fitness components but revealing the correlations occurring
   among disparate traits requires large datasets of pedigreed populations.
   In particular, the association between traits beneficial to social
   dominance with health and fitness could be antagonistic, because of
   trade-offs, or positive, because of greater resource acquisition by
   dominant individuals. Studies investigating these relationships found
   some empirical evidence in support of both theories, mainly using
   multiple trait models (MTM). However, if a trait giving a social
   advantage is suspected to affect the expression of other traits, MTM
   could provide some bias, that structural equation models (SEM) could
   highlight. We used Aosta Chestnut-Black Pied cattle to investigate
   whether the fighting ability of cows (the capability of winning social
   dominance interactions) is genetically correlated with health and
   fitness traits. We ran both MTM and SEM using a Gibbs sampling algorithm
   to disentangle the possible causal effects of fighting ability from the
   genetic correlations that this trait shares with other traits:
   individual milk yield, somatic cells (representing mammary health),
   fertility, and longevity. We found antagonistic genetic correlations,
   similar under both approaches, for fighting ability vs. milk, somatic
   cells, and fertility, Accordingly, we found only a slight causal effects
   of fighting ability on these traits (-0.012 to 0.059 in standardized
   value). However, we found genetic correlations opposite in sign between
   fighting ability and longevity under MTM (0.237) and SEM (-0.183),
   suggesting a strong causal effect (0.386 standardized) of fighting
   ability on longevity. In other words, MTM found a positive correlation
   between longevity and fighting ability, while SEM found a negative
   correlation. The explanation could be that for economic reasons dominant
   cows are kept in this population for longer, thus attaining greater
   longevity: using MTM, the economic importance of competitions probably
   covers the true genetic correlation among traits. This artificially
   simulates a natural situation where an antagonistic genetic correlation
   between longevity and fighting ability appears positive under MTM due to
   a non-genetic advantage obtained by the best fighters. The use of SEM to
   properly assess the relationships among traits is suggested in both
   evolutionary studies and animal breeding.},

Title = {Assessing the impact of forest structure disturbances on the arboreal
   movement and energetics of orangutans-An agent-based modeling approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Agent-based models have been developed and widely employed to assess the
   impact of disturbances or conservation management on animal habitat use,
   population development, and viability. However, the direct impacts of
   canopy disturbance on the arboreal movement of individual primates have
   been less studied. Such impacts could shed light on the cascading
   effects of disturbances on animal health and fitness. Orangutans are an
   arboreal primate that commonly encounters habitat quality deterioration
   due to land-use changes and related disturbances such as forest fires.
   Forest disturbance may, therefore, create a complex stress scenario
   threatening orangutan populations. Due to forest disturbances,
   orangutans may adapt to employ more terrestrial, as opposed to arboreal,
   movements potentially prolonging the search for fruiting and nesting
   trees. In turn, this may lead to changes in daily activity patterns
   (i.e., time spent traveling, feeding, and resting) and available energy
   budget, potentially decreasing the orangutan's fitness. We developed the
   agent-based simulation model BORNEO (arBOReal aNimal movEment mOdel),
   which explicitly describes both orangutans' arboreal and terrestrial
   movement in a forest habitat, depending on distances between trees and
   canopy structures. Orangutans in the model perform activities with a
   motivation to balance energy intake and expenditure through locomotion.
   We tested the model using forest inventory data obtained in Sebangau
   National Park, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This allowed us to
   construct virtual forests with real characteristics including tree
   connectivity, thus creating the potential to expand the environmental
   settings for simulation experiments. In order to parameterize the energy
   related processes of the orangutans described in the model, we applied a
   computationally intensive evolutionary algorithm and evaluated the
   simulation results against observed behavioral patterns of orangutans.
   Both the simulated variability and proportion of activity budgets
   including feeding, resting, and traveling time for female and male
   orangutans confirmed the suitability of the model for its purpose. We
   used the calibrated model to compare the activity patterns and energy
   budgets of orangutans in both natural and disturbed forests . The
   results confirm field observations that orangutans in the disturbed
   forest are more likely to experience deficit energy balance due to
   traveling to the detriment of feeding time. Such imbalance is more
   pronounced in males than in females. The finding of a threshold of
   forest disturbances that affects a significant change in activity and
   energy budgets suggests potential threats to the orangutan population.
   Our study introduces the first agent-based model describing the arboreal
   movement of primates that can serve as a tool to investigate the direct
   impact of forest changes and disturbances on the behavior of species
   such as orangutans. Moreover, it demonstrates the suitability of
   high-performance computing to optimize the calibration of complex
   agent-based models describing animal behavior at a fine spatio-temporal
   scale (1-m and 1-s granularity).},

Title = {Spatiotemporal relationship characteristic of climate comfort of urban
   human settlement environment and population density in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization in China has caused substantial changes in the urban
   climate, leading to accelerated shifts in the climate comfort of the
   human settlement environment. In addition, in certain regions of China,
   a glaring disproportion exists in the distribution of population to the
   available area. Therefore, the climate comfort of such areas needs to be
   improved to enhance their habitability. In this study, we explored the
   spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the climate comfort of the
   urban human settlement environment in China from 2000 to 2015, based on
   a three-level time scale of year, month, and day using the temperature
   and humidity index and wind efficiency index. In addition, the
   population density in China was calculated by employing the population
   grid spatial calculation method. Subsequently, we compared and analyzed
   the spatiotemporal relationship characteristics between the climate
   comfort of the urban human settlement environment and population
   density. Our results indicated that (1) the extremely cold area was the
   largest, followed by the cold area, with the comfort area being the
   smallest. The area range of climate comfort and cold expanded northward,
   whereas the extremely cold area shrank from 2000 to 2015. (2) The
   duration of the comfort month and comfort day in southern China was
   higher than that in northern China. The climate comfort area of 3-4
   months was the largest, and that of 7-12 months was the smallest, with
   the largest climate comfort area being 66-130 days and the smallest
   being 196-325 days. (3) The spatial difference in the climate comfort
   month was greater than that in the daily change, and the evolution
   process of various regions became relatively complex over time. The
   spatiotemporal evolution of the climate comfort day showed minimal
   change in northwest, north, and northeast China, whereas it changed
   significantly in southwest, south, central, and east China. These
   results imply that the population density in the country is generally
   concentrated in the climate comfort areas.},

Title = {Turn-taking skills in mammals: A systematic review into development and
   acquisition},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {How human language evolved remains one of the most intriguing questions
   in science, and different approaches have been used to tackle this
   question. A recent hypothesis, the Interaction Engine Hypothesis,
   postulates that language was made possible through the special capacity
   for social interaction involving different social cognitive skills
   (e.g., joint attention, common ground) and specific characteristics such
   as face-to-face interaction, mutual gaze and turn-taking, the exchange
   of rapid communicative turns. Recently, it has been argued that this
   turn-taking infrastructure may be a foundational and ancient mechanism
   of the layered system of language because communicative turn-taking has
   been found in human infants and across several non-human primate
   species. Moreover, there is some evidence for turn-taking in different
   mammalian taxa, especially those capable of vocal learning.
   Surprisingly, however, the existing studies have mainly focused on
   turn-taking production of adult individuals, while little is known about
   its emergence and development in young individuals. Hence, the aim of
   the current paper was 2-fold: First, we carried out a systematic review
   of turn-taking development and acquisition in mammals to evaluate
   possible research bias and existing gaps. Second, we highlight research
   avenues to spur more research into this domain and investigate if
   distinct turn-taking elements can be found in other non-human animal
   species. Since mammals exhibit an extended development period, including
   learning and strong parental care, they represent an excellent model
   group in which to investigate the acquisition and development of
   turn-taking abilities. We performed a systematic review including a wide
   range of terms and found 21 studies presenting findings on turn-taking
   abilities in infants and juveniles. Most of these studies were from the
   last decade, showing an increased interest in this field over the years.
   Overall, we found a considerable variation in the terminologies and
   methodological approaches used. In addition, studies investigating
   turn-taking abilities across different development periods and in
   relation to different social partners were very rare, thereby hampering
   direct, systematic comparisons within and across species. Nonetheless,
   the results of some studies suggested that specific turn-taking elements
   are innate, while others are acquired during development (e.g.,
   flexibility). Finally, we pinpoint fruitful research avenues and
   hypotheses to move the field of turn-taking development forward and
   improve our understanding of the impact of turn-taking on language
   evolution.},

Title = {The effect of road-based mortality on a local population of newts along
   a narrow two-lane road in California},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have documented high numbers of amphibians killed by
   vehicular strikes on roads. This direct mortality can cause population
   declines and extirpations, but in some cases the declines might be
   masked, initially, by large population sizes. Population viability
   analysis can help discern population trajectories and identify incipient
   declines. We applied this tool to a situation in Santa Clara County,
   California where a dead-on-the-road carcass survey in 2017 demonstrated
   that a large number of newts in the genus Taricha were being killed by
   vehicles using a small two-lane road (Alma Bridge Road) most likely
   during annual breeding migrations to a local reservoir (Lexington
   Reservoir). To help determine the effect of this road-based mortality on
   the California newt (T. torosa) population, we conducted a drift
   fence/pitfall trap array study on the road during the 2020-2021 breeding
   season. Drift fence/pitfall trap arrays were installed at six locations
   along a 6.6-km stretch of the road and daily surveys were conducted at
   these arrays over a 148-day period from mid-November to end of March.
   Daily traffic and precipitation data were also recorded to help inform
   timing of proposed mitigation efforts. Concurrently, a group of
   community scientists conducted a dead-on-the-road carcass survey over
   the entire 6.6-km study area. We calculated the number of adult newts
   attempting to cross Alma Bridge Road at the arrays and the associated
   road-based mortality rates. Then, we combined our array results with
   road mortality data provided by the community scientists to estimate the
   number of adult California newts attempting to cross the road and their
   mortality rates over the entire study area during the survey period. We
   then incorporated this data into a population viability model to
   determine whether this road-based mortality rate might, if left
   unabated, lead to a reduction in, and possibly the eventual extirpation
   of, the local population of T. torosa breeding in Lexington Reservoir.
   The model indicated that this population would be extirpated in
   approximately 92 years. Because the road has been in use for
   approximately 67 years, we discussed the possible reasons why this
   population is currently extant and experiencing this high level of
   road-based mortality.},

   annual changes responding to climate change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Examining vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) changes is important to
   understanding wetland carbon sequestration. Here, we combined the
   field-measured AGB data (458 samples) from 2009 to 2021, moderate
   resolution imaging spectroradiometer reflectance products, and climatic
   data to reveal the AGB variations of marshes in Northeast China by
   comparing various models driven by different indicators. The results
   indicated that random forest model driven by six vegetation indices,
   land surface temperature, and land surface water index achieved accurate
   marsh AGB estimation with R-2 being 0.78 and relative error being
   16.71\%. The mean marsh AGB in Northeast China from 2000 to 2021 was
   682.89 +/- 31.69 g center dot m(-2), which generally increased from
   north to south in space. Temporally, annual marsh AGB declined slowly at
   a rate of 3.45 g center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) during the past 21
   years driven mainly by the decrease in summer mean temperature that was
   characterized by a significantly positive correlation between them.
   Nevertheless, we highlighted that the temporal changes of marsh AGB
   spatially varied in response to inconsistent climate change, thus
   place-based measures are required for sustainable management of marshes.},

Title = {Period-oriented spatial comparative evaluation of biodiversity
   conservation effectiveness in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {The period-oriented comparative evaluation of biodiversity conservation
   effectiveness is the main basis for implementing the transfer payment
   policy of ecological compensation. In response to the lack of such a
   spatial comparative assessment system, the paper proposes a method to
   construct the period conservation effectiveness index (PCEI) and applies
   it to the spatial comparative assessment of Chinese biodiversity
   conservation effectiveness in three periods from 1990 to 2015, while
   validating the rationality of the reference. The results show that (1)
   spatially, the biodiversity conservation effectiveness of key ecological
   function areas (KEFAs) in Central China and South China is better, while
   Southwest and Northwest are in the middle, and East China and Northeast
   are worse; (2) temporally, the biodiversity conservation effectiveness
   of KEFAs as a whole is worse from 1990 to 2000, best from 2000 to 2010,
   and middle from 2010 to 2015; (3) The existing reference establishment
   methods can reflect the spatial differences of natural environment
   background, which effectively support the spatial comparison assessment
   of biodiversity conservation effectiveness. This study constructs a
   spatial comparison assessment system of biodiversity conservation
   effectiveness within periods, which can provide a scientific basis for
   national and even global large-scale ecological compensation and other
   fund allocation methods.},

Title = {Sexual and natural selection interplay in sexual head shape dimorphism
   of two sympatric racerunners (Squamata: Lacertidae)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Both natural and sexual selection can shape sexual dimorphism. However,
   determination of the contribution of these selection pressures is
   challenging. In lizards, sexual selection can contribute to the larger
   head size of males than that of females. However, males and females can
   also diverge in their head size to prey on different food resources
   under conditions of limited resources (and/or high competitors). Here,
   109 individuals from two sympatric desert racerunners (Eremias grammica:
   28 males and 30 females; Eremias velox: 25 males and 26 females) were
   studied to determine their sexual head shape (head length, width, and
   depth). Additionally, 191 and 169 feces samples of E. grammica and E.
   velox, respectively, were collected to assess the niche divergence
   hypothesis (a proxy for natural selection). We found that both species
   had dimorphic head shapes; male heads (i.e., length, width, and depth)
   were significantly larger than female heads (P < 0.05, in all cases) in
   E. grammica, and male heads of E. velox were significantly longer than
   those of females (P < 0.05). Chi-square test revealed that there were
   significant differences in the proportion (Hymenopteran and Orthopteran)
   and sizes of prey type between the two sexes of E. grammica; conspecific
   males and females of E. velox differed in the proportion of Coleopteran
   and Hymenopteran prey. Both males and females of these two species had a
   high niche overlap index (range from similar to 0.78 to 0.99) with each
   other. There were also significant differences in the sizes of the heads
   and prey between the two species (P < 0.05). However, the interspecific
   differences were mainly caused by interspecific male-male differences in
   morphological and prey traits. In summary, we believe that both natural
   (pressures from resource competition) and sexual selection drive sexual
   head shape dimorphism in these two sympatric lizards, owing to high food
   resource competition in arid regions. Therefore, head trait divergence
   can reduce competition by resulting in a preference for different prey
   types.},

Title = {Extreme climate and crime: Empirical evidence based on 129
   prefecture-level cities in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Climate change is having profound effects on natural and socio-economic
   systems, especially via extreme climate events. Using panel data from
   129 prefectural-level cities in China from 2013 to 2019, this paper
   explores the effects of extreme climate on crime rates based on a
   climate index and manual collection of crime data. The results showed
   that extreme climate has a significant positive effect on crime rates,
   increasing by 0.035\% for every 1\% increase in the extreme climate
   index. This occurs through two mechanistic pathways: reduced
   agricultural output and lower employment income. The heterogeneity
   analysis shows that extreme climate has a greater impact on crime rates
   in eastern areas which are economically developed and have high levels
   of immigration. This study provides new perspectives on the impact of
   extreme climate on the economy and society, in which governments can
   actively participate in climate governance through environmental
   protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, and
   technological innovation to reduce crime rates by reducing the
   occurrence of extreme climate.},

Title = {Karst tiankeng create a unique habitat for the survival of soil
   microbes: Evidence from ecoenzymatic stoichiometry},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Clarifying the soil microbial metabolism and resource limitations could
   help to understand the functions and processes of aboveground
   ecosystems, as well as to predict ecosystem stability under global
   climate change. Karst tiankeng is a kind of large-scale negative surface
   terrain on the surface which is similar to an oasis in degraded karst
   landscapes, but their soil microbial resource limitations still unclear.
   In this study, we evaluated and compared the soil microbial resource
   limitation in non-degraded tiankeng (NDT), moderately degraded tiankeng
   (MDT), heavily degraded tiankeng (HDT), and outside tiankeng (OT) by
   calculating soil ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. Overall, soil microbial
   communities were more limited by C and P in karst tiankeng ecosystem.
   The soil microbial C and P limitations significantly differed with the
   karst tiankeng degradation increased, and the lowest C and P limitations
   were observed in NDT. The higher microbial C and P limitations were
   observed in OT. Linear regression and redundancy analysis indicated that
   soil microbial C and P limitations were significantly influenced by soil
   nutrients. Karst tiankeng degradation influence the biogeochemical cycle
   and function of karst tiankeng systems. Our results highlight that karst
   tiankeng (especially the NDT) can provide a stable habitat for the
   survival of microorganisms in karst areas. Karst tiankeng is essential
   for regional ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Pre-Columbian cultivation of vegetatively propagated and fruit tree
   tropical crops in the Atacama Desert},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {South America is a megadiverse continent that witnessed the
   domestication, translocation and cultivation of various plant species
   from seemingly contrasting ecosystems. It was the recipient and supplier
   of crops brought to and from Mesoamerica (such as maize and cacao,
   respectively), and Polynesia to where the key staple crop sweet potato
   was exported. Not every instance of the trans-ecological expansion of
   cultivated plants (both domesticated and wild), however, resulted in
   successful farming. Here, we review the transregional circulation and
   introduction of five food tropical crops originated in the tropical and
   humid valleys of the eastern Andes-achira, cassava, ahipa, sweet potato,
   and pacay-to the hyper-arid coastal valleys of the Atacama Desert of
   northern Chile, where they have been found in early archeological sites.
   By means of an evaluation of the contexts of their deposition and
   supported by direct radiocarbon dating, stable isotopes analyses, and
   starch grain analysis, we evaluate different hypotheses for explaining
   their introduction and adaptation to the hyper-arid soils of northern
   Chile, by societal groups that after the introduction of cultigens still
   retained a strong dependence on marine hunting, gathering and fishing
   ways of life based on wide variety of marine coast resources. Many of
   the studied plants were part of a broader package of introduced goods
   and technological devices and procedures, linked to food, therapeutic
   medicine, social and ritual purposes that transformed previous
   hunter-gatherer social, economic, and ideological institutions. Based on
   archeological data, we discuss some of the possible socio-ecological
   processes involved in the development of agricultural landscapes
   including the adoption of tropical crops originated several hundred
   kilometers away from the Atacama Desert during the Late Holocene.},

Title = {Differential sensitivity of offspring from four species of goodeine
   freshwater fish to acute exposure to nitrates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) pollution related to anthropogenic activities
   is increasing in freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge about NO3-N
   sensitivity in freshwater wild fish is needed to understand the
   differential tolerance between species. Goodeinae is a subfamily of 41
   endemic fishes that inhabit central Mexico, with 33 species in the IUCN
   red list and three extinct. Distributional patterns suggest tolerant and
   sensitive goodeines related to the conservation gradient of freshwater
   ecosystems. Four species with a differential distribution and tolerance
   were selected to evaluate their physiological responses to NO3-N. Fish
   were exposed to different NO3-N concentrations for 96 h and the median
   lethal concentration (LC50) was determined. Swimming disorders plus gill
   and liver histopathological indexes were estimated and incorporated into
   an Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) for each species. Skiffia lermae
   (LC50 = 474.332 mg/L) and Xenotoca variata (LC50 = 520.273 mg/L) were
   more sensitive than Goodea atripinnis (LC50 = 953.049 mg/L) and
   Alloophorus robustus (LC50 = 1537.13 mg/L). The typical histological
   damage produced by NaNO3-N exposure was fusion of secondary lamellae in
   gills. This was present in all species and cellular degeneration was
   observed at the highest concentrations. Secondary lamellae aneurysms
   were only observed in G. atripinnis. Liver alterations included vascular
   dilation in hepatic sinusoids, hyperemia and nuclear hypertrophy; higher
   concentrations produced hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolation and reduced
   frequency of cell nuclei. Behavioral and histopathological alterations
   could explain the differential species sensitivity. The results suggest
   that species which preserve gill function and transfer the task of
   detoxification to the liver might have the best chance of surviving in
   polluted environments. Moreover, species previously considered as
   tolerant may be highly susceptible to NaNO3-N exposure. Therefore, it is
   necessary to closely monitor NaNO3-N concentrations in freshwater
   ecosystems and, if possible, reduce their levels to avoid the loss of
   wild populations.},

Title = {Neontological and paleontological congruence in the evolution of
   Podocarpaceae (coniferales) reproductive morphology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {IntroductionPodocarpaceae are a diverse, primarily tropical conifer
   family that commonly produce large leaves and highly reduced, fleshy
   seed cones bearing large seeds. These features may result from
   relatively recent adaptation to closed-canopy angiosperm forests and
   bird-mediated seed dispersal, although determining precisely when shifts
   in leaf and seed cone morphology occurred is difficult due to a sparse
   fossil record and relatively few surviving deep lineages. MethodsWe
   compare the fossil record of Podocarpaceae with results from ancestral
   state reconstruction methods and correlated character models using
   neontological data and a previously published molecular time-tree.
   ResultsAncestral state reconstructions suggest that small leaves, small
   seeds, and multi-seeded cones are ancestral in crown Podocarpaceae, with
   reduced cones bearing few seeds appearing in the Early Cretaceous and
   the correlated evolution of large leaves and large seeds occurring from
   the Late Cretaceous onwards. The exact timing of these shifts based on
   neontological data alone are poorly constrained, however, and estimates
   of leaf and seed size are imprecise. DiscussionThe fossil record is
   largely congruent with results based on the molecular time-tree, but
   provide important constraints on the range of leaf and seed sizes that
   were present in Cretaceous Podocarpaceae and the time by which changes
   in cone morphology and seed size likely occurred. We suggest in
   particular that reduced seed cones appeared in the Early Cretaceous and
   are linked to the contemporaneous diversification of small bodied
   avialans (birds), with shifts to larger seed sizes occurring after the
   Cretaceous in association with the spread of closed-canopy angiosperm
   forests.},

Title = {Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acid nitrogen reveals
   detrital support of microphytobenthos in the Dutch Wadden Sea benthic
   food web},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {The Wadden Sea is the world's largest intertidal ecosystem and provides
   vital food resources for a large number of migratory bird and fish
   species during seasonal stopovers. Previous work using bulk stable
   isotope analysis of carbon found that microphytobenthos (MPB) was the
   dominant resource fueling the food web with particulate organic matter
   making up the remainder. However, this work was unable to account for
   the trophic structure of the food web or the considerable increase in
   delta N-15 values of bulk tissue throughout the benthic food web
   occurring in the Eastern regions of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we
   combine compound-specific and bulk analytical stable isotope techniques
   to further resolve the trophic structure and resource use throughout the
   benthic food web in the Wadden Sea. Analysis of delta N-15 for trophic
   and source amino acids allowed for better identification of trophic
   relationships due to the integration of underlying variation in the
   nitrogen resources supporting the food web. Baseline-integrated trophic
   position estimates using glutamic acid (Glu) and phenylalanine (Phe)
   allow for disentanglement of baseline variations in underlying delta
   N-15 sources supporting the ecosystem and trophic shifts resulting from
   changes in ecological relationships. Through this application, we
   further confirmed the dominant ecosystem support by MPB-derived
   resources, although to a lesser extent than previously estimated. In
   addition to phytoplankton-derived particulate, organic matter and MPB
   supported from nutrients from the overlying water column there appears
   to be an additional resource supporting the benthic community. From the
   stable isotope mixing models, a subset of species appears to focus on
   MPB supported off recycled (porewater) N and/or detrital organic matter
   mainly driven by increased phenylalanine delta N-15 values. This
   additional resource within MPB may play a role in subsidizing the
   exceptional benthic productivity observed within the Wadden Sea
   ecosystem and reflect division in MPB support along green (herbivory)
   and brown (recycled/detrital) food web pathways.},

Abstract = {Microsatellite loci have been shown to vary according to environment. We

   a distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) to associate between allele
   length and habitat and climatic measures and found that geography and
   annual climate explained the significant variation in allele length. We
   also used additional measurements pertaining to demography,
   heterozygosity and allelic diversity to explore four different
   hypotheses that might explain the variations in allele length. Our
   results suggest that the changes we observed in allele lengths may not
   be purely random but could be influenced by the differential mutation
   rate and/or local environmental conditions operating at the different
   locations.},

Abstract = {Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) are important pollinators of wild and
   crop plants. Despite their importance in the process of fruit and seed
   production on crop sites, their activity may be impaired due to exposure
   to pesticides. This species has a yearly life cycle and colony success
   may rely on effective foraging of workers on ruderal plants late in
   summer when most crops are no longer flowering. In the current study, we
   investigated the effect of chronic exposure to Sulfoxaflor on aspects of
   the foraging behavior of bumble bees and whether Sulfoxaflor influences
   the body size of workers of B. terrestris in a crop landscape. We found
   that 2 weeks of continuous exposure to Sulfoxaflor influenced workers'
   foraging dynamics and collection of resources. However, there was no
   evidence that the 5 ppb dose of the pesticide impacted the ability of
   bees to handle flowers with different traits. Workers from colonies
   exposed to Sulfoxaflor were smaller. The effect on worker size may be
   explained as a consequence of the reduced pollen income per unit of
   worker foraging. Thus, if the effects of Sulfoxaflor applied directly to
   crops had the same effect as that observed on commercial bumble bees
   after our chronic exposure, it might negatively impact colony success
   due to the impact on pollen collection and the reduction in the size of
   workers.},

Title = {Producing non-steady-state gaits (starting, stopping, and turning) in a
   biologically realistic quadrupedal simulation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Multibody dynamic analysis (MDA) has become part of the standard toolkit
   used to reconstruct the biomechanics of extinct animals. However, its
   use is currently almost exclusively limited to steady state activities
   such as walking and running at constant velocity. If we want to
   reconstruct the full range of activities that a given morphology can
   achieve then we must be able to reconstruct non-steady-state activities
   such as starting, stopping, and turning. In this paper we demonstrate
   how we can borrow techniques from the robotics literature to produce
   gait controllers that allow us to generate non-steady-state gaits in a
   biologically realistic quadrupedal simulation of a chimpanzee. We use a
   novel proportional-derivative (PD) reach controller that can accommodate
   both the non-linear contraction dynamics of Hill-type muscles and the
   large numbers of both single-joint and two-joint muscles to allow us to
   define the trajectory of the distal limb segment. With defined
   autopodial trajectories we can then use tegotae style locomotor
   controllers that use decentralized reaction force feedback to control
   the trajectory speed in order to produce quadrupedal gait. This
   combination of controllers can generate starting, stopping, and turning
   kinematics, something that we believe has never before been achieved in
   a simulation that uses both physiologically realistic muscles and a high
   level of anatomical fidelity. The gait quality is currently relatively
   low compared to the more commonly used feedforward control methods, but
   this can almost certainly be improved in future by using more
   biologically based foot trajectories and increasing the complexity of
   the underlying model and controllers. Understanding these more complex
   gaits is essential, particularly in fields such as paleoanthropology
   where the transition from an ancestral hominoid with a diversified
   repertoire to a bipedal hominin is of such fundamental importance, and
   this approach illustrates one possible avenue for further research in
   this area.},

Title = {Clocks Ticking in the Dark: A Review of Biological Rhythms in
   Subterranean African Mole-Rats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Biological rhythms are rhythmic fluctuations of biological functions
   that occur in almost all organisms and on several time scales. These
   rhythms are generated endogenously and entail the coordination of
   physiological and behavioural processes to predictable, external
   environmental rhythms. The light-dark cycle is usually the most
   prominent environmental cue to which animals synchronise their rhythms.
   Biological rhythms are believed to provide an adaptive advantage to
   organisms. In the present review, we will examine the occurrence of
   circadian and seasonal rhythms in African mole-rats (family
   Bathyergidae). African mole-rats are strictly subterranean, they very
   rarely emerge aboveground and therefore, do not have regular access to
   environmental light. A key adaptation to their specialised habitat is a
   reduction in the visual system. Mole-rats exhibit both daily and
   seasonal rhythmicity in a range of behaviours and physiological
   variables, albeit to different degrees and with large variability. We
   review previous research on the entire circadian system of African
   mole-rats and discuss output rhythms in detail. Laboratory experiments
   imply that light remains the strongest zeitgeber for entrainment but in
   the absence of light, animals can entrain to ambient temperature
   rhythms. Field studies report that rhythmic daily and seasonal behaviour
   is displayed in their natural habitat. We suggest that ambient
   temperature and rainfall play an important role in the timing of
   rhythmic behaviour in mole-rats, and that they likely respond directly
   to these zeitgebers in the field rather than exhibit robust endogenous
   rhythms. In the light of climate change, these subterranean animals are
   buffered from the direct and immediate effects of changes in temperature
   and rainfall, partly because they do not have robust circadian rhythms,
   however, on a longer term they are vulnerable to changes in their food
   sources and dispersal abilities.},

   of Brahmaputra},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has experienced an increase in N
   deposition/input due to global change. However, it remains unclear how
   the responses and whether the responses of soil bacterial diversity to
   short-term N input are consistent at different levels. Here, we
   investigated soil bacterial species and phylogenetic alpha-diversity and
   community composition based on a short-term nitrogen input experiment
   (five levels: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g N m(-2) y(-1)) in an alpine steppe
   at the source of Brahmaputra, using high-throughput sequencing
   technology. Short-term nitrogen input did not affect the species
   alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of soil bacteria. However, soil
   bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity and dissimilarity increased with
   increasing nitrogen input. Different relative contributions and
   correlations of primary factors to species and phylogenetic diversity
   under short-term nitrogen input may result in different responses, in
   which ecological processes also play a role. Therefore, studying the
   response of soil bacteria to short-term nitrogen input should take into
   account not only the species level but also the phylogenetic level. We
   should pay close attention to the potential influence of short-term
   nitrogen deposition/fertilization on the soil bacterial community in the
   alpine steppe on the Tibetan Plateau.},

Title = {Effect of chronic traffic noise on behavior and physiology of plateau
   pikas (Ochotona curzoniae)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {During the last two decades, numerous studies have shown the effects of
   traffic noise on animal vocal communication. However, studies on the
   influences of traffic noise on wildlife behavior and physiology are
   scarce. In the present study, we experimentally manipulated the traffic
   noise exposure of plateau pika, a native small mammal widely distributed
   in the alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to explore the effects of
   traffic noise exposure on its behavior and physiology. We showed that
   noise exposure increased the pika's exploration and cortisol
   concentration (CORT) but decreased the resting metabolic rate (RMR). In
   addition, the relationships between RMR and exploration or CORT appeared
   under traffic noise treatment. This study suggests that traffic noise
   plays a large role in the behavior and physiology of plateau pikas and
   may have a long-term negative effect on the fitness of rodent
   populations. Generalizing these non-lethal effects to different taxa is
   crucial for the conservation and management of biodiversity in this
   increasingly noisy world.},

Title = {Predictors of sequence capture in a large-scale anchored phylogenomics
   project},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized
   phylogenomics by decreasing the cost and time required to generate
   sequence data from multiple markers or whole genomes. Further, the
   fragmented DNA of biological specimens collected decades ago can be
   sequenced with NGS, reducing the need for collecting fresh specimens.
   Sequence capture, also known as anchored hybrid enrichment, is a method
   to produce reduced representation libraries for NGS sequencing. The
   technique uses single-stranded oligonucleotide probes that hybridize
   with pre-selected regions of the genome that are sequenced via NGS,
   culminating in a dataset of numerous orthologous loci from multiple
   taxa. Phylogenetic analyses using these sequences have the potential to
   resolve deep and shallow phylogenetic relationships. Identifying the
   factors that affect sequence capture success could save time, money, and
   valuable specimens that might be destructively sampled despite low
   likelihood of sequencing success. We investigated the impacts of
   specimen age, preservation method, and DNA concentration on sequence
   capture (number of captured sequences and sequence quality) while
   accounting for taxonomy and extracted tissue type in a large-scale
   butterfly phylogenomics project. This project used two probe sets to
   extract 391 loci or a subset of 13 loci from over 6,000 butterfly
   specimens. We found that sequence capture is a resilient method capable
   of amplifying loci in samples of varying age (0-111 years), preservation
   method (alcohol, papered, pinned), and DNA concentration (0.020 ng/mu l
   - 316 ng/ul). Regression analyses demonstrate that sequence capture is
   positively correlated with DNA concentration. However, sequence capture
   and DNA concentration are negatively correlated with sample age and
   preservation method. Our findings suggest that sequence capture projects
   should prioritize the use of alcohol-preserved samples younger than 20
   years old when available. In the absence of such specimens, dried
   samples of any age can yield sequence data, albeit with returns that
   diminish with increasing age.},

Abstract = {Heritable genetic variation is a prerequisite for adaptive evolution;
   however, our knowledge about the heritability of plastic traits, such as

   involved in sexual selection. We recorded the songs of 81 males in a
   natural population and obtained various measures describing the
   frequency, temporal organization, and complexity of each song. As we had
   multiple songs from each individual, we were able to statistically
   account for the first time for the effect of within-individual variance
   on the heritability of song. Heritability was calculated from the
   variance estimates of animal models relying on a genetic similarity
   matrix based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism screening. Overall, we
   found small additive genetic variance and heritability values in all
   song traits, highlighting the role of environmental factors in shaping
   bird song.},

Title = {Accuracy of dental microwear impressions by physical properties of
   silicone materials},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Dental microwear analysis is an oft-used paleodietary estimation method,
   and the impression molds or resin casts are often analyzed rather than
   the original tooth surfaces. A choice of silicone products for dental
   impressions is crucial because the quality of microwear data is affected
   by the impression accuracy of the molds. For this reason, microwear
   researchers have heavily depended on a few commercial products such as
   ``President{''} (Coltene/Whaledent AG, Switzerland) to avoid analytical
   errors caused using different silicone materials. Considering that the
   production business might be terminated, however, heavy reliance on
   specific products could be a potential weakness in the field. In this
   study, we aimed at identifying specific indexes of physical properties
   of silicone materials with satisfactory accuracy. For this purpose, we
   measured dynamic viscoelasticity and shrinkage rates of various silicone
   compounds, including the standard impression material President and
   other eight affordable dental silicones. We scanned both original tooth
   surface and dental impression molds with a confocal laser microscope and
   conducted dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to quantitatively
   compare the scanned surfaces. The results showed relationships between
   the material properties of silicones and impression accuracy, indicating
   that the materials that cured slowly and began to shrink relatively
   early in the hardening process were less accurate. Some of these dental
   impression molds showed blurred surfaces, implying that molds were
   peeled off from the tooth surface at the microscopic level, as the
   shrinkage speed might exceed the curing speed. The following indices
   provided in the product information were found to be helpful in the
   search for substitutes: (1) medium viscosity, (2) short curing time
   after mixing (5-6 min), and (3) delayed change in shrinkage.},

Title = {Participatory management of weed infestation in Lake Tana-setting a
   better future in the front mirror},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Lake Tana is one of the biosphere reserves in Ethiopia registered by the
   United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
   (UNESCO). Water hyacinth is expanding in the lake owing to increased
   nutrient load from the watershed. As efforts from the government alone
   could not bring the anticipated change, local peoples' engagement and
   contribution are believed to sustainably and effectively manage the
   watershed and prevent the weed's spreading. This study, therefore, aims
   to estimate households' contribution (willingness to pay-WTP-and
   willingness to contribute labor-WTCL-) to prevent and control water
   hyacinth and hence improve lake ecosystem services through a
   hypothetical watershed management in Lake Tana. This study applied
   quantitative and qualitative methods. It was conducted among 560
   randomly selected households of the Libo-kemkem district using a
   contingent valuation method from March to April/2021. Eleven key
   informant interviews were also conducted. Bivariable and multivariable
   interval regression models were used to identify the determinants of
   households' potential contribution. Thematic analysis was used to
   analyze the qualitative data. As the weed is believed negatively impact
   the ecosystem services provided by the lake, 72\% of the respondents
   showed willingness to contribute to the proposed management program.
   About 32 and 39\% of the respondents were willing to pay in cash and to
   contribute labor, respectively, to prevent weed infestation. On the
   other hand, 28\% of them were neither willing to contribute in cash nor
   in labor to the hypothetical market. The findings showed respondents'
   mean annual WTP and WTCL were 632.8 Ethiopian birr and 30.1 man-days per
   household, respectively. The place of residence, educational status,
   farm plot area, household income, family size, and conference
   participation significantly influenced WTP and/or WTCL. In this
   hypothetical improvement scenario, an estimated annual WTP and WTCL of
   nearly 12 million Ethiopian birr and 700 man-days per year,
   respectively, are reported considering the total households in the study
   area. Therefore, collaborative efforts by different stakeholders are the
   next steps to realize the hypothetical contributions.},

Title = {High genetic connectivity among large populations of Pteronotus
   gymnonotus in bat caves in Brazil and its implications for conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Bat caves in the Neotropical region harbor exceptional bat populations
   (> 100,000 individuals). These populations play a wider role in
   ecological interactions, are vulnerable due to their restriction to
   caves, and have a disproportionate conservation value. Current knowledge
   of bat caves in Brazil is still small. However, systematic monitoring of
   some bat caves in northeastern Brazil shows that they experience strong
   population fluctuations over short periods of time, suggesting
   large-scale movements between roosts and a much broader use of the
   landscape than previously considered. Spatio-temporal reproductive
   connectivity between distant populations would change our understanding
   of the use of roosts among bat species in Brazil, and important gaps in
   knowledge of long-distance bat movements in the country would be filled.
   Here, we used ddRADseq data to analyze the genetic structure of
   Pteronotus gymnonotus across nine bat caves over 700 km. Our results
   indicate the lack of a clear geographic structure with gene flow among
   all the caves analyzed, suggesting that P. gymnonotus uses a network of
   bat caves geographically segregated hundreds of kilometers apart. Facing
   strong anthropogenic impacts and an underrepresentation of caves in
   conservation action plans worldwide, the genetic connectivity
   demonstrated here confirms that bat caves are priority sites for bat and
   speleological conservation in Brazil and elsewhere. Moreover, our
   results demonstrate a warning call: the applied aspects of the
   environmental licensing process of the mining sector and its impact must
   be reviewed, not only in Brazil, but wherever this licensing process
   affects caves having exceptional bat populations.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {From 2014 to 2022, we investigated the length of hibernation in a
   population of the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)
   (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Central Europe. Adults were collected
   during the autumn immigration to overwintering sites and placed in an
   artificial hibernaculum held in an unheated closed shelter. The
   following spring, the population was monitored for timing of emigration
   from this hibernaculum. In individual years, massive immigration took
   place between late September and late October and immigration lasted one
   to 3 days, each year. The main period of emigration from the
   hibernaculum (extending from the time that 25\% of adults departed the
   hibernaculum to the time that 75\% of the remaining individuals
   departed) occurred in individual years between mid-April and early May
   and lasted 8.0 +/- 1.3 days (mean +/- SE). Massive emigration activity
   followed a gradual period of increasing temperature. Although the dates
   of migration in some years, both autumn and spring, ranged over a period
   of 1 month, the overwintering period (from immigration to emigration of
   50\% of the population) was similar each year, 185.0 +/- 6.3 days (mean
   +/- SE). We hypothesize that the length of overwintering may be fixed by
   an intrinsic interval timer in H. axyridis adults. The internal timing
   of the end of hibernation may be advantageous in the cold temperate
   zone, where H. axyridis adults overwinter in buildings and are thus
   isolated from external photoperiodic and temperature stimuli that signal
   the end of the winter season.},

Title = {Pollinator movement activity influences genetic diversity and
   differentiation of spatially isolated populations of clonal forest herbs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {In agricultural landscapes, forest herbs live in small, spatially
   isolated forest patches. For their long-term survival, their populations
   depend on animals as genetic linkers that provide pollen- or
   seed-mediated gene flow among different forest patches. However, whether
   insect pollinators serve as genetic linkers among spatially isolated
   forest herb populations in agricultural landscapes remains to be shown.
   Here, we used population genetic methods to analyze: (A) the genetic
   diversity and genetic differentiation of populations of two common,
   slow-colonizing temperate forest herb species {[}Polygonatum multiflorum
   (L.) All. and Anemone nemorosa L.] in spatially isolated populations
   within three agricultural landscapes in Germany and Sweden and (B) the
   movement activity of their most relevant associated pollinator species,
   i.e., the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum (Scopoli, 1,763) and the hoverfly
   Melanostoma scalare (Fabricus, 1,794), respectively, which differ in
   their mobility. We tested whether the indicated pollinator movement
   activity affected the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of
   the forest herb populations. Bumblebee movement indicators that solely
   indicated movement activity between the forest patches affected both
   genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of the associated forest
   herb P. multiflorum in a way that can be explained by pollen-mediated
   gene flow among the forest herb populations. In contrast, movement
   indicators reflecting the total movement activity at a forest patch
   (including within-forest patch movement activity) showed unexpected
   effects for both plant-pollinator pairs that might be explained by
   accelerated genetic drift due to enhanced sexual reproduction. Our
   integrated approach revealed that bumblebees serve as genetic linkers of
   associated forest herb populations, even if they are more than 2 km
   apart from each other. No such evidence was found for the forest
   associated hoverfly species which showed significant genetic
   differentiation among forest patches itself. Our approach also indicated
   that a higher within-forest patch movement activity of both pollinator
   species might enhance sexual recruitment and thus diminishes the
   temporal buffer that clonal growth provides against habitat
   fragmentation effects.},

Title = {Limited evidence for phenological differences between non-native and
   native species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Although many species shift their phenology with climate change, species
   vary significantly in the direction and magnitude of these responses
   (i.e., phenological sensitivity). Studies increasingly detect early
   phenology or high phenological sensitivity to climate in non-native
   species, which may favor non-native species over natives in warming
   climates. Yet relatively few studies explicitly compare phenological
   responses to climate between native vs. non-native species or between
   non-native populations in the native vs. introduced range, limiting our
   ability to quantify the role of phenology in invasion success. Here, we
   review the empirical evidence for and against differences in phenology
   and phenological sensitivity to climate in both native vs. non-native
   species and native and introduced populations of non-native species.
   Contrary to common assumptions, native and non-native plant species did
   not consistently differ in mean phenology or phenological sensitivity.
   However, non-native plant species were often either just as or more
   sensitive, but rarely less sensitive, to climate as natives. Introduced
   populations of non-native plant species often show earlier reproduction
   than native populations of the same species, but there was mixed
   evidence for differences in phenological sensitivity between introduced
   and native plant populations. We found very few studies comparing native
   vs. invasive animal phenology. Future work should characterize
   phenological sensitivity to climate in native vs. non-native plant and
   animal species, in native vs. introduced populations of non-native
   species, and across different stages of invasion, and should carefully
   consider how differences in phenology might promote invasion success or
   disadvantage native species under climate change.},

Abstract = {Freshwater bodies are key in supporting aquatic and terrestrial life.
   Ecological balance of freshwater habitats is very vulnerable, hence,
   often significantly disrupted by climatic changes and anthropogenic
   acts. In Israel, due to its relatively arid climate, many freshwater
   resources have been disrupted and still are under great pressure. The
   Sea of Galilee is the largest surface freshwater body in the Middle East
   and a habitat to unique populations of several fishes, including six
   cichlid species. Studies on the ecology of these fish and their
   conservation require effective monitoring tools. In this study, a simple
   and efficient molecular method was developed to identify the species of
   these lake cichlids using high resolution melting analysis of mini DNA
   barcodes. The species of an individual sample can be identified by a
   single tube PCR reaction. This assay successfully identified sequence
   differences both among and within species. Here, this method identified
   the species for 279 small cichlid fry that could not be morphologically
   identified, allowing to estimate relative species abundance and map
   their distribution in time and location. The results are key to
   understand not only the ecology of young stages but also their
   recruitment potential to adult fish populations and their
   sustainability. This method can be readily implemented in further
   ecological studies and surveys related to these species, in the lake and
   its surroundings, as a tool to enhance understanding and protection of
   these species.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal patterns of microphytobenthos communities along the
   marine-terrestrial boundary in the German Wadden Sea},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPBs) are the main primary producers in shallow
   marine ecosystems, such as the Wadden Sea. We investigated the spatial
   and temporal dynamics of MPB communities across the marine-terrestrial
   boundary over three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) on three East
   Frisian Islands (Norderney, Spiekeroog, and Wangerooge) in the German
   Wadden Sea. Natural transects were compared with 12 experimental islands
   (salt marsh vegetated vs. initially bare islands) established on the
   tidal flats of Spiekeroog for studying dispersal-mediated community
   assembly. Sediment cores were taken along triplicate transects and on
   three elevation levels of the experimental islands, corresponding to the
   pioneer (pio) zone, the lower salt (LS) marsh, and the upper salt (US)
   marsh. On both the natural transects and the experimental islands, the
   highest MPB biomass was observed in the pio zone, where
   vegetation-driven sediment stabilization and high-mud content could have
   promoted MPB biomass in this marine-terrestrial transition zone. On the
   experimental islands, MPB biomass and diversity significantly decreased
   with elevation regardless of the season, indicating that the rarely
   submerged upper salt marsh level supported minimal MPB growth. The MPB
   biomass was also higher on initially vegetated than on bare islands,
   which was the most pronounced on the US level. On the tidal flat
   transects, the MPB biomass significantly increased with elevation up to
   the pio zone before decreasing again in the LS marsh. Temperature,
   sediment water content, and grain size significantly affected transect
   MPB biomass. MPB diversity, on the other hand, was not related to
   elevation but was rather determined by temperature, mean grain size, and
   mud content. Our study suggests that extending MPB studies into the
   ``terrestrial{''} domain of salt marshes enhances our understanding of
   the microalgae-plant interaction in this important boundary zone.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Biological particles suspended in the atmosphere have a crucial role in
   the dynamics of the biosphere underneath. Although much attention is
   paid for the chemical and physical properties of these particles, their
   biological taxonomic identity, which is relevant for ecological
   research, remains little studied. We took air samples at 300 meters
   above the forest in central Amazonia, in seven periods of 7 days, and
   used high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques to taxonomically identify
   airborne fungal and plant material. The use of a molecular
   identification technique improved taxonomic resolution when compared to
   morphological identification. This first appraisal of airborne diversity
   showed that fungal composition was strikingly different from what has
   been recorded in anthropogenic regions. For instance, basidiospores
   reached 30\% of the OTUs instead of 3-5\% as found in the literature;
   and the orders Capnodiales and Eurotiales-to which many allergenic fungi
   and crop pathogens belong-were much less frequently recorded than
   Pleosporales, Polyporales, and Agaricales. Plant OTUs corresponded
   mainly to Amazonian taxa frequently present in pollen records such as
   the genera Helicostilys and Cecropia and/or very abundant in the region
   such as Pourouma and Pouteria. The origin of extra-Amazonian plant
   material is unknown, but they belong to genera of predominantly
   wind-pollinated angiosperm families such as Poaceae and Betulaceae.
   Finally, the detection of two bryophyte genera feeds the debate about
   the role of long distance dispersal in the distribution of these plants.},

Title = {Multiscale spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of urban green space:
   Implications for green space planning in the rapid urbanizing Hefei
   City, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Under the pressure of rapid urbanization, the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   urban green spaces (UGS) have enormous impacts on the local ecological
   system and environment at different scales. In this study, UGS in Hefei
   City, which has experienced rapid urbanization from 1995 to 2015, were
   extracted based on time-series Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images,
   and different types of parks were mapped based on GF-2 images combined
   with multi-source metadata. Dynamic patterns of green space were
   examined by drawing the spatial variations of green space at the city,
   inner city, and park scales. Results revealed that: (1) At the city
   level, UGS decreased with the rapid urbanization, especially farmland
   sharply lost in areas around existing urban areas and along the
   transportation corridors. (2) At the inner-city level, concentric
   analyses showed that UGS changes in different rings had unique trends,
   and the dynamic changes were the most significant in Rings 2 and 3.
   Comparative analysis of old and new districts showed that the common
   characteristics of UGS changes were the transfer-out of farmland and the
   transfer-in of built-up land, and the newer the region, the more intense
   the changes. (3) At the park level, the number and area of urban parks
   were increasing from the center to the periphery, and the type of park
   gradually changed from single to rich. Significant spatial heterogeneity
   was identified in the landscape patterns of urban parks based on fishnet
   cell analysis. It is fundamental to assign urban construction land for
   socio-economic development, while planning UGS at different scales;
   moreover, integrating different green space-related policies could
   protect the UGS and maintain its stability. Only in this way can UGS
   combine economic, social, and ecological benefits under the background
   of rapid urbanization.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of the interactive development of inward
   foreign direct investment (IFDI) and outward foreign direct investment
   (OFDI) {[}two-way foreign direct investment (FDI)1 on regional
   environmental technology by using data from 30 provinces and cities in
   China from 2004 to 2017. To overcome the possible endogeneity problem of
   the model, the system generalized moment estimation method (system GMM)
   is used to estimate the model. The results show the following: First,
   two-way FDI could inhibit the progress of regional environmental
   technology. Second, the results of the regional heterogeneity test show
   that the development of two-way FDI interaction promotes the
   environmental technology in the eastern region, but inhibits the
   environmental technology in the central and western regions of China.
   Third, the heterogeneity test results of the two-way FDI interactive
   development degree show that the two-way FDI interactive development in
   China promotes environmental technology in high-interactive areas, but
   inhibits environmental technology in low-interactive areas. Finally, the
   results of the phased heterogeneity test show that as China's two-way
   FDI interactive development gradually increases, its inhibitory effect
   on regional environmental technology gradually declines. Therefore, it
   is believed that in the future, China should further strengthen inward
   FDI and OFDI, realize the benign interaction of two-way FDI, and finally
   promote the progress of regional environmental technology.},

Title = {Effect of Natural Hazards on the Income and Sense of Subjective
   Well-Being of Rural Residents: Evidence From Rural China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {China is a country that experiences severe natural hazards. In
   comparison to urban residents, farmers in rural areas of China are more
   susceptible to these natural hazards, whose impact is multidimensional;
   however, existing research has mainly focused on the household level.
   Based on China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data in 2019, a total of
   17,900 farmer households have been chosen to discuss the influences of
   natural hazards on the rural income and subjective well-being from the
   individual perspective and the family perspective; further, regional
   differences within the sphere of influence have been analyzed. Empirical
   results demonstrate that (1) the farmer household income is a factor
   that affects subjective well-being, but does not play a decisive role.
   (2) From the perspective of spatial differences and laws, subjective
   well-being and the income of farmers vary significantly. The subjective
   well-being in North China (NC) is the highest, while the subjective
   well-being in the Central South (CS) is the lowest. The distribution
   trend of rural income is high in Southeast China (SE) and low in
   Northwest China (NW). (3) Natural hazards can lower the subjective
   well-being {[}Mean AP - (average treatment effect) = -0.1040] and income
   (Mean ATT = -0.1715) of farmers significantly. Moreover, the influences
   of natural hazards on subjective well-being are lower than that on
   income. Therefore, it is imperative to ascertain the impact of natural
   hazards on farmers' subjective well-being and household income. Further,
   the government should consider regional differences and the different
   affected groups, and also strengthen the farmers' ability to cope with
   hazards and their post-hazard recovery ability during the implementation
   of hazard rescue.},

Title = {When less is more: Visitation by generalist pollinators can have neutral
   or negative effects on plant reproduction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Selection for specialized coevolutionary relationships can arise if
   generalized opportunistic pollinators, while still delivering some
   pollen, operate as less effective pollen delivery agents. Nevertheless,
   generalization could buffer high-latitude communities from loss of
   specialist pollinator species by providing some pollination service.
   Currently, there is limited understanding of the ecosystem services
   provided by generalized pollinators and whether they increase the
   fitness of the plants they visit. Network data and thorough observations
   of floral visitors, paired with estimates of seed set, offer some
   insight into the role of generalists, which in turn can inform us about
   how plants are likely to respond to ecosystem disturbances, such as
   losses of some pollinators, or changes in land cover. Here, we report on
   plant-pollinator visitation networks in Canada with high levels of
   generalization and examine the effects of generalization on seed set
   under different disturbance histories. We also then take a case study of
   one crop wild relative, Rubus arcticus or Arctic raspberry, and report
   on a near-complete characterization of pollinator interactions in
   different environmental conditions. Our findings indicate that
   generalized pollinators, though frequent and robust to variable
   temperatures and moisture conditions, do not appear to play a strong
   role in increasing the reproductive output of many plant species, and
   may provide only a weak buffer against the stronger effects of
   disturbance.},

Title = {Bacteria common to rhizosphere communities of Asiatic bittersweet across
   a post-glacial landscape},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Invasive plants such as Asiatic bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus
   Thunb.) are a significant problem for land managers as they impact plant
   species composition, disrupt nutrient dynamics and structure of native
   ecosystems, and are difficult to eradicate. As a result of the
   increasing abundance of Asiatic bittersweet across the eastern U.S., we
   have been investigating underlying factors potentially contributing to
   the success of this plant. Recently, ecologists have been investigating
   the role of plant-soil-microbe interactions contributing to plant
   invasion. This work has led to question: are there certain microbes
   (e.g., bacteria, fungi) contributing to the success of some invasive
   plants? We hypothesize that despite differences in geologic age of soils
   where Asiatic bittersweet has established in the Indiana Dunes National
   Park there are sufficient common factors that led to common bacterial
   taxa in their rhizosphere. The objectives were to determine differences
   and commonalities in the soil chemistry, plant community and bacterial
   communities of Asiatic bittersweet plants. To achieve these objectives,
   bittersweet plants were collected at thirteen locations in the national
   park from soils ranging in geologic age from 150 to over 14,500 years.
   Surrounding soil chemistry, plant cover and the 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   sequences of rhizosphere soil bacterial communities of these Asiatic
   bittersweet were compared. Asiatic bittersweet coverage of sampling
   sites ranged from 2 to 77\% averaging 52 +/- 2\%. There were
   statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in alpha diversity
   (Shannon, Faith's PD and Pielou's evenness) and beta diversity (Bray
   Curtis, Jaccard, unweighted Unifrac, weighted Unifrac) among the samples
   when grouped by soil age or habitat. Despite these differences in the
   bacterial communities from different soil ages and habitats, some
   bacterial taxa (e.g., Bacillus, Streptomyces, Sphingomonas and
   Rhizobiales) previously found in other studies to be beneficial to plant
   growth were found in every rhizosphere community sampled. These microbes
   provide insight into a possible contributing factor to the success of
   this invasive plant at the Indiana Dunes National Park, and a strategy
   for future work to reduce the impact of Asiatic bittersweet
   establishment and offer some new strategies to manage this nuisance
   species.},

Title = {Chasing the unbiased willingness to pay: Using an integrated contingent
   valuation survey in estimating the non-market value of rubber plantation
   ecological restoration programs in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The rubber expansion in Asian countries has led to various environmental
   problems. To smoothly promote the ecological restoration programs, an
   essential premise is that the local government must consider public
   attitude and understand the public willingness to pay (WTP) for the
   programs. In this study, we employ an integrated contingent valuation
   (ICV) survey to evaluate the citizen's WTP of implementing rubber
   plantation ecological restoration (RPER) programs in Hainan, China.
   Considering three types of the respondents' WTP data (interval
   truncated, merged, and point data), we adopt the Point and Interval Data
   (PID) model to estimate the determinants of WTP and calculate the
   non-market value with the comparison of the Tobit model. Results show
   that the mean value of WTP for the RPER program is 178 yuan per year,
   and the total non-market value throughout the province is worth
   approximately 1.839 billion yuan per year after controlling the regional
   differences. We also find that the respondents' WTP has a significant
   regional difference, in which Danzhou has the highest WTP, followed by
   Haikou, Wanning, and Sanya. Age has a significant negative effect on the
   WTP for the restoration program, whereas the factors such as education,
   family burden, income, and residents' environmental knowledge have a
   significant positive effect. Our findings add to the evidence that using
   improved estimation methods can generate diverse results, where
   neglecting the bias caused by the usual interval data model would lead
   to downward biased estimates.},

Title = {The diadromous watersheds-ocean continuum: Managing diadromous fish as a
   community for ecosystem resilience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Diadromous fishes play important ecological roles by delivering
   ecosystem services and making crucial connections along the
   watersheds-ocean continuum. However, it is difficult to fully understand
   the community-level impacts and cumulative benefits of diadromous fish
   migrations, as these species are most often considered individually or
   in small groups. Their interactions at a community level (e.g.,
   interdependencies such as predation, co-migration, and habitat
   conditioning) and the connections between their ecosystem roles and
   functions (e.g., cumulative marine-derived nutrient contributions,
   impacts on stream geomorphology) are yet to be fully understood.
   Similarly, freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems are often
   considered as independent parts, limiting understanding of the
   importance of connections across systems. We argue that not considering
   the ecosystem interdependence and importance of diadromous fish as a
   community currently hinders the implementation of the large-scale
   management required to increase ecosystem resilience and fish
   productivity across the full range of these species. We developed a
   conceptual model, the Diadromous Watersheds-Ocean Continuum (DWOC), that
   uses ecosystem services to promote a more holistic approach to the
   management of the diadromous community and encourages an integrated
   understanding of the ecosystem connections made by these species. DWOC
   provides a framework for discussions that can help identify research and
   management needs, discuss the trade-offs of different management
   options, and analyze what pressing questions impede the implementation
   of large-scale management solutions toward a more ecosystem-based
   management approach.},

Title = {A sequential game-play modelling on forest-title mortgage loans based on
   Chinese forester resource and assets valuation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Forest management has become a critical strategic action because of
   forests' diverse role in the nature conservation and bio-economic
   benefits. Forest-title mortgage loan (hereafter abbreviated as ``the
   loan{''}) which is one of forest management methods not only transforms
   the ``sleeping{''} resources of a forester in her/his forest into assets
   mortgageable for cash, but also plays a key role in alleviating the
   shortage of funds that a forester might encounter, promoting financial
   innovations, and protecting forest resources. As such, this paper
   examines the problem of the low limit placed on this loan in China, and
   draws the following conclusion from employing the dynamic game method
   comprising complete information: in the actual mortgage market where
   banks hold an absolute advantage in issuing mortgage loans to the
   borrower (whether or not a forester acting as the borrower here applies
   for this loan from the bank through using an asset-appraisal agency) the
   amount of loan approved for the forester is going to be lower than the
   actual market value of the forest-resource assets that the forester
   owns. At the same time, based on the above conclusion, this paper
   proposes certain suggestions regarding how to raise the limit of this
   loan for the forester. These suggestions include proposals pertinent to
   the governmental policy support, introduction of innovative credit
   products developed by the banks, as well as the elaboration on how
   foresters could integrate their forest-resource assets by using
   cooperatives and launching scaled productions.},

Title = {The dental microwear texture of wild boars from Japan reflects inter-
   and intra-populational feeding preferences},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is rapidly expanding for the
   dietary estimation of extinct animals. There has been an extensive
   accumulation of microwear texture data from herbivorous mammals,
   especially for ruminant artiodactyls, but suids are still
   underrepresented. Microwear varies depending on the diet, and suids are
   naturally more flexible than other artiodactyls. Thus, their microwear
   is prone to greater variability. In this study, we examine the tooth
   microwear texture of wild boars from Toyama Prefecture, Japan, for which
   detailed ecological and dietary information by stomach content analysis
   is available. We first investigated 205 individuals of wild-shot Toyama
   boars with known sex, age class, localities (the eastern high latitude
   region vs. the western low latitude region), and season of collection.
   The tooth surfaces of boarlets were rougher than those of juvenile and
   adult animals. The decrease in surface roughness with age implied that
   the frequency of tooth-tooth contact, which seemed to result in cracking
   of enamels and thus rough surfaces, decreased after the boars started
   feeding on solid foods (food-tooth contact), with progressive
   involvement of rooting behavior in mature adults. We further found that
   surface roughness showed significant differences between localities,
   with the western Toyama boars having flatter surfaces, possibly because
   they were involved in more rooting and feeding on soil-contaminated
   rhizomes than the eastern ones, as implied by the available stomach
   content data. The frequency of rooting was also evident in the broader
   comparison among Japanese boar populations with different habitat
   environments. The mainland boars inhabiting deciduous broad-leaved
   forests had a flatter and less rough tooth surfaces than those in the
   subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests of the southern islands. This
   corresponds to the fact that above-ground dietary resources were more
   abundant in the habitat of the southern island boars, where crops like
   succulent vegetables and fruits, as well as naturally fallen acorns,
   were abundant, whereas underground plant parts were the dominant diet
   component for the mainland boars. This study proved that DMTA can
   identify the difference in foraging modes in suids and make it possible
   to estimate the frequency of rooting, which is informative for inferring
   breeding methods of boars/pigs from archaeological sites.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {The alarming increase of ambient ozone (O-3) levels across China raises
   an urgent need in understanding underlying mechanisms of regional O-3
   events for highly urbanized city clusters. Sichuan Basin (SCB) situated
   in southwestern China has experienced severe O-3 pollution at times in
   summer from 2013 to 2020. Here, we use the WRF-CMAQ model with the
   Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) to investigate the
   evolution mechanism and conduct source attribution of an extreme O-3
   episode in the SCB from June 1 to 8, 2019. This typical summer O-3
   episode is associated with the synoptic-driven meteorological phenomenon
   and transboundary flow of O-3 and precursors across the SCB. Weak
   ventilation in combination with stagnant conditions triggered the
   basin-wide high O-3 concentrations and enhanced BVOC emissions
   substantially contribute up to 57.9 mu g/m(3) MDA8 O-3. CMAQ-ISAM
   indicates that precursor emissions from industrial and transportation
   have the largest impacts on elevating ambient O-3 concentrations, while
   power plant emissions exhibit insignificant contributions to basin-wide
   O-3 episodes. These results improve the understanding of the summertime
   O-3 episode in the SCB and contribute insights into designing O-3
   mitigation policy.},

Title = {Increasing taxon sampling suggests a complete taxonomic rearrangement in
   Echinantherini (Serpentes: Dipsadidae)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Although the recent advances on the relationship of its major groups,
   the systematics of the rich fauna of Neotropical snakes is far from
   being a consensus. In this sense, derived groups presenting continental
   distributions have represented a main challenge. The taxonomy of the
   snake tribe Echinantherini is one of the most contentious among the
   diverse family known as Dipsadidae. The tribe is poorly sampled in
   phylogenetic studies, resulting in conflicting hypotheses of
   relationships among its taxa. Moreover, several rare and micro endemic
   species of Echinantherini have never been evaluated within a
   comprehensive phylogenetic framework. Here, we assess for the first time
   the phylogenetic position of the rare Echinanthera amoena within
   Echinantherini. We based our analyses on a comprehensive multilocus
   dataset including 14 of the 16 species described for the tribe. Our
   results support the monophyly of Echinantherini and strongly indicate E.
   amoena as a unique lineage, phylogenetically positioned apart from all
   other congeners. From the three current genera (Echinanthera,
   Taeniophallus, and Sordellina) our results indicate that Echinanthera
   and Taeniophallus are paraphyletic, since the T. affinis species group
   is positioned as sister to Echinanthera (except E. amoena) clustering
   apart from the clade formed by the T. brevirostris and T. occipitalis
   groups. We describe new genera for the T. affinis and T. occipitalis
   species groups and an additional monospecific genus for E. amoena.
   Although we did not evaluate the phylogenetic position of T. nebularis,
   we described a new genus and removed it from Echinantherini since its
   morphology strikingly departs from all species now included in the
   tribe. Finally, we redefine the genera Echinanthera and Taeniophallus
   and we provide comments about further directions to study the
   biogeography and the evolution of morphological traits in
   Echinantherini.},

Title = {Integument carotenoid-based colouration reflects contamination to
   perfluoroalkyl substances, but not mercury, in arctic black-legged
   kittiwakes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are introducing multiple chemical contaminants
   into ecosystems that act as stressors for wildlife. Perfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) and mercury (Hg) are two relevant contaminants that
   may cause detrimental effects on the fitness of many aquatic organisms.
   However, there is a lack of information on their impact on the
   expression of secondary sexual signals that animals use for mate choice.
   We have explored the correlations between integument carotenoid-based
   colourations, blood levels of carotenoids, and blood levels of seven
   PFAS and of total Hg (THg) in 50 adult male black-legged kittiwakes
   (Rissa tridactyla) from the Norwegian Arctic during the pre-laying
   period, while controlling for other colouration influencing variables
   such as testosterone and body condition. Kittiwakes with elevated blood
   concentrations of PFAS (PFOSlin, PFNA, PFDcA, PFUnA, or PFDoA) had less
   chromatic but brighter bills, and brighter gape and tongue; PFOSlin was
   the pollutant with the strongest association with bill colourations.
   Conversely, plasma testosterone was the only significant correlate of
   hue and chroma of both gape and tongue, and of hue of the bill.
   Kittiwakes with higher concentrations of any PFAS, but not of THg,
   tended to have significantly higher plasma concentrations of the
   carotenoids astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and cryptoxanthin. Our work
   provides the first correlative evidence that PFAS exposure might
   interfere with the carotenoid metabolism and the expression of
   integument carotenoid-based colourations in a free-living bird species.
   This outcome may be a direct effect of PFAS exposure or be indirectly
   caused by components of diet that also correlate with elevated PFAS
   concentrations (e.g., proteins). It also suggests that there might be no
   additive effect of THg co-exposure with PFAS on the expression of
   colourations. These results call for further work on the possible
   interference of PFAS with the expression of colourations used in mate
   choice.},

Title = {Effective Air Purification via Pt-Decorated N-3-CNT Adsorbent},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {Effectively removal of air pollutants using adsorbents is one of the
   most important methods to purify the air. In this work, we proposed for
   the first time that PtN3-CNT is an effective adsorbent for air
   purification. Its air purification performance was studied by
   calculating the adsorption behaviors and electronic structures of 12 gas
   molecules, including the main components of air (N-2, O-2, H2O, CO2) and
   the most common air pollutants (NO, NO2, SO3, SO2, CO, O-3, NH3, H2S),
   on the surface of PtN3-CNT using first-principles calculations. The
   results showed that these gases were adsorbed stably via the
   coordination between Pt and the coordinated atoms (C, N, O, and S atoms)
   in the gas molecules, and the adsorption energies vary in the range of
   -0.81 similar to-4.28 eV. The obvious chemical interactions between
   PtN3-CNT and the adsorbed gas molecules are mainly determined by the
   apparent overlaps between the Pt 5d orbitals and the outmost p orbitals
   of the coordination atoms. PtN3-CNT has strong adsorption capacity for
   the toxic gas molecules, while relatively weaker adsorption performance
   for the main components of the air except oxygen. The recovery time of
   each adsorbed molecule calculated at different temperatures showed that,
   CO2, H2O, and N-2 can be desorbed gradually at 298 similar to 498 K,
   while the toxic gases are always adsorbed stably on the surface of
   PtN3-CNT. Considering the excellent thermal stability of PtN3-CNT at up
   to 1000 K proved by AIMD, PtN3-CNT is very suitable to act as an
   adsorbent to remove toxic gases to achieve the purpose of air
   purification. Our findings in this report would be beneficial for
   exploiting possible carbon-based air purification adsorbents with
   excellent adsorbing ability and good recovery performance.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify underwater vocalizations in
   red-eared turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) and assess differences
   between sexes and ages. We recorded the underwater vocalizations of the
   red-eared sliders and identified 12 call types through manual visual and
   aural inspection of the recordings. Similarity analysis verified that
   manual classification was relatively reliable. The call types of the
   turtle were described and displayed as spectrograms and waveforms. The
   turtles produced fewer high-frequency call types than low-frequency
   types in all recordings. Statistical analysis revealed significant
   differences in the frequencies and duration of the calls of red-eared
   turtles between different sexes and ages. Males vocalized pulse calls
   very frequently, whereas a high proportion of high-frequency call types
   was emitted by the female adult group. The male subadult group emitted
   higher frequencies of Type A, B, and C calls, which is in accordance
   with the phenomenon that vocal frequency is often inversely proportional
   to the turtle size. Some call types produced by red-eared turtles were
   above the frequency range of their known hearing range. This may have
   been a by-product of the sound production mechanism or it may have
   adaptive value in mitigating interference to communication from
   low-frequency noise common in natural waters in communication The
   behavioral implications of these vocalizations and whether turtles can
   hear such high sounds warrant further study.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {With the rise of global urbanization, the rural built environment has
   undergone tremendous changes. As such, the rural built environment
   impacts on residents' daily travel behavior is getting more researchers'
   attention. To date, most of the research focuses on urban areas in
   developed countries. To understand the state-of-the-art of interplay
   between the rural built environment and travel behaviors and to identify
   future research directions, this study adopts a science mapping approach
   to identify the relevant topics, authors, journals, and countries of the
   research done. This study proceeds through bibliometric retrieval of
   articles from 2005, followed by scientometric analysis and qualitative
   discussion. 37 documents are found to compare urban and rural domains,
   with 28 on the rural built environment. Research gaps and the research
   trends are discussed, of which the main themes are multi-dimensional
   correlation comparison of rural transportation service systems and
   emerging transportation modes, the influence of rural social and
   cultural factors on travel behavior, and low-carbon sustainable
   transportation. This review provides empirical foundation for current
   state-of-the-art and identifies the future research directions,
   specifically for rural built environment impact on travel behavior.},

Title = {Impact of soil types and root exudates on cadmium and petroleum
   hydrocarbon phytoremediation by Sorghum sudanense, Festuca arundinace,
   and Lolium perenne},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {With the development of industrialization, soils around the world have
   been polluted by heavy metals and oil to different degrees in recent
   years, and soil remediation has become a global problem.
   Phytoremediation has a wide application prospect because of its
   environmental friendliness and easy availability of materials.
   Objective: To explore the effects of soil types and root exudates on the
   removal of cadmium and petroleum hydrocarbon in soils. MethodA pot
   experiments with three soil types (sandy, loamy and clayey) of the
   Changning-Weiyuan area of Sichuan province and three root exudates
   (citric acid, glycine, and maltose) were carried out using Sorghum
   sudanense (Piper) Stapf., Lolium perenne L., and Festuca arundinacea L.
   as test materials. Plants were grown in soils contaminated by cadmium
   and petroleum at different concentrations.
   Result: The biomass of S. sudanense, the translocation ratio and removal
   rate of cadmium in S. sudanense decreased gradually with increasing soil
   cadmium concentration. The promotion effects of the three root exudates
   on S. sudanense were in the following order: citric acid > glycine >
   maltose. At the same cadmium pollution conditions, the biomass levels of
   S. sudanense in sandy, loamy, and clayey soils were in the following
   order: clayey soil > loamy soil > sandy soil. On the contrary, the
   concentration, translocation ratio, and removal rate of cadmium in S.
   sudanense grown in the different soils treated with root exudates were
   in the following order: sandy soil > loamy soil > clayey soil. Under the
   three soil conditions, the fresh weight of F. arundinacea (0.36 similar
   to 0.68 g) and S. sudanense (0.51 similar to 0.99 g) increased
   significantly (p < 0.05). The total petroleum hydrocarbons degradation
   efficiencies of F. arundinacea, L. perenne, and S. sudanense were high
   in sandy soil (34.27\% similar to 60.52\%). Changing the type of root
   exudate had a significant impact on the degradation of total petroleum
   hydrocarbons in sandy soil (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study showed that soil types impacted the accumulation
   of cadmium and petroleum in plants. Phytoremediation of cadmium and
   petroleum contaminated soil could be enhanced by the application of root
   exudates. This study recommend that the method is suitable for field
   remediation of soils contaminated with mild cadmium and petroleum
   hydrocarbons.},

Title = {Good news! Sampling intensity needed for accurate assessments of dung
   beetle diversity may be lower in the Neotropics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Ecological studies with Scarabaeinae dung beetles have increased
   exponentially over the past 30 years, using lethal pitfall traps baited
   with mammal feces or carrion as the preferred sampling method. Different
   studies have determined the distance between pitfall traps for effective
   sampling, but the number of traps is often subjective, leading to
   excessive or poor sampling. This study provides quantitative guidelines
   for establishing the sample size for optimal completeness of dung beetle
   diversity by systematically reviewing the relationship between sampling
   intensity and sampling coverage, habitat type, and the journal impact
   factor in peer-reviewed research. We gathered 94 studies covering a
   range from Mexico to Argentina. Sampling was conducted mainly in
   forested habitats, followed by treeless agriculture and agroforestry
   systems, with a median value of 50 pitfall traps per sampled habitat.
   Sampling completeness was above 0.9 in 95\% of the studies. Oversampling
   ranged from 1 to more than 96,000 individuals, and sampling deficit
   varied between 2 and 3,300 specimens. Sampling intensity and the journal
   impact factor were significantly and positively correlated with
   oversampling, but these variables did not explain the sampling deficit.
   The positive correlation between journal impact factor and oversampling
   may reflect a publication bias where high-impact journals and
   researchers seek more generalizable information obtained with a higher
   sampling intensity. Dung beetle oversampling was not homogeneous between
   habitats, being highest in old-growth forests and lowest in disturbed
   habitats such as pastures and forest edges. Our results show that the
   collection intensity used in dung beetle studies should be reconsidered
   carefully. By incorporating ethical principles used in animal science,
   we suggest sampling guidelines for a robust sampling scheme of dung
   beetle diversity, which would also prevent oversampling. Consciously
   reducing sampling intensity will make resource use more cost-effective.
   We suggest increasing the number of independent sampling units rather
   than intensifying subsampling, thereby increasing the predictive power
   of statistical models to obtain more robust evidence of the phenomena
   under study.},

Title = {Yearly weather variation and surface temperature drives the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of a threatened butterfly and its host plant},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {It remains unclear to what extent yearly weather variation and spatial
   variation in microclimate influences the outcome of interacting
   plant-animal species and whether responses differ between life stages.
   We collected data over several years on 46 ha on File Hajdar, Gotland,
   Sweden, and executed a complete mapping of larva nests (n = 776) and
   imago (n = 5,952) of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia
   and its host plant Succisa pratensis. The phenology of the butterflies
   and the major nectar plants visited varied among years. The duration of
   the adult flight period decreased with increasing ambient air
   temperatures. The density of butterflies, host plants, and host plant
   leaf size increased between years with increasing precipitation in the
   preceding year, and decreased with increasing average ambient air
   temperature in the preceding year. In 2021-2022 we deployed a unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) with a high-resolution thermal sensor to measure
   spatial variation in surface temperatures in the study area. We found
   that survival from the egg to the larva stage increased with increasing
   surface temperature and host plant density. Host plants and larva nests
   generally occupied warmer microhabitats compared to imago butterflies.
   The results further suggested that the relationships linking surface
   temperature to the densities of imago, larva, host plants, and leaf size
   differed qualitatively between years. In 2017, larva nests and host
   plant density increased with increasing surface temperatures, and
   butterflies showed a non-linear response with a density peak at
   intermediate temperatures. As a result of the extreme drought in 2018
   there was a reduction in maximum leaf size, and in the densities of
   plants, larvae, and butterflies. Moreover, the slopes of the
   relationships linking the density of larvae, butterflies, and plants to
   temperature shifted from linear positive to negative or curvilinear. Our
   findings demonstrate how yearly weather variation and heterogeneous
   surface temperatures can drive the spatiotemporal distribution and
   dynamics of butterflies and their host plants. The context specificity
   of the responses indicated by our results makes it challenging to
   project how climate change will affect the dynamics of ecological
   communities.},

Title = {Metatranscriptomic holobiont analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes in
   the millipede Telodeinopus aoutii (Diplopoda, Spirostreptida)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {As important decomposers of soil organic matter, millipedes contribute
   to lignocellulose decomposition and nutrient cycling. The degradation of
   lignocellulose requires the action of several carbohydrate-active
   enzymes (CAZymes) and, in most invertebrates, depends on the activity of
   mutualistic gut microorganisms. To address the question of the
   importance of the microbiota and endogenous (host) enzymes in digestive
   processes in millipedes, we analyzed metatranscriptomic data from the
   tropical millipede Telodeinopus aoutii at the holobiont level.
   Functional annotation included identification of expressed CAZymes (CAZy
   families and EC terms) in the host and its intestinal microbiota,
   foregut, midgut, and hindgut, compared to non-intestinal tissues. Most
   of the 175 CAZy families were expressed exclusively in the gut
   microbiota and more than 50\% of these microbial families were expressed
   exclusively in the hindgut. The greatest diversity of expressed
   endogenous CAZymes from all gut sections was found in the midgut (77
   families). Bacteria were the major microbial producers of CAZymes,
   Proteobacteria dominating in the midgut and Bacteriodetes with
   Firmicutes in the hindgut. The contribution of the eukaryotic microbiota
   to CAZymes production was negligible. Functional classification of
   expressed CAZy families confirmed a broad functional spectrum of CAZymes
   potentially expressed in the holobiont. Degradation of lignocellulose in
   the digestive tract of the millipede T. aoutii depends largely on
   bacterial enzymes expressed in the hindgut. Endogenous cellulases were
   not detected, except for the potentially cellulolytic family AA15, but
   an expression of cellulolytic enzymes of this family was not confirmed
   at the EC-number level. The midgut had the greatest diversity of
   expressed endogenous CAZymes, mainly amylases, indicating the importance
   of digesting alpha-glucosidases for the millipede. In contrast,
   bacterial lignocellulolytic enzymes are sparsely expressed here. The
   hindgut was the hotspot of microbial degradation of cellulose and
   hemicellulases. The gain of the millipede from the microbial
   lignocellulose degradation in the gut, and consequently the mutualistic
   status of the relationship between the millipede and its cellulolytic
   gut bacteria, depends on the ability of the millipede to take up
   microbial metabolites as nutrients through the hindgut wall. Enzymes
   expressed in the intestine can degrade all components of lignocellulose
   except lignin. Assuming that soil microbiota is partially degraded
   lignin in the millipede diet, T. aoutii can be considered a decomposer
   of soil organic matter relying primarily on its gut bacteria. The
   deposition of millipede fecal pellets containing an organic matter
   modified by the hindgut bacterial community could be of ecological
   significance.},

Title = {The Role of Wolves in Regulating a Chronic Non-communicable Disease,
   Osteoarthritis, in Prey Populations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {It is widely accepted that predators disproportionately prey on
   individuals that are old, weak, diseased or injured. By selectively
   removing individuals with diseases, predators may play an important role
   in regulating the overall health of prey populations. However, that idea
   is seldom tested empirically. Here we assess the extent that wolves
   (Canis lupus) select adult moose (Alces alces) in Isle Royale National
   Park on the basis of age-class and osteoarthritis, a chronic,
   non-communicable disease. We also assess how temporal variation in kill
   rates (on moose by wolves) were associated with the subsequent incidence
   of osteoarthritis in the moose population over a 33-year period
   (1975-2007). Wolves showed strong selection for senescent moose and
   tended to avoid prime-aged adults. However, the presence of severe
   osteoarthritis, but not mild or moderate osteoarthritis, appeared to
   increase the vulnerability of prime-aged moose to predation. There was
   weak evidence to suggest that senescent moose with osteoarthritis maybe
   more vulnerable to wolves, compared to senescent moose without the
   disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis declined following years with
   higher kill rates-which is plausibly due to the selective removal of
   individuals with osteoarthritis. Together those results suggest that
   selective predation plays an important role in regulating the health of
   prey populations. Additionally, because osteoarthritis is influenced by
   genetic factors, these results highlight how wolf predation may act as a
   selective force against genes associated with developing severe
   osteoarthritis as a prime-aged adult. Our findings highlight one
   benefits of allowing predators to naturally regulate prey populations.
   The evidence we present for predation's influence on the health of prey
   populations is also relevant for policy-related arguments about
   refraining from intensively hunting wolf populations.},

Abstract = {Our experimental work illustrates how microbial ecosystems can be shaped
   by selective pressures over long-term ecological time scales. Natural
   microbial ecosystems generally consist of various co-existing species,
   where community composition describes the frequency at which species or
   types are present. Overall functionality of the system is achieved by
   interacting species. Upon short-term selection, for instance by transfer
   to a novel environment, community composition and functionality may
   change in a process referred to as species sorting. Various factors,
   such as initial community composition and selective pressures from the
   environment, may influence this change. Mabisi is a traditional
   fermented food from Zambia that naturally contains a bacterial community
   of around twenty unique bacterial types. We used six comparable but
   different natural bacterial Mabisi communities, each split into five
   identical replicates, for 16 propagation cycles in a novel, common
   laboratory environment. Composition of the bacterial communities changed
   upon propagation. The influence of four main factors on community
   composition, i.e. initial composition (history), impact of the
   environment (adaptation), changes due to interaction between species and
   random processes (chance) in species dynamics, was tested using maximum
   likelihood ratios. Initial community composition seemed to determine the
   change in community composition, followed by random processes.
   Interestingly, we observed convergence at the level of ecosystem
   functionality, which was measured as profiles of metabolic output. This
   suggests different combinations of species or types can achieve similar
   eco-system functionality.},

Abstract = {The European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis L.) is a native bivalve of the
   European coasts. Harvest of this species has declined during the last
   decades because of the appearance of two parasites that have led to the
   collapse of the stocks and the loss of the natural oyster beds. O.
   edulis has been the subject of numerous studies in population genetics
   and on the detection of the parasites Bonamia ostreae and Marteilia
   refringens. These studies investigated immune responses to these
   parasites at the molecular and cellular levels. Several genetic
   improvement programs have been initiated especially for parasite
   resistance. Within the framework of a European project (PERLE 2) that
   aims to produce genetic lines of O. edulis with hardiness traits
   (growth, survival, resistance) for the purpose of repopulating natural
   oyster beds in Brittany and reviving the culture of this species in the
   foreshore, obtaining a reference genome becomes essential as done
   recently in many bivalve species of aquaculture interest. Here, we
   present a chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the
   European flat oyster, generated by combining PacBio, Illumina, 10X
   linked, and Hi-C sequencing. The finished assembly is 887.2 Mb with a
   scaffold-N50 of 97.1 Mb scaffolded on the expected 10 pseudochromosomes.
   Annotation of the genome revealed the presence of 35,962 protein-coding
   genes. We analyzed in detail the transposable element (TE) diversity in
   the flat oyster genome, highlighted some specificities in tRNA and miRNA
   composition, and provided the first insight into the molecular response
   of O. edulis to M. refringens. This genome provides a reference for
   genomic studies on O. edulis to better understand its basic physiology
   and as a useful resource for genetic breeding in support of aquaculture
   and natural reef restoration.},

Title = {Genomic analyses point to a low evolutionary potential of prospective
   source populations for assisted migration in a forest herb},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1859-1874},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting temperate forest ecosystems and
   many forest herbs might be unable to track the changing climate due to
   dispersal limitation. Forest herbs with a low adaptive capacity may
   therefore benefit from conservation strategies that mitigate dispersal
   limitation and evolutionary constraints, such as assisted migration.
   However, assisted migration strategies rarely consider evolutionary
   constraints of potential source populations that may jeopardize their
   success. In cases where climate adaptation is overshadowed by competing
   evolutionary processes, assisted migration is unlikely to support
   adaptation to future climates. Using a combination of population and
   landscape genomic analyses, we disentangled local adaptation drivers and
   quantified the adaptability and vulnerability to climate change of the
   self-incompatible deciduous forest herb Primula elatior. Southern
   populations displayed a sharp genetic turnover and a considerable amount
   of local adaptation under diversifying selection was discovered.
   However, most of the outlier loci could not be linked to climate
   variables (71\%) and were likely related to other local adaptation
   drivers, such as photoperiodism. Furthermore, specific adaptations to
   climate extremes, such as drought stress, could not be detected. This is
   in line with the typical occurrence of forest herbs in buffered climatic
   conditions, which can be expected to reduce selection pressures imposed
   by climate. Finally, populations in the south of the distribution area
   had increased sensitivity to climate change due to a reduced adaptive
   capacity and a moderate genetic offset, while central European
   populations were sensitive due to a high genetic offset. We conclude
   that assisted migration from southern source populations could bear
   significant risk due to nonclimatic maladaptation and a low adaptive
   capacity. Regional admixture and restoration of ecological connectivity
   to increase the adaptive capacity, and assisted range expansion to
   suitable habitat in the north might be more appropriate mitigation
   strategies.},

Title = {Demographic history and conservation genomics of caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus) in Quebec},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},

Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2043-2053},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The loss of genetic diversity is a challenge many species are facing,
   with genomics being a potential tool to inform and prioritize
   decision-making. Most caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations have
   experienced significant recent declines throughout Quebec, Canada, and
   are considered of concern, threatened or endangered. Here, we calculated
   the ancestral and contemporary patterns of genomic diversity of five
   representative caribou populations and applied a comparative population
   genomics framework to assess the interplay between demographic events
   and genomic diversity. We first calculated a caribou specific mutation
   rate, mu, by extracting orthologous genes from related ungulates and
   estimating the rate of synonymous mutations. Whole genome re-sequencing
   was then completed on 67 caribou: from these data we calculated
   nucleotide diversity, theta(pi) and estimated the coalescent or
   ancestral effective population size (N-e), which ranged from 12,030 to
   15,513. When compared to the census size, N-C, the endangered Gaspesie
   Mountain caribou population had the highest ancestral N-e:N-C ratio
   which is consistent with recent work suggesting high ancestral N-e:N-C
   is of conservation concern. In contrast, values of contemporary N-e,
   estimated from linkage-disequilibrium, ranged from 11 to 162, with
   Gaspesie having among the highest contemporary N-e:N-C ratio.
   Importantly, classic conservation genetics theory would predict this
   population to be of less concern based on this ratio. Interestingly, F
   varied only slightly between populations, and despite evidence of
   bottlenecks across the province, runs of homozygosity were not abundant
   in the genome. Tajima's D estimates mirrored the demographic models and
   current conservation status. Our study highlights how genomic patterns
   are nuanced and potentially misleading if viewed only through a
   contemporary lens; we argue a holistic conservation genomics view should
   integrate ancestral N-e and Tajima's D into management decisions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Life histories involving transitions between differing habitats (i.e.,
   aquatic to terrestrial or marine to freshwater) require numerous
   anatomical, physiological, and behavioral changes. Often, the traits
   associated with these changes are thought to come in suites, but all
   traits thought to be associated with particular life histories may not
   be required. While some traits are found in all species with a
   particular habitat transition, a grab bag approach may apply to other
   traits in that any trait may be sufficient for successful habitat
   transitions. We examine patterns of morphological traits associated with
   prolonged emersion in mudskipper, an amphibious fishes clade, where
   prolonged emersion appears twice. We test the evolutionary history of
   multiple characteristics associated with cutaneous respiration. We find
   most traits thought to be key for prolonged emersion show no
   phylogenetic signal and no tight correlation with prolonged emersion.
   Such traits appear in species with prolonged emersion but also
   non-emerging species. Only capillary density, which, when increased,
   allows for increased oxygen absorption, shows strong phylogenetic signal
   and correlation with prolonged emersion. Further experimental,
   functional genomics, and observational studies are needed to fully
   understand the mechanisms associated with each of these traits. With
   respect to traits associated with other particular behaviors, a
   comparative framework can be helpful in identifying evolutionary
   correlates.},

Title = {Modeling the distribution of invasive species (Ambrosia spp.) using
   regression kriging and Maxent},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Invasion by non-native species due to human activities is a major threat
   to biodiversity. The niche hypothesis for invasive species that rapidly
   disperse and disturb ecosystems is easily discarded owing to eradication
   activities or unsaturated dispersal. Here, we used spatial and
   non-spatial models to model the distribution of two invasive plant
   species (Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida), which are widely
   distributed, but are also being actively eradicated. Regression kriging
   (RK) and Maxent were used to predict the spatial distribution of the two
   plant species having eradication targets for decades in South Korea. In
   total, 1,478 presence/absence data points in the Seoul metropolitan area
   (similar to 11,000 km(2) in northeastern South Korea) were used. For
   regression kriging, the presence/absence data were first fitted with
   environmental covariates using a generalized linear model (GLM), and
   then the residuals of the GLM were modeled using ordinary kriging. The
   residuals of GLM showed significant spatial autocorrelation. The spatial
   autocorrelation was modeled using kriging. Regression kriging, which
   considers the spatial structure of data, yielded area under the receiver
   operating curve values of 0.785 and 0.775 for A. artemisiifolia and A.
   trifida, respectively; however, the values of Maxent, a non-spatial
   model, were 0.619 and 0.622, respectively. Thus, regression kriging was
   advantageous as it considers the spatial autocorrelation of the data.
   However, species distribution modeling encounters difficulties when the
   current species distribution does not reflect optimal habitat conditions
   (the niche habitat preferences) or when colonization is disturbed by
   artificial interference (e.g., removal activity). This greatly reduces
   the predictive power of the model if the model is based solely on the
   niche hypotheses that do not reflect reality. Managers can take
   advantage of regression modeling when modeling species distributions
   under conditions unfavorable to the niche hypothesis.},

Title = {Amount of bird suitable areas under climate change is modulated by
   morphological, ecological and geographical traits},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is already experiencing the effects of climate change
   through range expansion, retraction, or relocation, potentializing
   negative effects of other threats. Future projections already indicate
   richness reduction and composition modifications of bird communities due
   to global warming, which may disrupt the provision of key ecological
   services to ecosystem maintenance. Here, we systematically review the
   effect of morphological, ecological, and geographical traits on the
   amount of future suitable area for birds worldwide. Specifically, we
   tested whether body mass, diet, habitat type, movement pattern, range
   size, and biogeographic realm affect birds' suitable area. Our search
   returned 75 studies that modeled the effects of climate change on 1,991
   bird species. Our analyses included 1,661 species belonging to 128
   families, representing 83\% of the total, for which we were able to
   acquire all the six traits. The proportion of birds' suitable area was
   affected by range size, body mass, habitat type, and biogeographic
   realm, while diet and movement pattern showed lower relative importance
   and were not included in our final model. Contrary to expectations, the
   proportion of birds' suitable area was negatively related to range size,
   which may be explained by higher climatic stability predicted in certain
   areas that harbor species with restricted distribution. In contrast, we
   observed that birds presenting higher body mass will show an increase of
   the proportion of suitable area in the future. This is expected due to
   the high exposure of smaller birds to environmental changes and their
   difficulty to keep thermoregulation. Our results also indicated a low
   proportion of suitable area to forest-dependent birds, which is in
   accordance with their higher vulnerability due to specific requirements
   for reproduction and feeding. Finally, the proportion of suitable area
   was low for birds from Oceania, which is expected since the region
   encompasses small islands isolated from continents, preventing their
   species from reaching new suitable areas. Our study highlights that
   different traits should be considered when assessing extinction risk of
   species based on future projections, helping to improve bird
   conservation, especially the most vulnerable to climate change.},

Title = {Length of stay and departure strategies of Semipalmated Sandpipers

Abstract = {The Bay of Fundy, Canada is a critical staging area for Semipalmated
   Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) during post-breeding migration. Recent
   range-wide population declines and changes in diet and migratory timing
   in the Bay of Fundy prompted a re-examination of staging ecology,
   including length of stay (last estimated in 1981), which is used in
   calculating migratory population estimates. We used radio-telemetry and
   the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to estimate individual length of stay
   and departure conditions for 159 Semipalmated Sandpipers in 2013 and
   2014. Using tracking data we compared two estimation methods, minimum
   length of stay and mark-recapture modelling. Using minimum length of
   stay, the mean length of stay was approximately 21 days, an increase
   from the previous estimate of 15 days. Mark-recapture models suggested a
   much longer staging period that is inconsistent with other data.
   Sandpipers captured early in the staging period stayed longer on average
   than those captured later. Departures from the staging area were
   correlated with north-westerly winds, moderate to high wind speeds and
   low but rising atmospheric pressures. We suggest that Semipalmated
   Sandpipers in the Bay of Fundy are not operating on a time-selected
   migration schedule and instead wait for favourable weather conditions to
   depart, which occur more often later in the migratory period. Population
   trends in the Bay of Fundy should be re-evaluated in light of the
   increased length of stay.},

   role of rivers in shaping genetic structure},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {We used nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) of mitochondrial
   DNA sequence data to examine the processes contributing to population
   structure in naked mole-rats. We examined sequence variation in the
   (1097 bp) control region D-loop of the mitochondrial genome in 303
   individuals from 174 colonies of naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber)
   located mainly within an 870 km(2) area in Meru National Park, Kenya.
   Four rivers were found to be correlated to a significant fragmentation
   inference in the NCPA. The largest pairwise divergence between
   haplotypes from populations separated by rivers was 2.74\%, which was
   well over half of the divergence reported between the extremes of the
   distribution from southern Ethiopia to southern Kenya (4.6\%). However,
   the size of the river (measured in current discharge) was not a good
   predictor of the amount of sequence divergence between populations
   separated by a river. It appears that a large-scale historical
   fragmentation event may have conflated fragmentation patterns on a
   smaller scale, when recent colonization and range expansion brought two
   old lineages together at a location with a relatively small river
   separating them.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of soil iron across different plant communities
   along a hydrological gradient in the Yellow River Estuary wetland},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Iron is an important element and its biogeochemical processes are vital
   to the matter and energy cycles of wetland ecosystems. Hydrology greatly
   controls characteristics of soil property and plant community in
   wetlands, which can regulate the behavior of iron and its oxides.
   However, it remains unclear how the spatial distribution of iron and its
   forms in estuarine wetlands responses to hydrological conditions. Five
   typical plant communities along a naturally hydrological gradient in the
   Yellow River Estuary wetland, including Phragmites australis in
   freshwater marsh (FPA), Phragmites australis in salt marsh (SPA),
   Tamarix chinensis in salt marsh (TC), Suaeda salsa in salt marsh (SS)
   and Spartina altemiflora in salt marsh (SA), as sites to collect soil
   samples. The total iron (Fe-T) and three iron oxides (complexed iron,
   Fe-p; amorphous iron, Fe-o; free iron, Fe-d) in samples were determined
   to clarify the spatial distribution of iron and explore its impact
   factors. The mean contents of Fe-T, Fe-p, Fe-o and Fe-d were 28079.4,
   152.0, 617.2 and 8285.3 mg.kg(-1) of soil at 0-40 cm depth in the
   different sites, respectively. The means were significantly different
   across communities along the hydrological gradient, with the higher
   values for SA on the upper intertidal zone and for SPA on the lower
   intertidal zone, respectively. Iron and its forms were positively
   correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and clay, and negatively correlated with
   electrical conductivity (EC). The indexes of iron oxides (Fe-p/Fe-d,
   Fe-o/Fe-d and Fe-d /Fe-T) were also different across communities, with a
   higher value for SA, which were positively correlated with soil water
   content (WC) and TOC. The results indicate that a variety of plant
   community and soil property derived from the difference of hydrology
   might result in a spatial heterogeneity of iron in estuarine wetlands.},

Title = {Sex Differences Dictate the Movement Patterns of Striped Hyenas, Hyaena
   hyaena, in a Human-Dominated Landscape},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Large-carnivore populations have experienced significant declines in the
   past centuries in extended parts of the world. Habitat loss,
   fragmentation, and depletion of natural resources are some of the main
   causes of this decline. Consequently, behavioral flexibility, enabling
   the exploitation of anthropogenic food resources in highly disturbed
   human-dominated landscapes, is becoming critical for the survival of
   large carnivores. These behavioral changes increase the potential for
   human-large carnivore conflict and can further intensify carnivore
   persecution. Here, we examine how land cover types (representing a
   gradient of anthropogenic disturbance) alter the behavior of striped
   hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) in a human-dominated landscape in Israel, and
   whether differences in life history between males and females affect
   their reaction to such disturbances and consequently their level of
   exposure to humans. We used a Hidden Markov Model on GPS-tracking data
   for seven striped hyenas to segment individual-night trajectories into
   behavioral states (resting, searching, and traveling). We then used
   multinomial logistic regression to model hyenas' behavioral state as a
   function of the interaction between land cover and sex. Females traveled
   less than males both in terms of average distance traveled per hour, per
   night, and nightly net displacement. Most steps were classified as
   ``searching{''} for females and as ``traveling{''} for males. Female
   hyenas spent a higher proportion of time in human-dominated areas and a
   lower proportion in natural areas compared to males, and they were also
   more likely to be found close to settlements than males. Females changed
   their time allocation between natural and human-dominated areas,
   spending more time resting than traveling in natural areas but not in
   human-dominated ones; males spent more time searching than resting in
   human-dominated areas but were equally likely to rest or search in
   natural ones. The differences in life history between male and female
   hyenas may reflect different motivations for space use as a means to
   optimize fitness, which affects their exposure to humans and therefore
   their potential involvement in human-hyenas conflict. Understanding the
   mechanisms that lead to behavioral change in response to human
   disturbance is important for adaptive management and promoting human
   large-carnivores co-existence in general.},

Title = {Octopus Fishing and New Information on Ecology and Fishing of the
   Shallow-Water Octopus Callistoctopus furvus (Gould, 1852) Based on the
   Local Ecological Knowledge of Octopus Fishers in the Marine Ecoregions
   of Brazil},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Studies that compile local ecological knowledge (LEK) on some of the
   various species of living beings observe biological data and are notably
   fundamental for effectively managing fisheries, supporting management
   strategies for protected areas, species conservation, and other factors.
   In this study, ethnoecological approaches were used to focus on the
   octopus Callistoctopus furvus (Gould, 1852), recently re-described and
   re-presented to the academic community more than a century after its
   discovery. The LEK of octopus fishers from different marine ecoregions
   of Brazil was compared to identify the distribution limits of the
   species along the Brazilian coast. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted in 16 municipalities across four marine ecoregions located
   between the states of Ceara (northern limit) and Santa Catarina
   (southern limit), between March 2018 and August 2019. The results of the
   187 interviews indicated a traditionality of fishing among artisanal
   octopus fishers, who are mostly men, although some are women who also
   share information on the fishing of C. furvus and hold leadership
   positions in the fishing colony. Cronbach's alpha was used to analyze
   reliability of the form used in the interviews. A logistic regression
   model with binomial distribution was used to assess whether the
   probability of capturing the ``eastern octopus{''} was associated with
   some of the interview variables. A cluster analysis based only on the
   respondents who caught the ``eastern octopus{''} indicated the formation
   of groups and revealed greater dissimilarities among the fishers from
   the southeastern marine ecoregion of Brazil due to the fishing method
   used in the region. Heat maps showed that most of the information on the
   species was obtained in the eastern marine ecoregion of Brazil. The
   occurrence of the ``eastern octopus{''} was recorded in all the studied
   Brazilian marine ecoregions. Moreover, this study revealed the relevant
   contribution of fishers' knowledge to the distribution diagnosis of
   species with scarce scientific information.},

Title = {Risk assessment of cadmium pollution in selenium rich areas based on
   machine learning in the context of carbon emission reduction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Machine learning is of great value for the situation analysis and
   scientific prevention and control of soil heavy metal pollution risk. In
   this paper, taking the selenium rich area as the research object, the
   improved Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was used
   to construct the risk assessment model of Cd pollution in this area.
   Firstly, the content of Cd and Se in the soil of the study area was
   statistically analyzed based on descriptive statistics and correlation
   analysis. Then, a three-layer BP neural network structure was designed
   and optimized by GA algorithm. The individual coding length was
   calculated by connecting weights and thresholds of Cd and Se elements.
   Based on 97 groups of field data in this area, the experimental results
   show that the BP model optimized by GA has faster convergence speed,
   maintains good generalization ability on the test sample points.
   Compared with multiple linear regression model (MLRM), GA-BP reduces
   RMSE by 64.84, 52.12, 49.53, and 63.18\% compared with M5. The accuracy
   of estimating Cd pollution status in different areas by GA-BP neural
   network model is higher than the other three regression models on the
   whole. In the whole research region, the samples in the safe interval,
   relatively safe interval, light pollution interval, moderate pollution
   interval and severe pollution interval accounted for 4.12, 8.24, 42.26,
   17.52 and 27.86\%, respectively, and the prediction results of soil Cd
   pollution level showed that only 12.36\% of the samples were in a safe
   state without the risk of Cd pollution, while most of the samples were
   in a mild state. Because of the huge potential of carbon sequestration
   and emission reduction in agriculture, planting se-rich and Cd-low crops
   in these areas can not only promote the development of local Se-rich
   industries but also achieve carbon sequestration and emission reduction.},

Title = {Automatic differentiation and the optimization of differential equation
   models in biology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {A computational revolution unleashed the power of artificial neural
   networks. At the heart of that revolution is automatic differentiation,
   which calculates the derivative of a performance measure relative to a
   large number of parameters. Differentiation enhances the discovery of
   improved performance in large models, an achievement that was previously
   difficult or impossible. Recently, a second computational advance
   optimizes the temporal trajectories traced by differential equations.
   Optimization requires differentiating a measure of performance over a
   trajectory, such as the closeness of tracking the environment, with
   respect to the parameters of the differential equations. Because model
   trajectories are usually calculated numerically by multistep algorithms,
   such as Runge-Kutta, the automatic differentiation must be passed
   through the numerical algorithm. This article explains how such
   automatic differentiation of trajectories is achieved. It also discusses
   why such computational breakthroughs are likely to advance theoretical
   and statistical studies of biological problems, in which one can
   consider variables as dynamic paths over time and space. Many common
   problems arise between improving success in computational learning
   models over performance landscapes, improving evolutionary fitness over
   adaptive landscapes, and improving statistical fits to data over
   information landscapes.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Substantial differentiation was found between Ostrinia populations,
   adapted to feed on dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous host plants,
   which results not only in oviposition and larval survival differences
   but also in formation of ethological premating sex isolation mechanisms.
   Two strategies are surmised in warmer and colder areas, correspondingly:
   wide range of host plant species in combination with strict
   developmental stages of the plant, and alternatively, few host plant are
   infested during almost all the stages of their development, Inside these
   strategies, tactics are plastic. They are activated by the sensory
   stimuli, such as temperature, humidity and odorants. The tactic of
   dispersal flight before mating could be beneficial when the host plant
   is abundant, but mating before the flight is a better choice under the
   situation of sparse cornfields. There are still multiple questions to
   address for clear understanding of Ostrinia behavior and evolution.},

Title = {Allelopathic potential and allelochemical composition in different soil
   layers of Rhododendron delavayi forest, southwest China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Forests habituated by Rhododendron delavayi often lack understory
   vegetation, which could possibly be a consequence of allelopathy. It is
   a phenomenon by virtue of which certain plant species produce
   allelochemicals that affect the growth and behavior of surrounding
   plants. To elucidate the allelopathic potential and allelochemicals
   present in the different layers of a R. delavayi forest, extracts
   obtained from three layers of the forest were used for seed germination
   bioassays and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.
   Aqueous extracts of the litter and humus Layers significantly inhibited
   the seed germination of R. delavayi, Festuca arundinacea, and Lolium
   perenne, with the litter layer causing the strongest inhibitory effect.
   A total of 26 allelochemicals were identified in the litter, humus, and
   soil layers by GC-MS analysis. The primary allelochemicats in the soil
   and humus layer were organic acids, while the main allelochemicals in
   the litter layer were phenolic acids. The redundancy analysis revealed
   the significance of total nitrogen (TN) and relative water content (RWC)
   in explaining the distribution of the allelochemicats. The results
   indicated that the litter layer exerted the maximum allelopathic effect
   due to presence of maximum amount of allelochemical especially the
   phenolic acids.},

Title = {Stable isotopes in monitoring terrestrial arthropods},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Monitoring of arthropods focuses typically on changes in population and
   range size over time. Yet, there are a myriad of other aspects that
   could and should be monitored under the ongoing global and local
   environmental change. Stable isotope analysis, widely employed in
   short-term ecological studies, has potential in long-term monitoring of
   arthropods. Here we discuss the use of stable isotopes in monitoring
   terrestrial arthropods, provide some empirical examples of the use of
   bulk tissue samples in stable isotope analysis, and outline future
   directions in using compound-specific stable isotope analysis in
   monitoring. We performed a literature search for 2012-2021 to see if
   stable isotopes have been specifically used in monitoring of terrestrial
   arthropods. The literature shows that stable isotopes have been
   successfully used to reveal ecological phenomena (dispersal, trophic
   interactions, resource use) that would have been difficult or impossible
   to detect by other means. Yet, stable isotopes have been underused in
   arthropod monitoring programs, but the growing number of basic studies
   on stable isotope ecology and methodology provides crucial basis needed
   for developing monitoring programs. Stable isotopes provide technically,
   economically and ecologically feasible addition to the traditional
   monitoring methods of terrestrial arthropods.},

Title = {Multiple dimensions of niche specialization explain changes in species'
   range area, occupancy, and population size},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {In response to environmental change, species may decrease or increase in
   population size across their range, expand or contract their range
   limits, or alter how sites are occupied within their existing range.
   Shifts in range limits and widespread changes in population size have
   been documented in birds especially in response to changes in climate.
   Range occupancy, or how patchily or continuously a species is
   distributed within their range, has been studied less in the context of
   anthropogenic changes but may be expected to decrease with range-wide
   population size if abundance-occupancy relationships are generally
   positive. Determining which properties of species are related to range
   expansion or contraction or increased range occupancy or decreased range
   occupancy is useful in developing an understanding of which species
   become ``winners{''} or ``losers{''} under global change. Species with
   broader climatic niches may be more likely to successfully expand to new
   sites as climate changes. Range occupancy can be related to habitat
   preferences of species, and habitat specialization may predict how
   species fill in sites within their range. To examine how species niche
   breadth may explain changes in species distributions, we modeled how
   changes in range-wide population size, range extent, and range occupancy
   from 1976 to 2016 were predicted by species' climate, habitat, and diet
   niche breadth for 77 North American breeding bird species. We found that
   climate generalists were more likely to be increasing in range area,
   while species with declining population trends were likely to be
   contracting in range area and in occupancy within their range.
   Understanding how different dimensions of specialization relate to
   shifts in species distributions may improve predictions of which species
   are expected to benefit from or be vulnerable to anthropogenic change.},

Abstract = {Based on local cities' climate change data and the operating income data
   of Chinese listed enterprises from 2008 to 2019, we study the impact of
   climate change on enterprises' sales ability and analyze its subsequent
   influence on their sales revenue from three dimensions: inside
   enterprises, the supply side and the demand side. The results show that
   climate change reduces enterprises' sales revenue. From enterprises'
   internal perspective, climate change reduces production efficiency,
   increases management costs and the impact on the cost of sales is not
   obvious. From the demand side, climate change increases business risks
   and reduces transactions between large customers and enterprises. The
   share of sales from large customers is reduced, but no obvious impact is
   observed for small customers. On the supply side, climate change reduces
   business credit levels, which in turn reduces sales revenue. A
   heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of climate change on sales
   revenue is more obvious in private enterprises, enterprises with weak
   internal controls and enterprises in central and western regions of

Title = {Using media reports to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of carbon
   dioxide management development in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Over the past few decades, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions management
   problem has attracted global attention. China is transitioning to carbon
   neutrality and experienced rapid development in low-carbon management.
   However, current studies have limited understanding of the evolutionary
   process and development issues at a macro-level, which may hinder the
   structural reformation of stepwise carbon-neutral development. This
   study used the content analysis method to process and code reports from
   China's most prominent news media, Xinhua News Agency, to identify
   China's low-carbon evolution and development issues. The results depict
   a trend of gradually increasing carbon management within China and
   highlight the staged development features. Years 2010 and 2021 are the
   critical nodes of carbon emissions management in China, representing the
   two primary actions of low-carbon pilot city projects and the
   carbon-neutral construction. However, the results also reveal the uneven
   development problem of China's carbon management behind the rapid
   transition. The government is the primary participant in carbon
   management, but the participation of firms and the public is relatively
   low. The power industry implements the highest amount of carbon
   management actions, but less attention is paid to other sectors with
   high carbon emissions. Report tones on environmental protection and
   green technology have gradually declined, while the tone on economic and
   social development has increased. There are evident differences in the
   number of carbon management measures implemented between regions. The
   southeast coastal regions report more management numbers than China's
   central and western regions. The top three provinces (or municipalities)
   are Beijing (131), Shanghai (93), and Guangdong (78). From an industry
   perspective, more-reported regions have implemented carbon management
   measures in more industries than less-reported regions. This study
   provides a distinctive contribution to the theoretical work on China's
   carbon emissions regulation and the emerging planning and management
   mechanisms.},

Title = {Combining food web theory and population dynamics to assess the impact

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The impacts of invasive species on resident communities are driven by a
   tangle of ecological interactions difficult to quantify empirically.
   Combining a niche model with a population dynamic model, both
   allometrically parametrized, may represent a consistent framework to
   investigate invasive species impacts on resident communities in a food
   web context when empirical data are scarce. We used this framework to
   assess the ecological consequences of an invasive apex predator (Silurus
   glanis) in peri-Alpine lake food webs. Both increases and decreases of
   resident species abundances were highlighted and differed when
   accounting for different S. glanis body sizes. Complementarily, the
   prominence of indirect effects, such as trophic cascades, suggested that
   common approaches may only capture a restricted fraction of invasion
   consequences through direct predation or competition. By leveraging
   widely available biodiversity data, our approach may provide relevant
   insights for a comprehensive assessment and management of invasive
   species impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Historical reconstruction of aquatic vegetation of typical lakes in
   Northeast China based on an improved CA-Markov model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Aquatic vegetation is an important marker of the change in the lake
   ecosystem. It plays an important supporting role in the lake ecosystem,
   and its abundance and cover changes affect the ecosystem balance.
   Collecting accurate long-term distribution data on aquatic vegetation
   can help monitor the change in the lake ecosystem, thereby providing
   scientific support for efforts to maintain the balance of the ecosystem.
   This work aimed to establish an improved CA-Markov model to reconstruct
   historical potential distribution of aquatic vegetation in the two
   typical lakes (Xingkai Lake and Hulun Lake) in Northeast China during
   1950s to 1960s. We firstly analyzed remote sensing data on the spatial
   distribution of aquatic vegetation data in two lakes in six periods from
   the 1970 to 2015. Then, we built a transfer probability matrix for
   changes in hydrothermal conditions (temperature and precipitation) based
   on similar periods, and we designed suitability images using the spatial
   frequency and temporal continuity of the constraints. Finally, we
   established an improved CA-Markov model based on the transfer
   probability matrix and suitability images to reconstruct the potential
   distributions of aquatic vegetation in the two northeastern lakes during
   the 1950s and 1960s. The results showed the areas of aquatic vegetation
   in the 1950s and 1960s were 102.37 km(2) and 100.7 km(2) for Xingkai
   Lake and 90.81 km(2) and 88.15 km(2) for Hulun Lake, respectively.
   Compared with the traditional CA-Markov model, the overall accuracy of
   the improved model increased by more than 50\%, which proved the
   improved CA-Markov model can be used to effectively reconstruct the
   historical potential distribution of aquatic vegetation. This study
   provides an accurate methodology for simulating the potential historical
   distributions of aquatic vegetation to enrich the study of the
   historical evolution of lake ecosystem.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The mitochondrial genomes are very diverse, but their evolutionary
   history is unclear due to the lack of efforts to sequence those of
   protists (unicellular eukaryotes), which cover a major part of the
   eukaryotic tree. Cryptista comprises cryptophytes, goniomonads,
   kathablepharids, and Palpitomonas bilix, and their mitochondrial genomes
   (mt-genomes) are characterized by various gene contents, particularly
   the presence/absence of an ancestral (bacterial) system for the
   cytochrome c maturation system. To shed light on mt-genome evolution in
   Cryptista, we report the complete mt-genome of Microheliella maris,
   which was recently revealed to branch at the root of Cryptista. The M.
   maris mt-genome was reconstructed as a circular mapping chromosome of
   61.2 kbp with a pair of inverted repeats (12.9 kbp) and appeared to be
   the most gene-rich among the mt-genomes of the members of Diaphoretickes
   (a mega-scale eukaryotic assembly including Archaeplastida, Cryptista,
   Haptista, and SAR) studied so far, carrying 53 protein-coding genes.
   With this newly sequenced mt-genome, we inferred and discussed the
   evolution of the mt-genome in Cryptista and Diaphoretickes.},

   fungal structures},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {There are a considerable number of discussions aimed at analyzing
   microbial communities and their functions during the composting process.
   However, microbial succession under copper (Cu) and tetracycline
   (TCH)-stressed conditions has received less attention. Thus, this work
   analyzed the bacterial and fungal structures with high-throughput
   sequencing in Cu/TCH-amended composting (Cu: 0, 100, and 500 mg/kg; TCH:
   0, 50, and 300 mg/kg), and the dominating controls on microbial
   diversity were identified using redundancy analysis (RDA) and structural
   equation models (SEMs). Low-concentration Cu increased the peak
   temperature (57 degrees C) at the thermophilic phase. Composting
   phase-derived changes in bacterial and fungal communities were
   significant, while Cu and TCH showed a remarkable influence on fungi but
   not on bacteria. Cu and TCH inhibited Firmicutes' activity while
   promoting Actinobacteriota growth. Low-concentration Cu and TCH had a
   negative effect on Basidiomycota in the thermophilic phase and a
   positive influence on Chytridiomycota in the mature phase. TOC and TN
   were primary controls on the changes in microbial communities. NH4+-N
   and NO3--N were more beneficial to fungi with a contribution proportion
   of 42.13 and 16.85\%, respectively. These findings could provide
   theoretical guidance for the directional research on microbial
   inoculants.},

   barcoding databases for the advancement of museomics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Museomics is an approach to the DNA sequencing of museum specimens that
   can generate both biodiversity and sequence information. In this study,
   we surveyed both the biodiversity information-based database BOLD
   (Barcode of Life System) and the sequence information database GenBank,
   by using DNA barcoding data as an example, with the aim of integrating
   the data from these two databases. DNA barcoding is a method of
   identifying species from DNA sequences by using short genetic markers.
   We surveyed how many entries had biodiversity information (such as links
   to BOLD and specimen IDs) by downloading all fish, insect, and flowering
   plant data available from the GenBank Nucleotide, and BOLD ID was
   assigned to 26.2\% of entries for insects. In the same way, we
   downloaded the respective BOLD data and checked the status of links to
   sequence information. We also investigated how many species do these
   databases cover, and 7,693 species were found to exist only in BOLD. In
   the future, as museomics develops as a field, the targeted sequences
   will be extended not only to DNA barcodes, but also to mitochondrial
   genomes, other genes, and genome sequences. Consequently, the value of
   the sequence data will increase. In addition, various species will be
   sequenced and, thus, biodiversity information such as the evidence
   specimen photographs used as a basis for species identification, will
   become even more indispensable. This study contributes to the

Title = {Suitable grazing during the regrowth period promotes plant diversity in
   winter pastures in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Vegetation is a crucial component of any ecosystem and to preserve the
   health and stability of grassland ecosystems, species diversity is
   important. The primary form of grassland use globally is livestock
   grazing, hence many studies focus on how plant diversity is affected by
   the grazing intensity, differential use of grazing time and livestock
   species. Nevertheless, the impact of the grazing time on plant diversity
   remains largely unexplored. We performed a field survey on the winter
   pastures in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to
   examine the effects of grazing time on the vegetation traits. Livestock
   species, grazing stocking rates and the initiation time of the grazing
   were similar, but termination times of the grazing differed. The grazing
   termination time has a significant effect on most of the vegetation
   traits in the winter pastures. The vegetation height, above-ground
   biomass, and the Graminoids biomass was negatively related to the
   grazing termination time in the winter pastures. In contrast, vegetation
   cover and plant diversity initially increased and subsequently decreased
   again as the grazing termination time was extended. An extension of the
   grazing time did not have any effect on the biomass of forbs. Our study
   is the first to investigate the effects of grazing during the regrowth
   period on vegetation traits and imply that the plant diversity is
   mediated by the grazing termination time during the regrowth period in
   winter pastures. These findings could be used to improve the guidelines
   for livestock grazing management and policies of summer and winter
   pasture grazing of family pastures on the QTP from the perspective of
   plant diversity protection.},

Title = {Aerial insectivorous bats in the Brazilian-Uruguayan savanna: Modelling
   the occupancy through acoustic detection},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {The Pampa is the least protected and one of the least sampled for bats
   among the Brazilian domains. This leads to significant Linnean and
   Wallacean shortfalls for bats in the Brazilian-Uruguayan savanna
   ecoregion. Here, we aimed to model the occupancy of aerial insectivorous
   bats in response to landscape structure at different scales, considering
   the influence of microclimate on bat detection. We acoustically
   monitored 68 locations during the spring and summer of 2019/2020,
   gathering data on temperature and humidity associated with each acoustic
   record using data loggers. We detected at least 11 species of the
   Molossidae and the Vespertilionidae families, of which 9 were used in
   the model. The response to landscape structure was species-specific: the
   occupancy probability of Eptesicus brasiliensis and Molossus cf.
   currentium increased with landscape connectivity at the 500 m scale
   while Eptesicus furinalis and Histiotus cf. velatus were negatively
   affected by landscape connectivity at the 5.0 km scale. Molossus
   occupancy probability responded negatively to landscape heterogeneity at
   the 3.0 km scale, while Promops centralis responded positively to
   landscape heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale. Molossus rufus responded
   negatively to native vegetation cover and positively to landscape
   heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale. Myotis albescens and Molossops
   temminckii did not respond significantly to any of the evaluated
   landscape metrics. Our results show that different bat species perceive
   the landscape differently, regardless of the guild of use of space -
   edge- or open-space forager. Our estimate of projected occupancy for the
   areas contiguous to those sampled ranged from 0.45 to 0.70 for the whole
   of the bat taxa, suggesting that the landscape, particularly where it
   still maintains its native elements, is reasonably favourable to aerial
   insectivores.},

Title = {Microwear textures associated with experimental near-natural diets
   suggest that seeds and hard insect body parts cause high enamel surface
   complexity in small mammals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {In mammals, complex dental microwear textures (DMT) representing
   differently sized and shaped enamel lesions overlaying each other have
   traditionally been associated with the seeds and kernels in frugivorous
   diets, as well as with sclerotized insect cuticles. Recently, this
   notion has been challenged by field observations as well as in vitro
   experimental data. It remains unclear to what extent each food item
   contributes to the complexity level and is reflected by the surface
   texture of the respective tooth position along the molar tooth row. To
   clarify the potential of seeds and other abrasive dietary items to cause
   complex microwear textures, we conducted a controlled feeding experiment
   with rats. Six individual rats each received either a vegetable mix, a
   fruit mix, a seed mix, whole crickets, whole black soldier fly larvae,
   or whole day-old-chicks. These diets were subjected to material testing
   to obtain mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, yield
   strength, and food hardness (as indicated by texture profile analysis
   {[}TPA] tests). Seeds and crickets caused the highest surface
   complexity. The fruit mix, seed mix, and crickets caused the deepest
   wear features. Moreover, several diets resulted in an increasing wear
   gradient from the first to the second molar, suggesting that increasing
   bite force along the tooth row affects dental wear in rats on these
   diets. Mechanical properties of the diets showed different correlations
   with DMT obtained for the first and second molars. The first molar wear
   was mostly correlated with maximum TPA hardness, while the second molar
   wear was strongly correlated with maximum yield stress, mean TPA
   hardness, and maximum TPA hardness. This indicates a complex
   relationship between chewing mechanics, food mechanical properties, and
   observed DMT. Our results show that, in rats, seeds are the main cause
   of complex microwear textures but that hard insect body parts can also
   cause high complexity. However, the similarity in parameter values of
   surface textures resulting from seed and cricket consumption did not
   allow differentiation between these two diets in our experimental
   approach.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The riverine barrier hypothesis has been extensively explored in
   Neotropical rainforests, while its importance in drier regions such as
   the Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil,
   has only recently received more attention. The Caatinga is bisected by
   the Sao Francisco River (SFR), which has long been suggested to be an
   important biogeographic feature in the region. However, recent studies
   have found mixed support for the role of the SFR as a hard barrier, most
   of them relying on the presence or absence of genetic breaks congruent
   with its course. Here, we used published multilocus and next-generation
   data from six vertebrate species to test the SFR's strength as a
   barrier. Using model-based approaches (approximate Bayesian computation
   and supervised machine learning), we tested demographic models
   incorporating full, intermediate, and zero migration across the SFR,
   estimating divergence times and migration rates for each species. We
   found support for the SFR's role as a barrier, allowing gene flow for
   some species. Estimated divergence times varied among species but are
   limited to the late Pleistocene, coherent with one of several proposed
   paleocourse changes in the river's geological history. Contrary to the
   mixed results of previous studies, our study supports the SFR as an
   important phylogeographic barrier across different taxonomic groups,
   driving diversification in the Caatinga.},

   health-Evidence from Tianjin city of China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {The increasingly intensifying global warming and urban heat island
   (UHIs) are seriously damaging the physical and mental health of urban
   residents. However, the spatiotemporal evolution of how high
   temperatures affect human health in megacities remains unclear.
   Therefore, in this study, with Tianjin during 2006-2020 as an example,
   and based on data from meteorological stations, Landsat remote sensing
   images, and point of interest big data, this study applied hot- and
   cold-spot statistics and remote sensing retrieval in numerical modeling
   and established an appraisal system to assess how and to what extent
   UHIs affect resident health. The results showed that the overall
   influence of UHIs on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mental
   health increased to 373 km(2) in area and two levels in intensity; the
   influence was mainly concentrated in the downtown area, with a rising
   influence level. Owing to the dual-core structure of the city, the
   influence was distributed along the main traffic lines in Binhai New
   District, having a strong influence in the area mainly concentrated in
   the southeastern part. Many cold spots clustered in the central urban
   area to cool the thermal environment: the cooled area was 6.5 times
   larger than the area of intense cooling influence. Our study provides a
   method for identifying health risks in urban spaces, lays a theoretical
   foundation to improve the planning of urban green space systems, and
   offers some decision-making guidance for the planning of healthy cities.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal variation and ecological risk assessment of sediment
   heavy metals in two hydrologically connected lakes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Excessive accumulation of heavy metals in global lake sediments poses a
   serious threat to lake water quality and ecosystem security. However,
   there is still a knowledge gap in comparison of heavy metal variation
   and pollution in hydrologically connected lakes. In this study,
   concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn in sediments of two
   hydrologically connected lakes, Xingkai Lake and Xiaoxingkai Lake, were
   determined during the hydrologically connected periods (May and
   September) and disconnected period (January and July) in 2021. We found
   the range of As was 2.58 similar to 14.35 mg/kg, Cd was 0.050 similar to
   0.21 mg/kg, Cr was 28.58 similar to 262.3 mg/kg, Cu was 3.12 similar to
   28.05 mg/kg, Hg was 0.0030 similar to 0.14 mg/kg, Pb was 10.87 similar
   to 58.86 mg/kg, and Zn was 18.21 similar to 90.73 mg/kg. Heavy metal
   concentrations were lower than grade I level in Chinese soil quality
   standards with significant spatial and temporal differences in the
   basin. Overall, most of the sampling sites in Xingkai Lake and
   Xiaoxingkai Lake were at the uncontaminated level and moderate
   ecological risk during the sampling period. Two lakes showed different
   heavy metal compositions, accompanied by higher contamination level and
   higher potential ecological risk in the small lake than those in the
   large lake based on analysis of the geo-accumulation index and potential
   ecological risk index. Besides, the contamination level and potential
   ecological risk in May and September were higher than those in January
   and July, mainly due to human activities and hydrological connectivity.
   The ecological risks were moderate for Cd and Hg, and low for As, Cr,
   Cu, Pb, and Zn. Correlation and PCA analyses showed that Cd mainly
   originated from anthropogenic sources, while other metals mainly came
   from natural sources. These findings elucidate the effects of
   agriculture and hydrological connectivity on heavy metals in sediments,
   and provide scientific basis for the reasonable management of lake
   ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Integrating the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly
   affecting target traits from imputed whole-genome sequencing (iWGS) data
   into the genomic prediction (GP) model is an economic, efficient, and
   feasible strategy to improve prediction accuracy. The objective was to
   dissect the genetic architecture of intramuscular fat content (IFC) by
   genome wide association studies (GWAS) and to investigate the accuracy
   of GP based on pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP) model, genomic best linear
   unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models and Bayesian mixture (BayesMix)
   models under different strategies. A total of 482 Suhuai pigs were
   genotyped using an 80 K SNP chip. Furthermore, 30 key samples were
   selected for resequencing and were used as a reference panel to impute
   the 80 K chip data to the WGS dataset. The 80 K data and iWGS data were
   used to perform GWAS and test GP accuracies under different scenarios.
   GWAS results revealed that there were four major regions affecting IFC.
   Two important functional candidate genes were found in the two most
   significant regions, including protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE) and
   myosin light chain 2 (MYL2). The results of the predictions showed that
   the PBLUP model had the lowest reliability (0.096 +/- 0.032). The
   reliability (0.229 +/- 0.035) was improved by replacing pedigree
   information with 80 K chip data. Compared with using 80 K SNPs alone,
   pruning iWGS SNPs with the R-squared cutoff of linkage disequilibrium
   (0.55) led to a slight improvement (0.006), adding significant iWGS SNPs
   led to an improvement of reliability by 0.050 when using a one-component
   GBLUP, a further increase of 0.033 when using a two-component GBLUP
   model. For BayesMix models, compared with using 80 K SNPs alone, adding
   additional significant iWGS SNPs into one- or two-component BayesMix
   models led to improvements of reliabilities for IFC by 0.040 and 0.089,
   respectively. Our results may facilitate further identification of
   causal genes for IFC and may be beneficial for the improvement of IFC in
   pig breeding programs.},

Title = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics of Atlantic cod spatial behavior maintained

Abstract = {The effects of marine reserves on the life history and demography of the
   protected populations are well-established, typically increasing
   population density and body size. However, little is known about how
   marine reserves may alter the behavior of the populations that are the
   target of protection. In theory, marine reserves can relax selection on
   spatial behavioral phenotypes that were previously targeted by the
   fishery and also drive selection in favor of less mobile individuals. In
   this study, we used acoustic telemetry to monitor the individual spatial
   behavior of 566 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758) moving within
   a marine reserve and a control site in southern Norway, starting 1 year
   before the implementation of the marine reserve and lasting up to 9
   years after. Following a before-after-control-impact approach, we
   investigated changes in (1) survival, (2) selection acting on behavioral
   traits, and (3) mean behavioral phenotypes, after the implementation of
   the marine reserve. We focused on three behavioral traits commonly used
   to describe the mobility of aquatic animals: home range size, depth
   position, and diel vertical migration range. Survival increased after
   reserve implementation, but contrary to our expectations, it
   subsequently decreased to preprotection levels after just 3 years.
   Further, we found no significance in selection patterns acting on any of
   the three behavioral traits after reserve implementation. Although some
   changes related to water column use (the tendency to occupy deeper
   waters) were observed in the marine reserve after 9 years, they cannot
   unequivocally be attributed to protection. Our results show that
   survival and behavioral responses to marine reserves in some cases may
   be more complex than previously anticipated and highlight the need for
   appropriately scaled management experiments and more integrated
   approaches to understand the effects of marine protected areas on
   harvested aquatic species.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies of cancer-related genes not only provide novel
   information about their evolution and function but also an understanding
   of cancer as a driving force in biological systems and species' life
   histories. So far, these studies have focused on mammals. Here, we
   provide the first comparative study of cancer-related gene copy number
   variation in fish. Fishes are a paraphyletic group whose last common
   ancestor is also an ancestor of the tetrapods, and accordingly, their
   tumour suppression mechanisms should include most of the mammalian
   mechanisms and also reveal novel (but potentially phylogenetically
   older) previously undetected mechanisms. We have matched the sequenced
   genomes of 65 fish species from the Ensemble database with the cancer
   gene information from the COSMIC database. By calculating the number of
   gene copies across species using the Ensembl CAFE data (providing
   species trees for gene copy number counts), we used a less
   resource-demanding method for homolog identification. Our analysis
   demonstrates a masked relationship between cancer-related gene copy
   number variation (CNV) and maximum lifespan in fish species, suggesting
   that a higher number of copies of tumour suppressor genes lengthens and
   the number of copies of oncogenes shortens lifespan. Based on the
   positive correlation between the number of copies of tumour suppressors
   and oncogenes, we show which species have more tumour suppressors in
   relation to oncogenes. It could be suggested that these species have
   stronger genetic defences against oncogenic processes. Fish studies
   could be a largely unexplored treasure trove for understanding the
   evolution and ecology of cancer, providing novel insights into the study
   of cancer and tumour suppression, in addition to fish evolution,
   life-history trade-offs, and ecology.},

Title = {Using landscape genomics to delineate future adaptive potential for
   climate change in the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {An essential goal in conservation biology is delineating population
   units that maximize the probability of species persisting into the
   future and adapting to future environmental change. However,
   future-facing conservation concerns are often addressed using
   retrospective patterns that could be irrelevant. We recommend a novel
   landscape genomics framework for delineating future ``Geminate
   Evolutionary Units{''} (GEUs) in a focal species: (1) identify loci
   under environmental selection, (2) model and map adaptive conservation
   units that may spawn future lineages, (3) forecast relative selection
   pressures on each future lineage, and (4) estimate their fitness and
   likelihood of persistence using geo-genomic simulations. Using this
   process, we delineated conservation units for the Yosemite toad
   (Anaxyrus canorus), a U.S. federally threatened species that is highly
   vulnerable to climate change. We used a genome-wide dataset, redundancy
   analysis, and Bayesian association methods to identify 24 candidate loci
   responding to climatic selection (R-2 ranging from 0.09 to 0.52), after
   controlling for demographic structure. Candidate loci included genes
   such as MAP3K5, involved in cellular response to environmental change.
   We then forecasted future genomic response to climate change using the
   multivariate machine learning algorithm Gradient Forests. Based on all
   available evidence, we found three GEUs in Yosemite National Park,
   reflecting contrasting adaptive optima: YF-North (high winter snowpack
   with moderate summer rainfall), YF-East (low to moderate snowpack with
   high summer rainfall), and YF-Low-Elevation (low snowpack and rainfall).
   Simulations under the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario suggest that the
   species will decline by 29\% over 90 years, but the highly diverse
   YF-East lineage will be least impacted for two reasons: (1)
   geographically it will be sheltered from the largest climatic selection
   pressures, and (2) its standing genetic diversity will promote a faster
   adaptive response. Our approach provides a comprehensive strategy for
   protecting imperiled non-model species with genomic data alone and has
   wide applicability to other declining species.},

Abstract = {The study of eco-evolutionary dynamics, that is of the intertwinning
   between ecological and evolutionary processes when they occur at
   comparable time scales, is of growing interest in the current context of
   global change. However, many eco-evolutionary studies overlook the role
   of interindividual interactions, which are hard to predict and yet
   central to selective values. Here, we aimed at putting forward models
   that simulate interindividual interactions in an eco-evolutionary
   framework: the demo-genetic agent-based models (DG-ABMs). Being
   demo-genetic, DG-ABMs consider the feedback loop between ecological and
   evolutionary processes. Being agent-based, DG-ABMs follow populations of
   interacting individuals with sets of traits that vary among the
   individuals. We argue that the ability of DG-ABMs to take into account
   the genetic heterogeneity-that affects individual decisions/traits
   related to local and instantaneous conditions-differentiates them from
   analytical models, another type of model largely used by evolutionary
   biologists to investigate eco-evolutionary feedback loops. Based on the
   review of studies employing DG-ABMs and explicitly or implicitly
   accounting for competitive, cooperative or reproductive interactions, we
   illustrate that DG-ABMs are particularly relevant for the exploration of
   fundamental, yet pressing, questions in evolutionary ecology across
   various levels of organization. By jointly modelling the effects of
   management practices and other eco-evolutionary processes on
   interindividual interactions and population dynamics, DG-ABMs are also
   effective prospective and decision support tools to evaluate the short-
   and long-term evolutionary costs and benefits of management strategies
   and to assess potential trade-offs. Finally, we provide a list of the
   recent practical advances of the ABM community that should facilitate
   the development of DG-ABMs.},

Title = {Heteromorphic stamens are differentially attractive in Swartzia

Abstract = {The division of labour hypothesis between stamens has explained the
   evolution of divergent functions between dimorphic stamens in the same
   flower. However, little is known about whether the distinct type of
   stamens differs in attractiveness to pollinators. Therefore, we
   investigate whether the two types of stamens commonly found in Swartzia
   have different visual and olfactory attractants. We performed
   observations of anthesis dynamics, registration and collection of floral
   visitors, measurements of reflectance of floral parts and chemical
   analysis of the volatile organic compounds of the floral parts of two
   species, S. flaemingii and S. simplex. Both species have two distinct
   sets of stamens: one with smaller and abundant stamens in the centre of
   the flower and the other with fewer but larger abaxial stamens. The sets
   differ in UV reflectance (only S. simplex) and exhibit a distinct
   chromatic contrast. Concerning olfactory attractiveness, aliphatic
   compounds make up most of the odour of the two species, both whole
   flowers and most of their floral organs. On the other hand, only S.
   simplex presented apocarotenoids (as ionones) and benzenoids.
   Furthermore, there are differences in the proportion of volatiles
   emitted by the stamen in both cases, as the high proportion of
   sesquiterpenes among the smaller stamens compared to the larger ones. In
   conclusion, the two types of stamens found in S. flaemingii and S.
   simplex show a distinct attractiveness. In addition, our data have
   demonstrated diverse ways of differential attractiveness both between
   distinct stamens set per flower and between the two species from the
   same pollen flowers genus.
   The stamens of the same flower can differ in how they attract
   pollinators. The study by Basso-Alves et al.showed that the larger and
   smaller stamens in the genus Swartziahave different visual and olfactory
   signals. More surprising is that it was possible to observe that the
   strategies for attracting pollinators diverge between the two species
   studied. These differences include various types of signals, such as a
   visual pattern or a substance responsible for the floral odour, present
   in one species but absent in the other.},

Title = {Growth-limiting drought stress induces time-of-day-dependent
   transcriptome and physiological responses in hybrid poplar},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Drought is a life-changing event for long-lived forest trees. It
   influences all aspects of their growth and development; it limits their
   ability to capture carbon and increases their susceptibility to other
   stressors. In this study, we showed that poplar trees could experience
   the same amount of available water as a stress at one time of day, but
   not at another; we also showed that droughts of different severities
   affect the transcriptome in quantitatively and qualitatively different
   ways. Our findings suggest that responses to drought stress are
   temporally heterogeneous and are calibrated to account for the duration
   and severity of the drought.
   Drought stress negatively impacts the health of long-lived trees.
   Understanding the genetic mechanisms that underpin response to drought
   stress is requisite for selecting or enhancing climate change
   resilience. We aimed to determine how hybrid poplars respond to
   prolonged and uniform exposure to drought; how responses to moderate and
   more severe growth-limiting drought stresses differed; and how drought
   responses change throughout the day. We established hybrid poplar trees
   (Populus x `Okanese') from unrooted stem cutting with abundant soil
   moisture for 6 weeks. We then withheld water to establish well-watered,
   moderate and severe growth-limiting drought conditions. These conditions
   were maintained for 3 weeks during which growth was monitored. We then
   measured photosynthetic rates and transcriptomes of leaves that had
   developed during the drought treatments at two times of day. The
   moderate and severe drought treatments elicited distinct changes in
   growth and development, photosynthetic rates and global transcriptome
   profiles. Notably, the time of day of sampling produced the strongest
   effect in the transcriptome data. The moderate drought treatment
   elicited global transcriptome changes that were intermediate to the
   severe and well-watered treatments in the early evening but did not
   elicit a strong drought response in the morning. Stable drought
   conditions that are sufficient to limit plant growth elicit distinct
   transcriptional profiles depending on the degree of water limitation and
   on the time of day at which they are measured. There appears to be a
   limited number of genes and functional gene categories that are
   responsive to all of the tested drought conditions in this study
   emphasizing the complex nature of drought regulation in long-lived
   trees.},

Journal = {AOB PLANTS},

Abstract = {Affected by drought, the content of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs)
   in assimilation branches and secondary branches was significantly

   assimilation and carbon uptake were limited, resulting in slower growth.
   Under the influence of drought and salinity, the anisohydric properties

   limitation was relatively small.
   Drought and salt stress are important abiotic stressors that adversely
   affect the growth, resistance and survival of plants. Haloxylon
   ammodendron is a strong halophyte, and its hydraulic characteristics and
   carbon metabolism response to drought and salt stress under natural
   conditions have not been widely studied. With H. ammodendron as the
   research object, three sample plots with different water and salt
   contents (high water and high salt, medium salt in reclaimed water, low
   water and low salt) were selected to determine their water physiology,
   photosynthetic physiology, carbon physiology and growth status under
   different water and salt conditions. Studies have shown that drought and
   salinity affect the hydraulic properties of H. ammodendron, reducing the
   water content and water potential of assimilation branches and secondary
   branches and increasing the hydraulic conductivity per unit
   cross-sectional area of biennial shoots. Affected by drought, the
   content of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in assimilation branches
   and secondary branches was significantly reduced, and the NSC content of
   assimilating branches was significantly higher than that in secondary
   branches. The transportation of NSCs to the secondary branches caused
   obstacles, and more accumulated in the assimilating branches. In
   addition, drought reduced H. ammodendron photosynthesis and carbon
   assimilation and limited carbon uptake, resulting in slower growth.

Abstract = {Quantifying relationships between genetic variation and population
   viability is important from both basic biological and applied
   conservation perspectives, yet few populations have been monitored with
   both long-term demographic and population genetics approaches. To
   empirically test whether and how genetic variation and population
   dynamics are related, we present one such paired approach. First, we use
   eight years of historical demographic data from five populations of
   Boechera fecunda (Brassicaceae), a rare, self-compatible perennial plant
   endemic to Montana, USA, and use integral projection models to estimate
   the stochastic population growth rate (lambda(S)) and extinction risk of
   each population. We then combine these demographic estimates with
   previously published metrics of genetic variation in the same
   populations to test whether genetic diversity within populations is
   linked to demographic performance. Our results show that in this
   predominantly inbred species, standing genetic variation and demography
   are weakly positively correlated. However, the inbreeding coefficient
   was not strongly correlated with demographic performance, suggesting
   that more inbred populations are not necessarily less viable or at
   higher extinction risk than less inbred populations. A contemporary
   re-census of these populations revealed that neither genetic nor
   demographic parameters were consistently strong predictors of current
   population density, although populations showing lower probabilities of
   extinction in demographic models had larger population sizes at present.
   In the absence of evidence for inbreeding depression decreasing
   population viability in this species, we recommend conservation of
   distinct, potentially locally adapted populations of B. fecunda rather
   than alternatives such as translocations or reintroductions.},

Abstract = {For many clonally propagated species, the accumulation of somatic
   mutations is the principal driver of declines in yield and quality.
   However, somatic mutations may also promote genetic diversification.
   Thus, elucidating somatic mutation rates and patterns is important to
   understand the genetic basis undergirding the emergence of commercially
   valuable traits and developmental processes. In this study, we studied
   the effect of short-time clonal domestication of Populus alba var.
   pyramidalis, a species that has been propagated by cutting for the last
   67 years. We found that: (1) the somatic mutation rate for P. alba var.
   pyramidalis is 9.24 x 10(-9), which is higher than rates observed in
   related species; (2) there were more mutations near heterozygous
   regions, and a larger proportion of CpG and CHG sites were associated
   with somatic mutations, which may be related to the blocking of DNA
   repair by methylation; and (3) deleterious mutations were not shared by
   multiple individuals, and all occurred in heterozygous states,
   demonstrating the strong selective pressures that act against
   deleterious mutations. Taken together, the results of our study provide
   a global view of somatic mutation that will aid efforts to understand
   the genetic basis of commercially valuable traits and to improve
   clonally breeding species.},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation impacts the distribution of genetic diversity and
   population genetic structure. Therefore, protecting the evolutionary
   potential of species, especially in the context of the current rate of
   human-induced environmental change, is an important goal. In riverine
   ecosystems, migration barriers affect the genetic structure of native
   species, while also influencing the spread of invasive species. In this
   study, we compare genetic patterns of two native and one highly invasive
   riverine fish species in a Belgian river basin, namely the native
   three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and stone loach
   (Barbatula barbatula), and the non-native and invasive topmouth gudgeon
   (Pseudorasbora parva). We aimed to characterize both natural and
   anthropogenic determinants of genetic diversity and population genetic
   connectivity. Genetic diversity was highest in topmouth gudgeon,
   followed by stone loach and three-spined stickleback. The correlation
   between downstream distance and genetic diversity, a pattern often
   observed in riverine systems, was only marginally significant in stone
   loach and three-spined stickleback, while genetic diversity strongly
   declined with increasing number of barriers in topmouth gudgeon. An
   Isolation-By-Distance pattern characterizes the population genetic
   structure of each species. Population differentiation was only
   associated with migration barriers in the invasive topmouth gudgeon,
   while genetic composition of all species seemed at least partially
   determined by the presence of migration barriers. Among the six barrier
   types considered (watermills, sluices, tunnels, weirs, riverbed
   obstructions, and others), the presence of watermills was the strongest
   driver of genetic structure and composition. Our results indicate that
   conservation and restoration actions, focusing on conserving genetic
   patterns, cannot be generalized across species. Moreover, measures might
   target either on restoring connectivity, while risking a rapid spread of
   the invasive topmouth gudgeon, or not restoring connectivity, while
   risking native species extinction in upstream populations.},

Abstract = {Numerous terrestrial mammal species have experienced extensive
   population declines during past centuries, due largely to anthropogenic
   pressures. For some species, including the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra),
   environmental and legal protection has more recently led to population
   growth and recolonization of parts of their historic ranges. While
   heralded as conservation success, only few such recoveries have been
   examined from a genetic perspective, i.e. whether genetic variability
   and connectivity have been restored. We here use large-scale and
   long-term genetic monitoring data from UK otters, whose population
   underwent a well-documented population decline between the 1950s and
   1970s, to explore the dynamics of a population re-expansion over a
   21-year period. We genotyped otters from across Wales and England at
   five time points between 1994 and 2014 using 15 microsatellite loci. We
   used this combination of long-term temporal and large-scale spatial
   sampling to evaluate 3 hypotheses relating to genetic recovery that (i)
   gene flow between subpopulations would increase over time, (ii) genetic
   diversity of previously isolated populations would increase and that
   (iii) genetic structuring would weaken over time. Although we found an
   increase in inter-regional gene flow and admixture levels among
   subpopulations, there was no significant temporal change in either
   heterozygosity or allelic richness. Genetic structuring among the main
   subpopulations hence remained strong and showed a clear historical
   continuity. These findings highlight an underappreciated aspect of
   population recovery of endangered species: that genetic recovery may
   often lag behind the processes of spatial and demographic recovery. In
   other words, the restoration of the physical connectivity of populations
   does not necessarily lead to genetic connectivity. Our findings
   emphasize the need for genetic data as an integral part of conservation
   monitoring, to enable the potential vulnerability of populations to be
   evaluated.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The outcomes of biological control programs can be highly variable, with
   natural enemies often failing to establish or spread in pest
   populations. This variability has posed a major obstacle in use of the
   bacterial parasite Pasteuria penetrans for biological control of
   Meloidogyne species, economically devastating plant-parasitic nematodes
   for which there are limited management options. A leading hypothesis for
   this variability in control is that infection is successful only for
   specific combinations of bacterial and nematode genotypes. Under this
   hypothesis, failure of biological control results from the use of P.
   penetrans genotypes that cannot infect local Meloidogyne genotypes. We
   tested this hypothesis using isofemale lines of M. arenaria derived from
   a single field population and multiple sources of P. penetrans from the
   same and nearby fields. In strong support of the hypothesis,
   susceptibility to infection depended on the specific combination of host
   line and parasite source, with lines of M. arenaria varying
   substantially in which P. penetrans source could infect them. In light
   of this result, we tested whether using a diverse pool of P. penetrans
   could increase infection and thereby control. We found that increasing
   the diversity of the P. penetrans inoculum from one to eight sources
   more than doubled the fraction of M. arenaria individuals susceptible to
   infection and reduced variation in susceptibility across host lines.
   Together, our results highlight genotype-by-genotype specificity as an
   important cause of variation in biological control and call for the
   maintenance of genetic diversity in natural enemy populations.},

Abstract = {Arthropods that invade agricultural ecosystems systematically evolve
   resistance to the control measures used against them, and this remains a
   significant and ongoing challenge for sustainable food production
   systems. Early detection of resistance evolution could prompt remedial
   action to slow the spread of resistance alleles in the landscape.
   Historical approaches used to detect emerging resistance included
   phenotypic monitoring of agricultural pest populations, as well as
   monitoring of allele frequency changes at one or a few candidate
   pesticide resistance genes. In this article, I discuss the successes and
   limitations of these traditional monitoring approaches and then consider
   whether whole-genome scanning could be applied to samples collected from
   agroecosystems over time for resistance monitoring. I examine the
   qualities of agroecosystems that could impact application of this
   approach to pesticide resistance monitoring and describe a recent
   retrospective analysis where genome scanning successfully detected an
   oligogenic response to selection by pesticides years prior to pest
   management failure. I conclude by considering areas of further study
   that will shed light on the feasibility of applying whole-genome
   scanning for resistance risk monitoring in agricultural pest species.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of global coral bleaching has focused much attention on
   the possibility of interventions to increase heat resistance. However,
   if high heat resistance is linked to fitness tradeoffs that may
   disadvantage corals in other areas, then a more holistic view of heat
   resilience may be beneficial. In particular, overall resilience of a
   species to heat stress is likely to be the product of both resistance to
   heat and recovery from heat stress. Here, we investigate heat resistance
   and recovery among individual Acropora hyacinthus colonies in Palau. We
   divided corals into low, moderate, and high heat resistance categories
   based on the number of days (4-9) needed to reach significant
   pigmentation loss due to experimental heat stress. Afterward, we
   deployed corals back onto a reef in a common garden 6-month recovery
   experiment that monitored chlorophyll a, mortality, and skeletal growth.
   Heat resistance was negatively correlated with mortality during early
   recovery (0-1 month) but not late recovery (4-6 months), and chlorophyll
   a concentration recovered in heat-stressed corals by 1-month
   postbleaching. However, moderate-resistance corals had significantly
   greater skeletal growth than high-resistance corals by 4 months of
   recovery. High- and low-resistance corals on average did not exhibit
   skeletal growth within the observed recovery period. These data suggest
   complex tradeoffs may exist between coral heat resistance and recovery
   and highlight the importance of incorporating multiple aspects of
   resilience into future reef management programs.},

Abstract = {We compare the phylogeographic structure of 13 codistributed ectotherms
   including four reptiles (a snake, a legless skink and two tortoise
   species) and nine invertebrates (six freshwater crabs and three velvet
   worm species) to test the presence of congruent evolutionary histories.
   Phylogenies were estimated and dated using maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian methods with combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence
   datasets. All taxa demonstrated a marked east/west phylogeographic
   division, separated by the Cape Fold Mountain range. Phylogeographic
   concordance factors were calculated to assess the degree of evolutionary
   congruence among the study species and generally supported a shared
   pattern of diversification along the east/west longitudinal axis.
   Testing simultaneous divergence between the eastern and western
   phylogeographic regions indicated pseudocongruent evolutionary histories
   among the study taxa, with at least three separate divergence events
   throughout the Mio/Plio/Pleistocene epochs. Climatic refugia were
   identified for each species using climatic niche modelling,
   demonstrating taxon-specific responses to climatic fluctuations. Climate
   and the Cape Fold Mountain barrier explained the highest proportion of
   genetic diversity in all taxa, while climate was the most significant
   individual abiotic variable. This study highlights the complex
   interactions between the evolutionary history of fauna, the Cape Fold
   Mountains and past climatic oscillations during the
   Mio/Plio/Pleistocene. The congruent east/west phylogeographic division

Abstract = {Agricultural fields are typically simplified ecosystems compared to
   natural sites, a characteristic that has long-attracted researchers in
   Ecology and Evolution. In recent years, there has been a rising interest
   in understanding how agricultural systems are shaped by evolution in the
   context of changing agricultural practices by integrating biological
   information of crop systems. This editorial introduces the special issue
   ``Evolution in agricultural systems,{''} incorporating the articles
   published within this issue into three general areas of research:
   phenotypic and genetic responses to the environment, biotic interactions
   and the role of microbes. Together, this body of work unveils unforeseen
   complexity at all levels, from microbes to trophic chains. Understanding
   such complexity is critical not only to better understand natural
   systems, but also if we wish to improve the sustainability of the food
   system.},

Title = {The anthropogenic effect of land use on population genetics of Malcus
   inconspicuus},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {98-110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since the beginning of the Holocene era, human activities have seriously
   impacted animal habitats and vegetative environments. Species that are
   dependent on natural habitats or with narrow niches might be more
   severely affected by habitat changes. Malcus inconspicuus is distributed
   in subtropical China and highly dependent on the mountain environment.
   Our study investigated the role of the mountainous landscape in the
   historical evolution of M. inconspicuus and the impact of Holocene human
   activities on it. A phylogeographical approach was implemented with
   integrative datasets including double-digest restriction site-associated
   DNA (ddRAD), mitochondrial data, and distribution data. Three obvious
   clades and an east-west phylogeographical pattern were found in
   subtropical China. Mountainous landscape has ``multifaceted{''} effects
   on the evolutionary history of M. inconspicuus, it has contributed to
   population differentiation, provided glacial refuges, and provided
   population expansion corridors during the postglacial period. The
   effective population size (Ne) of M. inconspicuus showed a sharp decline
   during the Holocene era, which revealed a significantly negative
   correlation with the development of cropland in a hilly area at the same
   time and space. It supported that the species which are highly dependent
   on natural habitats might undergo greater impact when the habitat was
   damaged by agricultural activities and we should pay more attention to
   them, especially in the land development of their distribution areas.},

   discolor},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Many photosynthetic plants supplement photosynthetic carbon with fungal
   carbon, but the mechanisms that govern dependence on mycoheterotrophic
   carbon are poorly understood. We used exclusion shelters to manipulate
   water and light availability to plants of the terrestrial orchids
   Goodyera pubescens and Tipularia discolor. We tracked changes in delta
   C-13 from photosynthesis and delta N-15 acquired from soil-derived
   inorganic nitrogen versus mycoheterotrophy, along with direct measures
   of photosynthesis in T. discolor. We hypothesized that shade would
   increase dependence on mycoheterotrophy compared to reference plants,
   while drought would decrease both photosynthesis and the abundance of
   potential mycorrhizal fungi. Drought and shade enriched C-13 and N-15 in
   both G. pubescens and T. discolor, compared to control plants,
   indicating increased fungal contribution to orchid tissues.
   Physiological measurements of T. discolor leaves showed that dark
   respiration, water use efficiency, and relative electron transport rate
   did not vary significantly, but shaded plants had greater quantum
   efficiency, suggesting they were light-limited. Light saturated
   photosynthesis of T. discolor leaves was lower in both shaded and
   drought-treated plants, indicating lower photosynthetic capacity, and
   likely greater dependence on mycoheterotrophy and corresponding
   enrichment in C-13 and N-15. This study documented changes in orchid
   dependence on fungal carbon in response to manipulated environmental
   conditions. Both shade and drought increased the dependence of both
   orchids on mycoheterotrophically derived carbon and nitrogen.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are increasingly threatened by human activities. In
   Northeast Brazil, the Caatinga, an area of tropical dry forests
   surrounded by wetlands, is considered globally unique among these
   habitats. In this region, the stingless bee Plebeia flavocincta is found
   in a variety of environmental, ecological, and demographic conditions.
   We aimed to characterize P. flavocincta populations within its natural
   range through wing geometric morphometrics and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   analyses. The characterization of population variability can clarify
   whether the species is morphologically and genetically diverse and
   whether populations are morphologically and genetically structured. We
   analyzed 673 samples by wing morphometry and 75 by cytochrome-b assays.
   Our results revealed P. flavocincta is genetically and morphologically
   diverse and populations are morphologically and genetically structured.
   Despite the differentiation between the two most morphologically distant
   populations, we verified a large overlap of morphological variation
   between all populations. The genetic analysis showed that the haplotypes
   were geographically structured into six clusters, four of which were
   located in coastal areas, and the remaining two in the drier inland
   region. The characterization of P. flavocincta populations is an
   important step toward decision-making in programs for the protection,
   management, and sustainable use of this stingless bee in local breeding
   efforts.},

Title = {Strategy of micro-environmental adaptation to cold seep among different
   brittle stars' colonization},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Diffusing fluid from methane seepage in cold seep field creates zones
   with physicochemical gradients and divergent ecosystems like the mussel
   beds and clam beds. Three species of brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) were
   discovered in the Haima cold seep fields, of which Ophiophthalmus
   serratus and Histampica haimaensis were found on top of or within mussel
   beds and clam beds, whereas Amphiura sp. was only collected from muds in
   the clam bed assemblage. Here, we evaluated the genetic signatures of
   micro-environmental adaptation of brittle stars to cold seep through the
   comparison of mitogenomes. This study provided two complete mitogenome
   sequences of O. serratus and Amphiura sp. and compared with those of H.
   haimaensis and other non-seep species. We found that the split events of
   the seep and non-seep species were as ancient as the Cretaceous period
   (similar to 148-98 Mya). O. serratus and H. haimaensis display rapid
   residue mutation and mitogenome rearrangements compared to their shallow
   or deep-sea relatives, in contrast, Amphiura sp. only show medium,
   regardless of nucleotide mutation rate or mitogenome rearrangement,
   which may correlate with their adaptation to one or two
   micro-ecosystems. Furthermore, we identified 10 positively selected
   residues in ND4 in the Amphiura sp. lineage, suggesting important roles
   of the dehydrogenase complex in Amphiura sp. adaptive to the cold seep
   environment. Our results shed light on the different evolutionary
   strategies during colonization in different micro-environments.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The introduction of the functional response into population ecology in
   1949 by Maurice Solomon was focused on explaining population regulation
   by density-dependent mortality caused by predators and natural enemies.
   Like many simple ecological measures originating at the population
   level, it was soon being used for other purposes at the single species
   and individual predator level. It is thus necessary when we use this
   important response function that we have a clear hypothesis in mind that
   is being tested. Here I provide a capsular summary of the origins of the
   functional response and suggest five problems with its application in
   population and community ecology. The functional response has much
   utility as a critical component of understanding population and
   community dynamics but must be carefully aimed at specific questions.},

   the german wasp Vespula germanica},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) affects multiple physiological traits in insects.
   In social insects, besides development, JH has been demonstrated to
   influence caste determination and the production of chemical compounds.
   In social wasps, JH triggers behavioral maturation, gonadotropic
   effects, and hydrocarbon modulation. Here, we investigated whether JH
   displays the same function in fertility and fertility cue production in
   females of the German wasp Vespula germanica, previously shown in the
   related species Vespula vulgaris. By experimentally treating workers
   with JH-analog, an anti-JH, and acetone solvent control, we tested
   whether JH modulates the cuticular chemical expression (CHCs), the
   Dufour's gland chemical composition, and hence the compounds found over
   the egg's surface. Additionally, we explored whether JH has a
   gonadotropic effect on workers. Workers treated with the JH-analog
   acquired a chemical profile that was intermediate between the queen and
   other treated workers. Interestingly, the same pattern was also seen in
   the Dufour's glands and eggs, although more subtle. Furthermore, workers
   treated with the JH-analog were more fertile when compared to the
   controls, supporting the fact that JH acts as a gonadotropic hormone.
   Our results indicate a similar function of JH in societies of related

Title = {There and back again: A meta-analytical approach on the influence of
   acclimation and altitude in the upper thermal tolerance of amphibians
   and reptiles},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Realistic predictions about the impacts of climate change onbiodiversity
   requires gathering ecophysiological data and the critical thermal maxima
   (CTMax) is the most frequently used index to assess the thermal
   vulnerability of species. In the present study, we performed a
   systematic review to understand how acclimation and altitude affect
   CTMax estimates for amphibian and non-avian reptile species. We
   retrieved CTMax data for anurans, salamanders, lizards, snakes, and
   turtles/terrapins. Data allowed to perform a multilevel random effects
   meta-analysis to answer how acclimation temperature affect CTMax of
   Anura, Caudata, and Squamata and also meta-regressions to assess the
   influence of altitude on CTMax of frogs and lizards. Acclimation
   temperature influenced CTMax estimates of tadpoles, adult anurans,
   salamanders, and lizards, but not of froglets. In general, the increase
   in acclimation temperature led to higher CTMax values. Altitudinal
   bioclimatic gradient had an inverse effect for estimating the CTMax of
   lizards and anuran amphibians. For lizards, CTMax was positively
   influenced by the mean temperature of the wettest quarter. For anurans,
   the relationship is inverse; we recover a trend of decreasing CTMax when
   max temperature of warmest month and precipitation seasonality increase.
   There is an urgent need for studies to investigate the thermal tolerance
   of subsampled groups or even for which we do not have any information
   such as Gymnophiona, Serpentes, Amphisbaena, and Testudines. Broader
   phylogenetic coverage is mandatory for more accurate analyses of
   macroecological and evolutionary patterns for thermal tolerance indices
   as CTMax.},

Title = {Eco-environmental constraints, economic incentives, and spatiotemporal
   variations of construction land use efficiency in regional China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Construction land expansion and use efficiency are tied to the promotion
   of sustainable cities and communities. This article explores how and why
   the spatiotemporal variation of construction land use efficiency (CLUE)
   evolved in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China between 2000 and 2020.
   Our descriptive results show that county-level regions with higher CLUE
   are concentrated in major cities in the core YRD, as well as
   ecologically sensitive regions in the peripheral YRD. Although CLUE
   improvement in peripheral regions has been more remarkable since the
   early 2010s, the efficiency gap in construction land use between the
   core YRD (central cities) and the peripheral YRD (suburban counties) has
   doubled. The modeling results indicate the temporally and spatially
   heterogeneous impacts of various factors related to economic incentives
   and eco-environmental constraints on the uneven CLUE. Economic level and
   ecological sensitivity are positively associated with regional CLUE. The
   continuing growth of service industries and the spatial agglomeration of
   knowledge-intensive and foreign-invested firms are increasingly vital
   for CLUE improvement in the core YRD, while the prosperity of
   manufacturing industries is more important for the peripheral YRD. The
   ``crowding out effect{''} of environmental pollution on CLUE could be
   proved in the peripheral rather than the core YRD. Our findings suggest
   that proper policies should be tailored to specific places to coordinate
   construction land use, economic growth, and eco-environmental
   sustainability.},

Title = {Global patterns in symbiont selection and transmission strategies in
   sponges},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Sponges host dense and diverse communities of microbes (known as the
   microbiome) beneficial for the host nutrition and defense. Symbionts in
   turn receive shelter and metabolites from the sponge host, making their
   relationship beneficial for both partners. Given that sponge-microbes
   associations are fundamental for the survival of both, especially the
   sponge, such relationship is maintained through their life and even
   passed on to the future generations. In many organisms, the microbiome
   has profound effects on the development of the host, but the influence
   of the microbiome on the reproductive and developmental pathways of the
   sponges are less understood. In sponges, microbes are passed on to
   oocytes, sperm, embryos, and larvae (known as vertical transmission),
   using a variety of methods that include direct uptake from the mesohyl
   through phagocytosis by oocytes to indirect transmission to the oocyte
   by nurse cells. Such microbes can remain in the reproductive elements
   untouched, for transfer to offspring, or can be digested to make the
   yolky nutrient reserves of oocytes and larvae. When and how those
   decisions are made are fundamentally unanswered questions in sponge
   reproduction. Here we review the diversity of vertical transmission
   modes existent in the entire phylum Porifera through detailed imaging
   using electron microscopy, available metabarcoding data from
   reproductive elements, and macroevolutionary patterns associated to
   phylogenetic constraints. Additionally, we examine the fidelity of this
   vertical transmission and possible reasons for the observed variability
   in some developmental stages. Our current understanding in marine
   sponges, however, is that the adult microbial community is established
   by a combination of both vertical and horizontal (acquisition from the
   surrounding environment in each new generation) transmission processes,
   although the extent in which each mode shapes the adult microbiome still
   remains to be determined. We also assessed the fundamental role of
   filtration, the cellular structures for acquiring external microbes, and
   the role of the host immune system, that ultimately shapes the stable
   communities of prokaryotes observed in adult sponges.},

Title = {Calculation of surface settlement and pile foundation deformation caused
   by shield machine tunnelling along curve section},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {The shield machine tunnelling along the curve section causes more
   disturbance to the surrounding environment than the straight section.
   Pile foundation is the most commonly used foundation form in high-rise
   buildings, and high-rise buildings have extremely high requirements for
   controlling non-uniform deformation. Therefore, it is necessary to study
   the surface settlement and the deformation law of pile foundations
   caused by shield machine tunnelling along the curve section. Considering
   the shield machine tunnelling factors along the curve section and the
   coupling effect of piles and soil, the analytical calculation formula of
   the ground settlement and the pile foundation deformation caused by the
   shield machine tunnelling along the curve section is deduced. According
   to the actual project situation, a finite difference model (FDM) is
   constructed, and the correctness of the FDM and analytical prediction
   formula is verified by comparing the on-site monitoring data. The
   research shows that the error among the FDM results, the analytical
   prediction results, and the on-site monitoring data are small, and the
   surface settlement and pile foundation deformation meet the construction
   control standards. The friction resistance of the shield shell, the
   integrative gap at the shield tail (IGST), and the over-cutting gap (OG)
   are the main factors leading to the surface settlement. However, the
   shield shell friction and OG are the main reasons leading to the inner
   settlement of the curve section being more prominent than the outer
   side. The difference in the pile foundation settlement on both sides of
   the curve section is slight, the maximum settlement difference rate is
   1.8\%, and the maximum horizontal deformation rate of the pile
   foundation on the inner and outer sides is 9.2\%, which shows that the
   horizontal deformation of the pile foundation is more sensitive to the
   asymmetrically distributed construction factors.},

Title = {Shared body plans of lycophytes inferred from root formation of
   Lycopodium clavatum},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Late Silurian to early Devonian lycophytes had prostrate aerial axes,
   while subordinate organs or subterranean axes were formed around the
   dichotomies of the axes. The subterranean axes are hypothesized to have
   evolved into root-bearing axes (rhizophores) and roots in extant
   Selaginellaceae and Lycopodiaceae, respectively. Consistent with this
   hypothesis, rhizophores are formed on the dichotomies of shoots in
   Selaginellaceae. However, it has remained unclear whether roots are
   borne in the same position in Lycopodiaceae. In addition, roots form
   endogenously in the stem, but no data are available regarding the
   tissues in stem from which they arise. In this study, we tracked the
   root development in the clubmoss, Lycopodium clavatum, based on
   anatomical sections and 3D reconstructed images. The vascular tissue of
   the stem is encircled by ground meristem, which supplies cortical cells
   outwardly by periclinal divisions. A linear parenchymatous tissue is
   present on the ventral side of vascular cylinder, which we call
   ``ventral tissue{''} in this study. We found that root primordia are
   formed endogenously on the ventral side of stem, possibly from the
   ventral tissue. In addition, roots always initiate at positions close to
   dichotomies of stem. The root-initiating position supports the
   suggestion that Lycopodium roots share a body plan with the subterranean
   organs of the hypothesized ancestry.},

Title = {Predictors of plant endemism in two west African forest hotspots},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Centres of endemism have been much studied by biogeographers,
   ecologists, and evolutionary theorists, and are considered conservation
   priorities. It is therefore important to understand the ecological
   traits of restricted range taxa, and the landscape-scale drivers of high
   endemism. Here, we investigate correlates of floristic endemism within
   two of west Africa's forest biodiversity hotspots at local scale. We
   assembled distribution data for 1,042 vascular plant taxa from 114
   sample locations within forest reserves of south west Ghana, and for
   1,735 vascular plant taxa from 454 sample locations within the Nimba
   Mountains (Liberia and Guinea). A quantitative index of global endemism
   called the Genetic Heat Index was modelled linearly. We tested the
   significance of modern climate, altitude and disturbance as factors
   predicting endemism rates in these two forest reserves. Annual rainfall
   was significantly and positively related to endemism rates in both south
   west Ghana and the Nimba Mountains. Altitude was a significant predictor
   of endemism rates in the Nimba Mountains, with a quadratic relationship
   highlighting particularly high endemism over 1,000 m. Local topography
   rather than altitude was a significant predictor or endemism in SW
   Ghana, where altitude varies less. Areas of high rainfall and high
   altitude are geographically restricted across the western African
   forests, acting as edaphic islands driving spatial isolation. Disturbed
   vegetation samples had lower endemism rates than undisturbed samples in
   both Nimba and SW Ghana, and overall pioneer species had wider areas of
   occupancy than shade-bearing species. Endemism rates increased slightly
   with each year following clearance. Disturbance thus creates and
   maintains vegetation types which support a lower proportion of globally
   rare species in the two biodiversity hotspots surveyed. From the point
   of view of the conservation of globally rare plants, it is important to
   keep additional disturbance in the south west Ghana hotspot,
   particularly Ankasa, to a minimum, as is the current practice, and in
   the Nimba mountains to establish community forests which may be left
   relatively undisturbed amid farming and mining activities.},

Title = {Improving trajectories of amphibians in wildlife passages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Linear transport infrastructure can alter the viability of populations
   and wildlife passages are used to mitigate their impacts. The assessment
   of their outcomes is often limited to recording the use of the tunnels
   by a focal species. For amphibians, the effectiveness of tunnels is
   poorly evaluated with little information about whether certain features
   encourage individuals that may be reluctant to pass through tunnels. One
   study showed that acoustic enrichment with anuran calls can increase the
   crossing of tunnels by newts. This study recorded the behavior of three
   European amphibian species in three tunnels, tracking them with PIT tags
   and detection with four RFID antennas installed on the floor of the
   tunnels. We tested (1) the effectiveness of the antennas in detecting
   the species, (2) the effect of the length of the tunnels, and (3) the
   effect of acoustic enrichment. Using a multi-state capture-recapture
   model, we evaluated the probability of an individual advancing between
   the tunnel sections. The effectiveness of the antennas varied according
   to species, higher for Urodela species than for Anuran species. Several
   types of paths were detected (constant and varying speeds, halt, and
   back-and-forth movements). The fire salamander and the great crested
   newt individuals exhibited a similar variety of movements in the tunnels
   (21 and 40 m length). Triturus cristatus made similar movements in the
   tunnels with and without acoustic enrichment. In water frogs, all the
   individuals (n = 16) made a complete crossing in the tunnel with
   enrichment vs. 75\% (n = 71) in the tunnel without enrichment. In T.
   cristatus, the probability of going forward at the entrance of the
   tunnel was 18\% higher with enrichment in one tunnel. No significant
   effect of acoustic enrichment was observed in two others tunnels for
   this species. In Pelophylax esculentus, this probability was 78\% higher
   in the tunnel with enrichment. This multi-antenna RFID system was able
   to provide valuable information on the behavior of these small animals
   when traversing the tunnels, as well as to test the effectiveness of
   tunnel features. The findings indicate that acoustic enrichment to
   attract animals to specific locations holds promise as a new
   conservation tool.},

Title = {Temporal dynamics in zooplankton delta C-13 and delta N-15 isoscapes for
   the North Atlantic Ocean: Decadal cycles, seasonality, and implications
   for predator ecology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {The limited amount of ecological data covering offshore parts of the
   ocean impedes our ability to understand and anticipate the impact of
   anthropogenic stressors on pelagic marine ecosystems. Isoscapes, i.e.,
   spatial models of the distribution of stable isotope ratios, have been
   employed in the recent years to investigate spatio-temporal patterns in
   biogeochemical process and ecological responses. Development of
   isoscapes on the scale of ocean basins is hampered by access to suitable
   reference samples. Here we draw on archived material from long-running
   plankton survey initiatives, to build temporally explicit isoscape
   models for the North Atlantic Ocean (> 40 degrees N). A total of 570
   zooplankton samples were retrieved from Continuous Plankton Recorder
   archives and analysed for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Bayesian
   generalised additive models were developed to (1) model the relations
   between isotopic values and a set of predictors and (2) predict isotopic
   values for the whole of the study area. We produced yearly and seasonal
   isoscape models for the period 1998-2020. These are the first
   observation-based time-resolved C and N isoscapes developed at the scale
   of the North Atlantic Ocean. Drawing on the Stable Isotope Trajectory
   Analysis framework, we identify five isotopically distinct regions. We
   discuss the hydro-biogeochemical processes that likely explain theses
   modes, the differences in temporal dynamics (stability and cycles) and
   compare our results with previous bioregionalization efforts. Finally,
   we lay down the basis for using the isoscapes as a tool to define
   predator distributions and their interactions with the trophic
   environment. The isoscapes developed in this study have the potential to
   update our knowledge of marine predator ecology and therefore our
   capacity to improve their conservation in the future.},

Title = {Environmental factors indirectly reduce phytoplankton community
   stability via functional diversity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {The biodiversity-stability relationship is a fundamental subject of
   ecological research. Considerable evidence demonstrates that
   biodiversity can either increase or decrease stability. Most relevant
   research mainly focuses on grassland and forest ecosystems. The
   biodiversity-stability relationship in aquatic ecosystems and the
   underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To fill the gap, we
   conducted a year-long study on the phytoplankton of reservoir ecosystems
   in the Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) to test the following
   hypotheses: (H1) phytoplankton species richness and functional diversity
   directly reduce phytoplankton community stability in reservoir
   ecosystems; (H2) nutrient enrichment and water temperature increasing
   directly reduce phytoplankton community stability; and (H3) nutrients
   and water temperature indirectly reduce phytoplankton community
   stability via biodiversity. The structural equation model (SEM) found
   that functional diversity (community-weighted means of traits and
   functional divergence) had significant negative correlations with
   phytoplankton community stability (p < 0.05), while the species
   diversity had no significant correlation with phytoplankton community
   stability (p > 0.05). This finding partially supported the hypothesis
   H1, which suggested that the functional diversity had a closer tie with
   stability than the species diversity. SEM did not find any direct effect
   of environmental factors on phytoplankton community stability, which
   rejected our hypothesis H2. Instead, SEM found that water temperature
   and phosphate decreased phytoplankton community stability by increasing
   the first principal component of the community-weighted means of traits
   (CWM\_PC1), which supported hypothesis H3. Further analysis showed that
   the increased water temperature and phosphate concentration can promote
   ``r-strategists{''} species (larger CWM\_PC1), which are less resistant
   to environmental disturbances, therefore decreasing the phytoplankton
   community stability. Our study highlights the importance of functional
   diversity in maintaining the relationship between biodiversity and
   stability in the phytoplankton community, which may provide a
   mechanistic understanding of the biodiversity-stability relationships in
   aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Pollen and nectar have different effects on the development and
   reproduction of noctuid moths},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Although many noctuid insects are agricultural pests that threaten food
   production, they are also the major nocturnal pollinators of flowering
   plants. Larval foods of noctuid pest insects have been well studied for
   developing control strategies, but knowledge on host plants for the
   adults is rather scarce. Here, the impact of plant-derived foods on
   adult survival, fecundity and reproductive physiology of four global
   species of noctuid pests (Mythimna separata Walker, Mythimna loreyi
   Duponchel, Athetis lepigone Moschler, and Hadula trifolii Hufnagel) was
   assessed in laboratory experiments. Our results indicated that nectar
   slowed testis decay and prolonged the oviposition period and lifespan,
   increasing fecundity. Acacia nectar increased the longevity of mate and
   female adults by 3.2 similar to 10.9 and 2.4 similar to 5.0 days,
   respectively, and fecundity of females by 122 similar to 3.34 times
   compared to water-fed individuals. The fitness among the different
   species of noctuid moths differed on specific pollen diets. On pine
   pollen, the fecundity of female moths of M. separata, A. lepigone and H.
   trifolii was 10.06, 33.52, and 28.61\%, respectively, lower than those
   of the water-fed females, but the fecundity of female moths of M. loreyi
   on pine pollen was 2.11 times greater than for the water-fed
   individuals. This work provides valuable information on the nutritional
   ecology for noctuid moths, which can aid the development and design of
   nutritional attractants within noctuid pests-infected cropping systems
   and provide a basis for effective and targeted management of global
   noctuid pests.},

Title = {Survival and reproduction in Arctic caribou are associated with summer
   forage and insect harassment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Investigators have speculated that the climate-driven ``greening of the
   Arctic{''} may benefit barren-ground caribou populations, but
   paradoxically many populations have declined in recent years. This
   pattern has raised concerns about the influence of summer habitat
   conditions on caribou demographic rates, and how populations may be
   impacted in the future. The short Arctic summer provides caribou with
   important forage resources but is also the time they are exposed to
   intense harassment by insects, factors which are both being altered by
   longer, warmer growing seasons. To better understand the effects of
   summer forage and insect activity on Arctic caribou demographic rates,
   we investigated the influence of estimated forage biomass, digestible
   energy (DE), digestible nitrogen (DN), and mosquito activity on the
   reproductive success and survival of adult females in the Central Arctic
   Herd on the North Slope of Alaska. We tested the hypotheses that greater
   early summer DN would increase subsequent reproduction (parturition and
   late June calving success) while greater biomass and DE would increase
   adult survival (September-May), and that elevated mosquito activity
   would reduce both demographic rates. Because the period when abundant
   forage DN is limited and overlaps with the period of mosquito
   harassment, we also expected years with low DN and high harassment to
   synergistically reduce caribou reproductive success. Examining these
   relationships at the individual-level, using GPS-collared females, and
   at the population-level, using long-term monitoring data, we generally
   found support for our expectations. Greater early summer DN was
   associated with increased subsequent calving success, while greater
   summer biomass was associated with increased adult survival. Mosquito
   activity was associated with reductions in adult female parturition,
   late June calving success, and survival, and in years with low DN, had
   compounding effects on subsequent late June calving success. Our
   findings indicate that summer nutrition and mosquito activity
   collectively influence the demographic rates of Arctic caribou, and may
   impact the dynamics of populations in the future under changing
   environmental conditions.},

Title = {Are degraded karst tiankengs coupled with microclimatic underground
   forests the refugia of surface flora? Evidence from China's Yunnan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Karst tiankengs, as one of the most magnificent negative topographies,
   are capable of forming a bank for species diversity conservation easily.
   More than 300 karst tiankengs have been discovered and identified
   worldwide. Given its treacherous terrain, although original karst
   tiankeng were identified as species refuges, the broader distribution of
   degraded karst tiankeng has not been systematically studied. Our study
   area comprised the degraded karst tiankeng cluster immersed in the
   fragmented karst forests of Yunnan, China. Fifty-eight plant samples
   were selected from karst tiankengs and surface. We compared species
   composition, and analyzed diversity indices and similarity coefficients
   to verify the isolation effect of karst tiankengs on floras. The results
   indicated that: (1) In the degraded karst tiankeng, there were 24
   families, 37 genera and 48 species in the tree layer and 27 families, 43
   genera and 49 species in the shrub layer. Outside the degraded karst
   tiankengs, 20 families, 31 genera and 39 species were in the tree layer,
   and the shrub layer included 26 families, 44 genera and 55 species. (2)
   The species composition reached significant differences within and
   outside degraded karst tiankeng (p < 0.05) based on the analysis of
   variance (ANOVA). (3) In the degraded karst tiankeng, species
   richness/diversity in trees were higher than those in the shrub layer,
   while at the surface, shrubs had higher richness and lower diversity
   than trees by Alpha-diversity index. And for Beta-diversity index,
   species similarity among degraded karst tiankengs (0.215) was extremely
   dissimilar, which was even lower than the contrast within and outside
   the degraded karst tiankengs (0.272). (4) Shared species ranged from 1
   to 5 among the four habitats, with high variability in plant species
   across the habitat matrices. Through a comparative analysis of
   systematic biodiversity methods, we found that the degraded karst
   tiankengs, an independent type of karst tiankeng, are the unreported
   refugia. Species records in degraded karst tiankeng cluster will
   contribute to plant diversity conservation and resource management, and
   to the linkage with broader China's karst floras. Karst tiankeng
   botanical habitats possess not only biodiversity value for in situ
   conservation, but will further support the ecological recovery of
   surface flora. While its mechanism needs to be further revealed.},

Title = {Development of a polyphagous leaf beetle on different host plant species
   and its detoxification of glucosinolates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Herbivores face a broad range of defences when feeding on plants. By
   mixing diets, polyphagous herbivores are assumed to benefit during their
   development by gaining a better nutritional balance and reducing the
   intake of toxic compounds from individual plant species. Nevertheless,
   they also show strategies to metabolically cope with plant defences. In
   this study, we investigated the development of the polyphagous tansy
   leaf beetle, Galeruca tanaceti (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), on mono
   diets consisting of one plant species {[}cabbage (Brassica rapa),
   Brassicaceae; lettuce (Lactuca sativa), or tansy (Tanacetum vulgare),
   Asteraceae] vs. two mixed diets, both containing tansy. Leaves of the
   three species were analysed for contents of water, carbon and nitrogen,
   the specific leaf area (SLA) and trichome density. Furthermore, we
   studied the insect metabolism of two glucosinolates, characteristic
   defences of Brassicaceae. Individuals reared on cabbage mono diet
   developed fastest and showed the highest survival, while the development
   was slowest for individuals kept on tansy mono diet. Cabbage had the
   lowest water content, while tansy had the highest water content, C/N
   ratio and trichome density and the lowest SLA. Lettuce showed the lowest
   C/N ratio, highest SLA and no trichomes. Analysis of insect samples with
   UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS revealed that benzyl glucosinolate was metabolised
   to N-benzoylglycine, N-benzoylalanine and N-benzoylserine.
   MALDI-Orbitrap-MS imaging revealed the localisation of these metabolites
   in the larval hindgut region. 4-Hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate was
   metabolised to N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)glycine. Our results highlight that
   G. tanaceti deals with toxic hydrolysis products of glucosinolates by
   conjugation with different amino acids, which may enable this species to
   develop well on cabbage. The high trichome density and/or specific plant
   chemistry may lower the accessibility and/or digestibility of tansy
   leaves, leading to a poorer beetle development on pure tansy diet or
   diet mixes containing tansy. Thus, diet mixing is not necessarily
   beneficial, if one of the plant species is strongly defended.},

Title = {Cognitive-Behavioral Divergence Is Greater Across Alternative Male
   Reproductive Phenotypes Than Between the Sexes in a Wild Wrasse},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Sexual selection is a powerful diversifier of phenotype, behavior and
   cognition. Here we compare cognitive-behavioral traits across four
   reproductive phenotypes (females and three alternative males) of
   wild-caught ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus). Both sex and
   alternative male phenotypes are environmentally determined with sex
   determination occuring within the first year, and males transition
   between alternative phenotypes across 2 years (sneaker to satellite or
   satellite to nesting). We captured 151 ocellated wrasse and tested them
   on different behavior and cognition assays (scototaxis, shoaling, and
   two detour-reaching tasks). We found greater divergence across
   alternative male reproductive phenotypes than differences between the
   sexes in behavior, problem-solving, and relationships between these
   traits. Nesting males were significantly less bold than others, while
   sneaker males were faster problem-solvers and the only phenotype to
   display a cognitive-behavioral syndrome (significant correlation between
   boldness and problem-solving speed). Combining these results with prior
   measurements of sex steroid and stress hormone across males, suggests
   that nesting and sneaker males represent different coping styles. Our
   data suggests that transitioning between alternative male phenotypes
   requires more than changes in physiology (size and ornamentation) and
   mating tactic (sneaking vs. cooperation), but also involves significant
   shifts in cognitive-behavioral and coping style plasticity.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How can we best vary the application of pesticides and antibiotics to
   delay resistance evolution? Previous theoretical comparisons of
   deployment strategies have focused on qualitative resistance traits and
   have mostly assumed that resistance alleles are already present in a
   population. But many real resistance traits are quantitative, and the
   evolution of resistant genotypes in the field may depend on de novo
   mutation and recombination. Here, I use an individual-based,
   forward-time, quantitative-genetic simulation model to investigate the
   evolution of quantitative resistance. I evaluate the performance of four
   application strategies for delaying resistance evolution, to wit, the
   (1) sequential, (2) mosaic, (3) periodic, and (4) combined strategies. I
   find that which strategy is best depends on initial efficacy. When at
   the onset, xenobiotics completely prevent reproduction in treated demes,
   a combined strategy is best. On the other hand, when populations are
   partially resistant, the combined strategy is inferior to mosaic and
   periodic strategies, especially when resistance alleles are
   antagonistically pleiotropic. Thus, the optimal application strategy for
   managing against the rise of quantitative resistance depends on
   pleiotropy and whether or not partial resistance is already present in a
   population. This result appears robust to variation in pest reproductive
   mode and migration rate, direct fitness costs for resistant phenotypes,
   and the extent of refugial habitats.},

Title = {Biological control needs evolutionary perspectives of ecological

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1537-1554},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While ecological interactions have been identified as determinant for
   biological control efficiency, the role of evolution remains largely
   underestimated in biological control programs. With the restrictions on
   the use of both pesticides and exotic biological control agents (BCAs),
   the evolutionary optimization of local BCAs becomes central for
   improving the efficiency and the resilience of biological control. In
   particular, we need to better account for the natural processes of
   evolution to fully understand the interactions of pests and BCAs,
   including in biocontrol strategies integrating human manipulations of
   evolution (i.e., artificial selection and genetic engineering). In
   agroecosystems, the evolution of BCAs traits and performance depends on
   heritable phenotypic variation, trait genetic architecture, selection
   strength, stochastic processes, and other selective forces. Humans can
   manipulate these natural processes to increase the likelihood of
   evolutionary trait improvement, by artificially increasing heritable
   phenotypic variation, strengthening selection, controlling stochastic
   processes, or overpassing evolution through genetic engineering. We
   highlight these facets by reviewing recent studies addressing the
   importance of natural processes of evolution and human manipulations of
   these processes in biological control. We then discuss the interactions
   between the natural processes of evolution occurring in agroecosystems
   and affecting the artificially improved BCAs after their release. We
   emphasize that biological control cannot be summarized by interactions
   between species pairs because pests and biological control agents are
   entangled in diverse communities and are exposed to a multitude of
   deterministic and stochastic selective forces that can change rapidly in
   direction and intensity. We conclude that the combination of different
   evolutionary approaches can help optimize BCAs to remain efficient under
   changing environmental conditions and, ultimately, favor agroecosystem
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) is an ecologically and economically
   important species widely distributed across the North Pacific Ocean.
   However, the population size of this fishery resource has declined
   globally. Identifying genetic integrity, diversity and structure, and
   phylogenetic relationships of wild populations of O. keta over an entire
   species' range is central for developing its effective conservation and
   management plans. Nevertheless, chum salmon from the Korean Peninsula,
   which are comprised of its southwestern range margins, have been
   overlooked. By using mtDNA control region and 10 microsatellite loci, we
   here assessed the genetic diversity and structure for 16 populations,
   including 10 wild and six hatchery populations, encompassing the species
   entire geographic range in South Korea. The analyses showed that genetic
   diversity is significantly higher for wild than for hatchery
   populations. Both marker sets revealed significant genetic
   differentiation between some local populations. Comparisons of six wild
   and their respective hatchery populations indicated that
   allele/haplotype frequencies considerably differ, perhaps due to a
   strong founder effect and/or homogenizing of hatchery populations for
   stocking practice. Despite its single admixed gene pool for the Korean
   chum salmon, some local populations housing their own unique lineages
   should be accorded with a high priority to safeguard their genetic
   integrities. The results of our comparative analyses of the Korean
   population with other North Pacific chum salmons (inhabiting regions of
   Japan, Russia, and North America) revealed a lower diversity but higher
   contribution to the overall species-level genetic diversity, and also
   its unique genetic integrity. These findings advocate for the
   evolutionary significance of the Korean population for species-level
   conservation.},

Abstract = {As an indigenous breed, the Tibetan chicken is found in highland regions
   and shows physiological adaptations to high altitude; however, the
   genetic changes that determine these adaptations remain elusive. We
   assumed that the microevolution of the Tibetan chicken occurred from
   lowland to highland regions with a continuous elevation range. In this
   study, we analyzed the genome of 188 chickens from lowland areas to the
   high-altitude regions of the Tibetan plateau with four altitudinal
   levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Tibetan chickens are
   significantly different from other altitude chicken populations.
   Reconstruction of the demographic history showed that the migration and
   admixture events of the Tibetan chicken occurred at different times. The
   genome of the Tibetan chicken was also used to analyze positive
   selection pressure that is associated with high-altitude adaptation,
   revealing the well-known candidate gene that participates in oxygen
   binding (HBAD), as well as other novel potential genes (e.g., HRG and
   ANK2) that are related to blood coagulation and cardiovascular
   efficiency. Our study provides novel insights regarding the evolutionary
   history and microevolution mechanisms of the high-altitude adaptation in
   the Tibetan chicken.},

Abstract = {Co-evolved natural enemies provide sustainable and long-term control of
   numerous invasive insect pests, but the introduction of such enemies has
   declined sharply due to increasing regulations. In the absence of
   co-evolved natural enemies, native species may attack exotic invasive
   pests; however, they usually lack adaptations to control novel hosts
   effectively. We investigated the potential of two native pupal
   parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae and Trichopria drosophilae, to
   increase their developmental success on the invasive Drosophila suzukii.
   Replicated populations of the two parasitoids were subjected to 10
   generations of laboratory selection on D. suzukii with Drosophila
   melanogaster serving as the co-evolved host. We assessed developmental
   success of selected and control lines in generations 0, 3, and 10.
   Changes in host preference, sex ratio, development time, and body size
   were measured to evaluate correlated responses with adaptation. Both
   parasitoid species responded rapidly to selection by significantly
   increasing their developmental success on the novel host within three
   generations, which remained constant for seven additional generations
   without further improvement. The generalist parasitoid species P.
   vindemmiae was able to reach similar developmental success as the
   control populations, while the performance of the more specialized
   parasitoid T. drosophilae remained lower on the novel than on the
   co-evolved host. There was no increase in preference towards the novel
   host over 10 generations of selection nor were there changes in
   development time or body size associated with adaptation in either
   parasitoid species. The sex ratio became less female-biased for both
   parasitoids after three generations of selection but rebounded in P.
   vindemmiae by generation 10. These results suggest that a few
   generations of selection may be sufficient to improve the performance of
   native parasitoids on invasive hosts, but with limits to the degree of
   improvement for managing invasive pests when exotic co-evolved natural
   enemies are not available.},

Abstract = {Pesticide resistance provides one of the best examples of rapid
   evolution to environmental change. The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) has
   a long and noteworthy history as a super-pest due to its ability to
   repeatedly develop resistance to novel insecticides and rapidly expand
   its geographic and host plant range. Here, we investigate regional
   differences in demography, recombination, and selection using
   whole-genome resequencing data from two highly resistant CPB populations
   in the United States (Hancock, Wisconsin and Long Island, New York).
   Demographic reconstruction corroborates historical records for a single
   pest origin during the colonization of the Midwestern and Eastern United
   States in the mid- to late-19th century and suggests that the effective
   population size might be higher in Long Island, NY than Hancock, WI
   despite contemporary potato acreage of Wisconsin being far greater.
   Population-based recombination maps show similar background
   recombination rates between these populations, as well as overlapping
   regions of low recombination that intersect with important metabolic
   detoxification genes. In both populations, we find compelling evidence
   for hard selective sweeps linked to insecticide resistance with multiple
   sweeps involving genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism, stress
   response, and defensive chemistry. Notably, only two candidate
   insecticide resistance genes are shared among both populations, but both
   appear to be independent hard selective sweep events. This suggests that
   repeated, rapid, and independent evolution of genes may underlie CPB's
   pest status among geographically distinct populations.},

Abstract = {Patterns of genetic differentiation across the genome can provide
   insight into selective forces driving adaptation. We used pooled whole
   genome sequencing, gene annotation, and environmental covariates to
   evaluate patterns of genomic differentiation and to investigate
   mechanisms responsible for divergence among proximate Pacific cod (Gadus
   macrocephalus) populations from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and
   more distant Washington Coast cod. Samples were taken from eight
   spawning locations, three of which were replicated to estimate
   consistency in allele frequency estimation. A kernel smoothing moving
   weighted average of relative divergence (F-ST) identified 11 genomic
   islands of differentiation between the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea
   samples. In some islands of differentiation, there was also elevated
   absolute divergence (d(XY)) and evidence for selection, despite
   proximity and potential for gene flow. Similar levels of absolute
   divergence (d(XY)) but roughly double the relative divergence (F-ST)
   were observed between the distant Bering Sea and Washington Coast
   samples. Islands of differentiation were much smaller than the four
   large inversions among Atlantic cod ecotypes. Islands of differentiation
   between the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island were associated with SNPs
   from five vision system genes, which can be associated with feeding,
   predator avoidance, orientation, and socialization. We hypothesize that
   islands of differentiation between Pacific cod from the Bering Sea and
   Aleutian Islands provide evidence for adaptive differentiation despite
   gene flow in this commercially important marine species.},

Abstract = {Invasive organisms can alter host-parasite relationships in a given
   ecosystem by spreading exotic parasites and/or becoming a new reservoir
   for native ones. Since these problems affect management programs of the
   invasive host organisms, it is necessary to monitor them individually.
   The Pallas's squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus is an invasive arboreal
   mammal introduced into Japan that threatens to exacerbate ecological and
   public health problems by spreading native and exotic parasites.
   However, only limited surveys have been available especially for
   ectoparasites, using the traditional combing method in which the
   possibility of oversight is inherent. Here, we evaluated the
   ectoparasite occurrences in Kanto region of Japan, using the
   whole-shaving method as an alternative approach. As a result of
   examining 52 hosts from two invaded districts (Yokohama and Yokosuka),
   chigger mites (Leptotrombidium spp.) and fleas (Ceratophyllus anisus and
   Ceratophyllus indages indages) were newly recovered in addition to the
   previously reported tick (Haemaphysalis flava) and exotic lice
   (Enderleinellus kumadai and Neophaematoponis callosciuri). The parasite
   burdens were higher in Yokosuka and in male host individuals, affecting
   infracommunity richness and composition. Our findings on the variety of
   native and exotic ectoparasites, at higher abundances in some cases than
   previously known, may suggest that both the spillover and spillback
   risks need to be adjusted upwards.},

   the role of AM and manage its threat to penguin collections, Plasmodium
   was surveyed through PCR at Chester Zoo in mosquitoes, penguins, and
   dead free-living wild birds during and around the mortality event.
   Additional sequences were obtained from penguin fatalities from four
   other UK zoological collections. All sequences were integrated into
   phylogenetic analyses to determine parasite species and lineages. In
   total, 753/6459 positive mosquitoes were recorded (11.7\% prevalence),
   reaching a weekly peak of 30\% prevalence in midsummer. Among penguin
   fatalities at Chester Zoo, several penguins presented signs and lesions
   compatible with AM; nevertheless, exoerythrocytic memnts were identified
   in only one case and Plasmodium spp. was identified in 5/22 birds.
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed at least five parasite cytb lineages of
   three Plasmodium species (P. matutinum, P. relictum and P. vaughani)
   circulating in mosquitoes at Chester Zoo; however, infections in
   free-living wild birds and penguins were only from P. matutinum.
   Plasmodium matutinum was confirmed as the cause of death of one penguin
   and was highly suspected to be the cause of death of another three. The
   lineage LINN1 was associated with 4/5 penguin infections. AM had a key
   role in the penguin multicausal mortality event. Understanding the risk
   of AM to penguin collections at Chester Zoo and elsewhere requires
   long-term surveillance to examine the association between Plasmodium
   infection and penguin mortality and the variability in parasite
   virulence. Surveillance of Plasmodium spp. in mosquitoes and local birds
   provides information about the parasite's transmission cycle locally,
   and could warn about infection risks to species of interest, which is
   essential for efficient disease control and prevention.},

Abstract = {Genomic prediction (GP) based on haplotype alleles can capture
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects and increase predictive ability
   because the haplotypes are expected to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   with QTL. In this study, we constructed haploblocks using LD-based and
   the fixed number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (fixed-SNP) methods
   with Illumina BovineHD chip in beef cattle. To evaluate the performance
   of different haplotype block partitioning methods, we constructed
   haploblocks based on LD thresholds (from r(2) > 0.2 to r(2) > 0.8) and
   the number of fixed-SNPs (5, 10, 20). The performance of predictive
   methods for three carcass traits including liveweight (LW), dressing
   percentage (DP), and longissimus dorsi muscle weight (LDMW) was
   evaluated using three approaches (GBLUP and BayesB model based on the
   SNP, G(H)BLUP, and BayesBH models based on the haploblock, and
   G(H)BLUP+GBLUP and BayesBH+BayesB models based on the combined
   haploblock and the nonblocked SNPs, which were located between blocks).
   In this study, we found the accuracies of LD-based and fixed-SNP
   haplotype Bayesian methods outperformed the Bayesian models (up to 8.54
   +/- 7.44\% and 5.74 +/- 2.95\%, respectively). G(H)BLUP showed a high
   improvement (up to 11.29 +/- 9.87\%) compared with GBLUP. The Bayesian
   models have higher accuracies than BLUP models in most scenarios. The
   average computing time of the BayesBH+BayesB model can reduce by 29.3\%
   compared with the BayesB model. The prediction accuracies using the
   LD-based haplotype method showed higher improvements than the fixed-SNP
   haplotype method. In addition, to avoid the influence of rare haplotypes
   generated from haplotype construction, we compared the performance of GP
   by filtering four types of minor haplotype allele frequency (MHAF)
   (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1) under different conditions (LD levels were
   set at r(2) > 0.3, and the fixed number of SNPs was 5). We found the
   optimal MHAF threshold for LW was 0.01, and the optimal MHAF threshold
   for DP and LDMW was 0.025.},

Abstract = {Aggressive behaviour by dogs is a considerable social problem, but the
   ability to predict which individuals may have increased aggressive
   tendencies is very limited, restricting the development of efficient
   preventive measures. There is a common perception that certain breeds
   are more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviour, which has contributed
   to the introduction of breed-specific legislation. The rationale for
   such legislation explicitly assumes high heritability of this trait
   while also implying relatively little variation within breeds; these
   assumptions are largely untested. We compared behavioural tendencies
   between 8 breeds that are subject to legislation in at least one country
   and 17 breeds that are not subject to legislation using two validated
   psychometric tools: the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale (DIAS), which
   scores elements of impulsivity, including a tendency for aggressive
   behaviour, and Positive and Negative Activation Scale (PANAS), which
   scores sensitivity to positive and negative stimuli (which may trigger
   aggressive responses). We found that the two groups of breeds do not
   differ significantly in the specific DIAS factor relating to aggressive
   behaviour, ``Aggression Threshold and Response to Novelty{''}, or any
   other DIAS and PANAS factors. We found large variations in all
   behavioural tendencies measured by both psychometric scales within both
   groups and within each breed studied. Taken together, our findings
   indicate that breed alone is not a reliable predictor of individual
   behavioural tendencies, including those related to aggression, and
   therefore breed-specific legislation is unlikely to be an effective
   instrument for reducing risk.},

   the feasibility of its use for genetic improvement in the BCA
   Trichogramma evanescens, by phenotyping 1,049 individuals from 24
   isogenic lines. We found consistent individual variations in boldness,
   activity and exploration. Personality differences between the 24
   isogenic lines suggested a genetic origin of the variations in activity
   and exploration (broad-sense heritability estimates of 0.06 to 0.11) and
   revealed a trade-off between exploration and fecundity.},

Abstract = {In South America inhabit an endemic group of ungulates adapted to
   extreme environments: the South American camelids (SAC), a key component
   of the Andean biocultural heritage. Until today, SAC are the most
   important factor of Andean economies and social and ritual life. SAC
   include two wild species, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and the vicun \&
   SIM;a (Vicugna vicugna), and two domestic species, the llama (Lama
   glama) and the alpaca (Vicugna pacos). Endoparasitosis are one of the
   most common diseases in SAC, and have great economic and health
   relevance. Despite this, there is a lack of knowledge on this concern.
   The main objective of this work was to conduct the first systematic
   review of the diversity of gastrointestinal parasites of SAC throughout
   the entire native range of distribution and to identify several gaps in
   knowledge. The PRISMA protocol was performed and a total of 101
   documents were summarized. At least 36 parasitic helminths and five
   Eimeria spp. were registered. This work highlights the need for a
   greater number of works to know with more certainty the parasitic fauna
   of camelids in the past and present, in order to achieve predictions
   that allow proper management of camelids for their future conservation.
   Furthermore, concerted research efforts are needed to understand the
   biology, epidemiology, diagnosis and distribution of the parasitosis of
   SAC along the entire distribution range to guide conservation decisions.},

Title = {Classification of pleurodire polystomes (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea,

   the Australian and Neotropical Realms},

Abstract = {Polystomatids are platyhelminth parasites that infect mostly amphibian
   and chelonian hosts. Polystomatid of testudines were, for more than
   seven decades, classified in the three genera - Neopolystoma Price,
   1939, Polystomoides Ward, 1917 and Polystomoidella Price, 1939. The
   genus delimitation was primarily based on the absence of hamuli in
   Neopolystoma, the presence of one pair of hamuli in Polystomoidella, and
   two pairs in Polystomoides. From 2016 to 2020, five new genera were
   erected - namely Uropolystomoides Tinsley and Tinsley, 2016,
   Uteropolystomoides Tinsley, 2017, Apaloneotrema Du Preez and Verneau,
   2020, Aussietrema Du Preez and Verneau, 2020 and Fornixtrema Du Preez
   and Verneau, 2020. The generic diagnosis was based not only on the size
   and shape of morphological characters such as hamulus 1, uterus and
   eggs, but also on the site of infestation (i.e. urinary bladder, oral
   cavity or conjunctival sacs). Despite large advancements in polystome
   classification over the last decade, Neopolystoma was still polyphyletic
   with some species nested within Polystomoides and others being closely
   related to the Australian Aussietrema. Regarding the distribution of
   freshwater turtles of the two suborders Pleurodira (Southern continents)
   and Cryptodira (distributed worldwide except in Australia), one may
   wonder whether Australian chelonian polystomes of the genus Neopolystoma
   may have diverged from species infecting other pleurodires of South
   America. In the present study based on the analysis of several species
   selected among all genera, we reveal striking morphological differences
   within polystomes infecting pleurodiran turtles, which herein led to the
   proposal of two new chelonian polystome genera, Pleurodirotrema n. g.
   and Manotrema n. g. Pleurodirotrema n. g. is characterized by the
   absence of hamuli, presence of latero-ventral vaginae and includes
   species that infect either the oral region or the urinary bladder of
   Australian hosts of the Pleurodira. Manotrema n. g. is characterized by
   the presence of small hamuli, latero-ventral vaginae, deep incisions
   between suckers, a low genital spine number (<10) and includes species
   that infect the oral region of South American Pleurodira.},

Abstract = {This study describes the occurrence and molecular identification of
   Monogenea from blue mackerel Scomber australasicus (Cuvier)
   (Perciformes: Scombridae), an edible fish, from Australian waters.
   Previous studies have provided either morphological or genetic results,
   whereas this study combines both methods of species identi-fication. A
   total of 50 fish sourced from the waters off the south-eastern
   Australian coastline were examined and 71 Monogenea were recovered from
   the gills. The overall prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance
   were 64\%, 2.22, and 1.42, respectively. Monogenea were initially
   classified morphologically as five species belonging to two families.
   Family Mazocraeidae was represented by Kuhnia scombri (Kuhn, 1829)
   Sproston, 1945, K. scombercolias Nasir \& Fuentes Zambrano, 1983 and
   Pseudokuhnia minor (Goto, 1894) Rohde \& Watson, 1985 and family
   Gastrocotylidae by Gastrocotyle kurra Unnithan, 1968 and
   Allogastrocotyle bivaginalis Nasir \& Fuentes Zambrano, 1983. Molecular
   identification of Monogenea was conducted through sequencing of the
   mitochon-drial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. The host S.
   australasicus was barcoded (cox1) to confirm the specific identity.
   There was no comparable sequence available in GenBank for K.
   scombercolias. Also, limited sequences were available in GenBank for the
   gastrocotylid Monogenea identified in this study. However, phylogenetic
   analyses of cox1 sequences of the Monogenea identified in this study
   clustered according to their familial groups. Gastrocotyle kurra and A.
   bivaginalis were identified for the first-time on S. australasicus in
   Australian waters. This study provides the first sequencing of cox1 gene
   for K. scombercolias. The outcomes of the study provide a basis for
   future Monogenea research in Australian waters, as well as for other
   Scomber spp.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is a main mechanism for organisms to cope with
   changing environments and broaden their ecological range. Plasticity is
   genetically based and can evolve under natural selection, such that
   populations within a species show distinct phenotypic responses to the
   environment if evolved under different conditions. Understanding how
   intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity arises is critical to
   assess potential adaptation to ongoing climate change. Theory predicts
   that plasticity is favored in more favorable but variable environments.
   Yet, many theoretical predictions about benefits, costs, and selection
   on plasticity remain untested. To test these predictions, we took
   advantage of three genetic trials in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA,
   which assessed 23 closely located Pinus ponderosa populations over 27
   years. Mean environmental conditions and their spatial patterns of
   variation at the seed source populations were characterized based on six
   basic climate parameters. Despite the small area of origin, there was
   significant genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for tree growth
   among populations. We found a significant negative correlation between
   phenotypic plasticity and the patch size of environmental heterogeneity
   at the seed source populations, but not with total environmental spatial
   variance. These results show that populations exposed to high
   microhabitat heterogeneity have evolved higher phenotypic plasticity and
   that the trigger was the grain rather than the total magnitude of
   spatial heterogeneity. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we also
   found a positive relationship between population plasticity and summer
   drought at the seed source, indicating that drought can act as a trigger
   of plasticity. Finally, we found a negative correlation between the
   quantitative genetic variance within populations and their phenotypic
   plasticity, suggesting compensatory adaptive mechanisms for the lack of
   genetic diversity. These results improve our understanding of the
   microevolutionary drivers of phenotypic plasticity, a critical process
   for resilience of long-lived species under climate change, and support
   decision-making in tree genetic improvement programs and seed transfer
   strategies.},

Title = {Epidemiology of Trichinella infection in wild boar from Spain and its

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Trichinellosis is a notifiable zoonotic disease caused by parasitic
   nematode larvae belonging to the genus Trichinella. Domestic pig and
   wild boar are important hosts within the natural cycle of T. spiralis,
   the last one being an animal whose populations have experienced an
   important growth. Therefore, this paper studies the prevalence of
   Trichinella infection in wild boar in Spain, as well as its relation
   with hunting and its impact on public health during the period
   2006-2019. For this purpose, different sources of information were
   consulted and analyzed depending on the autonomous communities of Spain
   and years. During the fourteen years of study, the number of wild boars
   hunted and the number of cases of Trichinella infection in them
   increased (from 172 cases in 2006 to 421 in 2019), although prevalence
   values remained low as the number of animals analyzed also increased. On
   the other hand, trichinellosis in humans tended to decrease (from a peak
   of 107 cases in 2007 to 11 cases in 2019). Nevertheless, the numbers of
   both wild boars and humans infected with Trichinella in Spain are among
   the highest in Europe, and this emphasizes the importance of food
   safety, sanitary controls of game meat and citizen awareness campaigns,
   which prevent the spread of Trichinella through the human population.},

Abstract = {The nematode Trichinella pseudospiralis is a cosmopolitan parasite
   capable of infecting both birds and mammals including humans. T.
   pseudospiralis has a limited zoonotic importance in comparison to that
   of the other Trichinella species. However, it has been recognized as the
   etiological agent of two outbreaks of trichinellosis due to the
   consumption of wild boar meat. The role played by birds in the
   epidemiology of T. pseudospiralis is still unclear and needs to be
   deepened. The aim of our work was to show the results of an extensive
   wild bird sur-veillance carried out in the Emilia-Romagna (E-R) region,
   northern Italy, over the last 16 years. As part of the regional wildlife
   surveillance program, 14,933 raptors and carrion-eating birds' carcasses
   were necropsied from 2006 to 2021 and tested for the presence of
   Trichinella spp. larvae with only one positive result, an adult female
   of western marsh harrier. The larvae load (LPG) was evaluated on breast
   (100 LPG), wings (3.6 LPG), shoulder (2 LPG), head (4.5 LPG), thighs (8
   LPG), lower legs (2 LPG) and tongue (0.77 LPG). The results of the
   present study confirm that also in northern Italy T. pseudospiralis has
   a low prevalence comparing to that of other Trichinella species.
   However, this study demonstrates that T. pseudospiralis can reach a high
   parasitic load in infested birds. The large distribution range, probably
   facilitated by its ability to infest birds, suggests the need for a
   continuous monitoring program.},

Abstract = {Paramphistomes, commonly known as rumen flukes, are digenean parasites
   that infect ruminants. Accurate morphological identification of
   paramphistome species is challenging and often neglected. For instance,
   it requires sagittal midline sections of adult flukes, which are
   difficult to prepare. Therefore, the majority of the genetic information
   on paramphistomes found in the International Nucleotide Sequence
   Database is not supported by morphological descriptions, and the DNA
   barcodes of paramphistome species remain unreliable. In the present
   study, both morphological and molecular characterizations were
   simultaneously performed to ensure the reliability of the DNA
   information for the paramphistome species Calichophoron raja (Nasmark,
   1937). The morphological characteristics of the sagittal and horizontal
   sections of adult flukes from a black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) and
   a waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) in South Africa were identical to
   those previously described for Ca. raja. Additionally, this study
   represents a new host record of the species from Co. gnou. All sequences
   of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of ribosomal DNA were 100\%
   identical among the 18 flukes analyzed in the present study. A single
   nucleotide mutation was observed between Ca. raja in this study and Ca.
   raja detected in domestic ruminants in Kenya.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about ticks and Rickettsiae in Colombia is still limited and
   the areas of the country where studies have been conducted are scarce.
   In this study, ticks (Acari, Ixodidae) associated with reptiles and
   amphibians in San Juan de Carare, Santander department, were
   morphologically and molecularly identified and tested for the presence
   of Rickettsia. For the molecular characterization of ticks, CO1, 12S and
   16S sequences were generated and compared with other sequences available
   in genbank. Our analyses confirmed that the collected ticks were
   Amblyomma dissimile, and we provide the first report of this species
   parasitizing the snake Leptodeira septen-trionalis. Of the samples
   analyzed, 69\% were positive for Rickettsia sp. using the gltA, ompA and
   sca1 genes. Rickettsia sequences generated in this study were also
   compared to sequences downloaded from genbank by Bayesian inference (BI)
   and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyzes. The presence of a
   single Rickettsia species, Candidatus Rickettsia colombianensi, was
   identified. This study expands the knowledge regarding the distribution
   of A. dissimile ticks and Rickettsiae in Colombia.},

Abstract = {A new species of Eniochobothrium Shipley and Hornell, 1906 was recovered
   from the Oman cownose ray (Rhi-noptera jayakari Boulenger) from the body
   of water off the south-eastern coastline of the KwaZulu-Natal Prov-ince,
   South Africa. Eniochobothrium acostae n. sp. is described on
   morphological and molecular grounds. The new species is placed within
   Eniochobothrium (viz., Eniochobothrium gracile Shipley and Hornell,
   1906, Eniochoboth-rium qatarense Al Kawari, Saoud and Wanas, 1994,
   Eniochobothrium euaxos Jensen, 2005) by possessing key generic
   characteristics such as the absence of a vagina, expansion of the
   anterior region of the strobila forming a trough and presence of a
   thick-walled cirrus sac. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the partial
   28S rRNA and mtCOI genes confirm the generic characterisation as the
   newly proposed species groups together with other members of the genus.
   Eniochobothrium acostae n. sp. currently represents the largest
   described species of the genus; it possesses slightly fewer testes
   compared to most congeners, given that this feature has been provided in
   the original description (e.g., E. euaxos and E. qatarense). The new
   species of Eniochobothrium is the fourth valid species described to date
   and the first species record from South African waters.},

Abstract = {Parasites extracted from the lungs and the pterygoid sinus complex of 6
   species of odontocetes stranded along the north-west Spanish coast
   (Northeast Atlantic) between 2009 and 2019 were morphologically
   identified. The samples belonged to 14 specimens, including 3 harbour
   porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, 6 short-finned pilot whales, Globicephala
   macrorhynchus, 1 long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas, 1 Risso's
   dolphin, Grampus griseus, 1 striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba and 2
   bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. All animals (14/14) were
   infected by nematodes of the genus Stenurus spp.; moreover, two of them
   presented a mixed lung nematode infection by Stenurus spp. and
   Halocercus spp., and another two a mixed infection by Stenurus spp. and
   the trematode Nasitrema spp. in the pterygoid sinuses. The morphological
   characterization of the Stenurus specimens revealed the existence of
   three different species: Stenurus minor, present in the pterygoid
   sinuses of harbour porpoises with a mean intensity of 43.0 \& PLUSMN;
   9.0; Stenurus globicephalae, in the pterygoid sinuses of pilot whales
   and the Risso's dolphin (370.3 +/- 579.4); and Stenurus ovatus infecting
   bottlenose and striped dolphins' lungs (47.7 +/- 76.5). This is the
   first citation of S. minor and S. ovatus in odontoceti from the Galician
   coast. Nematodes of the genus Stenurus are frequent in odontocetes
   stranded along the north-west Spanish coast. A clear host-parasite
   association was observed between S. minor and the Phocoenidae family,
   between S. globicephalae and the sub-family Globicephalinae and between
   S. ovatus and subfamily Delphininae. Different trophic position and
   niche segregation may lead to different patterns of specificity.},

Abstract = {Helminths are not usually considered important pathogens for birds of
   prey. There is a single published report of mortality in raptors due to
   an air sac trematode infection. We report a well-documented death case
   from massive infection by an air sac trematode of the family
   Cyclocoelidae in a wild-caught, juvenile male Snail Kite (Rostr-hamus
   sociabilis) in Ecuador. The necropsy of a Snail Kite revealed more than
   200 trematodes among air sacs, lungs, heart, gizzard, proventriculus,
   and liver. Within air sacs and lungs, mature flukes were associated with
   sacculitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and atelectasis. Using an integrative
   taxonomic approach with morphological and molecular data, we identified
   the parasites as Bothrigaster variolaris (Trematoda: Cyclocoelidae:
   Oph-thalmophaginae). This case provides the first evidence for the
   pathologic presence of air sac trematodes asso-ciated with morbidity in
   birds of prey in South America. Our results suggest that cyclocoelids
   may cause debilitation and significant clinical lesions in birds of
   prey, with potentially fatal consequences.},

Abstract = {European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) have not been
   investigated in large numbers for blood-associated pathogens in Germany,
   because wildcats, being a protected species, may not be hunted, and the
   collection of samples is therefore difficult. Thus, spleen tissue and
   whole blood from 96 wildcats from Germany found as roadkill or dead from
   other causes in the years 1998-2020 were examined for the prevalence of
   blood associated pathogens using molecular genetic tools. PCR was used
   to screen for haemotrophic Mycoplasma spp., Hepatozoon spp., Cytauxzoon
   spp., Bartonella spp., Filarioidea, Anaplasmataceae, and Rickettsiales,
   and positive samples were subsequently sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses
   were performed for Mycoplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. by calculating
   phylogenetic trees and DNA haplotype networks. The following pathogens
   were found: Candidatus Mycoplasma haematominutum (7/96), Mycoplasma ovis
   (1/96), Hepatozoon silvestris (34/96), Hepatozoon felis (6/ 96),
   Cytauxzoon europaeus (45/96), and Bartonella spp. (3/96). This study
   elucidates the prevalence of bloodassociated pathogens in wildcats from
   Germany.},

   causes, an increased prevalence and intensity of the nematode
   Contracaecum osculatum has been discussed. This increase has been
   attributed to a population increase of the parasites final host, the
   grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Other studies have looked at the role of
   Contracaecum osculatum on cod growth and condition on recently caught
   cod, or done short term experimental studies in lab. This study instead
   investigated the importance of Contracaecum osculatum for cod growth in
   a sea pen based experiment, where cod were kept and fed in order to
   monitor growth. The results show that a higher density (number of
   nematodes per gram liver) decreases cod growth potential. If the number
   of nematodes exceeded 8 per gram liver cod did not grow in length, even
   when given generous amounts of food. Accounting for the lack of growth
   due to Contracaecum osculatum may improve stock assessments and increase
   the possibility to reach management targets.},

Abstract = {Octopus maya is an endemic species of the Yucatan Peninsula. This
   species sustains the octopus' fishery in the region and is the only
   cephalopod cultured in Mexico. It is known that O. maya harbor a large
   richness and abundance of metacestodes that have been tentatively
   identified by light microscopy alone. Since the larval stages of some
   orders of marine cestodes lack the taxonomic characteristics shown by
   the adult stages and on which cestode taxonomy is based, identification
   down to the species level is often unattainable. Hence, the goal of this
   study was to characterize the parasites, for the first time, at
   morphological and molecular levels. A total of 60 octopuses were
   collected from September to December 2017 from four fishery landing
   ports in Yucatan: Sisal, Progreso, Dzilam de Bravo, and Rio Lagartos (15
   hosts per locality). Morphology of metacestodes was characterized by
   light and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), while the genes 18S and
   285 rDNA were sequenced for molecular characterization. Based on
   phenotypic characters and molecular data, seven taxa of metacestodes
   were identified, four of them belonging of order Trypanorhyncha:
   Eutetrarhynchus sp., Kotorella pronosoma, Nybelinia sp.,
   Prochristianella sp. 1; and the three remaining taxa belonging to the
   order Onchoproteocephalidea: Acanthobothrium sp., Phoreiobothrium sp.,
   and Prosobothrium sp. This work provides, for the first time, molecular
   support to the morphological characterization of metacestodes recorded
   in Octopus maya.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases in the world.
   Felines excrete Toxoplasma gondii oocysts, which play a key role in the
   transmission of this protozoon. Pathological diagnoses were performed on
   four carcasses of captive tigers collected from 2019 to 2021 in China,
   and T. gondii was surveyed using serology, molecular analysis, and
   aetiology. Striated muscle samples of the tigers (n = 4) were bioassayed
   in mice. DNA derived from T. gondii tachyzoites was isolated and
   characterized using PCR-RFLP. The pathological diagnoses revealed that
   ageing, declined immune function, liver, and kidney failures caused the
   deaths in the tigers examined. A modified agglutination test (cut-off:
   1:25) revealed that IgG antibodies to T. gondii were 100\% (4/4) in the
   captive tigers. Two viable T. gondii strains (TgTigerCHn3 and
   TgTigerCHn4) were isolated from tiger striated muscles and seeded on the
   Vero cell culture for further propagation. The genotypes of TgTigerCHn3
   and TgTigerCHn4 were ToxoDB\#20 and ToxoDB\#2, respectively. The two
   strains were avirulent for Swiss mice, which matched the ROP18 and ROP5
   gene alleles of TgtigerCHn3 (3/4) and TgtigerCHn4 (3/3). Few brain
   tissue cysts (0-213) were observed in the mice after inoculation with
   TgTigerCHn3 and TgTigerCHn4. This is the first documented isolation of
   T. gondii ToxoDB\#20 and ToxoDB\#2 from tigers. The results provide
   additional direct evidence of tiger as intermediate hosts for T. gondii.
   Tigers in the zoos may potentially transmit T. gondii to other animals
   and humans.},

Title = {Where have all the grouse ticks gone? Apparent decline in collections of
   Haemaphysalis chordeilis Packard},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {323-329},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Haemaphysalis chordeilis Packard, also known as the grouse or bird tick,
   is a three-host tick native to North America. Literature from the early
   20th century reported a widespread distribution of this tick across the
   US and Canada. As its name implies, ground-dwelling birds such as grouse
   and quail were frequent hosts, and occa-sionally large infestations were
   reported in domestic flocks making it a pest of economic importance.
   However, after the mid-1900's records of this species appear scarce, and
   a number of more recent studies of ticks on birds (including ostensibly
   favored host species) did not detect it. To confirm this perception with
   data, we conducted a literature search for collection records of this
   species and compared the records across two eras (pre-1965 and
   post-1965), finding very few records of H. chordeilis in recent years,
   despite increased attention brought to this genus by the detection of
   exotic Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann populations in the eastern US.
   We also compiled a list of studies after 1965 that examined appropriate
   hosts for ectoparasites but failed to find H. chordeilis. We interpret
   the apparent decline of ticks in the context of documented population
   declines in several major host species over the same time frame and
   discuss whether ectoparasite populations should be subject to the same
   conservation consideration as their hosts.},

Title = {Limited dispersal ability and restricted niche characterize
   ?depauperons? in Melastomataceae},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The asymmetric pattern in species richness is a notable feature across
   different lineages and geographic regions. While some lineages have high
   richness, diversity and wide distribution, others have the opposite.
   Despite low rates of diversification, the latter might also be
   phylogenetically isolated. Lineages that accumulate these
   characteristics are known as ``depauperons{''} and explaining their
   existence and persistence through time is still a challenge. The plant
   family Melastomataceae contains both megadiverse lineages (such as the
   tribe Miconieae, with around 1900 species) and groups with few species
   (such as the tribes Eriocnemeae, Lithobieae, and Rupestreeae with 7, 1
   and 2 species, respectively). These three clades are restricted to
   eastern Brazil, where they have been seldom studied. The lack of
   information about their basic biology as well as which processes
   determine their distribution have not been previously studied. Here we
   integrated metrics of dispersal ability, species distribution models
   (SDMs) and natural history data compilation in order to uncover common
   patterns shared by these depauperons in Melastomataceae and raise
   conservation concerns. For all nine species we estimated the dispersal
   ability and generated SDMs in different time-periods (past, present and
   future). Dispersal ability was associated with predicted distribution
   models under future scenarios to evaluate shifts and/or retractions in
   suitable areas. In addition, we compared the climatic tolerances of the
   depauperons with their megadiverse sister tribes via climatic envelopes.
   Overall, our results indicate limited dispersal ability, dependency on
   water for dispersal, and restricted niche as common characteristics for
   all species in the deupauperon tribes Eriocnemeae, Lithobieae and
   Rupestreeae. Our analyses also show that the climatic niche spaces of
   the depauperons are limited and totally included within the niche space
   of its sister tribes. Based on our findings, the level of threat in
   these groups can be potentiated by rapid climate change, mainly due to
   their inability to spread over long distances, restricted niches and
   increased habitat fragmentation. We suggest that future conservational
   actions prioritize these unique taxa in Melastomataceae, especially if a
   phylogenetic diversity perspective is taken into account.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii was isolated in mice from different tissues of a
   captive black-and-gold howler monkey (Alouatta caraya) kept in a colony
   at the Primatology Center of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and it was
   geno-typically characterized based on using PCR-RFLP and Microsatellite
   Analysis (MS), later on. T. gondii was suc-cessfully isolated from
   inocula deriving from heart, liver and tissue pool (heart, liver, lungs,
   axillary lymph nodes and cerebellum) samples. The isolate was named
   TgBgHmBrRJ1. The high virulence of the aforementioned strain was
   observed in infected mice. Non-archetypal genotype (ToxoDB PCR-RFLP
   \#206) was obtained through PCR-RFLP. This genotype had been previously
   described in 12 isolates from different hosts, also in Southeastern
   Brazil, a fact that indicates likely high circulation of this genotype
   in this region. The isolate was also classified as non-archetypal, based
   on MS genotyping, as well as presented genotypic identity close to that
   of strains isolated from free-range non-symptomatic chickens
   (TgCkBr244,245,278,279) in Espirito Santo State. It is worth emphasizing
   that despite the large number of reports about clinical toxoplasmosis in
   neotropical primates in Brazil, this is just the second isolate of this
   parasite ever reported in this group of animals.},

Abstract = {Based on a long-term field investigation in the five provincial regions
   of Southwest China between 2001 and 2019, the present paper studied the
   infestation and related ecology of chigger mites (chiggers) on the large
   Chinese vole (Eothenomys miletus), an endemic and dominant rodent
   species in the regions. A total of 52331 chiggers were collected from
   2661 voles, and 52261 mites were identified as 185 species and 13 genera
   in the family Trombiculidae with very high species diversity. The
   identified 185 chigger species on E. miletus (a single rodent species)
   even exceeded those recorded in some countries. The overall infestation
   prevalence (Pm = 53.96\%), mean abundance (MA = 19.64) and mean
   intensity (MI = 36.39) on E. miletus were much higher than those on some
   other rodent species in the same regions. Although the species
   composition showed a moderate similarity (J = 0.63) between male and
   female hosts (E. miletus), the infestation indices (Pm = 56.25\%, MA =
   21.67) of chiggers on male hosts were higher than those on the females
   (Pm = 51.23\%, MA = 17.09) (P < 0.05). Two dominant chigger species,
   Leptotrombidium scutellare (Cr = 19.17\%) and L. sinicum (Cr = 11.06\%),
   showed an aggregated distribution pattern among different individuals of
   their host E. miletus, and a relatively high degree of positive
   association existed between the two dominant chigger species with PCC =
   0.57, DI = 0.60 and OI = 0.62 (x2 = 857.46, P < 0.001). Leptotrombidium
   densipunctatum, Walchia koi, Helenicula hsui, L. scutellare and W.
   ewingi showed a high degree of environmental adaptability to their
   environments with high niche breadths. The theoretical curve of the
   species abundance distribution of chigger community on E. miletus was
   successfully fitted with Preston's lognormal distribution model. Based
   on the theoretical curve fitting, the expected total number of chigger
   species on E. miletus was roughly estimated to be 223 species, and 38
   chigger species were probably missed in the sampling investigation.},

Title = {Robust methods are needed to resolve contradictions in species richness
   curves along ecological gradients},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nonmonotonic changes in species richness along ecological gradients are
   frequently observed in nature. While theories support both symmetric and
   skewed unimodal relationships, related studies usually fit second-order
   polynomials, which assume symmetric relationships. These studies often
   apply various transformations of the predictor variable to reduce the
   effects of outliers or to meet assumptions of normality. We studied
   whether predictor transformation affects the shape of the fitted curves.
   To test the effect of predictor transformation on the shape of the
   fitted curves, we re-analyzed the dataset of a highly-cited global
   analysis on the productivi-ty-species richness relationship without
   performing any data transformations and contrasted the results with
   those of the original analyses that used log-transformed productivity
   data. We found that predictor variable transformation, which was used in
   the original paper, changed the shape of fitted curves in 32 \% of the
   sites as well as the shape of the global relationship compared to the
   use of untransformed data. Therefore, we propose the reconsideration of
   predictor transformation and suggest an alternative approach: the
   piecewise regression. We found that piecewise regression is robust
   against predictor variable transformation. It resulted in much fewer
   inconsistent shape categories between the transformed and untransformed
   cases compared to the original ana -lyses (2 instead of 9). We suggest
   that studies applying untransformed and transformed predictors when
   studying the shape of species richness curves along gradients are not
   directly comparable. Using piecewise regression models may contribute
   toward resolving the ongoing debate on the change in species richness
   along ecological gradients in general, and the productivity-species
   richness relationship in particular.},

Title = {Similar diversification patterns in ``sky islands{''}: A comparative
   approach in lineages from campo rupestre and campo de altitude},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Campo rupestre and campo de altitude are two highly diverse plant
   formations that are found in montane areas in eastern Brazil. These
   formations are associated with landscapes having different geological
   histories and are part of different phytogeographic domains under
   different climatic conditions. It is unclear however, whether line-ages
   in each area have different diversification dynamics and climatic niche
   evolution. Here we analyze biogeographical history, climatic niche
   evolution and diversification dynamics of the Cambessedesieae
   (Mela-stomataceae), a clade with many endemics in each formation. We use
   a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree alongside carefully curated
   distribution points to estimate ancestral ranges and compare
   diversification dynamics and climatic niche evolution across the group,
   using models of geographical range evolution (BioGeoBEARS),
   diversification dynamics (BAMM, GeoSSE) and trait-evolution (l1ou). Our
   results show that Cambessedesieae is a relatively old (Early Eocene, 48
   Mya) clade in comparison to other lineages of similar distribution. An
   initial split between lineages that are mainly endemic to either
   formation happened earlier, but, surprisingly, these two lineages have
   similar diversification dynamics and climatic niche evolution. Shifts in
   climatic regimes in extant lineages occurred more recently and are not
   associated with changes in diversification rates. Overall, we show that
   lineages endemic to montane areas and having different geological
   histories and in different climatic and phytogeographic contexts can
   have similar diversification patterns.},

Title = {Inbreeding depression changes with stress response over time in flooded
   Mimulus guttatus},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Inbreeding usually reduces offspring fitness ('inbreeding depression',
   ID), and may affect the plasticity of functional traits involved in the
   response to stress. ID is often found to increase under stress, but
   there are also reports of no effects or even a reduction of ID under
   stress. One reason for this variation that has received little attention
   may be related to different concepts of stress. In particular, the
   magnitude of ID may be unrelated to the effect of an environment on
   fitness (evolutionary stress concept), but increase particularly during
   the `alarm phase' after a stress has been initiated (physiological
   stress concept). We clonally replicated inbred and outbred Mimulus
   guttatus plants, for which ID was known to increase under flooding. We
   exposed the clonal replicates to control and flooding conditions and
   harvested replicates of each genotype after two, six and 11 weeks of
   growth. As functional traits related to stress response we measured
   chlorophyll fluorescence, root mass and the production of stolons and
   adventitious roots. As fitness estimates we measured biomass and flower
   number, and we pollinated a subset of plants and grew a second
   generation of plants under control and flooding conditions to calculate
   multiplicative fitness. Overall, M. guttatus proved to be very
   flooding-tolerant. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was not influenced
   by flooding, but decreased with leaf age and increased after
   fertilization. At the end of the experiment, biomass and flower number
   (F1 generation) as well as multiplicative fitness (including performance
   in the F2 generation) were even higher under flooding than under control
   conditions. Flooding reduced the root mass in the pots, but increased
   the production of stolons and floating roots. Plasticity in these traits
   can be regarded as beneficial, although selection gradient analysis
   failed to identify plasticity in stolon number as adaptive. Only two
   functional traits were influenced by an interaction between flooding and
   inbreeding, early stolon length (suggesting a reduced flooding escape
   response of inbred plants) and root tissue density of floating
   adventitious roots (suggesting a reduced aeration of the roots of inbred
   offspring). ID in fitness-related traits was higher under flooding, but
   its magnitude changed strongly over the course of the experiment. ID
   under flooding was particularly high after two weeks (8 = 0.42 vs. 0.05
   in the control), suggesting sensitivity of inbred plants to the
   initiation of flooding ('alarm phase' of stress response). This effect
   had disappeared after 6 weeks when plants had acclimated to ongoing
   flooding. However, under flooding ID increased again after 11 weeks,
   this time because outbred plants grew much better under flooded than
   control conditions, and the same pattern was found for the
   multiplicative fitness function (8 = 0.68 under flooding vs. 0.36 in the
   control). Our results suggest that ID was higher under flooding, but not
   because this environment was generally more stressful. Instead, at an
   early stage ID increased because inbred offspring was more sensitive to
   the physiological stress after the initiation of flooding ('alarm
   phase'), whereas at a late stage ID increased because outbred offspring
   was more capable of exploiting the favourable flooding conditions. In
   general, our results show that phenotypic plasticity may often be robust
   against the effects of inbreeding.
   Moreover, ID may increase in particular under conditions of
   physiological stress, during which many stress-specific genes are
   expressed, whereas ID may not necessarily increase under constant poor
   conditions that reduce fitness, even if the stress is very strong in the
   evolutionary sense.},

Title = {Historical biogeography of Cannabis in the Iberian Peninsula: A

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The tempo and mode of colonization of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) by
   Cannabis sativa, its further internal spreading and the potential
   cultural and environmental factors involved remain unknown. The
   available continental-wide European meta-analyses using pollen and
   archeological evidence account for only a few IP sites, insufficient for
   a sound assessment. This paper presents a nearly comprehensive database
   of almost 60 IP sites with palynological evidence of Cannabis and
   analyzes the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns. The first scattered
   records of this pollen type date from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic
   (150-12 kyr BP) and would have entered the IP by maritime Mediterranean
   or terrestrial continental pathways, or both. A first burst of
   in-troductions, probably in a cultivated form, would have occurred
   during the Neolithic (7-5 kyr BP) using similar paths. Human
   participation in these Neolithic introductions remains unclear but
   cannot be dismissed. A period of reduced Cannabis arrivals (mostly via
   maritime pathway) occurred between the Chalcolithic and the Roman Epoch
   (4.5-2 kyr BP), when the innermost parts of the IP were colonized (Late
   Bronze). A second, likely anthropogenic, introduction acceleration took
   place in the Middle Ages (1.5 kyr BP onward) using the Medi-terranean
   and the continental pathways. Maximum cultivation and hemp retting
   activity was recorded during the Modern Ages (16th-19th centuries),
   coinciding with the increased demand of hemp fiber to supply the Spanish
   royal navy for imperial expansion and commerce. A potential link between
   Cannabis colonization/introduction bursts and climatic warmings has been
   observed that should be tested with future studies. Regional moisture
   variations seem to be less influential. Further efforts to enhance and
   improve the database used in this study are encouraged. The results of
   this paper should be compared with archeological and historical evidence
   to clarify the role of human migrations and cultural changes in the
   historical biogeography of Cannabis in the IP.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In non-fire prone ecosystems, like some subtropical humid forests, fire
   produces habitat destruction and intensifies land degradation by
   inducing changes in native species composition, soil properties and
   erosive processes. Bryophytes are key components of the Macaronesian
   laurel forests playing an important role in regulating water cycling and
   microclimate. Ecological and taxonomical bryophytes groups have distinct
   ecological and physiological requirements and may respond in a different
   way to the same fire events. Therefore, analysing post fire recovery of
   bryophyte communities represents a key step towards a better
   understanding of forest fire drivers and post fire management. We
   investigated how species richness and composition of different
   ecological and taxonomical bryophyte groups varied in 1158 samples
   within a fire chronosequence from 5 to 57 years in the best-preserved
   laurel forest from Canary Islands (Garajonay National Park) analysing
   communities in terms of differences with comparable surrounding old
   growth unburnt stands. Epiphyte, terricolous and saxicolous bryophytes
   were sampled at each plot and the influence of the time since fire was
   analyzed together with environmental variables (temperature,
   precipitation, mist precipitation and elevation) and forest structure
   variables. Our results indicate that there is no general pattern of post
   fire recolonization, as recolonization varies depending on the
   ecological and phylogenetic groups considered. Climate and forest
   structure play an important role in post-fire recolonization, such that
   time since fire is not the most important variable influencing richness
   and composition. The results increase the understanding of the processes
   that shape compositional patterns in groups with high dispersal
   capacities and high microclimate dependence, such as mosses and
   liverworts.},

Title = {Plant water stress, not termite herbivory, causes Namibia's fairy
   circles},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The fairy circles of Namibia form a remarkable gap pattern in arid
   grassland along the Namib Desert. The origin of the fairy circles is
   subject to an ongoing debate. Solving the mystery of the fairy circles
   (FCs) requires the right timing in fieldwork after rainfall, as the
   newly appearing grasses complete their life cycle within only a few
   weeks. Here we followed the rains along the Namib between 2020 and 2022
   and assessed the cause of the grass death within FCs at different time
   intervals after grass-triggering rainfall. To assess whether termite
   herbivory was the cause, we used grass excavations and observations on
   the roots and shoots. To test if edaphic differences may explain the
   grass death in FCs, we undertook infiltration measurements in 10
   FC-hotspot regions. Finally, we used continuous soil-moisture
   measurements from the dry into the rainy seasons to examine how the
   newly emerging grasses affect the soil-water content in space and time.
   Generally, in study plots that received grass -triggering rainfall most
   recently, the roots of the dead grasses in FCs were in 100 \% of the
   cases undamaged, root-shoot ratios were significantly greater, and the
   roots were as long or even longer as those of the surrounding matrix
   grasses outside of the FCs. This indicates that drought stress caused
   grasses in the FCs to invest resources into roots to reach the
   percolating water. The results also show that the cause of the grass
   death in fairy circles was not induced by termite herbivory. Also, we
   found no systematic differences in the rate of water infiltration
   between FCs and the matrix, hence the plant wilting cannot result from
   quicker percolation within FCs. However, the soil-moisture measurements
   indicate that the matrix grasses strongly depleted the upper soil water
   of the FCs after rainfall, which explains why most grasses cannot
   establish and quickly die in the FCs. The research shows that grass
   death in fairy circles occurs immediately after rainfall due to plant
   water stress but not due to termite activity. Our results conform with
   previous fieldwork, pattern analysis and theoretical modeling,
   suggesting that Namibia's fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation
   phenomenon induced by ecohydrological feedbacks.},

Title = {Restoration of Geographically Isolated Wetlands: An Amphibian-Centric
   Review of Methods and Effectiveness},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Geographically isolated wetlands provide a critical habitat for
   pond-breeding amphibians, a taxa of broad conservation concern. Global
   wetland loss and degradation has made restoration essential for
   amphibian conservation. Restoration goals typically include recovering
   the wetlands' physiochemical, hydrological, and ecological functions.
   However, for pond-breeding amphibians, successful restoration should
   also result in sustained populations, which is difficult to assess and
   infrequently reported. In this paper, we review the available evidence
   that restoration of geographically isolated wetlands promotes
   pond-breeding amphibian occupancy and population persistence. We provide
   an overview of restoration practices addressing hydrology, vegetation,
   and ecological processes within these unique environments and across
   spatial scales. We then summarize the evidence, and discuss the
   limitations, for evaluating successful restoration within the context of
   amphibian conservation across these categories. Finally, we provide
   recommendations for researchers and practitioners to leverage prior
   successes and establish systematic data collection and dissemination.
   Moving restoration of wetlands for amphibian conservation forward will
   require more robust data collection and reporting.},

Title = {Assessing Genetic Diversity and Searching for Selection Signatures by

   Livestock of the Central Region of Russia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Indigenous pig breeds are mainly associated with the adaptive capacity
   that is necessary to respond adequately to climate change, food
   security, and livelihood needs, and natural resources conservation.
   Livni pigs are an indigenous fat-type breed farmed in a single farm in
   the Orel region and located in the Central European part of the Russian
   Federation. To determine the genomic regions and genes that are affected
   by artificial selection, we conducted the comparative study of two pig
   breeds with different breeding histories and breeding objectives, i.e.,
   the native fat-type Livni and meat-type Duroc breeds using the Porcine
   GGP HD BeadChip, which contains similar to 80,000 SNPs. To check the
   Livni pigs for possible admixture, the Landrace and the Large White
   breeds were included into the study of genetic diversity as these breeds
   participated in the formation of the Livni pigs. We observed the highest
   level of genetic diversity in Livni pigs compared to commercial breeds
   (H-U(E) = 0.409 vs. 0.319-0.359, p < 0.001; A(R) = 1.995 vs.
   1.894-1.964, p < 0.001). A slight excess of heterozygotes was found in
   all of the breeds. We identified 291 candidate genes, which were
   localized within the regions under putative selection, including 22 and
   228 genes, which were specific for Livni and Duroc breeds, respectively,
   and 41 genes common for both breeds. A detailed analysis of the
   molecular functions identified the genes, which were related to the
   formation of meat and fat traits, and adaptation to environmental
   stress, including extreme temperatures, which were different between
   breeds. Our research results are useful for conservation and sustainable
   breeding of Livni breed, which shows a high level of genetic diversity.
   This makes Livni one of the valuable national pig genetic resources.},

Abstract = {Gastropoda are an important component of the freshwater benthic
   communities of Western Siberia and participate in a number of trophic
   relationships and as the intermediate hosts of trematodes. The purpose
   of this study is defining the ratio of Bithyniidae mollusks between
   other gastropods with regard to species diversity, and to compile all
   information about the abundance of bithyniid snails that we examined
   over 27 years in four major basins situated in the Novosibirsk region.
   Analyzing the data diversity and abundance of gastropod communities from
   freshwater ecosystems south of Western Siberia, we found that 22\% of
   the water bodies contained bithyniid snails. In total, 201 samples that
   were abundant with bithyniid snails of reproductive age were collected
   in 34 localities in 25 water bodies. While these freshwater snails are
   not abundant in most of the inspected reservoirs (fewer than 10 mollusks
   per square meter), two of the water bodies accommodated a great number
   of Bithyniidae (more than 100 ind.center dot m(-2)). Bithyniid snail
   abundance may vary tenfold in different years in the same water body.
   This and the study of seasonal dynamics show that the abundance of
   bithyniid snails of reproductive age decreased from June to August in
   all years. The results of this study can be used to identify and predict
   the natural foci of opisthorchiasis in the south of Western Siberia.},

Title = {High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals the Effect of Feeding on
   Overwintering Hirudo nipponia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To investigate the effect of feeding on hibernating Hirudo nipponia,
   metagenomic sequencing was performed on the microorganisms collected
   from the digestive tract of H. nipponia individuals that were fed (FW)
   or starving (SW) before hibernation. In addition, the salivary gland
   tissues were obtained from these individuals to conduct transcriptome
   sequencing. Results showed that feeding before hibernation increased the
   relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria at the phylum
   level and that of Aeromonas, Mucinivorans, Bacteroides, and
   Desulfovibrio at the genus level. Functional prediction results
   indicated that feeding before hibernation not only improved metabolic
   capacity but also increased the susceptibility of H. nipponia to
   pathogens. Among the 133,082 unigenes obtained by transcriptome
   sequencing, a total of 2801 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
   found, of which 355 were up-regulated and 2446 were down-regulated; the
   expression patterns of 15 selected DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR.
   Results from the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that a majority
   of these DEGs were involved in the signal transduction pathways. This
   study established a basis for H. nipponia breeding during hibernation
   through analyses of the abundance of microorganisms in the digestive
   tract and the gene expression pattern of salivary glands by
   high-throughput sequencing. The findings also revealed the effect of
   feeding on the expression of both gastrointestinal microorganisms and
   salivary gland genes of hibernating H. nipponia.},

Title = {Reproductive Ecology and Nesting Site Characteristics of Four-Toed
   Salamanders (Hemidactylium scutatum) in Natural and Constructed
   Upland-Embedded Wetlands on the Appalachian Plateau, Kentucky},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many forested freshwater wetlands have been altered or destroyed, and
   wetlands are constructed to offset loss. However, they do not always
   replace the function of natural wetlands. It is important to understand
   how features of the habitat differ between types of wetlands and whether
   constructed wetlands provide an adequate habitat for species adapted to
   natural wetlands. Our objectives were to measure the characteristics of
   Four-toed Salamanders' nesting habitat and determine which factors
   contribute to the abundance of eggs and nests in natural and constructed
   upland-embedded wetlands within a ridgetop ecosystem in eastern
   Kentucky. We located and examined characteristics for 207 nests in
   twelve wetlands and measured variables at the nest level and at the
   wetland level. The best predictor of the number of eggs and number of
   nests was amount of moss at the wetland. These measures of reproductive
   effort were similar between types of wetlands, but the number of eggs
   per nest was higher in constructed wetlands and inversely related to
   amount of moss, highlighting a deficit in nesting habitat. Research of
   embryonic and larval survival is needed but based on data from other
   amphibian species in this system, we predict that the survival of
   Four-toed Salamanders' larvae is low in constructed wetlands with
   permanent hydrology. Restoration of constructed wetlands should address
   the need for moss as nesting substrate and drying of the wetland to
   reduce the abundance and diversity of predators of larvae.},

Title = {Predicting the Potential Suitable Area of the Invasive Ant Linepithema
   humile in China under Future Climatic Scenarios Based on Optimized
   MaxEnt},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Linepithema humile (Mayr, 1868) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is one of
   ``100 of the world's worst invasive alien species{''} listed by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources
   (IUCN). Although native to South America, this ant has spread worldwide
   via international trade. Currently, L. humile has not been found in
   China, and if it invades China, it might pose a potential risk to the
   native invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, and human livelihoods. Based
   on 2432 global occurrence records and ten bioclimatic variables, the
   optimized MaxEnt model was used to predict the potential suitable areas
   of L. humile in China. We analyzed the important bioclimatic variables
   affecting the potential suitable areas, and determined the changes in
   potential suitable areas under future climatic scenarios. Our results
   indicated that the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (Bio11),
   precipitation of the coldest quarter (Bio19), mean temperature of the
   wettest quarter (Bio8), and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18)
   were the most important bioclimatic variables. Under the current
   climatic scenarios, the potential suitable area of L. humile in China is
   80.31 x 10(4) km(2), which is mainly located in Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan,
   Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hubei. Under future climate scenarios over
   coming decades, the potential suitable areas of L. humile showed an
   overall increase and a shift to higher latitudes, which indicated the
   invasion risk of L. humile in China will increase under climate change.
   Our findings provide the theoretical guidance for the early warning and
   monitoring of L. humile in China.},

Title = {Resilience and Species Accumulation across Seafloor Habitat Transitions
   in a Northern New Zealand Harbour},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecosystem stability and
   functionality under increasing anthropogenic stress. Part of this
   resilience comes from having many species performing the same function
   (functional redundancy) leading to the quantification of community
   composition and functional redundancy in relation to increasing stress.
   However, much of the research within coastal ecosystems focuses on
   distinct areas, rather than whole ecosystems. Here, we investigate the
   relationship between biodiversity and functional redundancy across two
   environmental gradients (sediment mud content and water column depth)
   and different habitat types following a survey of benthic macrofauna and
   sediment characteristics at 24 sites within Whangarei Harbour, New
   Zealand. We observed strong gradients in biodiversity which fragmented
   communities into fewer species that were a subset of the wider
   community. The lowest biodiversity was observed at muddy, intertidal and
   shallow subtidal sites which also had the lowest predicted functional
   redundancy. We show the stronger influence of water column depth on
   predicted functional redundancy than sediment mud content, highlighting
   the importance of subtidal regions. Overall, our study highlights the
   importance of studying the individual contributions of different areas
   in a landscape to characterise effective colonist pool size and how this
   can be used to predict recovery potential following disturbance.},

Title = {Effect of Different Types of Continuous Cropping on Microbial
   Communities and Physicochemical Properties of Black Soils},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The barriers caused by continuous tillage have had a negative impact on
   the crop and soil environment. Black soils are economically important as
   a valuable natural resource in Northeast China, but limited soil
   resources have led to continuous planting of major food crops and
   medicinal plants. At present, the extent to which two different types of
   plants-grains and medicinal plants that are successively grown on the
   same soil-have an impact on soil quality and microbiology is not known.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of different types of
   long-term continuous cropping on soil and soil microbial communities by
   determining the physicochemical properties, the soil community
   composition and function of grain crops and medicinal-plant soils with
   more than five years of continuous cropping, as well as fallow soils.
   The results showed that long-term continuous cropping reduced the pH of
   different types of soils, but there was no significant difference in the
   content of AK. The relative abundance of beneficial dominant phyla, such
   as Actinomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Green Campylobacter decreased and
   the relative abundance of pathogenic genera such as Alternaria and
   Didymellaceae, increased after the long-term continuous cropping of DM
   (grain crops) and DG (medicinal plants). Specifically, continuous
   cropping increased the relative abundance of fungi with pathogenic
   potential, such as Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Saccharomycetes,
   and Mucoromycetes in grain soils and Agaricostilbomycetes in herb soils.
   Among the soil physicochemical properties, NH4+-N and pH were the most
   important factors contributing to changes in the composition of
   bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Continuous cropping of
   different types of plants altered the diversity of the microbial
   communities, with the most significant effect from the continuous
   cropping of food crops. Our findings provide a scientific and
   theoretical basis for future agricultural research to improve soil
   microbial activity, mitigate continuous-cropping barriers, and increase
   productivity.},

Abstract = {The Polygonum sibiricum (Laxm.) Tzvelev, an important herbal species
   used to protect seawalls, has a solid resistance to salinity and alkali
   and can grow on alkali spots in saline-alkali soils. So far, the
   composition, population, and characteristics of its rhizosphere
   biological community related to the adaptation salt-alkali environment
   were still unknown. In the present study, rhizosphere and
   non-rhizosphere soil samples from the P. sibiricum on Chenier Island
   were collected. High-throughput sequencing was conducted to obtain the
   structural diversity of rhizosphere microbial communities. Our results
   showed that the dominant bacteria groups in the rhizosphere and
   non-rhizosphere were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Gemmatimonadota,
   and Actinobacteriota. The dominant fungi groups in the rhizosphere and
   non-rhizosphere soil samples were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota,
   Chytridiomycota, and Mortierellomycota. The results of the ASVs
   (amplicon sequence variants) showed that fungi have more ASVs in common.
   The PERMANOVA analysis showed that the bacteria among different groups
   were significantly different. The PCoA (principal coordinates analysis)
   study also showed that the structures of the bacterial and fungal
   communities between the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere were distinct.
   Function results showed that the relative abundance in COG (Clusters of
   Orthologous Groups of proteins) functional annotation was significantly
   different between the two groups. In addition to the general function
   prediction and carbohydrate transport and metabolism, the COG of the
   non-rhizosphere was higher than that of the rhizosphere. Our findings
   benefited the knowledge for studying and conserving the molecule-level
   adaptive mechanisms of P. sibiricum.},

Title = {Effects of David Deer Grazing on Soil Bacterial and Fungal Communities
   in an Eastern Coastal Wetland of China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The grazing activity of animals has a significant role on the
   environmental modification of land. In the coastal wetlands of eastern
   China, long-term David deer (Elaphurus davidianus) grazing has caused
   the degradation of various ecological elements in the area. Still, few
   studies have been reported concerning the effects of David deer grazing
   on the soil microorganisms of their habitats. We analyzed the community
   structure of soil bacteria and fungi in an area of continuous annual
   grazing and another area without traces of David deer grazing so as to
   learn about the effects of deer grazing on the soil microbial community
   structure in a spatial instead of temporal way, in preparation for
   improving the environment for deer survival. David deer grazing
   drastically changed the physicochemical characteristics of the soil,
   accelerating the alkalinization process and inhibiting the buildup of
   nutrients. There were differences in the microbial community structure
   between the grazed and the control areas, with bacteria predominating.
   The control had a higher level of bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity
   than the grazed area. The makeup of the soil's microbial community was
   also influenced, except for the dominant microbial at the phylum level.
   In addition to the establishment of numerous complex fungal functional
   types, David deer grazing increased the number of bacterial functional
   types linked to the carbon cycle. The impacts of soil pH and urease
   activity on bacterial and fungi populations were highlighted using the
   redundancy analysis. This study demonstrates that David deer grazing
   changes and complicates microbial functional kinds of composition, as
   well as modifies the composition of the soil's microbial community,
   improving the soil nutrient cycling process, mainly the carbon element.},

Title = {Current and Future Distribution Modeling of Socotra Cormorants Using
   MaxEnt},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Socotra Cormorant (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) is a regionally
   endemic seabird that is vulnerable due to human disturbance and habitat
   degradation. This study aimed to predict the potential current and
   future marine distribution of the species under different climate change
   scenarios using environmental variables affecting distribution using
   MaxEnt. Occurrence data were collected over several years using
   satellite tagged adults in the Arabian Gulf. The current model showed
   large areas of high suitability, mainly in the Arabian Gulf and in the
   Red Sea, where 31,300 km(2) or 48\% of total highly suitable areas
   existed. These areas are currently not utilized by the species. The
   future model predicted a sharp decline in suitable areas with 73\% loss
   under the SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario of 2050 (extreme scenario).
   Nevertheless, the Red Sea is predicted to still hold considerable
   moderately suitable areas. Suitable areas increased around the Socotra
   archipelago. The model did not include biological variables due to lack
   of fish distribution data. Two variables, namely, mixed layer thickness
   and sea floor depth, explained most of the species' distribution. These
   variables significantly influence nutrient cycling and forage fish
   distribution patterns, which in turn influence seabird distributions.
   Thus, the model could be useful in predicting the distribution of
   Socotra cormorants. However, the model outcomes should be interpreted
   with caution as potential areas of future expansion of the species to be
   further tested and validated. Conserving these areas as a precaution
   might encourage the Socotra Cormorant to colonize the region and persist
   in the future under the most extreme climate change scenarios, given
   that small forage fish that are eaten by the species are abundant in the
   predicted areas outside of the Arabian Gulf.},

Title = {Active Sampling and Understory Traps Can Cost-Effectively Detect Changes
   in Butterfly Communities after Hydroelectric Dam Construction},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Monitoring programs are essential to conservation but
   are often restricted by limited financial resources. Optimal monitoring
   can lead to higher cost-effectiveness. (2) Methods: In this study, we
   used butterflies as bioindicators to assess the effects of filling a dam
   in the Brazilian Amazon. We studied the effects of flooding on butterfly
   assemblages through samples collected before and after the flooding. We
   contrasted three sampling techniques: baited traps in the (a) canopy and
   (b) understory and (c) active collections using entomological nets. (3)
   Results: Community composition showed low resistance, with pronounced
   changes after disturbance, and low resilience, with the failure to
   recover taxonomic diversity even after two years. We found that using
   the three techniques together was redundant and baited understory traps
   alone were sufficient to detect community changes. (4) Conclusions: Our
   study adds to the currently limited knowledge about the effects of
   hydroelectric plants on terrestrial insect fauna. In addition,
   identifying cost-effective monitoring, which is often lacking in
   conservation studies, allows projects to use time and financial
   resources more efficiently, particularly given the financial limitations
   available for conservation studies in tropical countries.},

Title = {Ecological Distribution Patterns and Indicator Species Analysis of
   Climber Plants in Changa Manga Forest Plantation},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climbing plants have an important role in forest communities and
   ecosystems. Despite the significance of the climbers in ecosystems, most
   of the previous research work in Pakistan has been concentrated on
   trees, shrubs, and herbs, with little attention paid to climbing plants.
   The current study investigated the ecology of climbers and the influence
   of soil characteristics on diversity, richness, and indicator species
   distribution in the Changa Manga Forest Plantation, Punjab, Pakistan.
   Field surveys were carried out between 2020 and 2021, with the data
   gathered using a random sample approach for ordination and cluster
   analysis of each plant species and edaphic data from sample plots. We
   reported a total of 29 climber species belonging to 23 genera and 9
   families from the area. The Convolvulaceae family was the most
   prevalent, followed by Apocynaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Herbaceous
   climbers were the typical life form (70\% species) and species showed
   peak flowering during the months of August and September. The
   multivariate analysis and cluster analysis grouped the climbers into
   four distinct communities based on the indicator species, representing
   filtering of the species pool in the studied area. Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis (CCA) results showed that soil factors had a
   significant influence (p <= 0.002) on the climbers' diversity and
   distribution pattern. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding
   of climbing plant ecology in response to soil variables, with immediate
   consequences for policy and practice in this Himalayan region, as well
   as research insights for neighboring Himalayan regions and elsewhere in
   the world.},

Abstract = {Identifying the distribution dynamics of invasive alien species can help
   in the early detection of and rapid response to these invasive species
   in newly invaded sites. Ageratina adenophora, a worldwide invasive
   plant, has spread rapidly since its invasion in China in the 1940s,
   causing serious damage to the local socioeconomic and ecological
   environment. To better control the spread of this invasive plant, we
   used the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS based on field survey data and online
   databases to simulate and predict the spatial and temporal distribution
   patterns and risk areas for the spread of this species in China, and
   thus examined the key factors responsible for this weed's spread. The
   results showed that the risk areas for the invasion of A. adenophora in
   the current period were 18.394 degrees N-33.653 degrees N and 91.099
   degrees E-121.756 degrees E, mainly in the tropical and subtropical
   regions of China, and densely distributed along rivers and
   well-developed roads. The high-risk areas are mainly located in the
   basins of the Lancang, Jinsha, Yalong, and Anning Rivers. With global
   climate change, the trend of continued invasion of A. adenophora is more
   evident, with further expansion of the dispersal zone towards the
   northeast and coastal areas in all climatic scenarios, and a slight
   contraction in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau. Temperature, precipitation,
   altitude, and human activity are key factors in shaping the distribution
   pattern of A. adenophora. This weed prefers to grow in warm and
   precipitation-rich environments such as plains, hills, and mountains; in
   addition, increasing human activities provide more opportunities for its
   invasion, and well-developed water systems and roads can facilitate its
   spread. Measures should be taken to prevent its spread into these risk
   areas.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss affects the nature of biotic interactions in all ecosystems
   and at all levels of the food web. Nevertheless, little attention has
   been given to soil nematodes in tropical habitats despite their
   important role in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Here, we analyzed the
   influence of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the absolute and
   relative density and composition (i.e., trophic guilds) of soil nematode
   communities associated with the rhizosphere of the tropical herb
   Heliconia collinsiana in continuous mature forests and human-induced
   secondary forests. We compared nematode densities based on the following
   feeding guilds: bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores and predators.
   Thereafter, we classified herbivorous nematodes into genera and
   described soil properties in both habitat types including pH, electrical
   conductivity, and organic matter content. Herbivores were significantly
   the most abundant feeding guild for both habitats represented by
   Criconemella spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Meloidogyne spp., which
   showed no significant differences in density between habitats. Relative
   but not absolute nematode density differed between habitats, with
   fungivore nematodes being significantly lower in secondary forests. No
   significant differences in soil properties were detected. Overall, our
   results suggest that forest disturbance affects the nematode community
   associated with the rhizosphere of H. collinsiana which may affect
   forest succession and the dynamics of the soil biota. Our study
   contributes to the understanding of biotic interactions in conserved and
   disturbed tropical habitats.},

Title = {An Update of Amphipoda Checklist for the English Channel},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An updated checklist for 2022 of amphipods from the English Channel (La
   Manche) is given for eight geographical zones. This revision brings the
   inventory of 1999 up to date with recent data from the Normano-Breton
   Gulf and other studies focused on non-indigenous fauna, as well as
   recent data from benthic and suprabenthic studies, mainly in the eastern
   part of the English Channel (EC). The total number of species in the
   entire EC is 269. The number of species is much higher in the western
   basin (WEC) than it is in the eastern basin (EEC) or in the central part
   of the EC. The amphipod species listed here are distributed between the
   eight zones as follows: French WEC: 201 species; English WEC: 194;
   Normano-Breton Gulf: 224; Bay of Seine: 172; Wight: 97; French EEC: 149;
   English EEC: 64; and Central EC: 61. Of these species, 180 are present
   in both basins of the EC, while 78 are present only in the western basin
   and 11 are present only in the eastern basin. The low number of
   amphipods (<100) recorded in three of the eight zones is probably due to
   the lack of observations in these parts of the EC. Among the 269
   amphipod species recorded with confidence in the EC, 24 are new to the
   EC since 1999, 12 are non-indigenous species, and 44 are observed only
   in one of the eight zones, mainly in the three zones of the western
   basin of the EC.},

Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of hurricanes have increased with climate
   change, and their effects on most taxa are not known. We analyzed a
   species diversity of bats in three locations with different regimes of
   anthropic disturbance. We assessed the effect of the season and
   post-hurricane time on the abundance of trophic guilds in coastal
   Jalisco, Mexico, during the two years following Hurricane Patricia
   (category 4). During a sampling effort of 15,629.76 m(2) of netting, we
   captured 790 bats of 21 species. The species diversity was higher in the
   site with the highest proportion of primary tropical deciduous forest
   and was higher in 2016 than in 2017; the species composition did not
   differ greatly between the two years. The abundance of bats in various
   trophic guilds varied relative to the four climatic seasons. The general
   abundance of bats, frugivores-omnivores, and insectivores showed a
   significant increasing trend over time after the hurricane, which may
   indicate a recovery of the ecosystem or an abundance of
   early-successional fruiting plants. The results also confirm that
   species diversity recovers faster in a conserved forest. Thus, it is
   important to conserve natural areas to mitigate the effects of major
   disturbances.},

Abstract = {Hyperspectral inversion techniques can facilitate soil quality
   monitoring and evaluation. In this study, the Yellow River Delta Wetland
   Nature Reserve was used as the study area. By measuring and analyzing
   soil samples under different vegetation types and collecting soil
   reflectance spectra, the relationships between vegetation types, soil
   depth, and the changes in soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN),
   and total phosphorus (TP) contents were assessed. The spectral data set
   was changed by spectral first derivative processing and division of the
   sample set according to vegetation type. The correlation between soil
   carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents, and soil spectra was also
   analyzed, sensitive bands were selected, and the partial least-squares
   (PLS) method, support vector machine (SVM) method, and random forest
   (RF) model were used to establish the inversion model based on the
   characteristic bands. The optimal combination of spectral
   transformation, sample set partitioning, and inversion model was
   explored. The results showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in soil
   TC, TN, and TP contents under reed and saline alkali poncho vegetation,
   but not between soil element contents under different stratifications of
   the same plant species. The first derivative reflectance had higher
   correlation coefficients with soil TC, TN, and TP contents compared with
   the original reflectance, while the sensitive bands and quantities of
   the three elements differed. The division of the sample sets according
   to vegetation type and the first derivative treatment can improve the
   prediction accuracy of the model. The best combination of sample set
   plus FD plus RF for TC, TN, and TP in reed soil and sample set plus FD
   plus SVM for TC, TN, and TP in saline alkali pine soil provides
   technical support to further improve the prediction accuracy of TC, TN,
   and TP in wetland soil.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions often result from multiple invasion events. In the
   case of several subsequent invasive episodes, `newcomers' are usually
   poorly adapted to local environmental conditions in contrast to the
   representatives of the already-established invasive population of the
   same species. Therefore, the mode of inheritance of life-history
   features determining the survival and performance of interpopulation
   hybrids is an important component of invasiveness. We investigated the
   mode of inheritance of the photoperiodic response in the brown
   marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, by crossing between the native
   population of South Korea and the invasive population of the Black Sea
   coast of Russia. The aim of this study was to predict the overwintering
   potential of the progeny from possible crosses between representatives
   of the native and invasive populations. The pre-adult development time
   and the incidence of winter adult diapause in the progeny of the
   interpopulation crosses were close to the average of the values recorded
   in `pure' (unmixed) crosses. Female and male genotypes were equally
   important in the determination of these characters. Such a mode of
   inheritance is most likely determined by a polygenic control and would
   only partially promote subsequent invasion events from the native South
   Asian range of H. halys into Europe.},

Abstract = {Studies of speciation and intraspecific differentiation in salmonid
   fishes are traditionally based on analysis of osteological traits. In
   the current study the variation of osteological traits was compared
   between two Atlantic salmon forms: anadromous and landlocked. Each form
   was represented by three samples: one from a wild population, and two
   from hatcheries; i.e., we studied six samples in total. In total, 45
   osteological characters were analyzed. Differences between the forms
   were found to be genetically determined to a substantial extent. The
   factor ``origin{''} explained 48\% of the total morphological difference
   between the fish samples; the factor ``habitat{''}, 32\%; and their
   interaction, 14\%. Phenotypic plasticity of the anadromous form was
   observed to be lower than that of the landlocked form. We consider that
   the higher phenotypic plasticity may compensate for a decrease in
   genetic diversity which is observed in landlocked forms of the species.},

Title = {What Do the First 597 Global Fungal Red List Assessments Tell Us about
   the Threat Status of Fungi?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fungal species are not immune to the threats facing animals and plants
   and are thus also prone to extinction. Yet, until 2015, fungi were
   nearly absent on the IUCN Red List. Recent efforts to identify fungal
   species under threat have significantly increased the number of
   published fungal assessments. The 597 species of fungi published in the
   2022-1 IUCN Red List update (21 July 2022) are the basis for the first
   global review of the extinction risk of fungi and the threats they face.
   Nearly 50\% of the assessed species are threatened, with 10\% NT and 9\%
   DD. For regions with a larger number of assessments (i.e., Europe, North
   America, and South America), subanalyses are provided. Data for
   lichenized and nonlichenized fungi are also summarized separately.
   Habitat loss/degradation followed by climate change, invasive species,
   and pollution are the primary identified threats. Bias in the data is
   discussed along with knowledge gaps. Suggested actions to address these
   gaps are provided along with a discussion of the use of assessments to
   facilitate on-the-ground conservation efforts. A research agenda for
   conservation mycology to assist in the assessment process and
   implementation of effective species/habitat management is presented.},

Title = {Investigating the Assemblages of Two Groups of Collembola (Strong Furca
   and Weak Furca) under Different Agricultural Management Systems,
   Northeastern China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Agriculture itself has been considered one of the leading reasons for
   biodiversity loss because of the huge quantity of land dedicated to just
   this activity, and agricultural intensification has impacted soil
   organisms at several taxonomic levels. Soil biota is a vital component
   of the agricultural system, providing essential ecosystem services while
   also having synergistic impacts on crop yield. Preservation of their
   diversity becomes a major element of an agricultural sustainability
   strategy. Many studies focused on agricultural activities' effects on
   soil organisms, but few of them have focused on their effects on the
   co-occurrence patterns of their communities. Collembola communities are
   frequently employed as a substitute for soil organisms; thus, as a
   surface-dwelling arthropods representative, we investigated assemblages
   of soil Collembola in reaction to the arrangement of 6 treatments
   varying in crop rotation (MC: monoculture (corn) vs. CS: corn-soybean
   rotation) and tillage types (MP: mould ploughing; RT: ridge tillage; and
   NT: no-tillage). We hypothesized that Collembola communities with strong
   furca would respond well to the agricultural practices than those with
   weak furca, and there would be strong co-occurrence between species of
   Collembola communities belonging to the treatments with less intensity
   of soil disturbance and more variation in crop rotation. Our study found
   no clear evidence of a beneficial effect of crop rotation on Collembola
   communities. Although Collembola with strong furca shows higher
   abundances in plots with mold plowing, weak furca abundances were not
   showing any difference (differences in abilities to move fast from harsh
   habitats could be the reason for different responses of these two
   groups). Network analysis revealed that Collembola assemblages seem to
   occur more responsive to tillage intensity than crop rotation. Network
   graphs of treatments with ridge tillage are significantly more clustered
   than all others. For the first time, we can show that assemblages of
   springtails in agriculture were distinguished by a pattern of
   co-occurrence alongside agricultural practices (crop rotation, soil
   tillage), showing variations in the disturbance of soil and soil
   nutrients. Our results, contrary to our expectations, demonstrated that
   the effects of agricultural activities on Collembola abundance and
   diversity could be weak after long-term application of the same
   treatment, but still, they will clearly affect the bonds between
   Collembola species by affecting their co-occurrence pattern in
   Collembola communities.},

Abstract = {The paper reports the record of Pseudochromadora gomoi sp.n. in
   circalittoral habitats (at depths of 47-59 m) of the Romanian Black Sea
   waters. The species is characterized by a unispiral amphidial fovea, the
   presence of lateral alae stretching from the posterior end of the cardia
   to the level of the cloacal opening, but also shows unique features
   found in other Desmodorida genera (i.e., the presence of a precloacal
   ventral ala in males similar to several Desmodora or Echinodesmodora
   species and eight subcephalic setae on the head capsule). The presence
   of a constrictor cuticle ring and orange elongated ducts in the anterior
   body part as in Pseudodesmodora lacrima, Leduc and Wharton, 2010, were
   also noted. The morphometric measurements of our species differ from
   most of the Pseudochromadora species reported in specialty literature.
   We extracted and counted all desmodorid individuals from 9 meiobenthic
   samples collected in June 2020, and performed a detailed morphological
   analysis of 12 individuals (5 females and 7 males) belonging to our
   species, also highlighting the dissimilarities with the related
   desmodorid species.},

Title = {A New Genus and Two New Species of Fireflies from South America
   (Lampyridae: Lampyrinae: Photinini)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Lampyridae taxonomy has traditionally relied on a few characters now
   deemed to be highly homoplastic, and their classification-especially at
   the genus level-is yet to be consolidated based on rigorous phylogenetic
   analyses. Recent studies highlighted the value of genitalic trait
   variation in the evolution in Lampyridae, particularly for the rich and
   poorly known South American Photinini fauna. Here, we describe a new
   genus, with a new species from the Cerrado and another one from the
   Atlantic Forest. Phylogenetic analyses based on Bayesian and Maximum
   Parsimony approaches recovered these two species as sister to each
   other, which we place here in Zoiudo gen. nov. Males of this new lineage
   of fireflies are overall strikingly similar to Photinus Laporte 1833,
   but can be readily distinguished by traits heretofore neglected,
   including the structure of tibial spurs and many genitalic traits.
   Instead, Zoiudo gen. nov. is strongly supported as sister to Ybytyramoan
   Silveira and Mermudes, 2014, supported by eight synapomorphies, the most
   conspicuous being the sternum VIII with lateral margins divergent up to
   basal 1/5, then convergent posteriorly, and the rudimentary ventral
   plate of phallus. Our study confirms the value of extensive character
   and taxon sampling towards a revised classification of Photinini taxa
   and highlights the need for a continued sampling and protection of South
   American biomes.},

Title = {Geographical Patterns in Functional Diversity of Chinese Terrestrial
   Vertebrates},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Identifying priority regions is essential for effectively protecting
   biodiversity. China is one of the world's megabiodiversity countries,
   but its biodiversity is seriously threatened by anthropogenic forces.
   Many studies have identified priority regions in China for conserving
   biodiversity. However, most of these studies focused on plants and
   mainly relied on metrics such as species richness. A comprehensive
   assessment of functional diversity hotspots of Chinese terrestrial
   vertebrates is still lacking. In this study, we collected distribution
   information and functional traits of terrestrial Chinese vertebrates. We
   calculated functional richness and identified hotspots. Then, we
   assessed the overlap between functional hotspots and hotspots identified
   based on species richness. We found that the mountains in southern China
   harbor the most hotspots. Southwestern China is the most important
   region for biodiversity conservation, as it harbors functional diversity
   and species richness hotspots of multiple taxa. Mismatches between
   functional diversity and species richness hotspots were found in all
   taxa. Moreover, the locations of functional hotspots are different among
   taxa, even within taxonomic units. For example, the functional diversity
   patterns of Rodentia, Chiroptera and other mammalian taxa are different.
   These results highlight the importance of considering distinct groups
   separately in conservative actions.},

Title = {Phenotypic Diversity Analysis of the Progeny Variation of a `Mosaic
   Leaf' Loropetalum chinense var. rubrum Based on Flower Organ
   Characteristics},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Loropetalum chinense var. rubrum is a common landscape plant. Because of
   the preference for the `red leaf' trait, the `flower color' trait was
   ignored in breeding, and the genetic diversity of L. chinense var.
   rubrum was replaced by a few genotypes. Therefore, the potential value
   of flower color traits was affected, and the genetic diversity was not
   fully exploited. In this study, we utilized a cultivar with
   mosaic-colored flowers and leaves and observed 15 phenotypic traits in
   its flower organs and its progeny, as well as a total of 60 different
   flower color materials. We analyzed the variation characteristics and
   diversity of flower colors, and qualitatively described and
   preliminarily classified flower colors using the ISCC-NBS and CIELab
   systems to explore the correlation with the flower color phenotype from
   the distribution and content of anthocyanins. The phenotypic diversity
   of the flower organs was enriched, and genetic differences in flower
   color were significant for the L. chinense var. rubrum, with most of the
   15 phenotypic traits showing significant positive correlations, and the
   most critical phenotypes are sepal, petal and nectary color, as well as
   petal length. According to the CIELab color system and anthocyanin
   content and distribution characteristics, it is considered more accurate
   and convenient to classify the color phenotypes of L. chinense var.
   rubrum flowers into five categories. In this study, for the first time,
   the flower organ phenotype of L. chinense var. rubrum has been
   systematically analyzed, and it is explored as a reference method for
   breeding new cultivars of a diverse range of colors in L. chinense var.

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of black locust (Robinia
   pseudoacacia L.) and the knowledge accumulated by Romanian foresters and
   researchers, covering species propagation, stand management, and
   vulnerability issues. As highlighted by numerous authors, black locust
   manifests dual features, both as an exogenous species and one that is
   already naturalized. The main drivers for this species' expansion in
   Romania is its ecological adaptability on degraded lands, fast growth,
   and high biomass yields, in addition to other economic benefits. Black
   locust plantations and coppices also offer an important range of
   ecosystem services such as CO2 sequestration, landscape reclamation,
   fuel wood, or maintaining traditional crafts in regions with little to
   no forest cover. Highlighted disadvantages include short lifespan,
   invasiveness when introduced on fertile sites, and dieback in
   drought/frost prone areas. The results of extensive research and studies
   are captured in technical norms, although aspects such as species
   genetics, invasive potential, and adaptation to climate change dynamics
   call for more research and optimizing in species management. As Romania
   rallies its efforts with those of the international community in order
   to address climate change and desertification, black locust stands out
   as a proven solution for reclaiming degraded lands when native species
   are not an alternative.},

Abstract = {The phylogeography of the filed vole (Microtus agrestis) in Eurasia was
   thoroughly examined using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the cytochrome b
   (cytb) gene. However, the former conclusions about genetic variability
   and the contact zone of eastern and western genetic lineages in
   Lithuania were based on the analysis of a very limited number of
   individuals. In the present study, we examined 74 M. agrestis
   individuals trapped in four sites in the eastern, northern, and western
   parts of the country using sequence analysis of cytb and D-loop. Totals
   of 25 new cytb haplotypes and 19 new D-loop haplotypes were identified
   for this species. Higher nucleotide diversity was observed for D-loop
   (pi = 0.01147 +/- 0.00070) as compared to cytb (pi = 0.00694 +/-
   0.00039). The phylogenetic analysis based on both loci revealed the
   presence of two genetic lineages, i.e., the eastern and western ones,
   which were mixed in Lithuanian samples, with the exception of the Rusne
   site in the west of the country. Only the western lineage was observed
   in this island population of M. agrestis; the sample differed in low
   genetic variability and genetic differentiation from other investigated
   samples. We found D-loop to be an appropriate locus for the evaluation
   of the genetic variability of M. agrestis.},

   throughout its entire range. However, quantitative population management
   is required due to the danger of contagious diseases; the census is
   imprecise, and integrated management and monitoring are still missing in
   Lithuania. This study focused on the current condition of the wild boar
   population at the country level, species activity in forests and
   adjacent agricultural lands, the problem of damage to agriculture and
   forestry caused by wild boar, and methods for the management of the wild
   boar population. A methodology for the assessment of the effect of wild
   boar will help in reducing their impact. For the successful management
   of wild boar, an increase in the carrying capacity in conformity with
   animal density should be accomplished.},

   Associated with Mango Quality},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a widely cultivated fruit in tropical and
   subtropical areas at altitudes ranging from 100 to 1500 m above sea
   level (masl). However, little is known about the effects of altering
   altitudes on the morpho-physiological traits determining the commercial
   value of mango. Therefore, we systematically investigated a commercial
   mango cultivar at eight altitudes ranging from 680 to 1400 masl to check
   the environmental impact on morpho-physiological attributes and volatile
   compounds using analysis of variance, principal component analysis,
   clustering, and correlation. We observed an increase in fruit weight and
   size from 680 to 1000 masl elevation and a gradual decrease at higher
   altitudes above 1000 msl. In contrast, quality parameters, including
   total soluble solids and total sugar, decreased with the increase in
   altitude, while the total acid increased with the increase in altitude.
   Moreover, we characterized the dried fruit, pericarp, and sarcocarp for
   aromatic compounds and identified 110 volatile compounds. The
   accumulation pattern of the volatiles suggested a considerable influence
   of environmental factors associated with altering altitudes. However,
   there was no clear trend in the volatile accumulation at different
   altitudes. We further determined the ten most frequently occurring
   volatiles at different altitudes and tissues. For instance,
   Alpha-Guaiene was only identified at 1000-1215 masl altitudes in dried
   fruit, while Beta-Ocimene showed the highest accumulation at 900 masl in
   dried fruit and pericarp. Together, our study provides clues on the
   impact of the altitude on mango fruit yield and quality attributes,
   which will guide future agronomic practices.},

Title = {Can Larix sp. Mill. Provide Suitable Habitats for Insects and Lichens
   Associated with Stems of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. in Northern Europe?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Recent observations suggest that climate change affects the growth
   conditions and range of tree species distribution in Europe. This may
   also have a major effect on communities of different organisms
   associated with these tree species. We aimed to determine whether Larix
   sp. could provide suitable habitats to insects and lichens associated
   with P. abies to conserve their biodiversity under climate change. The
   study sites were 10 Larix sp. and 10 P. abies forest stands in
   Lithuania. Both living and dead trees were included. Sticky traps, bark
   sheets, and exit hole methods were used for the assessment of insects.
   Independent plots on tree stems were established for the assessment of
   lichens. There were 76 and 67 different insect species on dead and
   living P. abies, respectively, using sticky traps. Similarly, there were
   64 and 68 on dead and living Larix sp., respectively. The overall
   community of xylophagous insects consisted of nine and eight species,
   which were detected using the bark sheet and exit hole methods,
   respectively. The bark area colonized by lichens was 34.3\% on dead P.
   abies and 63.2\% on dead Larix sp., and 40.4\% on living P. abies and
   78.0\% on living Larix sp. Taken together, the results demonstrate that
   native P. abies and introduced Larix sp. support similar diversity of
   stem-associated insect and lichen species.},

Title = {Selection of Elms Tolerant to Dutch Elm Disease in South-West Romania},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ophiostoma novo-ulmi continues to be one of the most dangerous invasive
   fungi, destroying many autochthonous elm forests and cultures throughout
   the world. Searching for natural genotypes tolerant to Dutch elm disease
   (DED) is one of the main objectives of silviculturists all over the
   northern hemisphere in order to save the susceptible elms and to restore
   their ecosystem biodiversity. In this regard, the first trial was
   established between 1991 and 1994, in south-west Romania (Padurea Verde,
   Timisoara), using three elm species (Ulmus minor, U. glabra, and U.
   laevis) with 38 provenances. A local strain of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi was
   used to artificially inoculate all elm variants and the DED evolution
   was observed. Furthermore, in 2018-2021 the trial was inventoried to
   understand the local genotype reaction to DED in the local environmental
   conditions after almost 30 years. The outcomes of the present study
   proved the continuous presence of the infections in the comparative
   culture and its proximity, but the identified pathogen had a new hybrid
   form (found for the first time in Romania) between O. novo-ulmi ssp.
   americana x O. novo-ulmi ssp. novo-ulmi. Wych elm (U. glabra) was
   extremely sensitive to DED: only 12 trees (out of 69 found in 2018)
   survived in 2021, and only one tree could be selected according to the
   adopted health criteria (resistance and vigour). The field elm (U.
   minor) was sensitive to the pathogen, but there were still individuals
   that showed good health status and growth. In contrast, the European
   white elm (U. laevis) proved constant tolerance to DED: only 15\% had
   been found dead or presented severe symptoms of dieback. Overall, the
   results of this study report the diverse reactions of the Romanian
   regional elm genotypes to DED over the last three decades, providing
   promising perspectives for improving the presence of elms in the forest
   ecosystems of the Carpathian basin.},

Title = {Composition and Distribution of Plankton Communities in the Atlantic
   Sector of the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula and
   surrounding region have undergone a significant transformation due to
   global climate change affecting the structure and distribution of
   pelagic fauna. Here, we present the results of our study on the
   taxonomic composition and quantitative distribution of plankton
   communities in Bransfield Strait, Antarctic Sound, the Powell Basin of
   the Weddell Sea, and the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula and South
   Orkney Islands during the austral summer of 2022. A slight warming of
   the Transitional Zonal Water with Weddell Sea influence (TWW) and an
   increase in its distribution area was detected. Among the pelagic
   communities, three groups were found to be the most abundant: copepods
   Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, and Oithona spp., salpa Salpa
   thompsoni, and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Euphausiids were found
   in cases of low abundance, species diversity, and biomass. In the
   studied region, an increase in the amount of the salpa S. thompsoni and
   the euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura and the expansion of their
   distribution area were observed. Significant structural shifts in
   phytoplankton communities manifested themselves in changes in the
   structure of the Antarctic krill forage base. The composition and
   distribution of pelagic fauna is affected by a combination of
   environmental abiotic factors, of which water temperature is the main
   one. The obtained results have allowed us to assume that a further
   increase in ocean temperature may lead to a reduction in the number and
   size of the Antarctic krill population and its successive replacement by
   salps and other euphausiids that are more resistant to temperature
   fluctuations and water desalination.},

Title = {A Review of the Giant Triton (Charonia tritonis), from Exploitation to
   Coral Reef Protector?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Charonia tritonis (Charoniidae), one of the largest marine gastropods
   and an echinoderm specialist, preys on Crown-of-Thorns starfish (CoTS),
   a recurring pest that continues to be a leading cause of coral mortality
   on Indo-Pacific reefs. Widespread historical exploitation has impacted
   their numbers, with standing populations considered rare throughout
   their habitat. Their life-stage attributes, i.e., teleplanic larvae,
   planktotrophic phase spanning years permitting transoceanic dispersal,
   and recruitment to coral reefs through oceanic influx with intense
   larval mortality, have likely hindered their recovery. Decline in
   numbers is hypothesised to account partially for periodic CoTS
   outbreaks, yet predator-prey dynamics between these two species that
   might influence this are poorly understood. The C. tritonis excretory
   secretome elicits a proximity deterrence effect on CoTS, the nature of
   which is under investigation as a possible tool in CoTS biocontrol
   scenarios. However, specificity and zone of impact in situ are unknown,
   and whether the mere presence of C. tritonis and/or predation pressure
   has any regulatory influence over CoTS populations remains to be
   established. The fundamental taxonomy and distinctive characteristics,
   biology and ecology of C. tritonis is summarized, and knowledge gaps
   relevant to understanding their role within coral reefs identified.
   Information is provided regarding exploitation of C. tritonis across its
   habitat, and prospects for conservation interventions, including captive
   rearing and stock enhancement to repopulate local regions, are
   discussed. Its predator-prey ecology is also examined and potential to
   mitigate CoTS considered. Recommendations to direct future research into
   this predator and for its inclusion in a CoTS integrated pest management
   strategy to improve coral reef health are offered.},

   The inter-relationship among agro-morphological characteristics and
   their effect on yield was also studied. The polymorphic functional and
   microsatellite markers Xa21FR and pTA248 (Xa21), Xa13prom (xa13), RM21
   (xa5), MP (Xa4), RM6836 (Pi2, Pi9 \& Piz) and RM8225 (Piz) were first
   confirmed for the target genes. The selected markers were used for
   foreground selection of BC2F2 homozygous progenies with the target
   genes. Plants that had homozygous IRBB60 alleles for these markers were
   evaluated for their recovery of the recurrent parent genome. IRBB60 was
   used as the donor parent for bacterial blight resistance genes while
   Putra-1 served as a recipient/recurrent parent with background
   blast-resistance genes and high yield. After the foreground selection,
   79 polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers identified from the marker
   polymorphism survey were used for marker-assisted background selection
   to determine the percentage recovery of the recurrent parent genome. In
   order to make a selection on a phenotypic basis, 14 agro-morphological
   traits were measured and recorded. The result obtained from the study
   showed that 16 lines received the seven resistance genes in sufficiently
   varied numbers and were selected. The distribution of yield per hectare
   showed that about 50\% of the selected lines had yields as high as 5
   t/ha and above. Some of the lines produced as high as 8.4 t/ha. These
   lines demonstrated the potential of recording uniform 8t/ha upon
   recombination at BC2F2. The study also indicated that the number of
   panicles per hill correlated strongly, significantly and positively with
   the number of tillers (r = 0.962 {*}{*}), total grain weight per hill (r
   = 0.928 {*}{*}) and yield per hectare (r = 0.927 {*}{*}). It was
   concluded that the newly improved resistant lines which were selected
   have the capability to compete with Putra-1 in terms of its productivity
   and yield. The newly developed lines would be useful in future breeding
   programmes as donors for bacterial leaf blight and blast resistance
   genes. These lines are recommended for release to farmers in Malaysia
   and other rice-growing agro-ecologies for commercial cultivation.},

Abstract = {The interlinked biodiversity crisis and challenge of global climate
   change cannot be addressed without the management of tree species. It is
   crucial that we use the information now available as a result of the
   Global Tree Assessment to manage, conserve and restore threatened tree
   species and tree diversity. With over 17,500 tree species now known to
   be threatened with extinction, well-planned actions need to be urgently
   identified and implemented that target multiple species. In this review,
   we highlight approaches that coordinate and mobilise multi-species
   conservation at the taxonomic, national, regional and global levels.
   Only through a considerable scaling up of planning and action will we
   prevent the extinction of both trees and the associated plants, animals
   and fungi that depend on them, sustain livelihoods and ensure the
   ecological health of the planet.},

Abstract = {Litter weevil communities were investigated in two different types of
   montane forest in Ecuador: foothill evergreen forest, present in the
   Otongachi Integral Reserve between 800 and 1000 m, and tropical montane
   cloud forest (TMCF), present in the Otonga Integral Reserve between 1600
   and 2300 m. Sampling was conducted along elevation gradients, applying
   the entomological sifting method to 19 sampling transects (11 in Otonga
   and 8 in Otongachi). The taxa collected were identified as
   morphospecies, since the majority of them are still undescribed. A total
   of 510 specimens were sampled, belonging to 100 different morphospecies,
   85 of which were found in Otonga and 15 in Otongachi. No species in
   common between the two areas were found, despite the fact that the
   distance is extremely small (approximately 12 km). The Otonga area,
   regardless of primary or secondary forest habitats, had higher mean
   species richness. In both areas, the majority of species were found in a
   small number of stations and were sampled in a small number of
   specimens. A dominant and ubiquitous species was present only in
   Otongachi. The analysis of the community composition was carried out
   according to different categories of environmental variables (Otonga vs.
   Otongachi, forest type, elevation, litter and canopy coverage
   characteristics). Two well-differentiated coenoses were found,
   influenced firstly by the differences between the two reserves,
   secondarily by the elevation gradient and, to a lesser extent, by the
   forest type and other environmental variables. Some morphospecies
   characteristic of a specific type of biocoenosis could be identified.
   The study highlighted how most litter weevil species are strictly
   associated with a peculiar microhabitat and have a very narrow elevation
   and spatial range; the weevil communities can be strongly affected by
   heavy human impact. The results confirm that the tropical forests, in
   particular the TMCFs, host great biodiversity and that the majority of
   species are strictly associated with a single site; therefore,
   particular protection for these habitats should be granted. However, the
   non-significant variation between primary and secondary TMCFs indicates
   that, when correct management is carried out, a limited disturbance can
   be tolerated with only a limited loss of biodiversity.},

Title = {Dispersal and Space Use of Captive-Reared and Wild-Rehabilitated Harpy
   Eagles Released in Central American Landscapes: Implications for

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatial context of animal movements is fundamental for
   the establishment and management of protected areas. We tracked, by
   telemetry devices, 31 captive-reared and 5 wild-rehabilitated Harpia
   harpyja and estimated the dispersal and space use after release in
   Mesoamerica. We evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas in the
   protection of home ranges and examined how individual traits, release
   methods and landscape features influenced the dispersal and home range
   using mixed-effects models. The mean post-release dispersal was 29.4 km
   (95\% CI: 22.5-38.5), and the annual home ranges averaged 1039.5 km(2)
   (95\% CI: 627-1941). The home ranges were influenced by the release
   method, patch richness, patch and edge density and contagion. The
   currently protected areas in Mesoamerica may not be effective
   conservation units for this species. The Harpy Eagle average home range
   greatly exceeded the average size of 1115 terrestrial protected areas
   (52.7 +/- 6.1 km(2)) in Mesoamerica. Due to their wide use of space,
   including transboundary space, Harpy Eagle conservation efforts may fail
   if they are not carefully coordinated between the countries involved.
   Future restoration efforts of umbrella forest-dwelling raptors should
   select release sites with highly aggregated and poorly interspersed
   forests. The release sites should have a buffer of approximately 30 km
   and should be located completely within protected areas.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {In 2016, Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) (Crustacea, Amphipoda)
   was recorded for the first time in the River Adda, one of the main
   tributaries of the major Italian river, river Po. Here we investigate
   its distribution, population density and size classes distribution in
   the main course of the river, in the territory of the South Adda
   Regional Park. Furthermore, we defined its level of invasiveness using
   two different risk screening methods, in order to obtain a more
   comprehensive evaluation of its potential impacts: AS-ISK (Aquatic
   Species Invasiveness Screening Kit) and Harmonia(+). Finally, we
   compared the resulting invasiveness level with the output of the GISS
   (Generic Impact Scoring System) method, also used by IUCN. Our data
   confirm that the invasive amphipod is well-established in the downstream
   part of the River Adda, and its distribution seems related to
   hydrodynamism. Interestingly, its level of invasiveness was evaluated as
   low by Harmonia(+) and high by AS-ISK: this discrepancy is due to
   different evaluations of environmental and socio-economic impacts of a
   non-native species carried out by the two methods. Finally, we propose
   some possible actions to reduce the spreading rate of this invasive
   amphipod in this area.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Lowland tropical rainforests harbor the most diverse plant communities
   in the world, but the herbaceous plants of the understory are often
   overlooked. To address this knowledge gap, we asked to what extent the
   understory herbaceous community contributes to the species richness and
   phylogenetic diversity of plant communities by surveying a neotropical
   rainforest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We used Gentry transects to
   characterize the woody overstory community, and line-intercepts within
   the same transects to survey understory herbs and subshrubs. We also
   used published phylogenies to calculate community phylogenetic diversity
   with and without the understory stratum. We found that the understory
   contained a diverse (23 species, or 22.1\% of all species surveyed) and
   phylogenetically distinct plant community dominated by aroids (13
   species) and ferns (4 species). Inclusion of the understory stratum
   increased total species richness by 28.4\% but increased phylogenetic
   diversity by 41.4\%. Additionally, in contrast to temperate forests, the
   understory plant community was much less diverse than the overstory,
   which contained 81 species > 1 cm dbh (77.9\% of all species surveyed).
   This survey adds to the hitherto small body of literature comparing
   understory and overstory strata in tropical rainforests and reveals
   previously overlooked patterns of floristic diversity.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {A survey of the macrozoobenthos communities in the Maritsa River (South
   Bulgaria) was carried out in the summer of 2021. Benthic samples were
   collected and physicochemical parameters (water temperature, pH,
   conductivity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients) were measured at 15 sites
   located on the main river and its tributary system. The studied sites
   belonged to different river types and characterised the diversity of the
   ecological conditions-from unaffected to anthropogenically influenced
   river stretches. In addition, data from a study conducted in the summer
   of 2020 were used to analyse species-factor interactions in the river
   ecosystems and to assess the bio-indicative potential of the aquatic
   invertebrates. The dynamics of the taxonomic composition and abundance
   of the macrozoobenthos were analysed in relation to environmental
   factors. The physicochemical conditions of the water environment changed
   during the period of high water, which led to a reduction in the
   composition of the macrozoobenthos. Plecoptera and Trichoptera decreased

   Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae were permanently present along the whole

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Genetic diversity plays an important role in the evolution and
   adaptation of organisms. Losses of genetic diversity make organisms more
   vulnerable to climate changes and diseases, reducing the viability of
   small populations. In addition to natural selection, genetic drift,
   dispersal, inbreeding, and population bottleneck, the social systems of
   animals may also affect the genetic diversity of populations. We aimed
   to test the hypothesis that the delayed dispersal of group-living small
   mammals would reduce genetic diversity through attenuated gene flow but
   enhance genetic relatedness. We used microsatellite analysis to estimate
   genetic diversity and the Queller and Goodnight relatedness coefficients
   of Daurian pikas (Ochotona dauurica) and Mongolian gerbils (Meriones
   unguiculatus), two socially monogamous small mammals living in social
   groups in Inner Mongolia, China. The average genetic relatedness of
   social groups was inversely related to the average genetic diversity of
   social groups in Daurian pikas but not in Mongolian gerbils, partially
   supporting our hypothesis. Dispersal following frequent local
   extinctions resulted in the recolonization of burrow systems by
   individuals with different genetic makeups, increasing genetic diversity
   and reducing the genetic relatedness of the social groups of Daurian
   pikas. On the other hand, delayed short-distance dispersal was
   sufficient to maintain the high genetic diversity and high genetic
   relatedness of gerbil social groups independently.},

Abstract = {A critical revision of charophytes collected in Slovakia from 1887 up to
   present, based on herbaria specimens, provided us with the opportunity
   to compile an updated checklist and to revaluate their threat status in
   order to obtain the current red list of charophytes of Slovakia. The
   data obtained will fill the gap in knowledge about these macroscopic
   algae in Central Europe. The revised list of charophytes includes 19
   representatives of three genera: Chara (11), Nitella (7), and
   Nitellopsis (1). Following the latest IUCN red-list categories and
   criteria (version 3.1) and using the modified category regionally
   extinct (RE), derived from the category extinct (EX), 36.8\% of
   charophytes are classified as RE (Chara connivens, C. subspinosa
   (=rudis), Nitella capillaris, N. confervacea, N. flexilis, N. gracilis,
   and N. opaca); 21\% as EN (endangered; Chara braunii, Nitella mucronata,
   N. syncarpa, and Nitellopsis obtusa); 21\% as VU (vulnerable; Chara
   contraria, C. gymnophylla, C. hispida, and C. virgata); 10.6\% as NT
   (near-threatened; Chara globularis, C. vulgaris); and 5.3\% as CR
   (critically endangered; Chara canescens) species; finally, 5.3\% species
   could not be assessed (DD; Chara aspera).},

Title = {Genome-Wide SNP Analysis Reveals the Genetic Diversity and Population
   Structure of the Domestic Reindeer Population (Rangifer tarandus)
   Inhabiting the Indigenous Tofalar Lands of Southern Siberia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Operating under the assumption that decline in population size increases
   the threat of loss of genetic diversity, herein, our first aim was to
   monitor and document the genetic diversity and population structure of
   the endemic Tuva-Tofalar reindeer, the number of which has seen a
   dramatic decrease. Second, we were interested in understanding of Tuva
   reindeer genetic relationship with four officially recognized reindeer
   breeds, whose wild populations inhabit the Far North of Russia, as well
   as with the domestic reindeer making up the Mongolian population. Our
   results, based on the genome-wide SNP genotypes generated by the
   BovineHD BeadChip, revealed a low level of genetic variability of Tuva
   population in terms of the values of both allelic and genetic diversity.
   The ADMIXTURE analysis, the PCA plot, and the Neighbor Net network
   results, showed that Tuva population shared genetic background with
   reindeer inhabiting Mongolia, an implication of their common origin.
   Moreover, all statistic approaches used in our study showed a
   distinctive shared genetic structure revealed in independent clusters
   found in the composition of: an admixed cluster of Tuvan and Mongolian
   populations, a cluster of domestic reindeer breeds, and a cluster of the
   wild populations-all of which indirectly points to the possibility of
   the independent origins (with regard to the domestication) of the
   reindeer groups studied herein. We believe that our findings will
   contribute to the formation of a rational basis for solving problems
   related to the conservation of domestic Tuva-Tofalar reindeer in order
   to increase the number of this substantial reindeer population which
   will contribute to the sustainable functioning of ecosystems and the
   lives and culture of indigenous peoples inhabiting the southern sections
   of Eastern Siberia.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A new species, Lycodapus imperatorius, is described from the seamounts
   of the Emperor Ridge, North Pacific Ocean. The new species can be
   identified by its stout gill rakers, single interorbital pore, four
   preopercular and four mandibular pores, 95-99 vertebrae, numerous
   vomerine and palatine teeth, and COI mtDNA sequences. Although the new
   species is most similar to L. endemoscotus and L. antarcticus in
   morphology, the closest match to already published sequences was
   Lycodapus fierasfer, which is fairly different from the new species in
   terms of morphology. The incongruence between molecular and
   morphological inferences might be explained by the homoplastic nature of
   the morphological characteristics used for species delimitation in
   Lycodapus. The percent of genetic identity between the closest species
   of Lycodapus ranges from 95.4 to 98.6\% in comparison with 99.5-100.0\%
   between individuals of the same valid species. A key of the genus is
   amended to include the new species.},

Title = {The Key Environmental Factors Shaping Coastal Fish Community in the
   Eastern Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A highly productive coastal zone plays an important role in various
   stages of fish life cycles, e.g., spawning migrations, fish
   reproduction, larval development, juveniles growing, etc. Therefore,
   coastal biotopes significantly contribute to commercial fish species
   recruitment. Although the eastern Gulf of Finland is rich in shallow
   coastal water, its coastal fish communities and the influencing
   environmental variables are still significantly understudied. We
   investigated the composition and distribution of coastal fish species
   and the impact of abiotic and biotic environmental factors in the
   eastern Gulf of Finland during field surveys in 2011-2017. In total, 34
   fish species were recorded at shallows. The coastal fish community
   demonstrates a low degree of heterogeneity despite a highly
   heterogeneous environment. Five freshwater species are widely
   distributed and the most frequent in the area. Three key environmental
   variables influencing the coastal fish community of the eastern Gulf of
   Finland were: (i) salinity, (ii) filamentous algae presence, and (iii)
   macrophytes presence. Fish community structure was also influenced by
   the sampling season. Discriminating and typifying taxa were performed
   for each environmental variable. We suggest that obtained results might
   be useful for future environmental studies in the region and fish
   community modeling.},

   in Songpan County, Sichuan, southwest China where it has been considered
   as a Chinese white truffle. Based on both morphological and phylogenetic
   analyses, the collection was described as Choiromyces sichuanensis sp.
   nov. This study confirms the occurrence of members of Choiromyces in
   China. In addition, the mycorrhizal synthesis via spore inoculation
   between C. sichuanensis and Pinus armandii or two Picea species of Pi.
   likiangensis and Pi. crassifolia was attempted in a greenhouse. Both
   morphoanatomical and molecular analyses evidenced well-developed
   mycorrhization between C. sichuanensis and P. armandii, but not in Picea
   seedlings. Our current study provides data about the species diversity
   and mycorrhizal research of this genus for further studies. In addition,
   a successful mycorrhization between C. sichuanensis and selected tree
   species, irrespective of Pinus genus or other plant species, would
   broaden the set of species for a successful mycorrhization in greenhouse
   conditions and potential outplanting for cultivation purposes.},

Abstract = {Proper taxonomic identification is essential for biological research.
   Unfortunately, there are no clear guidelines for taxonomic assignment
   above the species level. Here, we present a novel approach-GBTD-to the
   use of genetic divergence to evaluate the taxonomic position of certain
   samples with simultaneous estimation of the current systematics
   correctness. This approach includes measuring the raw and model-adjusted
   distances between DNA sequences and attributing them to the lowest
   taxonomic levels that are common in sample pairs to reveal distance
   distributions matching different taxonomic levels (species, genus,
   family etc.). GBTD facilitated the reassessment of the taxonomic
   position of the samples, whose genetic distances relative to other
   samples in the dataset did not match their taxonomic divergence. A data
   set of complete mitochondrial genome sequences of segmented worms was
   chosen to test this approach. As a result, numerous inconsistencies in
   the systematics of samples from GenBank were pointed out. These
   inconsistencies included both the oversplitting and overlumping of
   individuals into taxa of different levels and clear cases of
   misidentification. Our approach sparks re-evaluation of the current
   systematics where traditional methods fail to provide sufficient
   resolution.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Xylella fastidiosa (Wells 1987, hereafter Xf), the causal agent of
   several devastating plant diseases, is threatening new countries of the
   Euro-Mediterranean, Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa (MENA)
   regions. In this perspective, a study was carried out to: (a) explore
   the potential establishment and spread and losses caused by Xf in
   Euro-Mediterranean countries (i.e., France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and
   Spain) and the Balkans (i.e., Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia,
   Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia); (b) assess the
   potential introduction of Xf in the MENA countries (i.e., Algeria,
   Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria,
   Tunisia, and Turkey); and (c) project the socio-economic impacts of Xf
   on olives, grapes, citrus, and almonds in these countries. A novel
   socio-economic risk assessment technique was developed and applied for
   these purposes. It revealed that Albania had the highest risk for Xf
   dispersal. In addition, the risk assessment also confirmed the
   vulnerability of Euro-Mediterranean countries in terms of Xf dispersal.
   In the MENA and Balkans regions, countries with fragmented and small
   farms are likely to face the worst social impacts, whereas the
   Euro-Mediterranean region runs the highest economic losses on the target
   crops.},

Title = {Morphology of Three Sphyrion (Copepoda: Siphonostomatoida: Sphyriidae)
   Species Infecting Teleost Fishes off South Africa with the First
   Description of Males of Two Species},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sphyrion is a member of the family Sphyriidae and currently consists of
   three valid species, namely S. laevigatum, S. lumpi and S. quadricornis.
   Species of Sphyrion are mesoparasites of a variety of bony fishes and
   occur worldwide. The bodies of the post-metamorphosis females are highly
   transformed with an elongated cephalothorax bearing conspicuous lateral
   processes. The structure of the cephalothorax is mostly used in the
   identification of the different species. The morphology of the adult
   males resembles those of the lernaeopodid males. Species of Sphyrion
   were collected from various fish hosts off the Indian and Atlantic
   Oceans off South Africa. Selected specimens were studied using
   dissection and compound light microscopy as well as scanning electron
   microscopy. Similar to previous reports, the morphology of specimens of
   the same species infecting the same host species is highly variable;
   thus, the structure of the cephalothorax should be considered together
   with the rest of the body features for identification. Additional
   information is provided regarding the morphology and armature of the
   appendages of the post-metamorphosis females of all three species, which
   resemble previous descriptions, although no detailed comparisons could
   be done. This is the first collection of descriptions and illustrations
   of the males of S. laevigatum and S. quadricornis. Male appendages of
   all three species are very similar with small differences in the
   armature. New geographical and host reports of the Sphyrion species are
   provided.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the avian diversity and threatening
   factors in five peri-urban sites around Fez city (Morocco) for 2 years
   (2018-2019). The study hosted 131 avian species, including 64.88\%
   breeding species, 19.84\% migrant winterers, and 11.45\% migrant
   breeders. Five species of conservation concern such as the vulnerable
   European turtle dove and the European goldfinch, the near-threatened
   ferruginous duck and bar-tailed godwit, and the endangered white-headed
   duck were recorded. Most bird species were recorded at the Oued Fez
   River (26.89\%) and the El Mehraz dam (25\%), followed by the El Gaada
   dam (17.4\%), the Ain Bida garbage dump (15.5\%), and the Ain Chkef
   Forest (15.18\%). About 44.44\% of the breeding species were found at
   Oued Fez, along with 33.33\% at the El Mehraz dam, while El Gaada, Ain
   Chkef, and Ain Bida hosted only 7.40\% of species. An important breeding
   population of the endangered white-headed duck was recorded at El Mehraz
   and Oued Fez. The extension of farmlands, urbanization, touristic
   activities, and drought constitute the most menacing factors for the
   avian diversity and their habitats in Fez.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the ecological status of marine coastal lagoons requires the
   integration of multiple indices. However, the efficacy of monitoring
   programs is complicated by the diverse array of habitats that conform
   coastal lagoons. In this study, we compared four sampling methods (25-m
   and 50-m beach seines, beam trawl and Riley push net) in the Ria Formosa
   coastal lagoon (South Portugal) for assessing fish assemblage and
   diversity. We compared species richness and assemblage structure with
   species accumulation curves and multivariate analysis, and assessed
   diversity patterns using taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional
   diversity indices. Variation in fish assemblage structure was mostly
   explained by gear type, and almost all diversity metrics varied not only
   according to sampling method but also depending on habitat
   characteristics and season. Based on operational costs and diversity
   patterns captured by each gear, we conclude that the combined use of
   25-m beach seine and beam trawl is the preferred approach. The proposed
   methodology will provide the data necessary for assessment of ecological
   status of coastal lagoons.},

Abstract = {Soil heterogeneity has been theoretically predicted to promote plant
   performance, but empirical evidence is often mixed. By focusing on a
   gradient of microhabitats (single, three and six types of
   microhabitats), we tested the hypothesis that increasing the number of
   microhabitats promotes the diversity and productivity of plant
   communities. We created different types of microhabitats by adding
   different forms of nitrogen (NE4+, NO3- and glycine) or combinations of
   these nitrogen in an even or patchy way. Community biomass, but not
   evenness, differed in different types of single-microhabitat. Increasing
   the number of microhabitat types did not alter community growth or
   evenness, but it increased the difference in the relative abundance of
   plant species within the community. These results suggest that
   microhabitat diversity can influence plant competitive hierarchies, and
   that this effect can lead to changed community growth, but may not be
   decisive for plant evenness.},

Abstract = {In response to the present ecological crisis, new approaches to
   environmental conservation and management are being developed in Europe.
   One of the axes considered by nature protection stakeholders since the
   2000s is to encourage the return of the wilderness. This has led to the
   deployment of a variety of initiatives, mainly led by civil and
   non-profit organisations. The objective here, through the analysis of
   the discourses of stakeholders-from semi-directive interviews-and the
   initiatives developed in Western Europe, is to understand how the
   multitude of projects carried out throughout Europe constitutes a
   proposal for new environmental management practices. Indeed, the studied
   initiatives introduce a paradigm shift by reflecting a will to go beyond
   the mere preservation of nature in order to contribute to a global
   territorial transition. To this end, the studied projects propose to
   create both a social and interspecies link around their sites, but also
   to ensure the development of virtuous economic forms in the territories.},

Abstract = {The family Lecithoceridae (Lepidoptera, Gelechioidea) is one of the more
   poorly known groups of microlepidoptera, even though it is a highly
   diverse group containing more than 1430 known species so far. During the
   last two decades since the end of the 20th century, the author has
   intensively studied the family Lecithoceridae, especially for the less
   explored areas including southern Asia and the Oceanian and Afrotropical
   regions. Throughout these studies, the author (often with his
   co-authors) described the new subfamily Crocanthinae Park, 2015, 32 new
   genera, and over 540 new species of the family. In this article, a
   historical review for the taxonomic works of the family since the
   comprehensive study by Gozmany is briefly summarized, with a comparison
   of the number of genera/species of each subfamily, and the number of the
   species by the subfamily in each region of the world. All available
   information on the phylogeny, biology, morphological characters of
   subfamilies, and zoogeographical remarks for the distribution of family
   are listed and discussed.},

Abstract = {The contribution discusses macrophyte communities in natural and
   man-made waterbodies located on the active floodplain along the Drava
   river (Slovenia). We presumed that these different types of wetlands
   host a great number of macrophyte species, but this diversity may be
   affected by the presence of alien invasive species Elodea canadensis and
   E. nuttallii. Presence, relative abundance, and growth forms of plant
   species along with selected environmental parameters were monitored.
   Correlation analyses and direct gradient analyses were performed to
   reveal the possible relations between the structure of macrophyte
   community and environmental parameters. Number of macrophytes in
   surveyed water bodies varied from 1 to 23. Besides numerous native
   species we also recorded Elodea canadensis and E. nuttallii, which were
   present in 19 out of 32 sample sites, with E. nuttallii prevailing. The
   less invasive E. canadensis was absent from ponds and oxbow lakes but
   relatively abundant in side-channels, while E. nuttallii was present in
   all types but dominant in ponds. The most abundant native species were
   Myriophyllum spicatum and M. verticillatum, Ceratophyllum demersum and
   Potamogeton natans. Correlation analyses showed no negative effect of
   the invasive alien Elodea species to the species richness and diversity
   of native flora. Positive correlation between the abundance of E.
   nuttallii and temperature of the water was obtained.},

Title = {Niche Breadth Predicts Geographical Range Size and Northern Range Shift
   in European Dragonfly Species (Odonata)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We studied how range sizes and shifts in species ranges depend on niche
   breadth in European dragonflies. We measured range sizes and shifts over
   a 22-year period (1988-2010) and grouped species into those reproducing
   in permanent running (perennial lotic) water, permanent standing
   (perennial lentic) water, and temporary (running or standing) water.
   Running water species are more specialized and have narrower niches with
   a more fixed niche position than standing water species. Temporary water
   species are more generalist and have broader niches without a fixed
   niche position as clear as permanent water species because they may
   utilize both temporary and permanent habitats. Running water species
   have smaller ranges, and some of them have contracted their ranges more
   than species reproducing in standing or temporary waters; that is, they
   are especially at risk of habitat loss and climate change because of the
   joint effects of their narrow niches and small range sizes. Temporary
   water species track climate changes better than permanent water species.
   This suggests that ecological specialization may cause contemporary
   range shifts to lag behind changes in climate and resources.
   Furthermore, it indicates that recent changes in climate and human land
   use cause biotic homogenization, where specialists are outperformed and
   replaced by generalists.},

Abstract = {The life cycles and biodiversity of Pacific coast gastropods were
   analyzed by videomicroscopy and DNA barcoding of individuals collected
   from tide pools and in plankton nets from a variety of shore stations.
   In many species (Families Calyptraeidae, Cerithiopsidae, Strombidae,
   Vermetidae, Columbellidae, Nassariidae, Olivellidae, Hermaeidae,
   Onchidorididae, Gastropteridae, Haminoeidae), the free-swimming veligers
   were recovered from plankton collections; in Roperia poulsoni (family
   Muricidae) veligers were usually recovered from egg sacs where they had
   been retained although some escapees were found in plankton collections;
   in Pteropurpura festiva (family Muricidae) free-living veligers were
   also found; and in Atlanta californiensis (family Atlantidae) both
   veligers and adults were obtained from plankton collections making this
   a holoplanktonic species. The results confirm that DNA barcoding based
   on COI gene sequencing is a useful strategy to match life-cycle stages
   within species as well as to identify species and to document the level
   of biodiversity within the gastropods.},

Title = {Application of Phytoplankton Taxonomic alpha-Diversity Indices to Assess
   Trophic States in Barrier Lake: A Case of Jingpo Lake},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phytoplankton taxonomic alpha-diversity indices are useful tools to
   characterize the trophic states in freshwater ecosystems. However, the
   application of these indices to assess trophic states in large barrier
   lakes is rare, especially in China. To test the usefulness of
   phytoplankton taxonomic alpha-diversity indices in trophic state
   assessments, we investigated the taxonomic alpha-diversity-Comprehensive
   Trophic Level Index (TLI) relationships in the second largest alpine
   lava barrier lake (Jingpo Lake, China) in the rainy and dry season from
   2017 to 2018. Based on a two-year dataset, we found that there was a
   significant difference in the phytoplankton community, alpha-diversity
   indices, and TLI dynamic between the rainy season and the dry season.
   First, there was significant variation in phytoplankton abundance, the
   Margalef index, and the Shannon-Wiener index in different hydrological
   periods (p < 0.05). Second, the mean TLI in the rainy season (44 +/- 5)
   was higher than in the dry season (41 +/- 5) (p < 0.05). Lastly, the
   response characteristics of the Margalef and Shannon-Wiener index with
   TLI were different in different hydrological periods, and the
   relationship between the Pielou evenness index and TLI was weak. This
   study highlights that phytoplankton taxonomic alpha-diversity indices
   are relevant tools in water quality assessments but selecting the fit
   index is necessary. The current study provides key information about
   phytoplankton community, alpha-diversity, and trophic states in the
   largest alpine lava barrier lake, and the results of the study will
   benefit water quality management and biodiversity conservation in
   barrier lakes.},

Title = {Impacts of Cd Pollution on the Vitality, Anatomy and Physiology of Two

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The heavy metal Cd accumulates in trophic chains, constituting a toxic
   element for photosynthesizing organisms, including the algal photobionts
   of lichen. Thus, as lichens respond differently to heavy metal toxicity,
   we hypothesized that the species Parmotrema tinctorum and Usnea barbata,
   commonly sampled in the Cerrado ecoregion, could be sensitive to Cd and,
   therefore, be used to biomonitor the dispersion of this metal. We also
   aimed to indicate the responsiveness of biological markers to Cd in
   these species by exposing the thalli to simulated rainfall with
   increasing metal concentrations. We observed that both lichen species
   are responsive to Cd stress; however, different pathways are accessed.
   The synthesis of carotenoids by P. tinctorum and the production of
   antioxidant enzymes by U. barbata seem to constitute relevant response
   strategies to Cd-induced stress. The lichen morphoanatomy, cell
   viability, photobiont vitality index, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and
   chlorophyll a synthesis were efficient biomarkers for the effects of
   increasing Cd exposure in P. tinctorum, being the variables primarily
   associated with damage to the photobiont. For U. barbata, the lichen
   morphoanatomy, photochemistry, and antioxidant enzyme activity
   (catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) were essential
   to reflect Cd toxicity. However, the species P. tinctorum was
   characterized as the most sensitive to Cd toxicity, constituting a good
   bioindicator for the presence of this metal. It can be used in the
   diagnosis of air quality in urban and industrial areas or even in forest
   areas influenced by Cd in phosphate fertilizers.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {More than 1.2 million distribution records were used to create species
   distribution models for 402 Palaearctic species of dragonflies and
   damselflies. On the basis of these diversity maps of total, lentic and
   lotic diversity for the whole of the Palaearctic (excluding China and
   the Himalayan region) are presented. These maps show a clear pattern of
   decreasing diversity longitudinally, with species numbers dropping in
   the eastern half of Europe and remaining low throughout a large part of
   Russia, then increasing again towards Russia's Far East and Korea. There
   are clear differences in diversity patterns of lentic and lotic species,
   with lentic species being dominant in colder and more arid areas. Areas
   with a high diversity of species assessed as threatened on the IUCN red
   list are largely restricted to the Mediterranean, Southwest Asia, and
   Japan, with clear hotspots found in the Levant and the southern half of
   Japan. The diversity at species, generic, and family level is higher in
   the south of Japan than in areas at a similar latitude in the western
   Mediterranean. This is likely to be the result of the more humid climate
   of Japan resulting in a higher diversity of freshwater habitats and the
   stronger impact of the glacial periods in the Western Palaearctic in
   combination with the Sahara, preventing tropical African lineages
   dispersing northwards.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The zooplankton community composition in shallow lakes is influenced by
   numerous factors, such as environmental factors and the land use
   patterns around the lake. To investigate the interaction between the
   spatial differences in the zooplankton community structure, aquatic
   parameters, and land use patterns in the Lake Chen Yao complex (Lake
   Chen Yao and Lake Feng Sha), we assessed them in four seasons from
   October 2020 to August 2021. The results showed that the zooplankton
   density and biomass of Lake Chen Yao were higher than the latter. The
   results of Pearson correlation and RDA analysis revealed that electrical
   conductivity (EC), Chlorophyll a (Chl.a), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH
   were the main environmental factors affecting the zooplankton community
   structure in the two lakes. The nutrient content of nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) were significantly higher in Lake Chen Yao, and there was
   a considerable relationship with the distribution of land use patterns
   around the two lakes. The land use patterns were the main reason for the
   difference in water quality and thus the spatial variation in the
   characteristics of the zooplankton communities in the two lakes.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to perform bioinformatic analysis
   of crystallin diversity in aquatic molluscs based on the sequences in
   the NCBI Protein database. The objectives were as follows: (1) analysis
   of some physical and chemical properties of mollusc crystallins, (2)
   comparison of mollusc crystallins with zebrafish and cubomedusa
   Tripedalia cystophora crystallins, and (3) determination of the most
   probable candidates for the role of gastropod eye crystallins. The
   calculated average GRAVY values revealed that the majority of the seven
   crystallin groups, except for mu- and zeta-crystallins, were hydrophilic
   proteins. The predominant predicted secondary structures of the
   crystallins in most cases were alpha-helices and coils. The highest
   values of refractive index increment (dn/dc) were typical for
   crystallins of aquatic organisms with known lens protein composition
   (zebrafish, cubomedusa, and octopuses) and for S-crystallin of Pomacea
   canaliculata. The evolutionary relationships between the studied
   crystallins, obtained from multiple sequence alignments using Clustal
   Omega and MUSCLE, and the normalized conservation index, calculated by
   Mirny, showed that the most conservative proteins were omega-crystallins
   but the most diverse were S-crystallins. The phylogenetic analysis of
   crystallin was generally consistent with modern mollusc taxonomy. Thus,
   alpha- and S-, and, possibly, J1A-crystallins, can be assumed to be the
   most likely candidates for the role of gastropod lens crystallins.},

   Importance of Unprotected Areas},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cheer pheasant is a globally vulnerable species mainly found in the
   mid-montane grassland of the western Himalayas. Such grasslands are
   spread sporadically, and the distribution of this species too, as a
   result, has remained patchy. Using Maxent, we investigated the
   distribution of cheer across its global range (Pakistan, India, and
   Nepal) to determine a potential distribution range. The model predicted
   that higher altitude (increasing probability peaking at 2060 m) and land
   cover categories of needleleaf evergreen forests, grasslands, barren and
   stony terrain, and croplands were the likely predictors of cheer
   pheasant occurrence. The model predicted a total potential distribution
   range of 3137.9 km(2), most of which lies in India. Interestingly, most
   areas within this range fall outside the protected areas network and are
   thus unprotected. The habitat of cheer is believed to require some form
   of continual disturbance, either naturally or by human intervention, to
   remain suitable for the species. Given the fact that most of its habitat
   lies outside the protected areas and the species tolerates limited
   amount of disturbance to its habitat, the future of the cheer is likely
   to be in the outside protected areas, provided that extremes of habitat
   change are limited and hunting is curtailed.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about the dynamics of regional diversity patterns is a
   foundation on which measures aimed to protect diversity dimensions in
   the light of climate change can be constructed. Here, we describe
   taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity patterns of amphibians
   in the Yucatan Peninsula and their representation in the current
   protected area system. We stacked current and future potential
   distribution models to estimate taxonomic diversity and, based on the
   most recent amphibian phylogeny and nine functional traits, we measured
   phylogenetic and functional diversity. Independent phylogenetic and
   functional metrics were obtained by applying null models that allowed us
   to identify the presumably signature mechanisms underlying assemblage
   formation. We evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas in
   protecting diversity dimensions across scenarios. We found phylogenetic
   and functional clustering as a result of environmental filters that have
   allowed only recently diverged species with converged functional traits
   to establish. Nevertheless, random assemblages are more widespread
   possibly due to the opposite directions in which competition and
   environmental filtering are acting. Overall, a decrease in all diversity
   dimensions is projected under future climate change scenarios compared
   with the current time. None of the protected areas evaluated were
   effective in protecting diversity dimensions, stressing the need to
   complete the existing protected areas network.},

Title = {The Mitogenome Structure of Righteye Flounders (Pleuronectidae):
   Molecular Phylogeny and Systematics of the Family in East Asia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This paper reports the first complete sequence of the mitochondrial
   genome (mitogenome) of the yellow-striped flounder Pseudopleuronectes
   herzensteini (Pleuronectoidei: Pleuronectidae). Mitogenome evolution,
   and molecular phylogenetic reconstruction based on four to six
   techniques, including coalescent analysis, were performed for flatfish.
   The genome size of the specimen sampled was 16,845 bp, including 13
   protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 12S, and 16S rRNA genes, and the
   control region, CR. The composition and arrangement of the genes are
   similar to those in other teleost fish, including the second mitogenome
   reported in this paper. The frequency of A, C, G, and T nucleotides in
   the P. herzensteini mitogenome is 27\%, 29.2\%, 17.6\%, and 26.2\%,
   respectively. The ratio of complementary nucleotides in the mitogenome
   of this and other species of the family was A+T:G+C (53.2: 46.8\%) and
   do not deviate significantly from the expected equilibrium proportion.
   The submission to the global database (GenBank) of two new mitogenomes
   along with 106 analyzed GenBank sequences will contribute to
   phylogenetic studies of flounders at the family and suborder levels.
   Based on 26 and 108 nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes (PCGs),
   we investigated the molecular phylogeny of flounders and performed
   analysis for two sets of sequences, including those of members of the
   family Pleuronectidae and the suborder Pleuronectoidei and estimated
   their importance in establishing the taxonomy at these two levels. Data
   obtained by up to six techniques of multigene phylogenetic
   reconstructions support monophyly within the family Pleuronectidae with
   high statistical confidence; however, conclusions regarding the
   phylogenetics at the suborder level require further investigation. Our
   results also revealed paraphyletic and weakly supported branches that
   are especially numerous at the suborder level; thus, there is a clear
   need for taxonomic revisions at the suborder, and possibly family
   levels. Genetic distance analysis reveals the suitability for DNA
   barcoding of species specimens at single genes as well as at whole
   mitogenome data.},

Abstract = {The Glyptothorax species from the Middle East are taxonomically revised
   based on extensive geographic range and taxon sampling, tree topologies
   from mitochondrial COI and Cyt b and nuclear RAG2 markers (2532 bps),
   molecular species delimitation and genetic distance analyses of DNA
   sequences against morphometric and morphological characters. A
   majority-rule consensus based on conceptually different molecular
   species delimitation analyses combined with the Bayesian and maximum
   likelihood tree topologies considered all the name-bearing Iranian
   endemic clades of Glyptothorax, except for G. pallens (i.e., G.
   alidaeii, G. galaxias, G. hosseinpanahii, G. shapuri and G. silviae) as
   a single molecular entity. We also lent our years of experience to the
   morphology of Iranian Glyptothorax populations and tried to perceive
   consistent morphological differences, but without success. Therefore,
   based on this integrated molecular and morphological study, we treat G.
   alidaeii, G. galaxias, G. hosseinpanahii and G. shapuri as conspecific
   with G. silviae. Furthermore, our molecular and morphological results
   confirmed the first record of G. cous in Iranian waters. The species G.
   armeniacus, G. cous, G. daemon, G. kurdistanicus, G. pallens, G. silviae
   and G. steindachneri are considered as valid species.},

Title = {Responses of Freshwater Planarian Girardia tigrina to Fipronil-Based
   Insecticide: Survival, Behavioral and Physiological Endpoints},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fipronil is a pyrazole insecticide used to control undesirable insect
   populations. Due to its large-scale application, there is the potential
   for surface waters' contamination, with toxic action for non-target
   organisms, and consequent impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Planarians are
   potential non-target aquatic invertebrates to these insecticides. They
   are widespread in tropical freshwaters and have been proposed as good
   candidates to assess the toxic effects of freshwater systems
   contaminated by insecticides. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate
   the sublethal concentrations of a fipronil-based insecticide that may
   affect the planarian physiology. After chronic exposure to Regent 800 WG
   (R), a significant decrease in locomotor velocity (LOEC-6.25 mg.L-1),
   regeneration of the auricles and photoreceptors (LOEC-3.13 mg.L-1), and
   reproduction (fecundity-LOEC 12.5 mg.L-1) were observed. The results of
   our study demonstrate that long-term exposure to a pyrazole insecticide
   can compromise non-target aquatic invertebrates while reinforcing the
   need for a better investigation of complementary parameters (such as
   behavior, regeneration, and reproduction) for a more accurate risk
   assessment of commercial pesticide toxicity in freshwater systems.},

Title = {Diversity and Community Structure of Zooplankton in Homestead Ponds of a
   Tropical Coastal Area},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As an intermediary connection between primary producers and higher
   trophic levels, zooplankton are an important component of the aquatic
   food chain, contributing significantly to aquatic biological
   productivity. This study describes the zooplankton diversity and
   community structure, as well as their relationships with ecological
   factors, in homestead ponds of a coastal district along the northern Bay
   of Bengal region. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were detected in
   the mean values of temperature, pH, DO, TDS, transparency, and
   phosphates from the ponds during December 2020, but no significant
   differences were found in the nitrate levels. However, no significant
   variances in the ecological parameters between months were found due to
   the study taking place in the same season. Sixteen zooplankton species,
   representing four groups, were found in the study area, with the highest
   mean abundance of 301.19 +/- 40.55 ind./L recorded in February 2021 and
   the lowest of 293.02 +/- 21.13 ind./L recorded in December 2020. The
   diversity (H'), evenness (e), richness (J), and dominance (D) ranged
   from 2.49 to 2.12, from 0.93 to 0.84, from 2.05 to 1.56, and from 0.13
   to 0.09, respectively. Based on the SIMPER analysis, Diaptomus gracilis
   and Brachionus calyciflorus were found to be significant contributors
   (>10\%) to the zooplankton community structure in different months. The
   ANOSIM results revealed that 10 species of zooplankton were significant
   contributors based on their average dissimilarity. The canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) identified that pH, transparency,
   nitrates, and phosphates have a significant impact on the abundance of
   zooplankton species in the homestead ponds in the study area.},

Title = {Trade in Southeast Asian Box Turtles from Indonesia: Legality,
   Livelihoods, Sustainability and Overexploitation},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Southeast Asian box turtles Cuora amboinensis are distributed in
   mainland Southeast Asia and throughout most of insular Southeast Asia
   and are often found in habitats shared with humans. In the 2000s
   evidence emerged of an enormous illegal export of Southeast Asian box
   turtles from Indonesia estimated at a hundred times larger than the
   legal exports. Using publicly available data we show that one or two
   exporters in Sampit in the province of Central Kalimantan, one of nine
   provinces where harvest of Southeast Asian box turtles is authorised,
   continue to trade above permitted levels. Harvest quotas for Central
   Kalimantan are set at 1000 turtles a year, and this is divided between
   five approved traders, two of whom are based in Sampit. A single visit
   to one of these two traders in April 2019 documented the presence of 549
   Southeast Asian box turtles. Based on documented data from middlemen we
   estimate that the number of Southeast Asian box turtles that are
   harvested in Central Kalimantan to supply the traders in Sampit amounts
   to 19,000-45,000 individuals a year. If the Sampit traders stay within
   their quotas potential profits are less than USD 400 year(-1), compared
   to up to USD 40,000 year(-1) when trading the higher numbers. It is not
   known how many box turtles are traded by the other three exporters in
   the province. With the annual harvest quota for all of Indonesia set at
   less than 15,000 the massive illegal trade as documented in the 1990s
   and 2000s continues unabated. Assessments of the harvest and trade in
   Southeast Asian box turtles must consider both the sustainability and
   legality of this trade.},

Title = {Herpetofaunal Diversity in a Dahomey Gap Savannah of Togo (West Africa):
   Effects of Seasons on the Populations of Amphibians and Reptiles},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Dahomey Gap is a human-derived savannah zone, interspersed by
   patches of moist tropical forest, that separates the forest zone into
   two blocks, the Upper Guinean and the Lower Guinean forests. Community
   ecology aspects of amphibians and reptiles are still relatively
   unexplored in this ecological zone of West Africa. Here, the overall
   species richness and the variation of the diversity metrics (dominance,
   evenness) of a whole herpetofaunal community in Togo was studied, with
   emphasis on the effects of the seasons (wet and dry) on the population
   structure. Overall, we observed 998 amphibian individuals from 27
   species: 148 individuals belonging to 11 species during the dry season
   and 849 individuals belonging to 25 species during the wet season. For
   reptiles, we observed 517 individuals belonging to 44 species: 323
   individuals belonging to 41 species during the dry season and 194
   individuals belonging to 28 species during the wet season. The analyses
   on the diversity metrics showed opposite patterns between amphibians and
   reptiles in each season. Indeed, the dry season rank-abundance curve was
   systematically higher in reptiles than in amphibians for each rank of
   abundance, while the opposite pattern occurred in the wet season
   rank-abundance curve. Singletons and doubletons were much more numerous
   in the reptiles. Concerning the diversity indices, the Dominance index
   was significantly higher in amphibians during the dry season than in all
   other pairwise comparisons, whereas the Shannon's index was
   significantly lower in dry season amphibians and significantly higher in
   wet season reptiles. Evenness index was significantly lower in reptiles
   than in amphibians and the mean number of individuals was significantly
   higher in amphibians by wet season compared to dry season amphibians or
   reptiles during both seasons. The ecological implications of these data
   are discussed. Most species were of minor conservation concern.},

Abstract = {Here we describe a new subgenus and three new species of parasitic water
   mites in the genus Unionicola (Acari: Hydrachnidia) from Myanmar:
   Myanmaratax subgen. nov., Unionicola (Myanmaratax) savadiensis subgen.
   and sp. nov. (hosts: Lamellidens savadiensis and L. generosus), U. (My.)
   generosa sp. nov. (the same hosts), and U. (My.) trapezidens sp. nov.
   (hosts: Trapezidens dolichorhynchus and T. angustior). These taxa were
   identified based on a two-gene phylogenetic analysis (COI + 28S), which
   also confirms the division of the genus Unionicola into numerous
   subgenera. The new species are cryptic species, which are
   morphologically indistinguishable but strongly resemble U. (Prasadatax)
   brandti Vidrine, 1985 described from Thailand (hosts: Lens spp. and
   Ensidens spp.). We also transfer the latter taxon from Prasadatax to
   Myanmaratax based on a set of morphological evidence and propose U.
   (My.) brandti comb. nov. The new subgenus contains a total of five
   species, one of which needs future sampling efforts and will be
   described elsewhere. Additionally, 56 valid subgenera, which were placed
   in the synonymy of the genus and in one case raised to the genus level,
   are restored here until robust phylogenetic evidence on their taxonomic
   status is available. Our results also confirm that Unionicola mites are
   narrow host specialists that are associated with either one or a few
   closely related freshwater mussel species belonging to one or two sister
   genera.},

Abstract = {We investigated the diversity of aquatic fungi from freshwater
   environments in Korea. From the survey of aquatic fungi, three
   Tetracladium (Leotiomycetes, Helotiales) strains, NNIBRFG814,
   NNIBRFG1997, and NNIBRFG3891, were isolated from decaying leaves of
   Fraxinus rhynchophylla located in Taebaek-si, Gangwon-do; freshwater
   foam in the freshwater of the Gam stream in Gimcheon-si; and from
   filtered freshwater of the Yangsan stream in Mungyeong-si,
   Gyeongsangbuk-do, respectively. The isolated fungal strains were
   identified using ITS sequence analysis and morphological characters. A
   sequence analysis indicated that the fungal isolates were closely
   related to Tetracladium breve MK371730 (100\%, NNIBRFG814), Tetracladium
   setigerum KU519120 (98.96\%, NNIBRFG1997), and T. marchalianum MK353126
   (98.14\%, NNIBRFG3891). In terms of growth conditions, it was confirmed
   that NNIBRFG814 grew best at 20 degrees C, did not grow above 30 degrees
   C, and grew at 5 degrees C as a psychrophilic fungus. NNIBRFG814 was
   included in the T. breve clade but its morphology was not similar to
   that of T. breve. Thus, NNIBRFG814 is a new species, and T. fraxineum
   sp. nov. NNIBRFG1997 and NNIBRFG3891 are the first records in Korea of
   T. setigerum and T. marchalianum, respectively.},

Title = {Shifts in Community Vegetative Organs and Their Dissimilar Trade-Off

   China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The ecology of functional features highlights the importance of the leaf
   economic spectrum (LES) in understanding plant trade-offs between
   conservative and commercial resource use. However, it is still unclear
   whether changes in the plant attributes of various vegetative organs can
   be altered and whether the plant economic spectrum (PES) is categorized
   by multiple vegetative organs. We investigated a total of 12 functional
   features of 174 woody tree species, with leaf and stem attributes, on
   Hainan Island. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the
   changes in attributes and connections to understand how the plant
   trade-offs differ. We detected that stem organic matter (SOM) and stem
   organic carbon (SOC) contributed most to the first principal component,
   followed by leaf organic matter (LOM) and leaf organic carbon (LOC).
   Using Spearman correlation analysis, we determined that leaf total
   nitrogen (LTN) and specific leaf area (SLA), LTN and leaf total
   phosphorus (LTP), and finally stem total nitrogen (STN) and stem total
   phosphorus (STP) were positively significantly correlated. These
   significant variations in the traits of nutrients are regulated, while
   the morphological traits of aboveground vegetative organs are diverse.
   The coexistence of species and community assembly can increase our
   knowledge on the tropical coastal secondary forests. Furthermore, our
   outcomes can help us to better understand the restoration of habitats
   and green infrastructure design, suggesting that selecting different
   species across multiple trait axes can help ensure functionality at the
   maximum level.},

Title = {Dolioletta advena sp. nov., a New Species of Doliolid (Tunicata,
   Thaliacea) from the Adriatic Sea},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Adriatic Sea, as a part of Mediterranean, is one of the best
   investigated areas in the world regarding zooplankton. Nevertheless, in
   the last decade four new species of gelatinous zooplankton were
   described from the Adriatic Sea. Whether these species are newcomers or
   they were simply overlooked is still under investigations. Here we
   provide a description of a new species of Doliolida from the genus
   Dolioletta, Dolioletta advena sp. nov., found in the Adriatic Sea in
   August 2021, in a period of high sea temperatures and salinities,
   suggesting its thermal predilection. Its blastozooids dominated the
   studied doliolid blastozooid communities in the South Adriatic, except
   in the 50-100 m depth layer at a coastal Lokrum station. Blastozooids of
   D. advena sp. nov. possess unique morphological features which easily
   distinguish it from other doliolid species: the most prominent feature
   being the curved digestive tract where the intestine does not form a
   tight coil as in other Dolioletta species. The placement of this species
   in the genus Dolioletta is corroborated by COI phylogenetic analysis
   which showed that D. advena sp. nov. forms a well-supported monophyletic
   clade with Dolioletta gegenbauri (81\% bootstrap support). In addition
   to D. advena sp. nov. COI sequence, we provide COI sequences of five
   doliolid and one pyrosomatid species, which will greatly improve the
   availability of thaliacean sequences for metabarcoding studies. The
   origin of D. advena sp. nov. is unknown, but given the fact that
   doliolids are well investigated in the Mediterranean Sea, it is likely
   that it arrived with sea currents either through the Suez Canal or the
   Strait of Gibraltar. Future investigations will confirm or reject this
   hypothesis.},

   Decline in Europe},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The loss of biodiversity is shaping today's environment. Bird ringing is
   a citizen science research tool that can determine species population
   dynamics and trends over a large geographic area. We used a 17-year time
   series to assess population trends of 74 passerine species based on
   ringing data from autumn migration in Slovenia (south-central Europe).
   We defined seven guilds of species according to geographic location,
   ecological, migratory, breeding, and life-history traits. Almost all
   guilds showed declining trends, except for the group of species of
   northeastern European origin, which showed a stable trend. The greatest
   decline was in low-productivity wetland specialists. Forest birds,
   seed-eaters, and high-productivity species experienced the smallest
   declines. The general declines in avifauna across a range of
   life-history and behavioural traits, and across a range of spatial and
   ecological scales, suggest widespread environmental change in Europe.
   Our data indicates that recent trends are toward ecosystem homogeneity,
   with an impoverished avifauna, including a few species that are
   increasing in abundance. These are the species with higher productivity
   and flexible behaviour, such as short-distance migrants, that have the
   greatest chance of prevailing in the recently rapidly changing
   environment because of their ability to adapt to changes in a timely
   manner.},

Title = {Effects of Invasive Plant Diversity on Soil Microbial Communities},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Native plant communities can be invaded by different numbers of alien
   plant species or by the same number of alien plant species with
   different levels of evenness. However, little is known about how alien
   invasive plant species richness and evenness affect soil microbial
   communities. We constructed native herbaceous plant communities invaded
   by exotic plants with different richness (1, 2, 4 and 8 species) and
   evenness (high and low) and analyzed soil physico-chemical properties
   and the diversity and composition of soil fungal and bacterial
   communities by high-throughput Illumina sequencing. Overall, the species
   richness and evenness of invasive plants had no significant effect on
   bacterial and fungal alpha diversity (OTUs, Shannon, Simpson, Chao1 and
   ACE) or the soil physico-chemical properties. However, invasive species
   richness had a significant impact on the relative abundance of the most
   dominant fungi, Ascomycota and Bipolaris, and the dominant bacteria,
   Actinobacteriota, which increased with increasing invasive species
   richness. The relative abundance of the dominant microbial groups was
   significantly correlated with the relative abundance of some specific
   invasive plants in the community. This study sheds new light on the
   effects of plant co-invasion on soil microbial communities, which may
   help us understand the underlying mechanisms of multiple alien plant
   invasion processes from the perspective of soil microorganisms.},

Abstract = {Although DNA barcodes-based operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are
   increasingly used in earthworm research, the relative efficiency of the
   different methods available to delimit them has not yet been tested on a
   comprehensive dataset. For this study, we used three datasets containing
   651, 2304 and 4773 COI barcodes of earthworms from French Guiana,
   respectively, to compare five of these methods: two phylogenetic
   methods-namely Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) and General Mixed Yule
   Coalescence (GMYC)-and three distance matrix methods-namely Refined
   Single Linkage (RESL, used for assigning Barcode Index Numbers in the
   Barcode of Life Data systems), Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD),
   and Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP). We found that
   phylogenetic approaches are less suitable for delineating OTUs from DNA
   barcodes in earthworms, especially for large sets of sequences. The
   computation times are unreasonable, they often fail to converge, and
   they also show a strong tendency to oversplit species. Among
   distance-based methods, RESL also has a clear tendency to oversplitting,
   while ABGD and ASAP are less prone to mismatches and have short
   computation times. ASAP requires less a priori knowledge for model
   parameterisation than AGBD, provides efficient graphical outputs, and
   has a much lower tendency to generate mismatches.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Phylogenetics has become a powerful tool in many areas of biology. Land
   plants are the most important primary producers of terrestrial
   ecosystems and have colonized various habitats on Earth. In the past two
   decades, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of
   phylogenetic relationships at all taxonomic levels across all land plant
   groups by employing DNA sequence data. Here, we review the progress made
   in large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of land plants and assess
   the current situation of phylogenetic studies of land plants. We then
   emphasize directions for future study. At present, the phylogenetic
   framework of land plants at the order and familial levels has been well
   built. Problematic deep-level relationships within land plants have also
   been well resolved by phylogenomic analyses. We pointed out five major
   aspects of molecular phylogenetics of land plants, which are nowadays
   being studied and will continue to be goals moving forward. These five
   aspects include: (1) constructing the genus- and species-level
   phylogenies for land plant groups, (2) updating the classification
   systems by combining morphological and molecular data, (3) integrating
   fossil taxa into phylogenies derived from living taxa, (4) resolving
   deep-level and/or rapidly divergent phylogenetic relationships using
   phylogenomic data, and (5) building big trees using the supermatrix
   method. We hope that this review paper will promote the development of
   plant molecular phylogenetics and other related areas.},

Title = {Variation in Fish Abundance, Diversity and Assemblage Structure in
   Seagrass Meadows across the Atlanto-Mediterranean Province},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Seagrasses worldwide provide key habitats for fish assemblages.
   Biogeographical disparities in ocean climate conditions and seasonal
   regimes are well-known drivers of the spatial and temporal variation in
   seagrass structure, with potential effects on associated fish
   assemblages. Whether taxonomically disparate fish assemblages support a
   similar range of ecological functions remains poorly tested in seagrass
   ecosystems. In this study, we examined variation in the abundance,
   diversity (from a taxonomic and functional perspective), and assemblage
   structure of fish community inhabiting nine meadows of the seagrass
   Cymodocea nodosa across three regions in the Mediterranean (Mallorca and
   Alicante) and the adjacent Atlantic (Gran Canaria), and identified which
   attributes typifying the structure of meadows, and large-scale
   variability in ocean climate, contributed most to explaining such
   ecological variation. Despite a similar total number of species between
   Mallorca and Gran Canaria, the latter region had more taxonomically and
   functionally diverse fish assemblages relative to the western
   Mediterranean regions, which translated into differences in multivariate
   assemblage structure. While variation in the abundance of the most
   conspicuous fish species was largely explained by variation in seagrass
   structural descriptors, most variation in diversity was accounted for by
   a descriptor of ocean climate (mean seasonal SST), operating at regional
   scales. Variation in fish assemblage structure was, to a lesser extent,
   also explained by local variability in seagrass structure. Beyond
   climatic drivers, our results suggest that lower temporal variability in
   the canopy structure of C. nodosa meadows in Gran Canaria provides a
   more consistent source of food and protection for associated fish
   assemblages, which likely enhances the more abundant and diverse fish
   assemblages there.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Lupinus is a wide genus, comprising between 300 and 500 species, most of
   them represented in America. Mexico is a secondary distribution center
   with more than 100 species growing along the highlands. Due to
   morphological similarities, the taxonomy of wild Lupinus species is
   still incomplete. It is, therefore, useful to collect morphological,
   chemical, and molecular data for the correct differentiation of these
   plants. In the present work, the composition of the seed proteins of
   four species: Lupinus aschenbornii Schauer, Lupinus campestris Cham and
   Schlecht, Lupinus hintonii C.P. Smith, and Lupinus montanus Kunth were
   analyzed. Seeds were collected at Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National
   Park. Both total proteins and single protein families, purified by
   chromatographic procedures, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
   2D-electrophoresis and by LC-MS/MS analysis. Data were compared with
   those of domesticated species whose proteomes had been already described
   in the literature. The protein profile may be useful for species
   identification since they have specific characteristics in each single
   species.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {We assessed 3 years of post-release movements of a reintroduced plains
   bison (Bison bison bison) population for evidence of anchoring,
   settling, exploratory and adaptive behavior within a 1200 km(2) target
   reintroduction zone in Banff National Park. We first held them in a
   soft-release pasture for 18 months, then partially constrained their
   movements with drift fences and hazing trials to discourage excursions
   from a 1200 km(2) target reintroduction zone. Their post-release
   movements were within 13 km of the soft-release pasture for the first 3
   months, but management interventions were needed to keep the animals
   within 29 km of the release site and inside the reintroduction zone for
   the remainder of the 3-year study period. Bison exploration was high in
   the first year but decreased thereafter, as did the size of their annual
   home range. Step lengths did not decrease but the frequency of ``surge
   movements{''} (step lengths > 4 km in 2 h) did. Fence visits did not
   decrease over time but the need to herd/haze the bison from other,
   unfenced boundary areas did. The reintroduced bison seasonally selected
   for rugged, high-elevation habitat despite being translocated from a
   flat landscape. Our results suggest wild bison reintroductions to areas
   of just a few hundred square kilometres are possible without perimeter
   fencing, so long as good habitat and management interventions to
   discourage broad movements are in place. Trends suggest such
   interventions will need to continue in Banff until the bison range can
   be expanded and/or bison movements are constrained by other forces, such
   as regulated hunting outside the park.},

Title = {Associations between Epiphytic Bryophyte and Woody Plant Species in a
   Temperate Deciduous Broad-Leaved Forest},

Abstract = {Determining whether epiphytic bryophytes have ecological preferences for
   woody plants remains difficult. Here, our primary aim in developing the
   torus-translation test is to evaluate the associations between epiphytic
   bryophytes and woody plants at the species, genus, or family levels in a
   100 m x 100 m forest dynamics plot in a temperate, deciduous
   broad-leaved forest (China). We collected all the epiphytic bryophyte
   species on woody plants and recorded the woody plant species in the 1-ha
   plot in 2020. All the epiphytic bryophytes on the trees from the ground
   level up to 2 m were collected. We recorded 988 epiphytic bryophyte
   specimens belonging to 61 species in 254 woody plants. The
   Torus-translation test showed that 93.44\% (57/61), 93.44\% (57/61), and
   98.36\% (60/61) of the bryophyte species were significantly positively
   associated with the family, genus, and species of woody plants,
   respectively. A total of 317, 563, and 857 significant positive
   associations concerning the family, genus, and species of the woody
   plants were observed among the 61 examined bryophyte species. In
   addition, few significant negative associations were identified
   regarding the family, genus, and species of woody plants. More rare
   bryophyte species were positively correlated with woody plants than
   dominant bryophyte species. Our study demonstrates that most epiphytic
   bryophytes exhibit ecological habitat preferences for woody plants.
   These observations highlight the importance of the species composition
   of woody plants with respect to the maintenance of epiphytic bryophytes'
   diversity. Epiphytic bryophytes' growth preference for woody plants,
   especially rare bryophyte species, should be considered in the process
   of bryophyte diversity conservation in temperate, deciduous broad-leaved
   forests.},

Title = {Flower-Visiting Insect Assemblages on Fall-Blooming Native California
   Sage Scrub Shrubs},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pollinator studies in the endangered California sage scrub ecosystem
   have focused on spring insect assemblages, when most plant species
   bloom. Consequently, the insect assemblages using common fall-blooming
   sage scrub shrubs Lepidospartum squamatum, Ericameria pinifolia, and
   Baccharis pilularis remain undescribed. Our study aimed to: (1) document
   flower-visiting insect assemblages on fall-blooming shrubs, (2) assess
   the efficacy of three sampling techniques in inventorying insect
   assemblages, and (3) explore, using DNA metabarcoding, which plants are
   utilized and the extent to which surrounding suburban habitats' plants
   are also used. While elevated sampling is required to inventory
   flower-visiting insects, we describe a diverse assemblage consisting of
   123 species. Insect assemblages differed between L. squamatum and B.
   pilularis, as well as, E. pinifolia and B. pilularis, but not between L.
   squamatum and E. pinifolia. Direct sampling approaches (netting and
   photo documentation) collected 115 species not collected by passive
   malaise traps, highlighting that active observations are required to
   describe flower-visiting insect assemblages. Sequencing the ITS2 region
   of pollen from abundant visitors revealed that a majority of pollen is
   from the sage scrub ecosystem, highlighting its value. Our results
   indicate that the presence of fall-blooming shrubs may be critical for
   maintaining diverse sage scrub insect and pollinator assemblages.},

Title = {A Phylogenetic Re-Evaluation of the Stenakrine Opecoelids (Trematoda,

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Opecoeloidea is a large group of xiphidiate digeneans parasitizing
   marine and freshwater fishes. According to the current taxonomic model,
   this superfamily contains only one family with numerous subfamilies.
   This study is devoted to the members of the Stenakrinae. Based on
   phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of 18S and 28S rRNA
   genes of stenakrine opecoelids Caudotestis dobrovolski, C. cf.
   dobrovolski, Hexagrammia zhukovi, Stenakron vetustum, as well as the
   deep-sea xiphidiate digenean Zdzitowieckitrema incognitum, which so far
   has had an ambiguous phylogenetic status, we erect a new opecoeloid
   family, the Zdzitowieckitrematidae fam. nov. The genera Holsworthotrema
   and Scorpidotrema are removed from the Stenakrinae to the
   Scorpidotrematinae subfam. nov. within the Opecoelidae. We also remove
   the Stenakrinae from the Opecoelidae and recognize it as a separate
   family within the Opecoeloidea. The Stenakridae stat. nov. is a sister
   taxon to a well-supported Opecoelidae. The Zdzitowieckitrematidae
   occupies a sister position relative to the stenakrids and the opecoelids
   taken together. All three families are clearly phylogenetically
   distinct, however convincing morphological differences are revealed only
   between the Zdzitowieckitrematidae and the Stenakridae and between the
   Opecoelidae and the Stenakridae.},

Abstract = {We describe and diagnose a new species of Acanthephyra (Acanthephyridae:
   Caridea: Decapoda) and provide an amended key to all species of the
   genus. In order to assess the taxonomic position of the new species, we
   examined and coded 55 characters in available specimens of Acanthephyra
   and ran morphological phylogenetic analyses. We also used a COI gene
   marker for molecular analyses of the new species and other available
   specimens of Acanthephyra. Both analyses retrieved an unexpected
   grouping of species that contradicted a recently accepted morphological
   grouping. We tested a new, quantitative, set of characters and found
   that three of them may explain the molecular grouping of the genus.
   These characters are linked to: (1) proportions of the 6th pleonic
   somite, (2) length of the same against carapace length, and (3) length
   of the same against length of two preceding somites. We suggest that
   these characters mirror evolutionary traits in Acanthephyra and discuss
   their possible adaptive sense.},

Title = {Distribution and Conservation of Plants in the Northeastern
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau under Climate Change},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change is causing unprecedented alterations in the spatial
   pattern of global biodiversity, imposing severe challenges for
   biodiversity conservation. In particular, alpine biomes are sensitive to
   a variety of environmental changes. Therefore, understanding the
   distribution and conservation of alpine plant biodiversity is vital. In
   this study, we used species distribution modeling and 20,650
   high-resolution occurrence coordinates of 1224 plant species to evaluate
   the potential distribution of plants in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau (Qinghai Province, China) under different future climate
   scenarios, through an integrative analysis of species distribution
   probabilities, species richness, and priority conservation areas. Under
   current and future climate scenarios, the plant species are predicted to
   be mainly distributed in eastern and southern Qinghai Province, with the
   suitable conditions for plant species gradually extending from the
   southeast to the northwest of Qinghai Province under the effects of
   climate change. The priority conservation areas in Qinghai national
   nature reserves are predicted to expand, with this expansion being
   greater for herbaceous plants than woody plants, under future climate
   scenarios. However, the priority conservation areas outside nature
   reserves in Qinghai Province remain approximately three times larger
   than those inside nature reserves. Thus, there were great differences
   between the existing nature reserve area and the priority conservation
   areas, with nature reserves insufficiently covering priority
   conservation areas in Qinghai Province. Therefore, the original nature
   reserve areas should be expanded, according to the predicted plant
   habitat hotspots in Qinghai Province. Our research provides valuable
   information for biodiversity protection in the northeastern
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, reasonable strategies for addressing the future
   protection challenges associated with climate pressure, and new insights
   for improving nature reserves in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

Title = {Bird Communities in a Changing World: The Role of Interspecific
   Competition},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Significant changes in the environment have the potential to affect bird
   species abundance and distribution, both directly, through a
   modification of the landscape, habitats, and climate, and indirectly,
   through a modification of biotic interactions such as competitive
   interactions. Predicting and mitigating the consequences of global
   change thus requires not only a sound understanding of the role played
   by biotic interactions in current ecosystems, but also the recognition
   and study of the complex and intricate effects that result from the
   perturbation of these ecosystems. In this review, we emphasize the role
   of interspecific competition in bird communities by focusing on three
   main predictions derived from theoretical and empirical considerations.
   We provide numerous examples of population decline and displacement that
   appeared to be, at least in part, driven by competition, and were
   amplified by environmental changes associated with human activities.
   Beyond a shift in relative species abundance, we show that interspecific
   competition may have a negative impact on species richness, ecosystem
   services, and endangered species. Despite these findings, we argue that,
   in general, the role played by interspecific competition in current
   communities remains poorly understood due to methodological issues and
   the complexity of natural communities. Predicting the consequences of
   global change in these communities is further complicated by uncertainty
   regarding future environmental conditions and the speed and efficacy of
   plastic and evolutionary responses to fast-changing environments.
   Possible directions of future research are highlighted.},

Abstract = {The characterization of demographic features in natural populations is
   important to understand recruitment dynamics, mating systems, and
   propensities for loss of genetic diversity. The accurate identification
   of sex can be difficult in sexually monomorphic species. We present a
   melt curve analysis based on qPCR assays for lake sturgeon (Acipenser
   fulvescens) sex identification and validation using the AllWSex2 marker
   and adult males and females (total N = 143) with an assigned field sex
   from two populations (Black Lake, MI, and Menominee River, MI-WI border,
   USA). The assay is highly accurate (similar to 98\% concordance between
   putative or confirmed field and molecular sex classification), fast, and
   easy to use. The detected inconsistencies between field and molecular
   sexing were partially attributed to field-sexing uncertainty. This
   method will allow researchers to rapidly determine the sex of
   individuals of this regionally threatened species to use in conservation
   efforts and research.},

Title = {Polyphasic Characterization and Taxonomic Evaluation of a Bloom-Forming
   Strain Morphologically Resembling Radiocystis fernandoi (Chroococcales,

Abstract = {Microcystis-dominated blooms cause environmental and ecological impacts
   worldwide. However, it is sometimes challenging to correctly identify
   Microcystis and its related genera. Radiocystis fernandoi Komarek et
   Komakova-Legnerova 1993, characterized by large cells and
   correspondingly large colonies with gas vesicles, has been frequently
   found in cyanobacterial blooms in Brazil. However, its molecular and
   phylogenetic identity is unknown because no valuable DNA sequences are
   available in GenBank. In this study, a strain with R. fernandoi
   morphology was successfully isolated from a cyanobacterial bloom sample
   in Lake Erhai, a subtropical plateau lake in China. Molecular
   characterization and phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and cpcBA
   genes revealed that the strain is different from the type species of the
   genus Radiocystis but formed a well-supported clade with the Microcystis
   species. The comparative results of the ITS region between 16S-23S rRNA
   genes also showed that the strain had very similar secondary structures
   to the species of Microcystis, supporting it as a new member of the
   genus Microcystis. Therefore, we propose the transfer of Radiocystis
   fernandoi into Microcystis fernandoi comb. nov. The correct
   identification and further taxonomic procedure for the bloom-forming
   cyanobacterial genera, such as Microcystis, Radiocystis, and
   Sphaerocavum, are also discussed in this study.},

Title = {Measuring the Impact of Conservation: The Growing Importance of
   Monitoring Fauna, Flora and Funga},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many stakeholders, from governments to civil society to businesses, lack
   the data they need to make informed decisions on biodiversity,
   jeopardising efforts to conserve, restore and sustainably manage nature.
   Here we review the importance of enhancing biodiversity monitoring,
   assess the challenges involved and identify potential solutions.
   Capacity for biodiversity monitoring needs to be enhanced urgently,
   especially in poorer, high-biodiversity countries where data gaps are
   disproportionately high. Modern tools and technologies, including remote
   sensing, bioacoustics and environmental DNA, should be used at larger
   scales to fill taxonomic and geographic data gaps, especially in the
   tropics, in marine and freshwater biomes, and for plants, fungi and
   invertebrates. Stakeholders need to follow best monitoring practices,
   adopting appropriate indicators and using counterfactual approaches to
   measure and attribute outcomes and impacts. Data should be made openly
   and freely available. Companies need to invest in collecting the data
   required to enhance sustainability in their operations and supply
   chains. With governments soon to commit to the post-2020 global
   biodiversity framework, the time is right to make a concerted push on
   monitoring. However, action at scale is needed now if we are to enhance
   results-based management adequately to conserve the biodiversity and
   ecosystem services we all depend on.},

Abstract = {Policies directly affect land-use change, which in turn, affects
   ecosystem services. In parallel with the implementation of a full-scale
   development program for the western region, the Chinese government has
   introduced a series of ecological protection and restoration strategies
   for development and construction. This study conducted a quantitative
   spatial evaluation of the ecosystem service value (ESV) of national
   nature reserves in the western region under this dual policy of
   development and protection. On the basis of land-use data and related
   evaluation parameters, fluctuations in the valuation of ecosystem
   services during 2000-2010 were analyzed in response to land-use changes
   under the comprehensive policy. Results showed that the increases in the
   areas of forestland and water bodies led to an increase of CNY 74.1
   billion in the ESV from 2000 to 2010, equivalent to 2.02\%. Grassland
   with increased production capacity and water bodies were the main
   factors driving the total ESV dynamics. Values of all ES increased
   significantly. Therefore, the ecological conservation and restoration
   policy, along with the development policy, had a positive influence on
   ecosystem services in the nature reserves in western China.},

Title = {Exploring the Biodiversity of a European NATURA 2000 Mediterranean
   Lagoon through eDNA Metabarcoding},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coastal lagoons are considered important habitats both for ecological
   functions and biodiversity worldwide. Thus, they provide relevant
   ecosystem services and valuable natural resources. However, coastal
   lagoons are highly susceptible to anthropogenic pressures that can cause
   biodiversity losses and require specific biomonitoring programs as well
   as management measures. In this research, we applied environmental DNA
   (eDNA) metabarcoding to investigate the biodiversity of a poorly known
   Mediterranean lagoon included in the European Natura 2000 Network. We
   used the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene marker to capture the entire
   biodiversity of this highly diversified aquatic coastal environment.
   With a low sampling effort and rapid laboratory practices, a large
   amount of valuable biodiversity data was generated and analyzed.
   Interestingly, this straightforward and broad molecular surveying of
   biodiversity unveiled a wide variety of taxonomic groups, such as
   benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and macroalgae,
   which are frequently used as ecological indicators. We were able to
   detect species that were previously morphologically identified, as well
   as species never identified before. This research underlines the
   validity of eDNA metabarcoding in assessing the biodiversity in a poorly
   known and protected Mediterranean lagoon ecosystem, as well as in
   identifying the early warnings of environmental stressors. Finally, the
   research highlights the need to investigate multiple target genes and
   primers set for a larger analysis of specific species.},

Title = {Ethnobotanical Survey of Plants Used as Biopesticides by Indigenous
   People of Plateau State, Nigeria},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The quest for sustainable health, environmental protection, and the
   conservation of beneficial organisms makes the use of biopesticides a
   desirable option. This research aimed to identify the botanicals used in
   the management of farm and household pests in Plateau State, Nigeria. A
   cross sectional study was carried out using semi-structured
   questionnaires and on-the-spot, face-to-face interviews. The main issues
   captured include the pests, the plants used to manage the pest, the
   parts used, the cultivation status, the availability, the effects on the
   pests, the indigenous formulation methods, and the modes of application.
   The quantitative data were analyzed using the Frequency of Citation
   (FC), Relative Frequency of Citation RFC (\%), and Use Value (UV). A
   total of 45 plant species belonging to 42 genera, 20 orders, and 30
   families were found to be useful in the management of 15 different
   pests. The FC, RFC (\%), and UV values identified the most popularly
   used plants as Mesosphaerum suaveolens (L.) Kuntze, Gymnanthemum
   amygdalinum (Delile) Sch.Bip., Azadirachta indica A. Juss, Canarium
   schweinfurthii Engl., Euphorbia unispina N.E.Br., and Erythrophloem
   africanum (Benth.) Harms. The plants that showed broad uses by the
   ethnic groups include Azadirachta indica A. Juss (7 uses), Erythrophloem
   africanum (Benth.) Harms, Khaya senegalensis (Desr.) A. Juss., and
   Gymnanthemum amygdalinum (Delile) Sch.Bip. The perception of the
   respondents indicated that most of the biopesticides are available,
   affordable, effective, eco-friendly, and safe. This survey provides a
   pathway for the formulation of stable biopesticides.},

Title = {Genetic Assessment of Remnant Sub-Populations of Sterlet (Acipenser

Abstract = {While the potamodromous sterlet was common in the past throughout the
   Upper Danube in Germany and Austria, it nearly vanished in the second
   half of the 20th century. Until recently, only one small and isolated
   reproductive sub-population is known from the German-Austrian border.
   However, isolated remnants in another section downstream of Vienna, near
   the Austrian-Slovakian border, were discovered in 2014. An assessment of
   the population size is one of the most important prerequisites for
   conservation management. This study aims to assess the population sizes
   at both sites, using genetic pedigrees and comparison to mark-recapture
   data. A total of 193 samples collected from these populations between
   2011 and 2021 have been investigated. In addition, 59 samples from
   captive stocks, 38 wild fish from downstream, and 247 genetic profiles
   from previous studies were used for comparison. Results show close
   relationships and intermittent reproduction on one site. Estimated
   populations based upon genetic pedigree are very small, and are
   consistent with mark-recapture results. Small population sizes of
   remnant populations have only limited, sporadic reproduction, as well as
   continual losses to outmigration support conservation actions for
   sturgeons in the Upper Danube, including the restoration of functional
   migration corridors.},

Title = {Understory Vegetation Dynamics in Non-Native Douglas Fir Forests after
   Management Abandonment-A Case Study in Two Strict Forest Reserves in
   Southwest Germany},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is widely distributed
   in Europe and promoted by forestry due to its assumed resistance against
   climate change. An increasing cultivation area is, however, viewed
   critically by nature conservation as negative effects on native
   biodiversity and naturalness are expected. We investigated plant species
   diversity and composition in two strict forest reserves (SFR) dominated
   by Douglas fir in southwest Germany. These reserves were established in
   the years 2001/2002 to study the development of Douglas fir forests
   after management abandonment. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 2005
   and repeated in 2017. We used re-survey data from a nearby SFR dominated
   by native tree species as a reference. The understory vegetation showed
   consistent development after management abandonment, irrespective of
   tree species identity and origin. It became less diverse and more
   shade-tolerant over time due to missing soil disturbance and decreasing
   light availability. In contrast to a native canopy, though, Douglas fir
   promoted the share of generalist species. Regeneration of Douglas fir
   largely decreased in the SFRs underlining its competitive weakness
   against native tree species, mainly against European beech (Fagus
   sylvatica). Thereby, regeneration patterns of Douglas fir in the SFR
   were similar to those observed in the native range.},

Title = {Testing the Effect of Sampling Effort on Inferring Phylogeographic
   History in Psolodesmus mandarinus (Calopterygidae, Odonata)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Phylogeographic studies have revealed spatial genetic structure and
   inferred geographical processes that may have generated genetic
   diversity and divergence. These study results have implications not only
   on the processes that generate intraspecific and interspecific diversity
   but also on the essential integrals for defining evolutionary entities
   (e.g., species). However, the resulting phylogeographic inferences might
   be impacted by the sampling design, i.e., the number of individuals per
   population and the number of geographic populations studied. The effect
   of sampling bias on phylogeographic inferences remains poorly explored.
   With a comprehensive sampling design (including 186 samples from 56
   localities), we studied the phylogeographic history of a Taiwanese
   endemic damselfly, Psolodesmus mandarinus, with a specific focus on
   testing the impact of the sampling design on phylogeographic inference.
   We found a significant difference in the genetic structure of eastern
   and western populations separated by the Central Mountain Range (CMR) of
   Taiwan. However, isolation by the CMR did not lead to reciprocally
   monophyletic geographic populations. We further showed that, when only a
   subset of individuals was randomly included in the study, monophyletic
   geographic populations were obtained. Furthermore, historical
   demographic expansion could become undetectable when only a subset of
   samples was used in the analyses. Our results demonstrate the impact of
   sampling design on phylogeographic inferences. Future studies need to be
   cautious when inferring the effect of isolation by a physical barrier.},

Title = {The Vulnerability of South African Estuaries to Climate Change: A Review
   and Synthesis},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This review evaluates the vulnerability of South African estuaries to
   Climate Change in a data-limited environment. The regional-scale
   assessment is based on physical characteristics and predicted/measured
   changes in the abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses. The major
   Climate Change stressors were identified in order of importance as
   change in climatic and hydrological processes, ocean circulation and
   temperature regimes, sea level rise, increase in frequency and intensity
   of sea storms, and ocean acidification. Flow-related ecosystem responses
   included changes in mouth state, salinity regimes, biochemical regimes
   (nutrient fluxes), and floods and related sediment deposition/erosion
   cycles. The regional vulnerability assessment provides a summary of the
   key shifts scaled as high, medium, and low in estuary state. Changes in
   oceanic processes and temperature regimes drive shifts in nearshore
   temperatures of the transitional zones, with related ecological
   responses (e.g., range expansion). However, most structural and
   functional changes are expected along cool temperate and subtropical
   biogeographical regions, leading to notable shifts in mouth closures and
   salinity regimes, which in turn will affect estuary function and
   estuary-associated species. Monitoring and management of resources
   (e.g., fresh water and fisheries allocations) need to consider this in
   long-term planning.},

Title = {High-Resolution Mapping of Seagrass Biomass Dynamics Suggests
   Differential Response of Seagrasses to Fluctuating Environments},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Seagrass beds are major blue carbon ecosystems. Climate
   change-associated factors may change the seagrass community and affect
   the capacity of carbon sequestration. To explore the possible effects of
   warming, higher precipitation levels and/or sea level rise on
   seagrasses, the spatial and seasonal dynamics in shallow seagrass beds
   comprising the late-successional seagrass Thalassia hemprichii and the
   early-successional seagrass Halodule uninervis were tracked. The
   high-resolution mapping of seagrass biomass dynamics showed that T.
   hemprichii was the dominant species in the study sites year round, as
   the space occupation by the larger seagrass T. hemprichii was more
   efficient than that by the smaller seagrass H. uninervis. The space
   occupation by both species in the low-elevation site was more efficient
   than in the high-elevation site. In the low-elevation site, while the
   dominance of the faster growing seagrass H. uninervis was increasing,
   the dominance of T. hemprichii was decreasing. This suggested that the
   carbon sequestration capacity of the seagrass beds will decrease, as T.
   hemprichii was capable of storing more carbon in the sediments. In the
   high-elevation site, however, the distribution of both species was
   distinct and showed a clear seasonal succession. The dominance of H.
   uninervis moved to shallower water in the wet season and then moved back
   to deeper water in the dry season. Our observations suggested that four
   possible mechanisms might be involved in the dominance shift in the
   shallow seagrass beds: (1) the deeper water in the low-elevation site or
   the higher precipitation levels in the wet season might reduce the
   drought stress of H. uninervis at low tide and enhance the competition
   of H. uninervis over T. hemprichii; (2) the growth of H. uninervis might
   be stimulated more by the flushing of land-based nutrients caused by the
   higher precipitation rates in the wet season; (3) in the high-elevation
   site, the faster flow velocity and frequently disturbed sediments in the
   dry season might constrain the further expansion of H. uninervis to
   shallower water; (4) the faster flow velocity in the high-elevation site
   might reduce the impacts of periphyton overgrowth on T. hemprichii and
   maintain the dominance of T. hemprichii in the community. Our results
   suggest seagrasses will not necessarily respond to fluctuating
   environments in the same way in the coming decades.},

Title = {Phytoplankton Community Structure and Its Relationship with
   Environmental Factors in Nanhai Lake},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In order to determine the characteristics of phytoplankton community
   structure in Nanhai Lake in Baotou City and its relationship with
   environmental factors, water and phytoplankton samples were collected
   and composition and biomass were investigated at six sites in the
   spring, summer, and autumn of 2021. This article used correlation
   analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) combined with the community
   turnover index (BC) to analyze the phytoplankton functional groups. The
   results showed that 7 phyla and 68 genera of phytoplankton were
   identified in the water body, of which Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta,
   Cyanobacteria, Chrysophyta, Euglenophyta, Cryptophyta, and Pyrrophyta
   accounted for 34\%, 32\%, 16\%, 6\%, 4\%, 4\%, and 3\%, respectively.
   The phytoplankton in the water body was classified into 23 functional
   groups, of which MP and D functional groups were the long-term dominant
   functional groups, indicating that the habitat is a turbid water body.
   The ecological state index (Q) value ranged from 1.94 to 3.13, with an
   average value of 2.74. The comprehensive nutritional index (TSIM( n-ary
   sumation )) was between 49.32 and 52.11, with an average value of 51.72,
   indicating that Nanhai Lake was in a mesotrophic state. Correlation
   analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that multiple nutrients,
   transparency (SD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), water temperature (WT),
   and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were the main environmental factors affecting
   the biomass of dominant functional groups in the water body. The study
   showed the characteristics of the functional groups of algae in a
   precious urban lake in arid and semi-arid areas of China and their
   relationship with environmental factors (physical and chemical
   indicators, anions and cation ions, and heavy metal ions), and provided
   a scientific basis for its water quality evaluation.},

Title = {Mechanistic Thermal Modeling of Late Triassic Terrestrial Amniotes
   Predicts Biogeographic Distribution},

Abstract = {The biogeography of terrestrial amniotes is controlled by historical
   contingency interacting with paleoclimate, morphology and physiological
   constraints to dispersal. Thermal tolerance is the intersection between
   organismal requirements and climate conditions which constrains modern
   organisms to specific locations and was likely a major control on
   ancient tetrapods. Here, we test the extent of controls exerted by
   thermal tolerance on the biogeography of 13 Late Triassic tetrapods
   using a mechanistic modeling program, Niche Mapper. This program
   accounts for heat and mass transfer into and out of organisms within
   microclimates. We model our 13 tetrapods in four different climates
   (cool and warm at low and high latitudes) using environmental conditions
   that are set using geochemical proxy-based general circulation models.
   Organismal conditions for the taxa are from proxy-based physiological
   values and phylogenetic bracketing. We find that thermal tolerances are
   a sufficient predictor for the latitudinal distribution of our 13 test
   taxa in the Late Triassic. Our modeled small mammaliamorph can persist
   at high latitudes with nocturnal activity and daytime burrowing but
   large pseudosuchians are excluded because they cannot seek nighttime
   shelter in burrows to retain elevated body temperatures. Our work
   demonstrates physiological modeling is useful for quantitative testing
   of the thermal exclusion hypothesis for tetrapods in deep time.},

   Geographical Variation in Northwestern China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invasive species impact both the local biota and human economies and are
   a very serious threat to biodiversity. The American bullfrog was
   initially introduced into northwestern China and many other sites for
   aquacultural purposes. Then, the frogs escaped and established feral
   populations. Here, we investigated the variations in age, body size, and
   sexual size dimorphism of two breeding populations inhabiting the
   southern (warm and dry) and northern (cold and wet) regions of Xinjiang
   province in northwestern China. Both populations originated from a
   single source that was introduced into Xinjiang 54 years ago. In both
   populations, males were significantly smaller than females, indicating
   significant sexual size dimorphism. The mean age and body size of both
   sexes in the population in the colder region were lower than those of
   the population in the warmer region. Bullfrogs in the southern
   population had a higher degree of sexual size dimorphism. These results
   increase our understanding of the American bullfrog, which could help in
   the development of strategies to control this invasive species.},

Abstract = {Vessel traffic is one of the major sources of underwater anthropogenic
   noise. Dolphins can modify their vocal repertoire, especially whistles,
   in presence of vessels to facilitate their communication. Acoustic data
   were collected (sampling rate 96 kHz) in La Paz Bay, Gulf of California,
   Mexico. Whistle rate and parameters of the coastal and oceanic ecotypes
   of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were measured in
   absence of vessels and in presence of moving small vessels (size 5-10
   m). The peak noise difference was calculated between the two frequency
   bands dominated by the whistles (2000-20,000 Hz) and the small vessel
   (500-2000 Hz). In presence of vessels the oceanic ecotype decreased
   whistle frequencies while the coastal ecotype increased them. Both
   ecotypes raised whistle frequencies with the decreasing of the peak
   noise difference. The differences in habitat and group structure could
   have driven the two ecotypes to react in a different way to the vessel
   presence.},

Abstract = {The tribe Rhodniini is a monophyletic group composed of 24 species
   grouped in two genera: Rhodnius and Psammolestes. Rhodnius is a
   paraphyletic genus formed by 21 species. The event of paraphilia is
   supported by the greater evolutionary proximity of the species of the
   prolixus groups with the genus Psammolestes than with the other groups
   of Rhodnius. Based on this phenomenon, it was proposed the alteration of
   the genus of the species of Psammolestes to Rhodnius. Thus, we performed
   experimental crosses between Psammolestes spp. and R. neglectus to
   assess the degree of reproductive compatibility between Psammolestes and
   Rhodnius. Hybrids were not obtained for intergeneric crosses. Based on
   this, we have demonstrated that Rhodnius and Psammolestes have
   reproductive incompatibility. These data are important to confirm the
   validity of the specific status of Psammolestes, based on the biological
   concept of the species.},

Title = {Biogeography of Black Mold Aspergillus niger: Global Situation and

   Modeling},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Climate change impacts represent one of the most important ecological
   and medical issues during this century. Several fungal species will
   change their distribution through space and time as a response to
   climate changes. This will rearrange many fungal diseases throughout the
   world. One of the most important and very common fungi is the black mold
   Aspergillus niger. The COVID-19 pandemic reforms the way in which
   mycologists think about this fungus as an emerging healthy issue.
   Through this work, about one thousand records of Aspergillus niger were
   used to model its current and future global distribution using 19
   bioclimatic variables under several climate change scenarios. Maximum
   entropy implemented in Maxent was chosen as the modeling tool,
   especially with its accuracy and reliability over the other modeling
   techniques. The annual mean temperature (bio 1) forms the most
   contributed climatological parameter to black mold distribution. The
   produced current distribution model came compatible with the real
   distribution of the species with a cosmopolitan range. The rise of
   temperature due to global warming will form a limitation to Aspergillus
   niger through several parts of its range. The generated maps of the
   future status of this fungus under two different RCPs for 2050 and 2070,
   indicate several parts that become free from black mold due to
   temperature limitations. The present results need more intensive future
   evaluation using data science and GIS, especially on a local scale
   including more ecological parameters other than climatological data.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Huasteca Potosina region has a relevant landscape heritage of
   biocultural diversity, due to high biological diversity and the presence
   of the Teenek (Huastec Mayan), Nahua, and Xi'iuy (Pame) ethnic groups.
   The object of this study is to analyze, among the different cultural
   groups of the region, how the performances of the relevant
   Socioecological Systems (SESs) influence the conservation of biocultural
   diversity. Quantitative approaches are used to determine the expected
   trends of indices (Informant Consensus Factor, ICF; Cultural Importance
   Index, CII; Shannon-Wiener Biodiversity Index, SWI) commonly used in the
   ethnobotanical field. Data of the main domestic forest species used by
   the groups mentioned above were collected in 2021. We analyzed the SES
   profile for each of the ethnic groups and a mestizo group, as well as
   their relationship with the biome they mainly inhabit and the domestic
   functions fulfilled by the ethnobotanical species. As a result, we found
   that the low deciduous forest and the sub-evergreen tropical forest
   biomes, which co-evolved mainly with the Nahua and the Teenek SESs,
   present higher diversity and effective use of species so that offer
   better chances for conserving the landscape heritage of biocultural
   diversity. Otherwise, the results also show the critical nature
   regarding the biomes inhabited by the Pame and the mestizo's SESs.},

Title = {Global Patterns of Earwig Species Richness},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the most investigated patterns in species diversity is the
   so-called latitudinal gradient, that is, a decrease in species richness
   from the equator to the poles. However, few studies investigated this
   pattern in insects at a global scale because of insufficient taxonomic
   and biogeographical information. Using estimates of earwig species
   richness at country level, their latitudinal diversity gradient was
   modelled globally and for the two hemispheres separately after
   correcting for differences in country areas. Separate analyses were also
   conducted for mainland and island countries. All analyses clearly
   indicated the existence of latitudinal gradients. The most plausible
   explanation for the observed pattern is the so-called tropical
   conservatism hypothesis, which postulates (1) a tropical origin of many
   extant clades, (2) a longer time for cladogenesis in tropical
   environments thanks to their environmental stability, and (3) a limited
   ability of historically tropical lineages to adapt to temperate
   climates. Earwigs probably evolved on Gondwana and secondarily colonized
   the Northern Hemisphere. This colonization was hampered by both
   geographical and climatic factors. The Himalayan orogenesis obstructed
   earwig dispersal into the Palearctic region. Additionally, earwig
   preferences for warm/hot and humid climates hampered the colonization of
   temperate regions. Pleistocene glaciation further contributed to
   reducing diversity at northern latitudes.},

Title = {Genetic Diversity in Marginal Populations of Nitraria schoberi L. from
   Romania},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nitraria schoberi L. (Nitrariaceae) is a halophytic plant with a
   continuous range in Central Asia and with only two populations in the
   westernmost distribution limit of species, in Romania. Currently, there
   is no documented explanation for the species' presence in Europe,
   outside the main distribution area. Considering that marginal
   populations genetics are important in establishing range limits and
   species adaptative potential, genetic diversity was assessed using
   Inter-simple sequence repeat markers (ISSR). Both the Shannon's
   Information Index (I) and Expected Heterozygosity (He) suggested a
   relatively low level of genetic diversity within the two populations.
   However, the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)
   dendrogram and Principal Coordinates Analysis clearly distinguished the
   two populations. Our presumptions, based on current results, are that
   the marginal westernmost population of N. schoberi was established due
   to the unique conditions from the ``islands of desert{''} developed in a
   temperate continental climate. The European establishment of this
   species was likely accidental and probably due to ornithochory. Genetic
   relatedness between populations could be a consequence of their common
   origin, presumably from proximal Asian N. schoberi populations, while
   the separation can be explained by the lack of genetic material exchange
   between the two populations.},

Title = {Deep Ecology, Biodiversity and Assisted Natural Regeneration of European
   Hemiboreal Forests},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change and the associated disturbances have disrupted the
   relative stability of tree species composition in hemiboreal forests.
   The natural ecology of forest communities, including species occurrence
   and composition, forest structure, and food webs, have been affected.
   Yet, the hemiboreal forest zone of Lithuania is the least studied in the
   country for climate change risks and possible management adaption
   techniques. This problem is further complicated by the fact that
   Lithuania uses a traditional centralised forest management system.
   Therefore, this work proposes assisted natural regeneration (ANR) of
   tree species as a more viable means of building hemiboreal forest
   resilience to cope with future climate change risks. The ANR model
   implies that forest management is localised in local communities, to
   provide opportunities for the local people to participate in forest
   management based on local knowledge, thereby facilitating the transition
   from cultural diversity to biodiversity. Further, ANR is grounded on an
   ethical framework-deep ecology-to provide ethical justification for the
   proposal to transit forest management in Lithuania from the traditional
   centralised segregated system to a community-driven practice. The work
   combines the theories of ANR, deep ecology, and hemiboreal forest
   knowledge systems to provide complementary information that builds on
   gaps in the existing literature. This study is unique in that no
   previous work has linked ANR and deep ecology in the context of
   Lithuania's forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Legal Obstacles in the Eradication of Bovine Tuberculosis in European

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {In Poland, bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is most often detected in cattle,
   although some cases have also been reported in pigs and in other
   non-domestic species. BTB is believed to be mainly present in the
   Bieszczady region, in the south-eastern part of the country. The present
   study analyses the practical applications of the law regarding the
   eradication of tuberculosis among European bison in Poland, as well as
   the influence of legal rules in species conservation effects. Its aim is
   to present and evaluate the effectiveness of legal provisions in
   selected cases of BTB detected in European bison. The analysis
   highlights key ``critical points{''} in the management of cases of BTB
   in European bison, which resulted from the problematic interpretation
   and application of the existing legal provisions. Findings indicate that
   before the Animal Health Law, the eradication of BTB in European bison
   in Poland was not regulated clearly enough by the applicable laws in
   force prior to 2021. This posed a threat to an effective reintroduction
   strategy for bison based on creating larger metapopulations and
   maintaining small, isolated reservoir herds (breading centers) for
   fallback in the case of infectious disease. It should be emphasized that
   in the current legal system, there is no doubt that a District
   Veterinary Officer has the competence to prevent and control
   tuberculosis in European bison.},

Abstract = {The environmental contingency caused by the recent massive arrivals of
   pelagic sargasso (Sargassum natans and S. fluitans) on Mexico's
   Caribbean coasts have given rise to several areas of scientific
   research. Our work proposed identifying the diatom flora adhered to the
   thalli of these two sargasso species collected on the coasts of Cancun,
   Isla Mujeres, and Puerto Morelos. We recorded 184 diatom taxa (all
   illustrated) from 65 genera. Taxa from the genera Mastogloia (37),
   Cocconeis (11), Nitzschia (10), Diploneis (8), and Amphora (9)
   represented 41\% of the total, while 38 of these genera were represented
   by a single species. In the total floristic count, 41 taxa occurred
   exclusively on S. fluitans, 52 exclusively on S. natans (22 and 28\%,
   respectively) and 91 (49\%) were found on both. Species of Navicula were
   scarce, and Navicula barbara var. densestriata was here transferred to
   the genus Lyrella (Lyrella barbara var. densestriata (Foged)
   Lopez-Fuerte \& Siqueiros Beltrones comb. nov.). Overall, 17 (9\%) of
   the identified taxa were new recordings for Mexico's coasts. Supporting
   the hypothesis proposed, the 37 Mastogloia taxa suggested a tropical
   affinity, while the high species richness denoted that the surfaces of
   both sargasso species constituted favorable substrata for the growth of
   diatom assemblages.},

Title = {Genomic Analysis of a Novel Heavy Metal Resistant Isolate from a Black

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Microorganisms that grow in poorly studied environments are of special
   interest when new biotechnological applications are searched. The Melet
   river offshore sediments at the Black Sea have been described to contain
   an important number of contaminants from upstream industries which have
   been accumulating for years. Bacteria of such habitats must be adapted
   to the presence of those compounds and in some cases, are able to use
   them as carbon sources. In the analysis of some samples recovered from
   this environment, an actinobacterial strain was isolated, named as
   S1510(T), and its taxonomic position was determined using a combination
   of phenotypic and genotypic properties. Strain S1510(T) presented
   phenotypic properties typical of members of the family
   Micromonosporaceae and was assigned to the Plantactinospora genus, based
   on the phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome
   sequences. Low dDDH (digital DNA-DNA hybridization) values with other
   members of the genus confirmed that Plantactinospora sp. S1510(T)
   represents a novel species, and is proposed with the new name
   Plantactinospora alkalitolerans. The strain presented characteristics
   not previously described for other species in the genus, such as its
   high tolerance to alkaline pHs, the presence of genes related to the
   production and degradation of alkanes (oleABCD, ssuAD, almA), the
   degradation of several aromatic compounds, and the tolerance to high
   heavy metal concentrations. In addition, Plantactinospora sp. S1510(T)
   presents several bioclusters to produce nonribosomal
   peptide-synthetases, terpenes, polyketide synthases, and bacteriocins,
   that possess low similarities with known compounds.},

Abstract = {The Wnt gene family is of ancient origin and is involved in various
   biological processes. In this study, Wnt4 and Wnt16 were cloned from
   Daphnia pulex, named DpWnt4 and DpWnt16, respectively. In DpWnt4 cDNA,
   full-length 1684 bp, the open reading frame was 1122 bp and it encodes a
   373 amino acid polypeptide. In DpWnt16 cDNA, full-length 1941 bp, the
   open reading frame was 1293 bp and it encodes a 430 amino acid
   polypeptide. The sequence analysis result showed that both DpWnt4 and
   DpWnt16 sequences contain a Wnt1 domain. Multiple sequence alignment and
   phylogenetic analysis revealed that DpWnt4 and DpWnt16 were most closely
   related to arthropods. The expression of DpWnt4 decreased at 0.5 mg/L
   group and was induced at 2 mg/L, while DpWnt16 was only induced at 2
   mg/L nanoplastics group. These results help us understand more about the
   character of Wnt4 and Wnt16 in crustaceans and how Wnt genes respond to
   pollutants, especially nanoplastics.},

Abstract = {We describe the first predation record of an undescribed adult male
   tarantula from the genus Euathlus in a juvenile austral thrush (Turdus
   falcklandii Quoy and Gaimard, 1824) (Aves: Turdidae) in central Chile.
   The precise moment of predation was not observed; it could have been an
   opportunistic event or active hunting. In support of the later
   alternative, this undescribed species of Euathlus has been relatively
   frequently seen walking on tree trunks. These incidental observations
   raise the question of how important Euathlus is as a predator of
   juvenile birds.},

Abstract = {Classified as an adaptogen, Maral root (Rhaponticum carthamoides, Leuzea
   carthamoides) is a herb that has long been used in Siberian as well as
   Russian alternative medicine. With over 200 substances found, this plant
   is a great source of bioactive compounds which have significant
   beneficial effects on human health and physical enhancement.
   Simultaneous quantification of the eight most therapeutic and abundant
   substances, i.e., 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE), kaempferol, hesperetin,
   quercetin, chlorogenic acid, N-feruloyl serotonin, cynaropicrin, and
   tracheloside belonging to various groups, such as ecdysteroids,
   flavonoids, phenolics, sesquiterpenes, and lignans, was performed for
   the first time through validated HPLC-MS. The evaluated parameters for
   method validation showed excellent linearity with R-2 higher than 0.996,
   stability under various environmental factors with \% RSD <= 2\%, and
   recovery between 97 and 103\% for all the studied compounds. Other
   validation parameters including selectivity, sensitivity, and precision
   were found to be within the acceptance criteria. The results of the
   stability studies provide information on the best combination of
   conditions for sample handling and storage. Generally, for almost every
   compound, exposure to light and elevated temperature for 96 h led to
   degradation; nevertheless, the acidic environment was beneficial for
   most of them.},

Title = {Freshwater Fish Biodiversity in a Large Mediterranean Basin

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Guadalquivir River Basin is one of the largest in the Iberian
   Peninsula and has a remarkable freshwater biodiversity. Although many
   studies on hydrological regimes or water quality have been conducted in
   this basin the biodiversity of freshwater fish, as well as their
   distribution and conservation status, has never been globally addressed
   as in other Iberian basins. In this context, we synthesized information
   on freshwater fish using field procedures and a bibliographic search.
   Fish distribution patterns at different spatial scales and general
   environmental conditions were analyzed as well as the conservation
   status of the fish community. We documented the presence of 40 species
   (20 native and 20 exotic) in the basin during the 20th century until
   today. However, we only captured 18 species during the field sampling,
   with a prevalence for any native species of less than 23\% (except
   Luciobarbus sclateri). The highest species richness was found in mid
   reaches, while the lower reaches had very low diversity values. Around
   50\% of species are threatened; according to the IUCN, several species
   are declining at an alarming rate and others are probably extinct and/or
   their current status is unknown. Human disturbances during the last few
   decades have caused serious changes in fish distribution and
   consequently to their conservation status. Hydrological alterations,
   intensive agriculture and introduced species are probably the principal
   reasons for Guadalquivir's ichthyofauna imperilment. Our study indicates
   an urgent and real need to identify important areas for fish
   conservation to guarantee a minimum fish biodiversity conservation over
   the long term, as well as effective strategies for fish recovery where
   it still is possible.},

Abstract = {The restoration of vegetation on coal gangue mountains has always been
   an area of concern, and therefore, an important area of research.
   Liupanshui city in Guizhou province, China, has a large number of coal
   gangue mountains, and for this reason, was chosen for studying
   vegetation succession on these sites. Vetiveria zizanioides is known to
   accelerate the restoration of vegetation on coal gangue mountains and to
   shorten community succession timeframes. Because of this, we
   investigated different successional stages after the planting of V.
   zizanioides on coal gangue mountains in the Dahe coal mine comprehensive
   environmental governance project area in Liupanshui city. Through field
   community surveys and model prediction, the effects of planted V.
   zizanioides on the species composition, species diversity, and community
   succession of gangue mountains 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 years after planting
   were explored. In total, 35 plant species belonging to 17 families and
   32 genera were recorded across the five different coal gangue mountains.
   With more time after planting, the height, coverage, density, and
   biomass of V. zizanioides all decreased, but increased for Miscanthus
   floridulus. The Simpson diversity index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index,
   and Pielou evenness index all first increased before decreasing over
   time; maximum values were recorded for the coal gangue mountain 8 years
   after planting of V. zizanioides. According to different similarity and
   dissimilarity indices, the successional stages became more similar with
   increasing time after planting. According to biomass fitting and
   prediction curves, the succession process of coal gangue mountain plant
   communities could be divided into a V. zizanioides community stage, a M.
   floridulus community stage, and a woody plant stage, that starts to
   approach the natural community of evergreen broad-leaved forests, with
   durations of 0-5.62 years, 5.62-17.48 years, and over 17.48 years,
   respectively.},

Title = {Reducing Carbon Input Improved the Diversity of Bacterial Community in
   Large-Scale Biofloc Shrimp Culture Facilities},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, a group of large-scale biofloc shrimp culturing
   facilities were designed. The bioflocs were domesticated by continuously
   reducing the ratio of carbon to feed. The bacterial community diversity
   on the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th days was analyzed by high-throughput
   sequencing technology. The results showed that the biofloc content (0
   similar to 16.8 +/- 4.3) mL/L, TSS concentration (0 similar to 247.46
   +/- 27.3) mL/L, total ammonia nitrogen concentration (0 similar to 0.28
   +/- 0.052) mg/L, nitrite nitrogen concentration (0 similar to 4.13 +/-
   1.42) mg/L, nitrate nitrogen concentration (108.57 +/- 19.6) mg/L were
   all within the safe concentration range of Litopenaeus vannamei. With
   the progress of reducing carbon input, the Chao1 index, the number of
   operational taxonomic units, and the Shannon index increased
   significantly. The number of OTUs of B80 (572.36 +/- 13.26) was
   significantly higher than that of B60 (489.69 +/- 12.97), B40 (423.35
   +/- 18.46) and B20 (407.67 +/- 15.65) (p < 0.05). The Chao1 index of B80
   (768.58 +/- 36.96) was significantly higher than that of B60 (646.8 +/-
   52.53), B40 (569.7 +/- 46.53) and B20 (516.3 +/- 21.35) (p < 0.05). The
   Shannon index of B80 (5.63 +/- 0.16) was higher than that of B60 (4.85
   +/- 0.13), B40 (4.68 +/- 0.21) and B20 (3.65 +/- 0.22), with significant
   difference (p < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the domestication
   formed a micro-ecosystem with Proteobacteria as the carrier (46.98 +/-
   15.82\%), Chloroflexi as the skeleton (2.2 +/- 0.36\%), Nitrospirae
   (1.35 +/- 0.26\%) as the main water treatment functional bacteria, and
   other bacteria as auxiliary nitrogen and phosphorus removal; At the
   genus level, unclassified\_f\_Rhodobacteracea (22.97 +/- 3.82\%),
   Ruegeria (10.35 +/- 1.26\%), Muricauda (5.73 +/- 0.61\%), Algoriphagus
   (3.75\% +/- 0.85\%) and Nitrospira (1.56 +/- 0.56\%) are the dominant
   bacteria. Under the synergistic effect of the above bacteria, the
   biofloc system remains relatively stable. The survival rate and unit
   yield of shrimp were (65.32 +/- 6.85)\% and (4.15 +/- 1.58) kg/m(3),
   respectively.},

Title = {Spatial Patterns and Determinants of Endemic Taxa Richness in the Genus
   Viburnum (Adoxaceae) in China},

Abstract = {Understanding the distribution patterns and formation mechanisms of
   endemic taxa is essential for effective biodiversity conservation. China
   is an important distribution and endemic center for genus Viburnum in
   Asia. However, the distribution pattern and formation mechanism of
   endemic taxa of Viburnum remains unclear in China. In this study, we
   determined the distribution information of 61 endemic taxa of Viburnum
   through specimens' review and field surveys. Species distribution models
   were used to clarify the distribution patterns of the endemic taxa of
   Viburnum. The findings shows that the hotspot for overall endemic taxa
   of Viburnum in China is mainly distributed in temperate and subtropical
   mountainous areas, and the highest richness in the mountainous regions
   were around the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. About
   one-third of the endemic taxa of Viburnum were rare species, whose
   distribution area was scattered and lacked protection. The distribution
   pattern of the endemic taxa of genus Viburnum can be well explained
   within the three hypotheses of environmental energy, water availability
   and climate seasonality. This study provides additional understanding
   and explanation of endemic species richness distribution and their
   formation mechanisms. In addition, it provides conservation measures for
   endemic taxa of genus Viburnum to guide conservationists and policy
   makers in China.},

Abstract = {According to the modern fish system, one species of fourhorn sculpin
   Triglopsis quadricornis lives in the Baltic Sea and Arctic waters. In
   the present study, sculpins from the Baltic and White Seas were studied
   using different methods: morphological analysis to establish patterns of
   the seismosensory system, tomography for the study of cranial bones,
   X-ray imaging for the study of the axial skeleton, as well as
   phylogenetic analysis of two mtDNA markers (control region and CO1) and
   one nDNA marker (RAG1). The results obtained by these methods were used
   to prove the existence of two species: T. quadricornis in the Baltic Sea
   and Triglopsis sp. in the White Sea. These species differ significantly
   in the unique shape and size of the bony outgrowths on the head, as well
   as in the number of bony plates on the body. Genetic differences between
   the species were expressed in the formation of T. quadricornis and
   Triglopsis sp. independent clusters on Bayesian phylogenetic trees
   reconstructed based on the sequences of the mtDNA control region and
   RAG1.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Food resources are key limiting factors for migratory waterbirds, and
   the foraging strategies adopted by herbivorous waterbirds are affected
   by food availability in wetland habitats. The greater white-fronted
   goose (Anser albifrons) is mainly dependent on Carex in the lower and
   middle Yangtze River floodplain. Exploring the relationship between the
   growth conditions of Carex and the foraging strategies adopted by
   wintering greater white-fronted geese has important ecological
   implications for habitat protection and management. In this study, scan
   sampling and focal animal sampling were used to record the foraging
   behaviors of greater white-fronted geese wintering at Shengjin Lake, and
   the plant height and water content of Carex were surveyed
   simultaneously. The relationship between plant characteristics and
   foraging behaviors was tested using a linear regression equation. The
   results showed that Carex had two growth periods at Shengjin Lake, and
   the pecking rate and foraging time budget of greater white-fronted geese
   were higher during these two periods. Plant characteristics were
   positively correlated with goose foraging behaviors. The strategic
   adjustment of the foraging behaviors adopted by wintering greater
   white-fronted geese was consistent with the growth stage of Carex, which
   is the optimal foraging window for greater white-fronted geese. During
   the foraging windows, geese changed their foraging strategies to obtain
   more energy in order to guarantee successful wintering and migration.},

Title = {One Tree at a Time: Restoring Landscape Connectivity through
   Silvopastoral Systems in Transformed Amazon Landscapes},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Due to the continued expansion of pastures and illicit crops, the
   Andes-Amazon foothills in Colombia are one of most threatened
   biodiversity hotspots in the country. Halting and restoring the
   connectivity of the landscapes transformed over the last 40 years and
   now dominated by extensive cattle ranching practices, represents a
   challenge. Silvopastoral systems (SPSs) have been proposed as a strategy
   to help conserve the biodiversity by improving landscape connectivity.
   However, understanding the contributions of SPSs to biodiversity
   conservation still requires additional research. At the farm scale (here
   called farmscape), we compared different landscape fragmentation and
   connectivity metrics under two SPS conditions (with and without).
   Overall, the adoption of SPSs increased the probability of connectivity
   (PC) index in all cases. However, the contributions of SPSs to landscape
   connectivity were not linear. Greater PC increases were observed in
   highly degraded farmscapes (Delta Pc = 284) compared to farmscapes
   containing patches that were better connected and had larger habitat
   areas (Delta Pc = 6). These variables could play a fundamental role in
   enhancing the landscape connectivity through restoration activities that
   seek to improve biodiversity conservation. Even if they are relatively
   small and scattered, in highly degraded cattle ranching systems, SPSs
   could significantly improve the landscape connectivity, which in turn
   could improve wildlife conservation.},

Abstract = {Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) sedimentary layers and nodules occur at different
   depths within sediments at deep basins and ridges of Lake Baikal. We
   studied Fe-Mn nodules and host sediments recovered at the slope of
   Bolshoy Ushkany Island. Layer-by-layer Th-230/U dating analysis
   determined the initial age of the Fe-Mn nodule formation scattered in
   the sediments as 96 +/- 5-131 +/- 8 Ka. The distribution profiles of the
   main ions in the pore waters of the studied sediment are similar to
   those observed in the deep-sea areas of Lake Baikal, while the chemical
   composition of Fe-Mn nodules indicates their diagenetic formation with
   hydrothermal influence. Among the bacteria in microbial communities of
   sediments, members of organoheterotrophic Gammaproteobacteria,
   Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, Acidobacteriota, among them
   Archaea-chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea Nitrososphaeria,
   dominated. About 13\% of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences in Fe-Mn
   layers belonged to Methylomirabilota representatives which use nitrite
   ions as electron acceptors for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM).
   Nitrospirota comprised up to 9\% of the layers of Bolshoy Ushkany
   Island. In bacterial communities of Fe-Mn nodule, a large percentage of
   sequences were attributed to Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and
   Firmicutes, as well as a variety of OTUs with a small number of
   sequences characteristic of hydrothermal ecosystems. The contribution of
   representatives of Methylomirabilota and Nitrospirota in communities of
   Fe-Mn nodule was minor. Our data support the hypothesis that
   chemolithoautotrophs associated with ammonium-oxidizing archaea and
   nitrite-oxidizing bacteria can potentially play an important role as
   primary producers of Fe-Mn substrates in freshwater Lake Baikal.},

Abstract = {Reducing browsing damages from cervids (Cervidae) on economically
   valuable tree species is a challenging task in many countries. Apart
   from cervid abundance, landscape characteristics, such as forest
   composition, land use, forage availability and climatic conditions, may
   affect the degree of browsing through both direct and indirect effects.
   A better understanding of basic mechanisms in this complex system is
   needed to design efficient and convincing management strategies.
   Focusing on Sweden as a case, which has been widely studied using
   regression analyses only, we applied path analysis to test the validity
   of a model on the indirect and direct links between landscape
   characteristics, cervid populations, and browsing damages on Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris). Our results validated the tested model in which
   moose (Alces alces) density and pine availability directly influence
   browsing damages. Increasing amounts of pine forests, preferred
   deciduous trees, and young forest had positive direct effects on moose
   densities and thereby indirectly contributed to increased browsing
   damages. The density of smaller deer species showed no direct effect on
   browsing damages on pine. Path analysis corroborated our attempt to
   disentangle direct and indirect potential causal drivers of browsing
   damages and shows that the choice of statistical method may alter the
   understanding of mechanistic driving forces.},

Title = {Project ``Biodiversity MARE Tricase{''}: A Species Inventory of the
   Coastal Area of Southeastern Salento (Ionian Sea, Italy)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Biodiversity is a broad concept that encompasses the diversity of
   nature, from the genetic to the habitat scale, and ensures the proper
   functioning of ecosystems. The Mediterranean Sea, one of the world's
   most biodiverse marine basins, faces major threats, such as
   overexploitation of resources, pollution and climate change. Here we
   provide the first multi-taxa inventory of marine organisms and coastal
   terrestrial flora recorded in southeastern Salento (Ionian Sea, Italy),
   realized during the project ``Biodiversity MARE Tricase{''}, which
   provided the first baseline of species living in the area. Sampling was
   carried out by SCUBA and free diving, fishing gears, and citizen science
   from 0 to 70 m. Overall, 697 taxa were found between March 2016 and
   October 2017, 94\% of which were identified to the species level. Of
   these, 19 taxa represented new records for the Ionian Sea (36 additional
   new records had been reported in previous publications on specific
   groups, namely Porifera and Mollusca Heterobranchia), and two findings
   represented the easternmost records in the Mediterranean Sea
   (Helicosalpa virgula and Lampea pancerina). For eight other taxa, our
   findings represented the only locality in the Ionian Sea, besides the
   Straits of Messina. In addition to the species list, phenological events
   (e.g., blooms, presence of reproductive traits and behaviour) were also
   reported, with a focus on gelatinous plankton. Our results reveal that
   even for a relatively well-known area, current biodiversity knowledge
   may still be limited, and targeted investigations are needed to fill the
   gaps. Further research is needed to understand the distribution and
   temporal trends of Mediterranean biodiversity and to provide baseline
   data to identify ongoing and future changes.},

Title = {New Records of the Cryptogenic Soft Coral Genus Stragulum (Tubiporidae)
   from the Eastern Caribbean and the Persian Gulf},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The monotypic soft coral genus Stragulum van Ofwegen and Haddad, 2011
   (Octocorallia: Malacalcyonacea: Tubiporidae) was originally described
   from Brazil, southwest Atlantic Ocean. Here, we report the first records
   of the genus from the eastern Caribbean and the Persian Gulf in the
   northwest Indian Ocean. We compare the morphological features of
   specimens, together with molecular data from three commonly used
   barcoding markers (COI, mtMutS, 28S rDNA) and 308 ultraconserved
   elements (UCE) and exon loci sequenced using a target-enrichment
   approach. The molecular and morphological data together suggest that
   specimens from all three localities are the same species, i.e.,
   Stragulum bicolor van Ofwegen and Haddad, 2011. It is still not possible
   to establish the native range of the species or determine whether it may
   be an introduced species due to the limited number of specimens included
   in this study. However, the lack of historical records, its fouling
   abilities on artificial substrates, and a growing number of observations
   support the invasive nature of the species in Brazilian and Caribbean
   waters and therefore suggest that it may have been introduced into the
   Atlantic from elsewhere. Interestingly, the species has not shown any
   invasive behaviour in the Persian Gulf, where it has been found only on
   natural, rocky substrates. The aim of the present report is to create
   awareness of this taxon with the hope that this will lead to new records
   from other localities and help to establish its native range.},

Title = {Diversity and Variation of Epiphytic Diatoms on Ruppia maritima L.,
   Related to Anthropogenic Impact in an Estuary in Southern Brazil},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Knowledge about the diversity and spatiotemporal variability of
   epiphytic diatom communities in estuarine meadows has great relevance
   for coastal ecology and, thus, contributes to understanding the impact
   of natural and anthropogenic changes on seagrass meadows. The community
   of epiphytic diatoms in Ruppia maritima L. meadows was investigated in
   two environments with different levels of anthropogenic impact and
   nutrient loads. Both impacted and non-impacted meadows had similar
   conditions in terms of water depth, temperature and transparency but
   distinct nutrient loads and salinity ranges. A total of 159 diatom taxa
   were found on Ruppia maritima leaves during the monitoring period,
   including freshwater (30.8\%), marine (25.1\%), brackish (9.4\%) and
   cosmopolitan (8.8\%) taxa. The most abundant species were C. placentula,
   T. tabulata, M. pumila and T. fasciculata, in addition to A.
   tenuissimus, C. adhaerens and M. moniliformis. Although present in both
   sites, C. placentula and T. tabulata were the dominant species in the
   impacted site. We found that 32\% of the taxa were exclusive to the
   non-impacted site, 23\% to the impacted site and 45\% were common to
   both sites. The study sites showed marked differences in community
   attributes; i.e., higher richness, diversity and equitability and lower
   dominance were found in the non-impacted site, which is distant from
   anthropogenic sources of domestic and industrial sewage and has low
   concentrations of dissolved N and P in water and low values of sediment
   organic matter. Nutrient concentration and salinity were the main
   factors behind the spatial and temporal variability in the structure of
   the epiphytic community when all other environmental variables were
   similar (water depth, temperature, transparency and host plant). The
   influence of temperature and salinity on community structure was
   site-dependent. This study revealed the high richness and diversity of
   epiphytic diatoms in the meadows of the Patos Lagoon estuary (PLE) and
   the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the communities, and it
   shows the potential of epiphytic community studies for the assessment of
   environmental quality in seagrass meadow habitats.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Camellia gigantocarpa is one of the oil-tea trees whose seeds can be
   used to extract high-quality vegetable oil. To date, there are no data
   on the mitochondrial genome of the oil-tea tree, in contrast to the
   tea-tree C. sinensis, which belongs to the same genus. In this paper, we
   present the first complete mitochondrial genomes of C. gigantocarpa
   obtained using PacBio Hi-Fi (high-fidelity) and Hi-C sequencing
   technologies to anchor the 970,410 bp genome assembly into a single
   sequence. A set of 44 protein-coding genes, 22 non-coding genes, 746
   simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and more than 201 kb of repetitive
   sequences were annotated in the genome assembly. The high percentage of
   repetitive sequences in the mitochondrial genome of C. gigantocarpa
   (20.81\%) and C. sinensis (22.15\%, tea tree) compared to Arabidopsis
   thaliana (4.96\%) significantly increased the mitogenome size in the
   genus Camellia. The comparison of the mitochondrial genomes between C.
   gigantocarpa and C. sinensis revealed genes exhibit high variance in
   gene order and low substitution rate within the genus Camellia.
   Information on the mitochondrial genome provides a better understanding
   of the structure and evolution of the genome in Camellia and may
   contribute to further study of the after-ripening process of oil-tea
   trees.},

Title = {Genome-Wide Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of Local Sudanese
   Sheep Populations Revealed by Whole-Genome Sequencing},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Local Sudanese sheep populations inhabiting diverse environmental
   conditions and holding opposing morphologies provide opportunities for
   molecular-genetic research. Characterizing their genome is crucial for
   sustainable breeding improvement and targeting favorable genes in
   breeding programs. However, the genome of these sheep populations, which
   comprises several subtypes, remains uncharacterized using whole-genome
   sequence data. This study aimed to elucidate genomewide genetic
   diversity and population structure of 11 local Sudanese sheep
   populations, namely, Hammari, Kabbashi, Meidobe, Ashgar, Dubasi, Watish,
   Bega, Naili, Fulani, Zagawi, and Garag. Ninety whole blood samples were
   collected, and we extracted DNA using a Qiagen DNeasy (R) extraction
   kit. We used the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to sequence all the DNA
   samples. We included whole-genome sequence data of three Ethiopian sheep
   (Doyogena, Kefis, and Gafera) and one Libyan sheep (Libyan Barbary) in
   the study to infer the genetic relationships of local Sudanese sheep
   populations from a continental perspective. A total of 44.8 million
   bi-allelic autosomal SNPs were detected; 28.5\% and 63.3\% occur in
   introns and intergenic regions, respectively. The mean genetic diversity
   ranged from 0.276 for Garag to 0.324 for Kabbashi sheep populations. The
   lowest F sT estimates were observed between Kabbashi and Ashgar and the
   highest between Bega and Fulani local Sudanese sheep populations. The
   principal component and population structure analyses of the 11 local
   Sudanese sheep populations indicated three separate genetic groups
   categorized following their tail morphotype, geographical distribution,
   and population subtype. The thin-tailed local Sudanese sheep populations
   exhibited independent clustering from the fat-tailed Ethiopian and
   Libyan sheep. We also observed distinct clustering between the
   fat-tailed Ethiopian and Libyan sheep. The present study's findings
   demonstrated the population structure and principal components related
   to tail morphotype, geographical distribution, and population subtype of
   local Sudanese sheep populations. A clear signature of admixture was
   observed among the studied local Sudanese sheep populations.},

Title = {Biodiversity and Phylogeny of North Atlantic Euphrosinidae (Annelida)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Euphrosinidae (Amphinomida) is a clade of generally small, short but
   stout annelids characterized by long, calcareous chaetae that may be
   distally forked or ringent. Little is known about the diversity of
   Euphrosinidae from the North Atlantic and the phylogeny of the group has
   received little attention. Here, we examined 59 specimens of
   Euphrosinidae (primarily from the IceAGE I and II cruises) and sequenced
   fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and nuclear 28S rDNA genes to
   improve understanding of euphrosinid diversity in the North Atlantic and
   gain insights into euphrosinid phylogeny. Maximum likelihood analysis of
   28S + 16S recovered Euphrosine as a `basal' paraphyletic grade; a clade
   containing E. armadillo (plus other unidentified specimens) was sister
   to Euphrosinopsis + Euphrosinella while a clade containing E. aurantiaca
   and E. foliosa (plus three unidentified species) was recovered sister to
   all other sampled Euphrosinidae species. Species delimitation analyses
   based on 16S sequences identified between 14 and 11 species of
   Euphrosinidae with as many as ten distinct species from the North
   Atlantic. The IceAGE material investigated includes one new species of
   Euphrosinopsis and at least one new species of Euphrosinella.
   Unfortunately, because most of this material was preserved in ethanol,
   we were unable to characterize key features needed for adequate species
   descriptions. Additionally, PCR contaminants from presumed gut contents
   suggest that some euphrosinids eat other annelids, namely Cirratulidae
   and Syllidae.},

Title = {Ecotoxicological Evaluation of Dye Degradation and Photodegradation by
   Peracetic Acid with Sodium Carbonate},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) are procedures used for the
   treatment of wastewater based on the generation of free radicals, such
   as hydroxyl (center dot OH) and carbonate anion (CO3 center dot-)
   radicals. However, although contaminants are degraded in these
   processes, the by-products generated in this transformation can be a
   greater source of toxicity than the original compound, making
   ecotoxicological tests essential for monitoring the efficacy of these
   treatment processes. In this study, we examined the ecotoxicity of AOP
   by-products generated using peracetic acid (PAA) and sodium carbonate,
   with and without solar radiation, for the degradation of methylene blue
   dye, using the planarian Girardia tigrina as a test organism.
   Ecotoxicological tests evaluated the acute toxicity of the generated
   by-product in terms of lethal concentrations (LC50). Although in both
   assays the degradation of the dye was greater than 99\%, higher toxicity
   was observed in the assay using PAA and carbonate in the absence of
   radiation. From the results obtained, we conclude that the by-product
   generated from the degradation of methylene blue dye by peracetic acid
   and sodium carbonate, with and without solar radiation, can pose risks
   to aquatic ecosystems if released directly into water bodies.},

Abstract = {Translocations and introductions are important events that allow
   organisms to overcome natural barriers. The genetic background of
   colonization success and genetic consequences of the establishment of
   populations in new environments are of great interest for predicting
   species' colonization success. The wild boar has been introduced into
   many parts of the world. We analyzed sequences of the mitochondrial-DNA
   control region in the wild boars introduced into the Ural region and
   compared them with sequences from founder populations (from Europe, the
   Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Far East). We found that the introduced
   population has high genetic diversity. Haplotypes from all the major
   phylogenetic clades were detected in the analyzed group of the animals
   from the Urals. In this group, no haplotypes identical to Far Eastern
   sequences were detectable despite a large number of founders from that
   region. The contribution of lineages originating from Eastern Europe was
   greater than expected from the proportions (\%) of European and Asian
   animals in the founder populations. This is the first study on the
   genetic diversity and structure of a wild boar population of mixed
   origin at the northern periphery of this species' geographical range.},

Abstract = {A Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, motile bacterium designated KMM
   9957(T) was isolated from a bottom sediment sample obtained from the
   Okhotsk Sea, Russia. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene
   and concatenated conserved protein-coding sequences positioned the novel
   strain KMM 9957(T) in the genus Marinobacterium as a distinct line
   adjacent to Marinobacterium rhizophilum CL-YJ9(T), Marinobacterium
   profundum PAMC 27536(T), and Marinobacterium aestuarii KCTC 52193(T)
   with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 99\%, 98.3\%, and 98.2\%,
   respectively. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA
   hybridization values between strain KMM 9957(T) and M. aestuarii KCTC
   52193(T), M. profundum PAMC 27536(T), and M. rhizophilum DSM 18822(T)
   were 89.4\%, 87.9\%, and 84.7\% and 38.6\%, 34.8\%, and 28.4\%,
   respectively. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain KMM 9957(T) was 58.4
   mol\%. The dominant respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-8, and the
   major fatty acids were C-18:1, C-10:0 3-OH, C-16:0, and C-16:1 omega 7c.
   The polar lipids of strain KMM 9957(T) consisted of
   phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,
   an unidentified aminophospholipid, two unidentified aminolipids, eight
   unidentified phospholipids, and three unidentified lipids. Based on the
   combination of phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain KMM
   9957(T) represents a novel species of the genus Marinobacterium, for
   which the name Marinobacterium sedimentorum sp. nov. is proposed.},

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of diversity-productivity relationships is
   a central question in community ecology. Grazing is the main driving
   force affecting biodiversity, function, and stability of grassland
   ecosystems, and thus should play an important role in mediating
   diversity-productivity relationships. In this study, we examined the
   effect of grazing intensity on both aboveground biomass and biodiversity
   and explored the relationship between them in alpine meadow ecosystems
   in Sanjiangyuan, which is the source of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang
   rivers. The results showed that the aboveground biomass and species
   richness decreased significantly due to multi-state succession in alpine
   meadows caused by long-term grazing, while the Shannon-Wiener index and
   Pielou evenness index decreased and then increased with increasing
   grazing intensity. The relationship between the aboveground biomass and
   biodiversity was U-shaped. Our results highlighted the opposite pattern
   of the diversity-productivity relationship under low and medium grazing
   intensity versus an extremely high grazing intensity; evenness
   contributed largely to this pattern. This study provided a new
   perspective on grassland management and the relationship between
   productivity and biodiversity. Attention should be paid to rational
   grazing to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services in
   alpine meadows.},

Abstract = {Euphorbiaceae and Phyllantaceae are two of the most taxonomically
   complex and diverse families among angiosperm. Therefore, this study
   aims to identify the common, variation, and diagnostic traits of foliar
   anatomy and micromorphology of selected Euphorbiaceae and Phyllanthaceae
   taxa collected from Hainan Island. A total of 42 individuals of 38
   species belonging to these two families were examined under light
   microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A multivariate
   detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), principal component analysis
   (PCA), and chord diagram analysis were performed to visualize the
   variations and relationships between the species. The nonglandular
   trichomes were further classified into long falcate and short conical
   with papillae on their surface, and stellate and lepidote subentire,
   while the glandular trichomes were divided into capitate, subsessile
   capitate, sessile capitates, and peltate. The paracytic-type stomata
   were found in most of the species. The prominent continuous or
   discontinuous cuticular striations radiating from the guard cells in
   parallel, horizontal, or reticulate patterns were analyzed in most of
   the taxa. Variation was also found in epidermal cells and anticlinal
   wall patterns. Together, these traits are useful for identification,
   discrimination, and to define species boundaries at various levels. Our
   study will provide a basis for future studies to strengthen the
   systematic of Euphorbiaceae taxa.},

Title = {Freshwater Fishes of Central America: Distribution, Assessment, and
   Major Threats},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Central America contains a rich diversity of freshwater habitats that
   support more than 600 species of freshwater fishes. However, despite
   several perceived threats to the integrity of the freshwater habitats
   throughout the region, a formal analysis of extinction risk for the
   region's ichthyofauna is lacking. In this manuscript, we report an
   updated checklist of species and a novel comprehensive assessment of the
   conservation status of Central American freshwater fishes by applying
   the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria to species at the global
   level. We also analyze the distribution of freshwater fishes across
   Central America and generate baseline geospatial data that can be used
   in multi-species conservation planning processes, which is available
   through the Red List Website. Our results indicate that between 15 and
   28\% of freshwater fishes in the region are threatened with extinction,
   with considerable uncertainty resulting from elevated data deficiency.
   We identify major and widespread threats in the region, including
   pollution, agriculture, aquaculture, biological resource use, natural
   system modifications, invasive species, and land development. This
   analysis represents an important first step in formulating effective
   conservation planning and action initiatives for a taxonomic group that
   historically has received few protections and can be used to inform
   conservation priorities of freshwater ecosystems at both national and
   regional scales.},

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change put pressure onto environmental and
   natural resources, which in turn increases the vulnerability of
   ecosystems and human communities. This makes social participation
   essential for biodiversity conservation. This article addresses the
   community perceptions of the adaptations made to climate change in the
   El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve (REBIVI), in Baja California Sur (Mexico),
   one of the largest natural protected areas in Latin America. Workshops
   with local communities defined the Socio-ecological Assets for
   Conservation (SEACs) and prioritized the adaptation strategies and
   actions by multicriteria analysis. The conclusions point out that a
   combination of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and communities-based
   adaptation (CbA) is the most appropriate pathway to affront the adverse
   impacts of climate change. Thus, a socioecological approach for land and
   biodiversity use planning has to be implemented if both human welfare
   and conservation are to be effectively promoted. The process is
   necessary and very important, as is the participation of the local
   residents in the implementation and monitoring of the adaptation
   actions.},

Abstract = {We analyzed harvest data to test hypotheses that nearly 4 decades of
   effort to reduce abundance of brown bears (Ursus arctos), black bears
   (U. americanus) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) in an 60,542 km(2) area in
   south-central Alaska (Game Management Unit {[}GMU] 13) was positively
   correlated with moose (Alces alces) harvests in some time-lagged
   fashion. Predator-reduction efforts were progressively more aggressive
   over decades (both de facto and officially designated predator control)
   and did not have clear starting points which complicated our post hoc
   analyses. We documented no positive correlations (p > 0.05) between
   harvests of brown and black bears and subsequent moose harvests for any
   time lag. Moose harvest was negatively correlated with the previous
   years' wolf harvest, but the relationship was weak (correlation = -0.33,
   p < 0.05). Consequently, we reject our hypotheses that harvest of
   predators was positively correlated with moose harvests. We also
   observed no differences in mean moose harvests during periods of
   officially designated wolf control (2005-2020) and a previous period (p
   > 0.50). We recommend that predator reductions designed to improve
   hunter harvests of moose be conducted within a research framework that
   will permit improved interpretations of results and the implementation
   of an adaptive-management approach to achieve management objectives.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Greece is situated in the East Mediterranean region and in the Balkan
   peninsula, i.e., a European biodiversity hotspot with high endemism in
   subterranean and freshwater fauna, highlighting the need to understand
   its biodiversity. A literature search was undertaken to present a
   checklist of cladocerans and copepods based on a compilation of
   published and current data, from 1892 up to 2022 from inland surfaces
   and subterranean water bodies from different regions of Greece. For
   Cladocera, 80 species were recorded (9 families with 35 genera). The
   most diverse families were Chydoridae (20 genera with 33 species) and
   Daphniidae (5 genera with 27 species). For copepoda, 134 taxa were
   recorded, in surface water bodies (12 families with 34 genera),
   subterranean water bodies (7 families with 27 genera), and parasitic
   copepods (3 families with 3 genera). The most diverse families in
   surface waters were Cyclopidae (15 genera with 41 taxa) and Diaptomidae
   (5 genera with 17 species), while those in subterranean waters were
   Cyclopidae (11 genera with 35 taxa) and Canthocamptidae (6 genera with

Title = {Understanding the Taxonomic Complexes and Species Delimitation within
   Sambucus L. (Viburnaceae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The genus Sambucus belongs to the family Viburnaceae, and has long been
   a debatable taxon regarding its systematics and taxonomic assignment. It
   is known for its morphological and genetic variations and thus the
   taxonomic delimitation remains uncertain. Phenotypic and genotypic
   variations within plant species causes difficulties in the detection of
   species boundaries. In the present review, we compiled a set of studies
   that assessed species discrimination within Sambucus genus by
   morphological and molecular markers as well as the taxonomic
   uncertainties in the re-circumscription of the segregated genera i.e.,
   Viburnum L., Sambucus L., and Adoxa L., (syn. Sinadoxa C.Y. Wu, Z.L. Wu
   \& R.F. Huang/Tetradoxa C.Y. Wu) from Caprifoliaceae and their family
   assignment. The data was obtained from published journal articles and
   various online databases. Morphological and molecular diagnostic
   characters were employed to distinguish Sambucus species. Our findings
   indicated that high intraspecific variations within narrow-ranged
   populations and their widespread counterparts contribute to its
   taxonomic complications. Additionally, intraspecific variations within
   Sambucus species leads to misidentifications and the misapplication of
   names, occasioning the publication of many putative synonyms and
   ambiguous names. Possible interspecific hybridizations experienced
   between Sambucus species increases complexity in character evolution. A
   morphological analysis showed that the endocarp seed morphological
   characters can reliably support the segregation of Sambucus taxa into
   discrete taxonomic entities. In molecular analysis, the NeighborNet (NN)
   phylogenetic split network revealed three distinct genera including
   Viburnum, Sambucus, and Adoxa, which clustered separately. The Maximum
   Likelihood (ML) analysis indicated that the Sambucus species formed a
   monophyletic group and clustered into two major clades, a small clade
   containing S. maderensis, S. peruviana, S. nigra, and S. canadensis, and
   a large clade encompassing the rest of the species with significantly
   supported clades (<52\%). The preferred family assignment for Sambucus
   is Viburnaceae.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In January 2019, epilithic diatoms were collected from two streams on
   Mount Gumdan and Mount Yongma near Lake Paldang in central South Korea.
   A total of 16 diatoms were isolated and classified by molecular and
   morphological analysis. Morphology was studied by LM and SEM, while the
   molecular study focused on small subunit (SSU) rRNA and ribulose
   bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) genes. Molecular analysis showed that
   the three species had clear differences in phylogenetic distance. Based
   on these findings, we studied the ultrastructure of three species. Among
   the morphological characteristics, Hannaea librata is longer but
   narrower and always has conical spines, while the similar species H.
   pamirensis has bifurcated spines in the central region and conical
   spines near the pole. Gomphonema seminulum is wider in the axial-central
   area than G. pumilium. Nitzschia inclinata has a bended valve apex,
   while N. oligotraphenta has a straight apex.},

Title = {Are Iron-Rich Calcareous Mine Sites Easily Invaded by Invasive Plant
   Species?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plant diversity in relatively harsh environments, such as metal-polluted
   areas tends to be relatively low. Invasive plants may invade harsh
   environments more easily than native plants. However, studies often find
   fewer invasive species in stressful edaphic habitats (such as serpentine
   soils). Those examples may represent relatively extreme conditions.
   Moderately stressful habitats may be more invaded given the advantages
   of invasive plants. We surveyed the plant diversity in four site pairs
   across three seasons. Sites consist of abandoned mines and reference
   sites. The mine sites have calcareous soils with relatively high iron,
   basic pH, and lower nutrients than reference sites. Results: There were
   153 plant species among the four site pairs. Around 80 and 66\% of
   species in calcareous and reference sites were introduced species
   respectively. Diversity varied across seasons but tended to be lower in
   the mine sites. One of the mines was significantly more invaded. Across
   sites, the number of invasive species and their abundances was not
   different from that of native species. Invasive plants are as capable of
   invading moderately stressful calcareous sites as native species, with
   some sites tending to be even more invaded.},

Abstract = {A new species, Cryptomonas tropica sp. nov., is described from Cat Tien

   Strains of the new species were isolated from soil, which is an unusual

   cells in ventral view and a single plastid notched into several
   irregular lobes without microscopically visible pyrenoids. Phylogenetic
   relationships inferred from nuclear-encoded SSU, LSU, ITS2 rDNA and psbA
   cpDNA show that the new species forms an independent branch on the
   phylogenetic tree of the genus Cryptomonas. In all phylogenetic
   analyses, this lineage was sister to clades containing other
   small-celled, pyrenoid-less species: Cryptomonas erosa, C. parmana, C.
   macilenta, C. obovoidea and C. commutata. C. tropica has been observed
   in two distant localities in Cat Tien National Park.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Fishes from the uppermost Norian Fuchsberg Quarry near Seinstedt are
   represented by two taxa that we interpret as a teleosteomorph (complete
   specimens) and actinistian (scales). Seinstedtia parva gen. et sp. nov.
   is described; although it was proposed as a possible semionotiform, this
   study reveals that Seinstedtia possesses a combination of teleosteomorph
   features, for instance: characteristic pholidophoriform-shaped cranial
   roof; fusion of skull roof bones; three dorso-posterior infraorbitals,
   including an enlarged infraorbital 3; one suborbital bone; movable
   premaxilla; and characteristic-shaped preopercle. In parallel,
   Seinstedtia possesses a head gently curved anteriorly, with lower jaw
   protruding slightly in front of upper jaw; supraorbital 1 forming most
   of antero-dorsal margin of circumorbital ring; one supramaxilla; three
   extrascapulae; cleithrum with short and broad lower arm; and enlarged
   clavicle. This character combination places Seinstedtia as a
   teleosteomorph, family incertae sedis. This fish (total length ca. 50
   mm) and some pholidophorids (ca. 70 mm or less; Parapholidophorus
   nybelini and Pholidoctenus serianus) represent the known smallest
   teleosteomorphs that inhabited Europe during the Norian. The isolated
   scales are elasmoid of amioid type ornamented with the elongated ridges
   of actinistians. This diversity of teleosteomorphs and actinistians in
   Fuchsberg Quarry during the Triassic indicates a connection to a marine
   environment.},

   Growth and Fruit Yield by Reshaping Rhizosphere Microbial Community
   Structure},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are essential components of the soil
   microbiome that can facilitate plant growth and enhance abiotic and
   biotic stress resistance. However, the mechanisms via which AMF
   inoculation influences Cucurbita pepo L. plant growth and fruit yield
   remain unclear. Here, we conducted pot experiments to investigate
   bacterial and fungal community structure in the rhizosphere of C. pepo
   plants inoculated with Funneliformis mosseae (Nicoll. \& Gerd.) Gerd. \&
   Trappe based on 16S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer gene
   sequencing. The alpha-diversity of bacteria increased significantly
   following F. mosseae inoculation, whereas the alpha-diversity of fungi
   exhibited an opposite trend (p < 0.01). The relative abundances of major
   bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi,
   together with the fungal phylum Ascomycota, were all higher in
   inoculated samples than in uninoculated controls. F. mosseae inoculation
   led to remarkable enrichment of potentially beneficial taxa (e.g.,
   Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, Lysobacter, and Trichoderma), in stark
   contrast to depletion of fungal pathogens (e.g., Botryotrichum,
   Acremonium, Fusarium, and Plectosphaerella). Pathways related to amino
   acid metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis were upregulated by F.
   mosseae inoculation, whereas pathways involved in infectious diseases
   were downregulated. The results suggest that F. mosseae inoculation
   reshapes the rhizosphere microbiome, thereby augmenting C. pepo plant
   growth and fruit yield.},

Abstract = {Cordulegaster heros is a Balkan species with a disjunctive area
   extending into Central Europe. The population in the Chriby Mts. in the
   southeastern Czech Republic is the northernmost population, and this
   population was intensively studied from 2010 to 2021 to establish basic
   data on its abundance. In the territory, the geomorphological
   characteristics of streams, characteristics of sediment in streams,
   habitat, emergence time, and period of flight were recorded, and
   population viability was evaluated. Larvae were recorded in 10 small
   forest streams (altitude of 235-426 m a.s.l.), with an average minimum
   width of 51.9 cm, an average maximum width of 177.7 cm, an average
   minimum depth of 6.5 cm, an average maximum depth (in pools) of 21 cm,
   and an average stream gradient of 1.9 grades. The sediments in each
   stream exhibited a grain size distribution with an average fraction less
   than 0.05 mm represented by 6.3\%, a fraction of 0.05-0.1 mm represented
   by 21.1\%, a fraction of 0.1-2 mm represented by 52.1\%, a fraction of
   2-5 mm represented by 12.1\%, a fraction of 5-20 mm represented by 8\%,
   and a fraction of 20+ mm represented by 0.3\%. The larval abundance was
   0.1-6.7 larvae per 1 m(2) of suitable sediment. The emergence period was
   recorded from 28 May to 1 July. The emergence site was categorized as
   larvae-dominated plant leave (57\% of cases), plant stalks (21\%), and
   tree trunks (17\%). Exuviae occurred at an average of 154 cm at
   horizontal distance from the shore and an average vertical height of 77
   cm above the ground. The average total distance of larval movement was
   205 cm. The flight period in 2021 was recorded from 15 June to 11 August
   with peak flight activity noted in the third week of June. The
   northernmost population of C. heros was evaluated as viable and stable.},

Abstract = {In late April 2022, while listening to audio files from an unsupervised
   bioacoustic assessment of the shearwater populations (Aves,
   Procellariiformes) on the coast of Pantelleria island (Sicily, Italy), a
   cricket song of unknown attribution was heard. The first bioacoustic
   analyses, including FFT-based spectrograms and sound pressure envelopes,
   confirmed that it could not be attributed to the known sound of any
   Italian nor Mediterranean species of cricket. In the ensuing weeks,
   field research at the original station and further localities on the
   southern coast of Pantelleria provided photographs, living specimens,
   and further audio records. As soon as the photos were shared among the
   authors, it became clear the species belonged to the genus Acheta.
   Further bioacoustic analyses and morphological comparison with type
   specimens of Mediterranean and North-African congenerics in relevant
   collections and the scientific literature were conducted: they confirmed
   that the findings could only be attributed to a still undescribed
   species that escaped detection due to its impervious and unfrequented
   habitat. Acheta pantescus n. sp. is apparently restricted to the
   effusive coastal cliffs of the island of Pantelleria, a habitat whose
   scant extension and vulnerability require environmental protection
   actions such as the inclusion in a special Red List by the IUCN Italian
   Committee.},

Title = {Meiotic Analysis of Gomphidae Species Sheds Light on the Large X
   Chromosome of the Family (Anisoptera, Odonata)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In most Anisoptera families, the modal diploid number is 25 in males (24
   autosomes + X), and the X chromosome is one of the smallest elements of
   the complement. The family Gomphidae is an exception, as it has a modal
   diploid number of 23 (22 + X), and the X chromosome is the largest of
   the complement and of medium-to-large size in many species. We studied
   the meiosis of three gomphid species from Argentina: Aphylla cf.
   distinguenda (Campion, 1920), Phyllocycla propinqua Belle, 1972 and
   Phyllocycla sp. Chromosome number is 2n = 23, n = 11 + X, except for
   Phyllocycla propinqua, showing n = 10 + X. The X chromosome of these
   species is medium-sized and presents heteropyknotic blocks of different
   sizes. Despite the small number of gomphid species analysed, there is a
   clear trend of increasing size of the X chromosome with the increasing
   amount of heterochromatin. Our results, together with those from the
   literature, suggest that its large size might have been due to a
   progressive accumulation of repetitive DNA and heterochromatinisation
   and not to fusion, as previously suggested. This led us to propose that
   the ancestral number coincided with the modal number of Gomphidae. A
   revision of the derived sex-determining systems in Odonata is also
   provided.},

Title = {Physiological and Ecological Correlates of the Cellular and Humoral
   Innate Immune Responses in an Insular Desert Bat: The Fish-Eating Myotis
   (Myotis vivesi)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The immune response is affected by aridity, but it has been rarely
   examined in desert-dwelling bats. For two consecutive years, we examined
   the seasonal variation in the innate immune response of an insular
   desert bat, the fish-eating myotis (Myotis vivesi), in relation to its
   reproductive activity and ectoparasite load. We evaluated the
   reproductive activity based on external morphological traits and
   testosterone levels in the plasma for males and progesterone and
   estradiol for females. We injected phytohemagglutinin (PHA) into the
   footpads of the bats to estimate the innate cellular response, and we
   measured the bacterial killing ability (BKA) of the blood plasma to
   determine the innate humoral response. Both the external morphological
   traits and hormone levels indicate that the females were pregnant in
   spring and lactating in summer, and that the males were reproductively
   active in autumn, when mating probably occurred. The swelling response
   of the female and male bats was lower in spring. The BKA in the males
   did not vary seasonally; the BKA in the females varied seasonally but
   only in the first year of the study, with lower values in spring and
   summer. The BKA in spring was lower in the first year of the study, when
   the females appeared to be in early pregnancy, compared to the second
   year, when the females were in advanced pregnancy. The swelling
   increased as the body mass and body conditions of the males increased,
   but the BKA was not correlated with body mass or body condition in
   either sex. Ectoparasite abundance and prevalence did not vary among
   seasons. Ectoparasite abundance was not correlated with the PHA response
   in both sexes; it was not correlated with the BKA in females, but it was
   inversely correlated in males. Of the three hormones measured, only
   estradiol was correlated with the immune response: females with higher
   estradiol levels had a higher PHA response and BKA. Our findings
   indicate that the cellular and humoral innate immune responses of the
   fish-eating myotis varied throughout the year, following the seasonal
   reproductive pattern of the species. Our evaluation of the proximal
   factors affecting the expression of the immune response points to the
   potential immunoregulatory role of sex hormones and body mass.},

Title = {Small and Abundant but Understudied Ribbed Sculpin Triglops pingelii

   Biology, and Comparison with Congeners},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The features of the spatial and vertical distributions, and size-age and
   size-sex structures of the ribbed sculpin Triglops pingelii of the Kara
   Sea are presented. In September 2019, this species was recorded at
   depths from 18 to 235 m at a bottom temperature from -1.5 to +1.6
   degrees C. The densest concentrations were recorded northeastward of the
   Yamal Peninsula, at the outlet of the Gulf of Ob at a depth of 18-21 m
   and a bottom temperature from -1.5 to -1.0 degrees C. Individuals with a
   length of 46-126 mm and a body weight of 0.35-15.60 g aged 1+ to 4+
   years were recorded in trawl catches. However, fish with a length of
   51-90 mm and a body weight < 6 g aged 1+-2+ years dominated. Among fish
   > 71 mm long, the proportion of females increased sharply, reaching
   100\% with a length of 120 mm. The individual fecundity of female ribbed
   sculpins in the Kara Sea with a length of 89-123 mm varied from 100 to
   316 (on average 215 +/- 15) eggs. It is shown that this species is a
   necto-bentho-ichthyophage whose main prey are benthic and bentho-pelagic
   crustaceans (mainly amphipods and mysids), as well as juveniles of
   various fish, the total proportion of which is >99\% of the food weight.
   In this sculpin, age-related changes in the diet composition are well
   expressed, i.e., as the size increases, the relative importance of the
   former prey group decreases sharply, and that of the latter two groups,
   on the contrary, increases. A comparative analysis of data on the
   biology and distribution of the six most abundant or common Triglops
   spp. makes it possible to attribute the ribbed sculpin to medium-sized
   representatives of the genus, whose maximum length is similar to those
   of T. jordani from the North Pacific, as well as T. murrayi and T.
   nibelyni from the Arctic. The lifespan of the ribbed sculpin is within
   the same limits as reported for other Triglops spp. Its individual
   fecundity in the Arctic seas is comparable to that of other Triglops
   species living here, but is significantly lower than that of individuals
   of this species and other congeners from the northwest Pacific Ocean.},

Title = {Blood Parasites of Vangas and Other Corvoidea on Madagascar},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Madagascar hosts a great diversity of bird species. This study focuses
   on the description of the diversity and prevalence of blood parasites
   (Haemosporida, trypanosomes and filarioid nematodes) in 131 blood
   samples of 14 species of Corvoidea, namely vangas (Vangidae), Coracina
   cinerea (Campephagidae), Dicrurus forficatus (Dicruridae) and
   Terpsiphone mutata (Monarchidae) found in primary rainforests on
   Madagascar. Blood parasites were detected using both molecular and
   microscopic methods. Multiplex PCR was used to detect mixed
   haemosporidian infections and nested PCR was used to describe a 479 bp
   fragment of the haemosporidian cytochrome b (cytb) gene. Furthermore, a
   770 bp SSU rRNA fragment of trypanosomes, and, for microfilariae, a 690
   bp fragment of 28S rRNA, as well as a 770 bp fragment of 28S rRNA, were
   amplified for identification using nested PCRs. Phylogenetic analyses
   were carried out for all sequences obtained from all blood parasite
   taxa. Over half of the samples (54.2\%; n = 71) were infected with
   Haemosporida, whereas only 21.4\% (n = 28) were infected with
   Trypanosoma and 5.3\% (n = 7) contained filarioid nematode DNA. Fourteen
   of 56 blood smears contained some of the above-mentioned parasite taxa.
   The results corroborate the great diversity of blood parasites in the
   different bird species studied, especially in vangas. Vangas had the
   greatest diversity of parasites found, as well as the highest number of
   multiple infections, which may be due to their morphological diversity
   and resulting habitat use. Fifteen haemosporidian lineages, seven
   Trypanosoma and five filarioid nematode isolates were newly discovered
   in the avian species studied, particularly in the vangas. Members of the
   other Corvoidea families on Madagascar showed a lower susceptibility for
   avian haemosporidian parasites than vangas, which could be attributed to
   possible resistance against those parasites. The study confirmed the
   host specificity of some Haemosporida and microfilariae; however, it
   demonstrated that this was not the case for Trypanosoma.},

Title = {Assessment of Genetic Diversity among Wild Ruta chalepensis L. from the
   North of Jordan},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ruta chalepensis, known as Fringed Rue, is a small shrub of the Rutaceae
   family. To date, there is no record of its natural distribution across
   Jordan, a country located in the eastern part of the Mediterranean
   basin, and there are no previous studies on its genetic diversity in the
   region. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the genetic
   diversity of R. chalepensis in the northern parts of Jordan using
   morphological trait and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   analyses. For the morphological traits, the analysis of variance
   indicated that there were significant differences between the identified
   populations. The Shannon diversity indices showed relatively high
   values, indicating the existence of a high variability among the
   identified populations. The principal component analysis explained 82\%
   of the variation between the collected plants, and a clear separation of
   the collected individuals from the Jarash-A, Jarash-B and Ajloun-B
   populations from the rest of the populations was observed. The heatmap
   clustering was in general agreement with the results of the principal
   component analysis, with the plant height, rachis length and plant width
   considered as the discriminative traits. The AFLP analysis using eight
   different primer combinations generated 59 polymorphic bands, with an
   average polymorphism information content value of 0.32. The phylogenetic
   analysis identified three main clusters, with the first cluster
   including 65\% of the individuals collected from the Jarash and Ajloun
   provinces, with a clear separation of the Jarash-B population. The AMOVA
   revealed that the genetic variation between the populations contributed
   30\% of the total genetic variation, while the variation within the
   populations explained 70\%. In conclusion, morphological traits and
   molecular markers were used successfully to assess the genetic diversity
   among wild R. chalepensis from the north of Jordan, and such data can be
   used for future conservation plans and utilization purposes.},

Title = {Species Diversity Has a Positive Interrelationship with Aboveground

   Forest on the Wuyi Mountains, China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The Wuyi Mountains in China are one of the largest and most complete
   subtropical forest ecosystems at the same latitude in the world.
   However, our limited understanding of the function of this distinctive
   ecosystem means that the interrelationship between species diversity and
   ecosystem functioning needs to be investigated if evergreen broadleaf
   forests (EBLFs) are to be protected. Here, we calculated species
   richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, and the Pielou index in large-,
   medium-, and small-scale (20 m x 20 m, 10 m x 10 m, and 5 m x 5 m)
   forest dynamics plots (FDPs). We also investigated the
   interrelationships between species diversity and aboveground biomass
   (AGB)/productivity in FDPs at the different scales using the generalized
   linear regression model. The results showed that species diversity and
   AGB positively interrelated with each other, whereas there was no
   species diversity-productivity interrelationship in the subtropical BLF
   on the Wuyi Mountains. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that
   elevation was a key factor directly affecting AGB. These findings lead
   to the conclusion that productivity is not solely correlated with
   species diversity and that abiotic factors probably mediate the positive
   interrelationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning.
   This study provides theoretical basis that can be used to protect EBLFs
   in subtropical areas and the results can be used to improve the
   construction of artificial forest communities and vegetation restoration
   at the same latitude.},

Title = {Using Import Data to Predict the Potential of Introduction of Alert
   Alien Species to South Korea},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As globalization progresses, human activities, such as travel and trade,
   are rapidly increasing beyond national boundaries. It is increasingly
   recognized that places, such as ports and airports, where trade occurs
   play a major role as an introduction pathway for alien species. In this
   study, we focused on evaluating the possibility of introduction of Alert
   Alien Species (AAS) through trade data among countries. The natural and
   distribution range of AAS were analyzed along with import data by
   country. There were large differences between the number of AAS
   distributed in a country and the import weight of items related to the
   import of AAS from the country. Fish, which account for 76\% of the
   import weight of AAS, 43 and 40 species of the 84 species of AAS were
   distributed in US and Russia, respectively. However, the import weight
   of items related to the import of fish designated as AAS from these
   countries were extremely low. This finding suggests that trade, which is
   the main introduction pathway, is not taken into account in the
   designation of AAS. For future management plans for non-introduced alien
   species, species with a high possibility of introduction into South
   Korea through trade should be prioritized using import data.},

Abstract = {The weevil Curculio chinensis Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a
   major cause of economic losses to growers of Camellia oleifera in China,
   as females lay their eggs in developing fruits and the hatching larvae
   feed on their seed, aborting fruit growth. Olfactory cues play a key
   role in the host location of this weevil. The present study focused on
   identifying volatiles from different parts of the host plant Ca.
   oleifera, namely, the leaves, fruit peel, and seeds, and testing the
   antennal and behavioral responses of adult Cu. chinensis to those same
   volatiles. Methods relied on gas chromatography, electroantennograms,
   and Y-tube bioassays. The results included a total of twenty-five
   volatiles emitted by the three plant parts, among which eight elicited
   antennal responses in Cu. chinensis adults of both sexes. The behavioral
   bioassays indicated that 3-hexenal, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, methyl
   salicylate, geraniol, and phenethyl alcohol were attractive to Cu.
   chinensis, while trans-2-hexenal and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were repellent.
   Tests with different concentrations indicated that the behavioral
   response could be dose-dependent. Future studies should focus on field
   tests with blends of the attractant compounds in order to develop novel,
   improved control methods for field applications.},

Abstract = {Curculio glandium females associated with the pedunculate oak were
   investigated in order to fill the knowledge gap on acorn structure
   preferences and shell-hardening influence on ovipositional behavior and
   fecundity. Shell solidification progression of weekly harvested acorns
   was measured using penetration and force-deformation tests along with
   fruit mass within a time frame covering weevils' reproduction period.
   Captured females were offered regular acorns (uncracked, soft enough to
   drill into) and older seeds (with natural cracks) for behavior
   recordings and preferences tests. Young acorns and fruits ripe enough to
   be too hard for females to drill (artificially pierced and untouched)
   were used for egg output assessment throughout the shell-hardening
   progression. Experiments revealed that naturally cracked acorns were
   chosen significantly more often, which resulted in reduced
   drilling-phase duration. Egg number did not differ significantly before
   and after the threshold of acorn hardening; however, having passed it,
   females significantly more frequently deposited eggs in artificially
   pierced seeds. Results indicate the opportunistic nature of female
   preferences. Oviposition in cracked or pierced acorns facilitates the
   process and lowers competition for relatively shortly available soft and
   healthy seeds, the first of which reach impenetrability in the third
   week of August.},

Abstract = {Dense aggregations of serpulid worms were encountered in the Daymaniyat
   Islands (Gulf of Oman) from 10 to 20 m depth, over the period
   January-March, 2021. The species responsible for these aggregations
   belongs to the Filograna/Salmacina-complex (Annelida: Serpulidae). This
   species has been present in the area and observed along the Oman
   coastline, but high-density aggregates like this have not been reported
   before. The most probable cause of the aggregations, supported by field
   observations and Aqua-MODIS satellite data, was natural eutrophication
   with a subsequent algal bloom linked to the local winter monsoon. This
   observation emphasises the importance of documenting biodiversity and
   dynamics of reef communities along the Oman coastline.},

Abstract = {In the south of Bahia state, a large part of the native Atlantic Forest
   areas has been modified for the cultivation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao).
   These crops are cultivated under the shade of the canopy of native
   trees, a system locally known as the ``cabruca{''} agroforestry system.
   This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of Odonata assemblages
   (adults and larvae) in cocoa farming areas and to identify the
   relationships of these species with local and spatial environmental
   variables of the monitored sites. Altogether, adult and larvae were
   sampled at 22 sites. Physical and physicochemical water variables were
   recorded for each site. A total of 1336 dragonflies were collected, of
   which 20 were Zygoptera species and 30 were adult Anisoptera
   representatives. The different life stages were related to environmental
   variables such as conductivity, watercourse channel width, and dissolved
   oxygen. The space predictors were also associated with the assemblages,
   mainly for adults. The present study identified that cabruca areas
   maintain a great diversity of dragonflies, including species that are
   considered to be forest specialists and more sensitive to landscape
   changes. The characteristics of this cropping system are considered to
   be favorable for the conservation of the biodiversity of the Atlantic
   Forest.},

Abstract = {The documentation of ethnobotanical knowledge is useful for biocultural
   conservation, preserving the diversity of plants, and drug development.
   The present study was carried out to compile and document the knowledge
   and uses of plants in Al Baha Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A
   total of 81 knowledgeable informants of different sexes, ages, and
   status levels were randomly selected and interviewed. The majority of
   the informants (63\%) were > 60 years old. The collected data were
   qualitatively and quantitatively described using different quantitative
   indices {[}family importance value (FIV), use value (UV), and informant
   consensus factor (ICF)]. The fidelity level (FL), rank order priority
   (ROP), and relative popularity level (RPL) were determined for the
   plants (42 species) mentioned by at least three informants. A total of
   97 plants belonging to 91 genera and 44 families were reported. The most
   commonly used parts were fruits (30.7\%) and leaves (25.4\%), whereas
   the most frequently used modes of preparation were maceration (24.7\%)
   and direct application (23.3\%). Most of the cited plants (49.5\%) were
   traditionally used for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders, whereas a
   few plants (6.2\%) were used for the treatment of reproductive
   disorders. The most ethnobotanically important families were Lamiaceae
   (FIV = 0.35) and Apiaceae (FIV = 0.33). The highest UV was represented
   by Zingiber officinale (0.086) followed by Commiphora myrrha and
   Trigonella foenum-graecum (0.074). The level of agreement among the
   interviewees was remarkably high (ICF = 0.65-0.93) for plants that had
   the ability to cure infectious diseases. A low level of agreement (ICF =
   0.33-0.48) was observed among the informants towards plants that were
   used to treat gastrointestinal tract, reproductive, hematological, and
   central nervous system disorders. There was a total and absolute
   disagreement (ICF = 0) among the informants regarding the plants that
   were used to treat renal, endocrine system, oncological/immunological,
   rheumatic, orthopedic, ear, nose, and throat (ENT), and inflammatory
   disorders. Six of the plants which were cited by three informants or
   more had a high healing efficacy (FL = 100) and forty species attained
   ROP values of 50 or above. Out of the 42 plants, 20 species were grouped
   as popular (RPL = 1), and the remaining plants (22 species) were
   unpopular (RPL < 1). Curcuma longa, which showed the highest ROP value
   (100), was used to enhance immunity. In conclusion, various plant
   species in Al Baha province were used by the local communities for the
   treatment of different health problems. The documentation of these
   plants could serve as a basis for further scientific research and
   conservation studies.},

Title = {Living in the Extreme: Fatty Acid Profiles and Their Specificity in

   the Austral Summer},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The fatty acid profile of seven different organs (brain, gills, heart,
   muscles, gonads, liver, and gall bladder) of the lipid-rich Antarctic
   silverfish, Pleuragramma antarcticum, from the Antarctic Sound was
   studied. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of fatty acids were
   performed using gas chromatography with mass-selective and flame
   ionization detectors. It was seen that the muscles and gills differed
   from the other organs with the prevalence of saturated fatty acids,
   mainly due to 16:0 and 14:0 that may reveal their additional metabolic
   role in these organs for adaptation of the fish to the cold Antarctic
   waters. Monounsaturated fatty acids 18:1(n - 9) and 16:1(n - 7) were
   prevalent in the other organs of silverfish, especially their high
   content in the liver, reflecting the carnivorous feeding type (mainly
   adult ice krill) of the species and their dietary preferences in the
   austral summer. The high content of essential fatty acids, 22:6(n - 3)
   (14\% of total fatty acids) found in the brain and 20:5(n - 3) (12\% of
   total fatty acids) found in the muscles, highlights the functional
   significance of these lipid components in the studied tissues of fish.
   The results will improve the understanding of the functional value of
   individual fatty acids in terms of their organ specificity and the
   adaptation of the Antarctic silverfish to life in the frigid ice waters
   of the Antarctic pelagic ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Host plants are known to determine the distribution and development of
   ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Tricholoma matsutake; however, we found
   that the fruit body distribution of T. matsutake was different in
   Quercus mongolica pure or mixed forests. To clarify the fungal and other
   microbial composition rules of host plants, ectomycorrhizal root tip
   samples of Q. mongolica mixed with different plants were selected for
   study. By using high-throughput sequencing, we obtained 5229 fungal and
   38,834 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) as determined by
   internally transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA (ITS rRNA) and 16S ribosomal
   RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing via the Illumina NovaSeq platform. Among the
   neighboring plants, there were no significant differences in fungal or
   bacterial alpha diversity, but there was a significant difference (p <
   0.05) in ectomycorrhizal alpha diversity. The fungal, bacterial and
   ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in the ectomycorrhizosphere of Q.
   mongolica all showed differences in beta diversity and species
   composition. In addition, the physical and chemical properties of the
   soil and the relationships among species could affect the relative
   abundance of fungi, bacteria and ectomycorrhizal fungi, but the soil
   microbial pool had little effect on microbial composition. Using
   PICRUSt2, some significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) metabolic functions
   in ectomycorrrhizospheric microbial communities were predicted, which
   would be an interesting research field for ectomycorrhizal microecology.},

Title = {Genetic Architecture and Signatures of Selection in the Caqueteno Creole
   (Colombian Native Cattle)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Evolutionary mechanisms have shaped the genomic architecture of
   Colombian Creole cattle breeds. The mating and selection processes have
   impacted several traits, promoting differences within and between
   populations. Studies of population structure and selection signatures in
   Colombian Creole breeds are scarce, and need more attention to better
   understand genetic differentiation, gene flow, and genetic distance.
   This study aimed to analyze the population structure and identify
   selection imprints in the Criollo Caqueteno (CAQ) population. It used
   127 CAQ animals genotyped with Chip HD 777,000 SNPs. The population
   structure analyses used discriminant principal component analysis
   (DAPC), integrated haplotype scoring (iHS), and index-fixing (Fst)
   methodologies to detect selection signals. We can highlight SNP regions
   on the genes TMPRSS15, PGAM2, and EGFR, identified by the Fst method.
   Additionally, the iHS regions for cluster 1 identified candidate genes
   on BTA 3 (CMPK1 and FOXD2), BTA 11 (RCAN1), and BTA 22 (ARPP21). In
   group 2, we can highlight the genes on BTA 4 (SLC13A4, BRAF), BTA 9
   (ULBP), BTA 14 (CSMD3) and BTA 19 (KRTAP9-2). These candidate genes have
   been associated with fertility traits, precocity, growth, and
   environmental and disease resistance, indicating a genetic potential in
   CAQ animals. All this promotes a better understanding of the diversity
   and genetic structure in the CAQ population. Based on that, our study
   can significantly assist the sustainable development and conservation of
   the breed in the Colombian Amazon.},

Abstract = {In order to study the diversity, phylogenetic relationships and
   distribution of marsh frogs of the Pelophylax ridibundus complex in
   Kazakhstan and northwest China, we conducted phylogeographic analyses of
   125 samples from 53 localities using the mtDNA ND2 and COI genes and the
   SAI nuclear gene sequences. Phylogenetic inference of mtDNA revealed
   three main lineages-sister lineages Balkhash and Syrdarya (as the
   Central Asian P. sp. novum), and the Anatolian P. cf. bedriagae, while
   from nDNA data, we additionally detected the western form, P.
   ridibundus. According to mtDNA data, the mean genetic distances between
   P. sp. novum and two other forms of marsh frogs was more than 5\%.
   Genetic homogeneity within populations of the Syrdarya lineage and P.
   cf. bedriagae is characterized by low nucleotide diversity and high
   haplotype diversity. Demographic analyses of the lineages showed past
   population expansions of the Balkhash and the Syrdarya forms. Divergence
   from the most recent ancestor had occurred in the Early Pleistocene
   period (2.46 Mya) for the Balkhash and the Syrdarya lineages, and 1.27
   Mya for the P. cf. bedriagae. Our findings provide a first investigation
   of the lineage diversification and population dynamics of the Central
   Asian marsh frogs and will be useful for further taxonomic implications
   and conservational actions.},

Title = {Genome-Wide Characterization and Identification of the YABBY Gene Family
   in Mango (Mangifera indica)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {YABBY is a specific transcription factor gene family in plants. It has
   the typical N-terminal C2C2-type zinc-finger domain and the C-terminal
   YABBY conservative structure domain, which play an important role in the
   development of the leaves and floral organs. The YABBY gene family
   directs leaf polarity in mango, playing an important role in maintaining
   species specificity. In this study, a total of seven YABBY genes were
   identified in the mango (Mangifera indica) genome. The seven YABBY
   family members possessed both typical C2C2 and YABBY domains. A
   phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of
   the 42 YABBY proteins of mango, Arabidopsis, apple, grape, and peach.
   The phylogenetic tree indicated that the members of the mango YABBY
   family could be divided into three subfamilies, including CRC, YAB5, and
   YAB3. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the transcription levels of
   the MiYABBYs were significantly different under biotic and abiotic
   stresses. The transcription level of MiYABBY7 was significantly
   down-regulated at 0-72 h after Xanthomonas campestris pv.
   mangiferaeindicae infection, methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid
   stresses. The MiYABBY1 transcription level was significantly
   down-regulated at 0-72 h after Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infection.
   MiYABBYs were expressed specifically in different leaves and fruit, and
   MiYABBY6 was significantly up-regulated during leaf and fruit
   development. However, MiYABBY5 showed a contrary transcriptional pattern
   during leaf and fruit development. This is first report on the mango
   YABBY gene family at the genome-wide level. These results will be
   beneficial for understanding the biological functions and molecular
   mechanisms of YABBY genes.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are crucial components of biological soil crusts of polar
   landscapes and carry out many functions in subaerial environments.
   Simple untapered filamentous cyanobacteria are typically in the
   terrestrial biotopes. They appear to be a group with an abundance of
   cryptic taxa. We isolated 23 strains of cyanobacteria from the different
   habitats of the Arctic and temperate zone, from 10 locations in order to
   characterize their morphological and genotypic diversity. Phylogenetic
   analyses were conducted on the 16S and 16S-23S ITS rRNA gene regions
   using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. A morphological
   comparison of the isolated strains with similar known species, as well
   as its phylogenetic analyses, revealed that they belong to three species
   of the genus Phormidesmis (P. nigrescens, P. pristley, and P.
   communis)-and to the previously unknown genus of Leptolyngbyaceae. Using
   an integrative approach, we provide here a description of a new taxon

   a 54-Year Long Surveillance)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ixodes apronophorus Schulze, 1924, the marsh tick, belongs to a group of
   so-called ``neglected{''} ixodid ticks, which remain underexplored
   compared to the most well-studied species of the genus Ixodes (I.
   ricinus, I. persulcatus). In this communication, we analyze and
   summarize the quantitative data on the abundance of this parasite, its
   geographical distribution, and the diversity of its small mammal hosts
   in the region of West Siberia (Asiatic Russia). The analyzed data
   represent a continuous series of observations made between 1953 and
   2007, which constitutes one of the longest timeseries ever studied by
   acarologists. It is shown that the marsh tick in West Siberia is most
   common in the northern forest steppe and southern taiga landscape zones,
   being distributed south of 60 degrees N. Among 24 species of small
   mammals registered as hosts for I. apronophorus in the studied region,
   three play the most important role: the European water vole (Arvicola
   amphibius), the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus), and the Northern
   red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus). The data characterizing
   parasitism of the marsh tick on these three hosts in various landscape
   zones and subzones are provided. We can report a weak albeit significant
   negative relationship between the abundances of I. apronophorus and its
   small mammal hosts. The possible explanation lies in the mismatch
   between the cycles of abundance characteristic of the tick and its
   hosts.},

Abstract = {Jujube is one of the main tree species found in the arid areas of
   Xinjiang, China. However, the nutritional requirements of central leader
   jujube trees are not understood. Our aim was to explore the effects of
   different fertilization gradients on the growth, development, and canopy
   formation of jujube trees to provide a basis for efficient cultivation.
   We measured and compared various suitable indices of jujube trees under
   16 different fertilization treatments, and we confirmed the treatments
   suitable for cultivation by correlation and principal component
   analyses. The jujube tree growth indices under different fertilization
   treatments significantly differed (p < 0.05). The application of
   nitrogen fertilizer promoted the growth of branches and leaves. The soil
   and plant analyzer development value, light, and other traits
   significantly differed (p < 0.05). The leaf area index and direct
   transmittance coefficient significantly differed (p < 0.05). Compared
   with single-fertilizer application, mixed-fertilizer application
   significantly increased the leaf area index. Correlation analysis showed
   that the net photosynthetic rate of jujube leaves significantly
   correlated with the stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and leaf
   SPAD content (p < 0.01). We obtained three principal components with a
   cumulative variance contribution rate of 82.192\%. The final ranking
   showed that the mixed treatment (N 460.77 g/tree, P2O5 460.77 g/tree,
   and K2O 588.23 g/tree) performed better. To ensure branch and leaf
   growth, this treatment promoted photosynthesis, enabling the growth and
   development of fruit trees.},

Title = {Buffalo on the Edge: Factors Affecting Historical Distribution and
   Restoration of Bison bison in the Western Cordillera, North America},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The historic western edge of the bison (Bison bison) range and the
   ecological processes that caused its formation are frequently debated
   with important implications for bison restoration across North America.
   We test the hypothesis that a combination of bottom-up habitat
   suitability and top-down harvest pressure from Indigenous peoples were
   important processes in forming the western edge of bison distribution.
   Using 9384 historical journal observations from 1691-1928, we employ
   MaxEnt ecological niche modelling to identify suitable bison habitat
   across the Western Cordillera from bottom-up climatic, land cover, and
   topographic factors. We then use mixed-effect logistic regression to
   test if bison occurrence in journal records can be in part explained by
   the abundance of humans, wolves, or grizzly bears, in addition to
   MaxEnt-derived habitat suitability. We find support for our hypothesis
   because of the limited suitable habitat in the Rocky Mountains that
   likely prevented westward bison dispersal from their core habitat, and
   there was a negative relationship between bison occurrence and human
   harvest pressure. On this basis, we propose that intensive human harvest
   from large populations in the Western Cordillera, subsidized by other
   wildlife, salmon, and vegetation resources, is an underappreciated
   socioecological process that needs to be restored alongside bison
   populations. Co-managing bison with Indigenous peoples will also
   mitigate the adverse effects of overabundant bison populations and
   maximize the ecological and cultural benefits of bison restoration.},

Abstract = {The Nature Reserve Malpaga-Basella, located along the Serio River in
   Lombardy, was recently established in 2017. It is interesting as it
   presents plant species typical in dry grassland habitats, not present in
   the surrounding area. In this study, Heteroptera were surveyed in the
   Nature Reserve and in a bordering giant Miscanthus crop in 2019. The
   biodiversity of the reserve was well characterized by the presence of
   species linked to arid environments with steppe or Mediterranean
   characteristics, like Antheminia lunulata. Four species new for Lombardy
   were collected, Lygus italicus, Drymus pilipes, Ortholomus punctipennis,
   and Arenocoris waltlii. Giant Miscanthus hosted only a few ubiquitous
   species, also collected in the Nature Reserve.},

Abstract = {The Sminthurididae family includes Symphypleona species highly adapted
   to courtship, with males exhibiting remarkable modifications on their
   antennae. Here we describe a new Neotropical genus and species of
   Sminthurididae from a Cerrado-Caatinga ecotonal zone in Brazil. Males of
   Parasminthurides spinosus gen. nov. sp. nov. have highly dimorphic
   antennal claspers similar to those of Sminthurides, but its females have
   unique strong spiniform chaetae on antennal segments II and III as well,
   which are possibly accessories for the courtship. The new genus can also
   be diagnosed by its elongated maxillae, males having large dorsal
   vesicles between abdomen II and III, ungues I-III with similar
   morphology and sizes, and interno-apical dental chaetae modified into
   large spiniform chaetae. We also present the main diagnostic features of
   all Sminthurididae genera, providing a comparative table and an updated
   identification key for them. Finally, we discuss the previous and
   current knowledge on the family's systematics, suggesting some
   perspectives for future studies in this field.},

Title = {The Effects of Sampling Depth on Benthic Testate Amoeba Assemblages in

   Plain)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Testate amoebae are widely used as proxies in paleoecological
   reconstructions of lacustrine environments; however, our knowledge on
   their distribution along depth gradients are limited. This study
   investigates the distribution of benthic testate amoebae along a
   sampling depth gradient (0 to 57 m) and related environmental
   characteristics in Lake Valdayskoe, Russia. In total, 101 species
   belonging to twenty-one genera were identified. Four types of testate
   amoeba assemblages (littoral, sublittoral, bottom slope and profundal)
   were distinguished that corresponded well to the bottom zones of the
   lake. The results of redundancy analysis indicated that sampling depth,
   temperature, pH and bottom inclination significantly explained 40.2\% of
   the total variance in the species composition. Temperature and sampling
   depth had the largest individual contributions of 19.2 and 7.4\% (p <
   0.001), respectively. The minimal values of species diversity were
   observed on the littoral and at the lower boundary of the thermocline.
   We estimated depth optima and ranges for the species with high
   occurrences and distinguish stenobathic and eurybathic species. These
   data might improve the interpretations of paleoecological records of
   subfossil testate amoeba assemblages in lacustrine surface sediments and
   serve as basis for the development of a transfer function for
   reconstruction of lake depths.},

Title = {The First-Named Fossil Ostrich: A Revision of Struthio asiaticus, from

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The first fossil ostrich to have been named, by Milne-Edwards in
   1869-1871, was Struthio asiaticus, a taxon based on a specimen collected
   by Colonel Colvin in the Siwaliks of India, consisting of associated
   postcranial elements (vertebrae, forelimb elements, a fragmentary
   tarsometatarsus and first phalanx of the third toe). Although it was
   described as least twice in some detail in the 19th century, the
   specimen has since then been interpreted in conflicting ways. A revision
   of the type material and its history shows that it came in all
   likelihood from the Siwaliks of present-day India, not Pakistan. The
   exact locality is unknown and the stratigraphic position of the specimen
   is uncertain (the frequent attribution to the Dhok Pathan Formation is
   not based on solid evidence). Contrary to what has sometimes been
   claimed, Struthio asiaticus was neither a small nor an especially large
   ostrich. It was apparently comparable in size with the modern S.
   camelus, but had slightly more robust cervical vertebrae and carpal
   bones. It seems to have been relatively short-toed. Because of the
   incompleteness of the material and uncertainties about its geological
   age, it is difficult to assess the place of Struthio asiaticus in the
   evolutionary history of the ostriches. Reports of Struthio asiaticus
   from Africa and north-eastern Asia are based on misinterpretations and
   should be discarded.},

Title = {Specific and Intraspecific Diversity of Symphypleona and Neelipleona
   (Hexapoda: Collembola) in Southern High Appalachia (USA)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Collembola, commonly known as springtails, are important detritivores,
   abundant in leaf litter and soil globally. Springtails are wingless
   hexapods with many North American species having wide distributions
   ranging from as far as Alaska to Mexico. Here, we analyze the occurrence
   and intraspecific diversity of springtails with a globular body shape
   (Symphypleona and Neelipleona), in southern high Appalachia, a
   significant biodiversity hotspot. The peaks of high Appalachia represent
   `sky islands' due to their physical isolation, and they host numerous
   endemic species in other taxa. We surveyed globular Collembola through
   COI metabarcoding, assessing geographic and genetic diversity across
   localities and species. Intraspecific diversity in globular Collembola
   was extremely high, suggesting that considerable cryptic speciation has
   occurred. While we were able to associate morphospecies with described
   species in most of the major families in the region (Dicyrtomidae,
   Katiannidae, Sminthuridae, and Sminthurididae), other families
   (Neelidae, and Arrhopalitidae) are in more pressing need of taxonomic
   revision before species identities can be confirmed. Due to poor
   representation in databases, and high intraspecific variability, no
   identifications were accomplished through comparison with available DNA
   barcodes.},

Abstract = {Gracillariidae is one of the richest families of leaf mining moths,
   known by its ornamental and orchard plant pests expanding their primary
   ranges. We here provide a revised checklist of Gracillariidae
   (Lepidoptera) of Slovenia that presently accounts for 123 species. Among
   them, four species, Dialectica imperialella (Zeller, 1847),
   Phyllonorycter abrasella (Duponchel, 1843), Ph. trifoliella (Gerasimov,
   1933), and Phyllocnistis valentinensis M. Hering, 1936, are new records
   for the country. The distribution of the other three species in
   Slovenia, Caloptilia honoratella (Rebel, 1914), Dialectica scalariella
   (Zeller, 1850), and Ph. messaniella (Zeller, 1846), is clarified. For
   the above seven species, short synopses of the bionomics, a current
   range, and images of biotopes, adult moths and their genitalia are
   provided. For P. valentinensis sampled at a larval stage, the DNA
   barcode was obtained to confirm the species identification. Given the
   known distribution of some of the newly recorded moths in Europe, we
   believe that these species do not represent a new invasion but rather
   are discoveries of native species, except for the newly documented Ph.
   trifoliella in Slovenia, which is likely to be an alien species for the
   country.},

Title = {Biodiversity of Coleoptera (Insecta) in Lipetsk Region (Russia)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Coleoptera is one of the most diverse insect lineages.
   Coleoptera species live in many ecosystems around the globe and their
   role in ecosystems is very diverse. To study the number and distribution
   of species, lists of species were compiled and then added into the
   database generation platforms. The aim of the work was to describe the
   modern fauna of Coleoptera based on a recently published dataset. (2)
   Methods: Studies were conducted from 1971 to 2022. Insects were
   collected by different means (searching under the bark of trees and
   stumps, sifting litter and wood dust, soil samples, caught in the light,
   in soil traps, window traps, etc.). For each observation, the
   coordinates of the place of discovery, the number of individuals, dates
   were noted. (3) Results: The dataset presents data on 2416 species and
   subspecies of Coleoptera from 89 families found in the Lipetsk region.
   In total, the number of studied specimens in the dataset was 16,184, the
   number of occurrences was 6192. The largest families in terms of species
   diversity were Staphylinidae (541 species), Curculionidae (416),
   Chrysomelidae (315) and Carabidae (285). (4) Conclusions: In addition,
   based on the analysis of additional references, 452 more species and 2
   families are indicated. Thus, the biodiversity of Coleoptera of the
   Lipetsk region is 2868 species from 89 families. Dataset

Abstract = {A new species of freshwater alga, Chara zhengzhouensis, is described and

   point of view, C. zhengzhouensis differs from another closely related
   species, C. connivens, in its diplostichous cortex and corticate or
   ecorticate in based segments of branchlets. Therefore, the results based
   on both morphological observation and molecular evidence facilitated the
   proposal of this new species-C. zhengzhouensis. It represents another
   species in the charophyte diversity in China and the description of this
   new species provides more molecular data for phylogenetic analysis of

Title = {Quantifying the Evolution of Giant Panda Habitats in Sichuan Province
   under Different Scenarios},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a relic species in China and
   a flagship species in the field of endangered wildlife conservation. The
   conservation of the giant panda's habitat has gained widespread
   attention for this reason. Historically, Chinese Giant Panda Nature
   Reserves are surrounded by communities and the resource utilization
   behavior of households disturbs the giant panda habitat. Changes in
   these communities and in Giant Panda Nature Reserves began around 2010,
   with the feminization and aging of the farm labor force. These changes
   brought different resource utilization behaviors that led to different
   evolutionary tendencies in giant panda habitats. This research study
   assesses the impact of these tendencies based on data from the fourth
   survey of the giant panda in the Sichuan Province and from geographic
   information data. The paper aims to uncover the internal mechanisms of
   farmers' resource utilization behavior in terms of the changes wrought
   to giant panda habitats. The paper simulates the future habitat of the
   giant panda based on the LUCC (land use/cover change) model to identify
   anticipated changes in future landscape patterns and the habitat quality
   of giant pandas under the current scenarios. The paper analyzes the
   spatial-temporal change of landscape patterns through the land use
   transfer matrix, based on the Markov model. The results of the scenario
   analyses illustrate the spatial and temporal difference in habitat
   quality. The driving mechanism for landscape pattern change is explored
   using the logistic regression model. The paper simulates the variation
   tendency of giant panda habitats under differential labor force
   structures and resource utilization behavior based on the CA (cellular
   automata) model, with the robustness of the results verified by
   participatory experiment. Through four scenarios of simulated farm labor
   force structure and resource utilization behavior, results suggest that
   the quality of giant panda habitats in the future will be relatively
   high when workforce feminization and aging is intense and resource
   utilization behavior is weakened. The simulated results confirm that the
   current agricultural labor force structure can reduce the intensity of
   resource utilization behavior. In this scenario, disturbance to giant
   panda habitats would decrease and their quality would improve.},

Title = {Does Temporal and Spatial Diet Alteration Lead to Successful Adaptation
   of the Eastern Imperial Eagle, a Top Predator?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Predator-prey interactions may be linked to different temporal or
   spatial patterns, including dynamics in prey populations. Therefore,
   understanding the adaptive capacity and how top predators respond to
   shifts in prey abundance and availability is crucial for their
   conservation. In this study, we investigated the diet pattern of the
   endangered Eastern Imperial Eagle facing long-term and large-scale
   changes. We studied the abundance variation of its profitable prey,
   sousliks, and how it reflected on eagle population trajectories in a
   regional and temporal context. We found a significant diet alteration
   expressed in large decrease of brown hare (beta(2) = -0.83), poultry
   (beta(2) = -0.81), gulls (beta(2) = -0.71), and water birds (beta(2) =
   -0.57), and an obvious increase of northern white-breasted hedgehog
   (beta(2) = 0.61) and doves (beta(2) = 0.60). Raptors and owls raised
   their participation (beta(2) = 0.44), but white stork and different
   reptiles supplied more biomass. Abundance of European souslik decreased
   through the studied periods (adjusted R-2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) which
   accounted for the lower proportion of this prey in the eagle's diet.
   Nevertheless, the eagle population successfully adapted and
   significantly increased (beta(2) = 0.97) in most of the distribution
   area. The trophic strategy used by this top predator related to
   opportunistic foraging represents an ecological advantage that allows
   the species to adapt to different habitats and guarantees its future.
   The observed prolonged diet alteration could result in a significant
   negative attitude among different groups such as hunters, pigeon
   fanciers, and poultry keepers towards eagles. Therefore, enhanced
   communication with key stakeholders is needed. Conservation efforts
   should be focused also on the preservation of the species' main foraging
   habitats and the restoration of damaged ones so as to maintain the good
   conditions of both primary food source and subsequent prey.},

   exposed to 10 mu g/L waterborne PFOA for 21 days. Subsequently, the
   effect of PFOA exposure on gene expression in liver tissue was
   investigated using transcriptomic techniques. In total, 754
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 389 up-regulated and 365
   down-regulated) were identified. According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of
   Genes and Genomes enrichment and Gene Ontology functional enrichment
   analyses, the DEGs were mainly involved in lipid metabolism, endocrine
   functions, and immunity. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
   reaction analysis of 15 selected DEGs revealed a high correlation (R-2 =
   0.9917) with the transcriptomic results. These results indicated that
   the PFOA hepatotoxicity in frogs is mediated mainly by lipid metabolism
   dysregulation, endocrine system disruption, and immunotoxicity. This
   study provides insights into the hepatotoxic mechanism of PFOA and other
   perfluorinated compounds in amphibians.},

Title = {Stochastic Processes Drive Plant Community Assembly in Alpine Grassland
   during the Restoration Period},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Enclosure (prohibition of grazing) is an important process to restore
   alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, few studies
   have quantified the extent to which the long-term enclosure may
   contribute to the changes in plant phylogenetic diversity and community
   assembly in alpine grassland under environmental change. In this study,
   based on an 11-year fencing experiment along an altitudinal gradient
   ranging from 4400 m to 5200 m in central Tibet, we conducted an
   observation of species composition and coverage within and outside the
   fences in the fifth, eighth and eleventh year, and monitored the related
   climate and soil factors at 7 sites. Our aim is to quantify the relative
   effects of environmental change and grassland management on the alpine
   plant community assemblage. The results were: (1) the overall
   phylogenetic structure (NRI) of the alpine plant communities, whether
   inside or outside the enclosure, was divergent at altitudes where the
   environment was relatively unextreme (4800-5100 m), but aggregative at
   altitudes with low precipitation (4400-4650 m) or with low temperature
   (5200 m). (2) The phylogenetic structure of the nearest taxon of species
   (NTI) was more aggregative along the whole gradient. (3) Precipitation
   was the dominant factor driving the changes in species richness,
   phylogenetic diversity and community alpha-phylogenetic structure
   indices (NRI and NTI), followed by enclosure duration and soil C:N
   ratio. (4) The phylogenetic structure of the communities was similar at
   higher altitudes under grazing or enclosure treatments, and was opposite
   at lower sites. Stochastic processes have driven the changes in the
   communities between inside and outside the fences at all altitudes. In
   addition, homogeneous dispersal occurred in communities at higher sites.
   In summary, the 11-year enclosure had little effect on community
   structure of alpine meadows where the grazing pressure is relative
   lower, whereas it could help restore the community of steppe meadow at
   lower altitudes where the grazing pressure is extensively higher. This
   study may provide a vital theoretical support for the formulation of
   differential management for alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau.},

Abstract = {In Southeast Asian nations, cultured hybrid groupers are facing serious
   infestation by the marine parasitic leech Zeylanicobdella arugamensis
   (Annelida, Hirudinea). They attach to the hybrid groupers by sucking and
   biting on the surface of the skin, paving the way for secondary
   infection upon the fish. The objective of the study is to utilize the
   locally available seaweed to control the infestation of parasitic
   leeches. The methanol extracts of the brown alga Sargassum polycystum C.
   Agardh, 1824 (Phaeophyceae) from Sabah were prepared and investigated
   for antiparasitic efficacy against Z. arugamensis through in vitro
   bioassay. A total of 126 adult leeches from the host hybrid groupers
   were obtained from the fish hatchery. The parasitic leeches were treated
   with the methanol extracts of S. polycystum for 180 min by preparing
   five different dosages at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25
   mg/mL. The brown alga was found to have high antiparasitic efficacy,
   resulting in 100\% leech mortality over a short period of time. It
   showed the highest antiparasitic efficacy (total mortality of leeches)
   in a short time limit of 0.96 +/- 0.44 min, for 100 mg/mL of the
   extract. Observations on leech behavior in the positive control and the
   seaweed extract treatments showed vigorous swimming before mortality.
   LC-MS/MS analysis was used to reveal the phytochemical composition of
   the extract to understand the nature of the main components responsible
   for its antiparasitic activities. A total of 29 metabolites were
   identified via Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometry, including two
   flavonoids (ephedrannin A and hinokiflavone), two organoarsenics
   (1-dimethylarsinoyl-heptadecane and cacodylic acid), four heterocyclic
   compounds, and two chlorophyll breakdown products. The presence of
   bioactive compounds could increase the mortality rate of parasitic
   leeches. Thus, this study concludes that the brown alga showed high
   efficacy in its antiparasitic activities and can be effectively applied
   for treatment in grouper aquaculture farms for sustainable aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Anchovies are species of ecological and economic importance that inhabit
   coastal waters, where they are very abundant. The objective of the study
   was, through high-frequency temporal sampling, to analyze the diversity,
   seasonal and diel distribution patterns of anchovies and their
   relationships with environmental variables. For 19 months, 24-h monthly
   cycles were carried out, taking samples every two hours. Permutational
   analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used
   for data analysis. Seven species were captured, of which, Anchoa
   mitchilli, Anchoa hepsetus, Anchoa lyolepis, Anchoa lamprotaenia and
   Cetengraulis edentulus are common in brackish waters; however,
   Anchoviella perfasciata and Engraulis eurystole rarely occur in these
   systems. For these species, no major threats are known; therefore, they
   are listed as `Least Concern'. A seasonal succession shows pulses during
   the closed-mouth phase and during the late warm-rainy season. At diel
   level, A. mitchilli, C. edentulus and A. lamprotaenia showed a markedly
   nocturnal pattern. RDA correlations showed that salinity, day/night
   effect, inlet state and rainfall were the most important factors related
   to anchovy distribution. Segregation along a salinity gradient was
   observed, in which A. mitchilli was captured mainly at low salinities,
   while other species occurred mainly at intermediate to high salinities.
   High-frequency sampling allowed a better understanding of the species
   richness and abundance patterns of anchovies in the system.},

   for Amphibians},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The protection of wetlands is a cornerstone in the conservation of
   pond-breeding amphibians. Because protected wetlands are rarely natural
   areas, but are often man-made, at least in Europe, it is important that
   they are well managed to fulfill their intended function. Appropriate
   management requires knowledge of the ecology of the species,
   particularly habitat requirements. Here, we combine species monitoring
   data and habitat mapping data in an analysis where our goal was to
   describe the factors that determine the occupancy of amphibian species
   in federally protected amphibian breeding sites. As expected, every
   species had its own habitat requirements, often a combination of both a
   terrestrial and aquatic habitat (i.e., landscape complementation). In
   most species, occupancy was strongly positively affected with the amount
   of aquatic habitat, but predicted occupancy probabilities were low
   because the amount of aquatic habitat was low in most sites. The area or
   proportion of ruderal vegetation also had positive effects on multiple
   species, while other types of terrestrial habitat (e.g., meadows) led to
   low occupancy probabilities. The total area of the protected breeding
   sites was never included in a final model and connectivity was important
   only for one species (Triturus cristatus). The latter finding implies
   that the quality of the landscape between breeding sizes is more
   important than distance per se, while the former implies that the area
   of some specific habitats within breeding sites is crucial for high
   occupancies. Thus, increasing the amount of aquatic habitats and
   likewise terrestrial habitats within protected areas would make them
   more likely to achieve their conservation objectives. Our study is an
   example of how the joint analysis of monitoring data and habitat data
   (based on mapping in the field) can lead to evidence-based suggestions
   on how to improve conservation practice.},

Abstract = {Studies of dietary preferences of migratory species are of great
   importance as these species connect food webs of habitats across the
   migration route and thus represent trophic relationships between the
   spatially disjointed communities. Here we described the dietary
   preferences of threespine stickleback G. aculeatus in the White Sea
   during the spawning season using stable isotope and stomach content
   analyses. The two analyses suggested that during the spawning season,
   when sticklebacks spend the majority of their time inshore, their diet
   consists mostly of benthic species, while at the beginning of the
   spawning season when fish migrating from the offshore were feeding on
   plankton. Additionally, we demonstrated that stickleback eggs
   contributed greatly to the diet of both male and female fish. Using
   Bayesian mixing modeling, we showed that dietary preferences in females
   were broader than in males, and more variable during the spawning
   season. While guarding their nests, males fed almost exclusively on
   eggs. Both stomach contents and isotope signatures demonstrate that by
   the end of the spawning season sticklebacks again increase the
   consumption of plankton. Isotope analysis proved to be a more reliable
   tool to trace this change than stomach content analysis. Our results
   show that stable isotope and stomach content analyses are complementary
   in understanding seasonal changes in the dietary composition of
   stickleback.},

Abstract = {Traditional knowledge is a favored research area in agrobiodiversity
   conservation at home and abroad, and plays a vital role in the
   sustainable use of ecosystems, livelihood support, and food security. In
   this paper, the WoS Core Collection was used as the data source to
   statistically analyze the literature on the topic of agrobiodiversity
   and traditional knowledge research. The results show the following: (1)
   The number of articles published in agrobiodiversity and traditional
   knowledge research has been increasing annually. (2) The United States
   is the most influential country in this field of research, and other
   leading countries include India, Mexico, Germany, and Italy. (3) The
   existing research is mainly in the field of natural science, and the
   Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine is the most crucial journal in
   terms of the number of articles published. (4) Neither authors nor
   institutional collaboration networks have formed a close transnational
   collaboration network. (5) Popular research in this area includes the
   conservation of local varieties, agricultural landscape changes,
   livelihood support, and agroforestry systems. (6) In addition to the
   ongoing focus on natural ecological aspects of research, future research
   will focus more on cultural and social benefits. Finally, we propose to
   enhance the exploration of quantitative analysis research methods,
   strengthen interdisciplinary research exchanges, expand the breadth of
   disciplinary research, strengthen stakeholder cooperation, and promote
   the construction of relevant policies and regulations.},

Title = {Morphological and Molecular Characterization Using Genitalia and CoxI
   Barcode Sequence Analysis of Afrotropical Mosquitoes with Arbovirus
   Vector Potential},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Potential arboviral Afrotropical mosquito vectors are underrepresented
   in public databases of CoxI barcode sequences. Furthermore, available
   CoxI sequences for many species are often not associated with voucher
   specimens to match the corresponding fine morphological characterization
   of specimens. Hence, this study focused on the characterization of
   Culicine mosquitoes from South Africa, Mozambique, and Angola and their
   classification using a complementary approach including a morphological
   analysis of specimens' genitalia and phylogenetic study based on the
   analysis of CoxI barcode sequences using maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference methods, alongside Median-Joining Network and
   PCOORD analyses. Overall, 800 mosquitoes (652 males and 148 females)
   from 67 species, were analyzed. Genitalia from 663 specimens allowed the
   identification of 55 species of 10 genera. A total of 247 CoxI partial
   gene sequences corresponding to 65 species were obtained, 11 of which
   (Aedes capensis, Ae. mucidus, Culex andersoni, Cx. telesilla, Cx.
   inconspicuosus, Eretmapodites subsimplicipes, Er. quinquevittatus,
   Ficalbia uniformis, Mimomyia hispida, Uranotaenia alboabdominalis, and
   Ur. mashonaensis) are, to the best of our knowledge, provided here for
   the first time. The presence of Cx. pipiens ecotypes molestus and
   pipiens and their hybrids, as well as Cx. infula, is newly reported in
   the Afrotropical region. The rates of correct sequence identification
   using BOLD and BLASTn (>= 95\% identity) were 64\% and 53\%,
   respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that, except for subgenus
   Eumelanomyia of Culex, there was support for tribes Aedini, Culicini,
   Ficalbiini, and Mansoniini. A divergence >2\% was observed in
   conspecific sequences, e.g., Aedeomyia africana, Ae. cumminsii, Ae.
   unilineatus, Ae. metallicus, Ae. furcifer, Ae. caballus, and Mansonia
   uniformis. Conversely, sequences from groups and species complexes,
   namely, Ae. simpsoni, Ae. mcintoshi, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. simpsoni,
   and Cx. pipiens were insufficiently separated. A contribution has been
   made to the barcode library of Afrotropical mosquitoes with associated
   genitalia morphological identifications.},

Title = {A New Combined Index to Assess the Fragmentation Status of a Forest
   Patch Based on Its Size, Shape Complexity, and Isolation},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There are many local fragmentation metrics, but most can be grouped into
   four types (composition/area, isolation, edge, and shape), and none of
   them alone determines the degree of fragmentation of a patch. Here, we
   grouped together the main fragmentation metrics (area, edge, shape, and
   isolation) in order to propose a new metric/index, the Patch
   Fragmentation Index (PFI), with which to determine fragmentation at
   patch scale. The index was subsequently verified with the Ecuadorian
   seasonal dry forest by employing geographic information layers and
   temporal land uses changes in 1990, 2000, 2008, and 2018. The PFI was
   applied to calculate the fragmentation per patch, spatial and temporal
   changes of fragmentation based on PFI were assessed, and the spatial
   patterns (Getis-Ord Gi {*} analysis) were calculated. The Ecuadorian
   seasonal dry forest obtained a mean PFI value of 0.88 (median = 0.99) in
   2018. This value has increased by 8.6\% since 1990, and 3451 patches of
   forest disappeared between 1990 and 2018. The Getis-Ord Gi {*} analysis
   was effective with regard to describing the spatial patterns, and 62\%
   of the patches that were classified as hot patches in 1990 had
   disappeared by 2018. The PFI has proven to be a useful tool with which
   to describe fragmentation patterns at patch scale (regardless of its
   size) and can be extrapolated to other landscapes. The PFI will provide
   a new vision and can help in the decision-making related to the
   conservation and management of fragmented ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Shallow water sponges settled on a raft along the Pong River (Lower
   Mekong Basin, Thailand) were investigated to highlight the taxonomic
   richness, composition, relative abundance and lifestyle of
   sponge-dwelling aquatic Insecta. The three-dimensional biogenic
   structures of the model sponges hosted 4 orders of Insecta, belonging to
   10 families and 19 genera/species, able to strictly coexist at the level
   of the sponges in aquiferous canals and/or at the body surface, and/or
   dwelling in the extracellular matrix. On the basis of the identified 379
   larvae and pupae, Trichoptera and Diptera were found to be the dominant
   inhabitants of Corvospongilla siamensis (Demospongiae: Spongillida),
   endemic to Southeast Asia. In the focused lotic ecosystem, dominated by
   soft bottoms, sponges play a functional role. Insecta use sponges as a
   substratum, nursery ground, food source, and shelter microhabitat,
   protecting them from predation and environmental aggression. Moreover,
   their feeding behavior indicates the insects' adaptive traits to recycle
   sponge siliceous spicules as a source of exogenous material to
   strengthen the larval-pupal cases and the digestive system. The results
   of the Thai sponge model contribute to the inventory of global
   engineering species richness, ecosystem types, and biogeographic
   diversity, thus raising awareness for freshwater biodiversity
   conservation. In this regard, the present data, along with the worldwide
   inventory, focus on sponges as (a) key habitat-forming species for
   aquatic insect assemblages, (b) ecosystem engineers in
   river/lake/wetland ecosystems, providing water purification, the
   processing of organic matter, recycling of nutrients, and
   freshwater-terrestrial coupling, and (c) promising candidates in
   restoration projects of tropical freshwater ecosystems by
   bioremediation.},

Abstract = {Cities are growing rapidly worldwide, with over half of the human
   population living in cities. Amphibians are the most threatened
   vertebrates on our planet and are particularly vulnerable to the effects
   of urbanization. While it is known that landscape features and scales
   are important for amphibians in urban areas, we do not adequately
   understand how the urban landscape affects diversity patterns, nor have
   we identified which spatial scale is most appropriate for evaluating how
   amphibians respond to urban environments. In this study, we examined the
   relationships between anuran abundance/richness and landscape features
   at four spatial scales in Shanghai, China. In order to determine the
   relative importance of landscape variables and the most appropriate
   spatial scale, a multi-model inference approach was used to evaluate and
   compare model weighted mean coefficients. Our results show that large
   spatial scales, i.e., 1500 m and 2000 m, best predicted relative anuran
   abundance and richness, while the total anuran abundance responded most
   strongly to landscape variables at smaller scales, i.e., 500 m and 1000
   m. Patch richness and the interspersion and juxtaposition index play a
   large role in predicting the anuran species' richness and abundance. The
   abundance of P. nigromaculatus, F. multistriata, and B. gargarizans
   increased with patch richness. Species richness and total abundance were
   most strongly related to the interspersion and juxtaposition index. Our
   research highlights the importance of identifying the most suitable
   spatial scale in urban environments because not all anuran respond to
   the same spatial scale. We found that the relationships between anuran
   relative abundance and species and urban habitat features are not
   consistent with the prediction of other landscapes (e.g., farmland,
   forest, and island). Additionally, constructing diverse habitat patches
   and more neighboring habitats may maintain or improve anuran communities
   in urbanizing landscapes.},

Title = {The Role of the Environment in Shaping the Genomic Variation in an
   Insular Wild Boar Population},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Sardinian population of wild boar (WB, Sus scrofa meridionalis) has
   evolved on this Mediterranean island since its arrival in Neolithic age.
   Climate and land use vary across the island; high temperatures and
   dryness represent limiting factors for the development and reproduction
   of the species. Hence, the environment can have contributed to create
   the morphological differences we observe today across the island and
   could sustain the genetic structure that has been previously observed
   using neutral molecular markers. We therefore searched for genomic
   signatures of local adaptation in a sample of Sardinian WB genotyped at
   almost 50 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic structure
   was observed in the population separating the northwest and southwest
   from the east of the island, where internal substructure also emerged.
   We identified 49 SNPs as candidate loci involved in adaptation and 61
   genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed over-representation of
   terms related to cell localization, motility, and adhesion, but also
   related to anatomical development and immunity. According to our
   results, the environment seems to have played a role in shaping the
   genetic differentiation of the Sardinian wild boar in a limited
   evolutionary timescale.},

Abstract = {The Konya Closed Basin (KCB) in Turkiye plays a key role in agricultural
   production and freshwater supply. However, the basin is impacted by
   humanly derived nitrogenous compounds and toxic metals. Keeping the
   water quality at a potable level in the basin is compulsory. This study
   was part of a project yielding monitoring of water quality in KCB in
   accordance with the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Eleven
   stations, except Beysehir Lake and Mamasin Dam, were sampled for the
   first time for freshwater molluscs. Community structure indexes and
   multivariate statistical analyses were applied to determine the
   microhabitats of gastropods and their responses to environmental
   changes. The structure and distribution of gastropod assemblages
   differed depending on total phosphate, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen,
   and pH. This study revealed that most of the gastropods in KCB are
   relatively tolerant to biodegradable pollution. However, there is a
   strong observed decline in population size requiring intensive future
   monitoring; measures have to be taken to preserve the remaining
   populations. Two endemic species need an urgent action plan to protect
   their habitats: Theodoxus anatolicus of celtik Canal and Bithynia
   pseudemmericia of Beysehir Lake; a re-assessment of their extinction
   risk according to the IUCN rules is needed (2022). The results of this
   study will be useful for comparison with future studies to document
   potential improvements or continued ecological regression in the quality
   of aquatic ecosystems in the watershed.},

Title = {Phylogenetic Analysis and Toxigenic Profile of Alternaria Species
   Isolated from Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) in Argentina},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chickpeas are a very important legume due to their nutritional richness
   and high protein content and they are used as food for humans and as
   fodder for livestock. However, they are susceptible to fungal infections
   and mycotoxin contamination. The Alternaria genus was among the main
   fungi isolated from chickpea samples in Argentina. The species within
   this genus are able to produce several mycotoxins such as alternariol
   (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), and tenuazonic acid (TA). So,
   the objectives of this study were to identify the Alternaria spp. found
   in the chickpea samples and to determine their toxigenic potential in
   vitro. A phylogenetic analysis of 32 Alternaria strains was carried out
   based on the combined sequences of the tef1, gpd, and Alt a1 genes. All
   Alternaria strains clustered into the section Alternaria and were
   identified as A. alternata and A. arborescens. Further, the toxigenic
   profile of each strain was determined in a ground rice-corn steep liquor
   medium and analysed by HPLC. Most strains were able to co-produce AOH,
   AME, and TA. These results indicate a potential risk for human health
   when consuming chickpeas since this legume could be contaminated with
   Alternaria and its mycotoxins, which are not yet regulated in food.},

Title = {Characterization of Captive Breeders to Preserve the Residual Genetic
   Diversity of Adriatic Sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since 1996, the Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii) has been
   inscribed on the IUCN Red List as ``Critically Endangered and possibly
   extinct in the wild{''}. Nowadays, its survival totally depends on
   restocking programs conducted by releasing juveniles generated from
   adult breeders reared in aquaculture. Conducting accurate genetic
   characterizations of all individuals potentially involved in
   reproduction activities is therefore of primary importance to avoid
   inbreeding and to maximize the genetic diversity transmitted to
   following generations. Since all animals reared in captivity descend
   from a single stock of wild origin, this offers the ideal condition for
   carrying out relatedness analysis based on parentage allocations. In
   this study, we provided the most complete characterization of about 500
   individuals representing the most diverse extant stock of Adriatic
   sturgeon. Through the analyses of mitochondrial d-loop and 15
   microsatellite loci selected from 24 genotyped loci, we identified about
   30 different familiar groups, updating data on breeding stocks,
   increasing the genetic information already available, and extending the
   analyses to animals never genotyped before. Given its completeness, it
   will represent a reference database for any future parental allocation
   of recaptured animals for the inclusion of all other stocks present, as
   well as for the development of a long-term breeding plan. The approach
   used has also been proven useful on individuals of unknown genealogy,
   allowing for the identification of family groups and thus being proven
   to be promising for the analysis of stocks of other tetraploid sturgeon
   species.},

   Integrative Taxonomic Approach},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The diversity of red algae is significantly increasing; in the recent
   interest of climate changes, taxonomic and biogeographic studies are
   needed in untouched regions such as ecological important islands. We
   examined a collection of Gelidium specimens gathered during the 2010
   Atimo Vatae expedition based on the morphology and DNA sequencing of
   mitochondrial cox1 and plastid rbcL. Both morphological and molecular
   datasets demonstrated the presence of three species in Madagascar; G.
   leptum G.H.Boo, L.Le Gall and H.S.Yoon, sp. nov., described here, and G.
   sclerophyllum W.R.Taylor and G. usmanghanii Afaq-Husain and Shameel.
   Gelidium leptum is distinguished by thin, slender, flattened thalli with
   irregular branches, compactly arranged thick-walled cells in medulla,
   sparse rhizoidal filaments at both sides of branches, and elongate sori
   of tetrasporangia. Gelidium sclerophyllum, previously considered as
   endemic to the Tropical Eastern Pacific, is first reported in the Indian
   Ocean and Hawai'i; G. usmanghanii, previously reported to occur in
   Pakistan and Oman, also presents a first record in the Southern
   Hemisphere. Phylogenies inferred from cox1 and rbcL sequences suggests
   that each of the three species likely diverged from different ancestors.
   The Madagascan Gelidium comprises two geographical elements; Madagascan
   endemic (G. leptum) and widespread species (G. sclerophyllum and G.
   usmanghanii).},

Abstract = {Resource utilization strategies of avian migrants are a major concern
   for conservation and management. Understanding seasonal habitat
   selection by migratory birds helps us explain the ongoing continental
   declines of migratory bird populations. Our objective was to compare the
   second-order and third-order habitat selection by the American White
   Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos; hereafter pelican) between the
   breeding and non-breeding grounds. We tested the Lack hypothesis that
   habitat selection by migratory birds is stronger on the breeding grounds
   than on the non-breeding grounds. We used random-effect
   Dirichlet-multinomial models to estimate the second-order habitat
   selection between the seasons with the GPS locations of 32 tracked
   pelicans. We used Gaussian Markov random field models to estimate the
   third-order habitat selection by pelicans at the breeding and
   non-breeding grounds, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Pelicans
   strongly selected waterbodies and wetlands at both non-breeding and
   breeding grounds, tracking their foraging habitats between the seasons
   at the home range level. However, pelicans exhibited seasonal
   differences in the strength of the third-order selection of wetlands and
   waterbodies with foraging habitat selection being stronger at the
   breeding grounds than at the non-breeding grounds, supporting the Lack
   hypothesis.},

Title = {The Long and Winding Road of Coral Reef Recovery in the Anthropocene: A
   Case Study from Puerto Rico},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The persistence and resilience of marginal shallow coral reefs at their
   limits of environmental tolerance have declined due to chronic
   environmental degradation and climate change. However, the consequences
   for the natural recovery ability of reefs of disturbance remain poorly
   understood. This study considered the potential for natural recovery
   through coral recruitment on fringing reefs across different geographic
   regions under contrasting environmental conditions in Puerto Rico. Reefs
   in areas with significant water quality degradation and more severe
   physical impacts of hurricanes were expected to have lower coral recruit
   density and diversity, and therefore less potential for recovery.
   Sixteen reefs were assessed across three geographic regions. Degraded
   reefs sustained a lower percentage of live coral cover and had higher
   macroalgae and turf algae abundance. Locations affected by high PO4,
   NH3+ and optical brightness concentrations, high turbidity, and high sea
   surface temperature anomalies, chlorophyll-a concentration and light
   attenuation Kd(490) evidenced significantly lower coral recruit density
   and diversity. Hurricane-decimated reefs also exhibited impoverished
   coral recruit assemblages. Low coral recruitment could have important
   long-term implications under projected climate change and sea level
   rise, particularly in coastal urban habitats. There is a need to
   implement effective environmental conservation, ecological restoration
   and community participation strategies that facilitate enhanced coral
   recruitment success and assisted recovery processes.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has a special geological history, diverse
   habitats, a complex climate, and a large number of wetlands, which
   harbor a huge of wetland plants. In this study, we sorted out the
   monographs, literatures and online databases, as well as our own
   collection from field surveys, and comprehensively combed the checklist
   and county-level diversity of wetland angiosperms and endangered species
   in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for the first time. The distribution
   pattern of species richness was analyzed through three groups of
   environmental variables: energy, water, and habitat. The wetland
   angiosperms have high richness, with a total of 2329 species, belonging
   to 91 families and 438 genera, mainly hygrophytes (94.98\%). The spatial
   distribution is uneven, and gradually decreases from the southeast to
   the northwest of the plateau. Species richness decreased with elevation
   and latitude and increased with longitude. Annual precipitation (AP) and
   annual mean temperature (AMT) are the most important variables affecting
   species diversity. Habitat environmental variables had less influence on
   species richness distribution and wetland area was not associated with
   richness distribution. The setting of endangered wetland angiosperm
   reserves needs to focus on the Hengduan Mountains and southeastern
   Tibet. Our study provided basic data for the research and protection of
   wetland plant diversity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

Title = {Sandaracinobacteroides saxicola sp. nov., a Zeaxanthin-Producing and

   and the Diversity of Its ARHDs},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {A yellow, Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile, and
   rod-shaped bacterial strain designated M6(T) was isolated from fully
   weathered granitic soil. The strain showing the highest 16S rRNA gene
   sequence similarity to M6(T) was Sandaracinobacteroides hominis SZY
   PN-1(T) (96.3\%), the only species in the genus Sandaracinobacteroides.
   The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization value
   between these two strains were 72.6\% and 18.0\% respectively. Growth
   was inhibited by NaCl (>= 0.1\% (w/v)). Strain M6(T) contained C-18:1
   omega 7c (33.8\%), C-14:0 2-OH (16.6\%), summed feature 3 (15.8\%), and
   C-16:0 (12.6\%) as the major fatty acids. The polar lipids profile
   consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an
   unidentified glycolipid, four unidentified phospholipids, and four
   unidentified lipids. The genome of strain M6(T) was 3.4 Mb with 67.7\%
   GC content. Further genomic analysis revealed a biosynthetic gene
   cluster for zeaxanthin, the production of which was verified by a
   high-resolution mass spectrum. The existence of multiple genes for
   aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases implies the potential ability
   for organic pollution controlling. The morphological, physiological,
   chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic analysis clearly distinguished this
   strain from its phylogenetic neighbors, thus strain M6(T) represents a
   novel species of the genus Sandaracinobacteroides, for which the name
   Sandaracinobacteroides saxicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type of strain
   is M6(T) (=CGMCC 1.19164(T)=NBRC 115420(T)).},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {During the austral winter of 2017, a bloom of Prorocentrum spp.
   occurred, reaching a cell density of 2.73 x 10(6) cells L-1, in Paracas
   Bay, Peru. In order to identify which, type of species generated this
   event and determine its toxicity, the values of the environmental
   parameters (temperature, winds and salinity) that induced the rapid
   growth of the dinoflagellate in this bloom were identified. A clonal
   culture was established for taxonomic (SEM), phylogenetic (ITS) and
   toxicological analysis via LC-MS/MS to determine the presence of
   tetrodotoxin (TTX) and whether the species represents a food safety
   hazard. This event coincided with the coastal upwelling process, which
   generated high concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (>10 mg m(-3)
   chlorophyll-a) and allowed the rapid growth of P. cordatum (IMP-BG 450)
   in Paracas Bay. However, toxicological analyses of the IMP-BG 450 strain
   culture did not show the presence of TTX quantifiable through the
   technique used. Due to the antecedents of the presence of TTX in
   mollusks from other latitudes during blooms of this species, it is
   recommended that analyses of this toxin be carried out both in
   filter-feeding mollusks and in this species during a new bloom.},

Abstract = {In the context of biodiversity crisis, targeted efforts are required to
   accelerate the discovery and description of the still-unknown species.
   In the present study, we collected data on current knowledge of plant
   richness in South Africa and used a statistical modeling technique to
   predict what might still be missing in the country. We found that we
   might be missing 1400-1575 plant species, and it might take 40-45 years
   to identify and describe these species aided by 64-315 taxonomists.
   Surveyed taxonomists spent USD 95,559, on average, to describe one
   species. At this rate, USD 150,506,142 would be required to describe the
   1575 species (modeling) or USD 133,783,237 for the 1400 remaining
   species (expert opinion). However, these estimates do not correspond to
   what is specifically required for only species description but does
   integrate connected activities, e.g., running cost, bursary, salaries,
   grants, etc. Furthermore, these estimates do not account for the
   possibility of taxonomic revision, which, on its own, needs to be
   funded, nor do they account for molecular laboratory requirement.
   Nevertheless, if we consider that 15\% of the predicted funds are solely
   spent on taxonomic activities, we would need similar to USD 14,334 on
   one species. Overall, our study provides figures that can inform
   attempts to fuel efforts toward a comprehensive assessment of the unique
   South Africa's biodiversity.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Two new species of the genus Scottolana Huys, 2009, were collected from
   Korean waters. S. daecheonensis sp. nov. is morphologically similar to
   S. jasani Song, Kangtia, Khim, and Chullasorn, 2018, from the Yellow
   Sea, Korea, and S. gomezi Nazari, Mirshamsi, Sari, Aliabadian, and
   Martinez Arbizu, 2018, from Bandar Abbas, Iran. However, it can clearly
   be distinguished from its congeners by rostrum with two tiny lateral
   sensilla, 4-segemented antennule in female, and 5-segmented antennule in
   male, 3-segmented mandibular exopod, P3 basis with an inner spinous
   process on the posterior surface, P3 endopod-3 without a modified
   tube-pore along the inner margin in male, P4 endopod-2 crumpled inner
   margin with strong spinules in male, P5 second outermost seta naked,
   caudal rami with an unguiform extension on the inner margins, and caudal
   seta V with a normal base in female. S. wonchoeli sp. nov. is similar to
   S. geei Mu and Huys, 2004 from the Bohai Sea, and S. longipes (Thompson
   I.C. and Scott A., 1903) sensu Wells and Rao (1987) from the Andaman
   Islands, but it can clearly be distinguished from its congeners by a
   combination of the following features: rostrum with a broadly rounded
   apex, 3-segemented antennule in female and 5-segmented in male,
   antennary exopod 8-segmented, female genital field relatively small,
   extending about one-third of genital double-somite, genital somite with
   paired lateral spinous processes in male, P6 with a long proximal
   element in male, and maxillular endopod with 11 setae in total. In a
   molecular analysis using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit
   I (COI) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) genes, the interspecific
   distance was 20.031\% for COI and 3.214\% for 18S rRNA between the two
   new species. A key for the identification of the species of Scottolana
   is included.},

Title = {Ice Cod Arctogadus glacialis (Peters, 1874) in Northeast Greenland-A
   First Sketch of Spatial Occurrence and Abundance},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Based on bottom trawl catches during the years 2002-2017, we present the
   first large-scale baseline on the spatial distribution and abundance of
   ice cod Arctogadus glacialis (Peters, 1874) in the fjords and on the
   shelf in Northeast Greenland (latitudes 70 degrees N-78 degrees N). Ice
   cod abundance peaked in the secluded sill fjords such as Bessel Fjord,
   Brede Fjord, Clavering o fjord system and Kong Oscar Fjord as compared
   to the offshore shelf. The mean biomass was estimated as 3.9 kg/km(2) on
   the shelf and 49.3 kg/km(2) in the fjords. Nearly 45\% of the biomass
   was restricted to temperatures < -1.0 degrees C and almost 90 \% of the
   biomass occurred within 200-600 m depth. This corresponds well with the
   deep, subzero fjords along the Northeast Greenland coast which, thus,
   appear the most suitable habitat for ice cod. Moreover, there was a
   gradual decrease in ice cod biomass on the shelf over the years
   2002-2017. This apparent relocation of ice cod matches the ongoing
   warming of the Northeast Greenland shelf waters. Given that the overall
   temperature space of ice cod spans less than 4 oC in Northeast
   Greenland, it is likely that the species is particularly vulnerable to
   climate change as warmer waters before long enter the fjords, i.e., the
   main habitat for ice cod.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Seamounts are globally important and essential ecosystems for supporting
   and maintaining marine biodiversity. In the Mallorca Channel, three
   prominent seamounts are present: Ausias March, Ses Olives and Emile
   Baudot. Currently, this area is being evaluated for inclusion in the
   Natura 2000 network. For this objective three surveys were conducted in
   the seamounts of the Mallorca Channel during July 2018 and July 2020.
   Samples of macro-invertebrates obtained in the deep sea revealed a rich
   fauna of Mollusca (68 species belonging to 40 families). New Mollusca
   occurrences included: four species of Gastropoda: Colus jeffreysianus,
   Cantrainea peloritana, Fusiturris similis, Gymnobela abyssorum, and
   seven species of Bivalvia: Pododesmus squama, Allogramma formosa,
   Asperarca nodulosa, Cetomya neaeroides, Spondylus gussonii, Haliris
   granulata and Policordia gemma. Where possible, the identification of
   these species was confirmed using the DNA barcoding method (sequencing
   of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I). This study contributes towards
   filling the gap in knowledge of deep-sea mollusc fauna of the
   north-western Mediterranean.},

   System in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau},

Abstract = {Prediction of species' potentially suitable distribution areas and their
   range shifts under future climate change has long been the focus of
   macroecology and biogeography. Gymnocypris chilianensis of
   Schizothoracinae and Triplophysa hsutschouensis of Triplophysa are
   isolated to the Shiyang, Heihe, and Shule Rivers of the Hexi River
   system, listed from east to west, along the northeastern part of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). This spatial distribution provides a
   valuable set of conditions for investigating patterns of habitat
   suitability and potential impacts of accelerated plateau climate change
   on endemic plateau fish species. Here, we employed the maximum entropy
   (MaxEnt) model to first evaluate potentially suitable habitats of the
   two species and identify the primary impact factors under the current
   climate based on occurrence records and environmental variables; then,
   we predicted changes in suitable habitat areas and distribution centers
   under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 2.6 and 8.5, for
   the future (2050 and 2070). The results showed that annual precipitation
   and altitude were the two most important environmental factors
   predicting the suitable habitat of G. chilianensis and T.
   hsutschouensis. The areas of suitable habitat for G. chilianensis and T.
   hsutschouensis experienced a sequential westward decrease from the
   Shiyang River towards the Heihe and Shule Rivers under the current
   climate conditions. Under future climate changes, the areas of the
   potential geographical distribution of G. chilianensis and T.
   hsutschouensis were concentrated eastward towards the Shiyang River, the
   area of the species' ancestral origins. Suitable habitat centers of the
   two species shifted eastward from the Heihe River to the Shiyang River
   and higher altitude areas. Additionally, G. chilianensis showed a
   greater reduction in suitable habitat and greater eastward range shift
   compared to T. hsutschouensis. These findings provide empirical evidence
   that accelerated climate change on the QTP has severe consequences for
   endemic populations with restricted and isolated habitats. This study
   demonstrates that different plateau fish have similarities and
   differences in their responses to climate change. Our findings also
   highlight that the effects of climate change must be incorporated into
   the integrated conservation plans for fish species on the QTP and its
   adjacent areas.},

   Freshwater biota and terrestrial biota do not respond in the same way to
   environmental variables. The Ibera Depression, one of the largest
   wetlands in South America, is recognized in many schemes either as a
   functional unit or as an area with an ecotonal character. We used the
   distributional data of 128 species of Odonata, from a total of 103
   collection sites from Corrientes and Misiones provinces, to test if
   Ibera functions as an ecological and functional unit, based on the
   Odonata distribution patterns. In addition, we tested if their
   distribution patterns fit into the most widespread regionalization
   schemes (hydrological basins, biogeographical provinces and ecoregions)
   used in Argentina. The Ibera Depression was not recovered as a
   functional unit; its sub-basins are more related to external basins than
   to each other. Neither the ecoregion nor the biogeographical schemes are
   suitable to explain the distribution patterns of the Odonata. The
   Odonata seem to respond to the availability of particular wetlands
   (e.g., ponds, streams, rivers, swamps, etc.), or to specific physical
   characteristics, such as the type of sediment, the availability of
   oxygen, etc., instead of to biogeographical or ecoregional schemes.},

Title = {BetaBayes-A Bayesian Approach for Comparing Ecological Communities},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecological communities change because of both natural and human factors.
   Distinguishing between the two is critical to ecology and conservation
   science. One of the most common approaches for modelling species
   composition changes is calculating beta diversity indices and then
   relating index changes to environmental changes. The main difficulty
   with these analyses is that beta diversity indices are paired
   comparisons, which means indices calculated with the same community are
   not independent. Mantel tests and generalised dissimilarity modelling
   (GDM) are two of the most commonly used statistical procedures for
   analysing such data, employing randomisation tests to consider the
   data's dependence. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model-based approach
   called BetaBayes that explicitly incorporates the data dependence. This
   approach is based on the Bradley-Terry model, which is a widely used
   approach for modelling paired comparisons that involves building a
   standard regression model containing two varying intercepts, one for
   each community involved in the beta diversity index, that capture their
   respective contributions. We used BetaBayes to analyse a famous dataset
   collected in Panama that contains information on multiple 1 ha plots
   from the rain forests of Panama. We calculated the Bray-Curtis index
   between all pairs of plots, analysed the relationship between the index
   and two covariates (geographic distance and elevation), and compared the
   results of BetaBayes with those from the Mantel test and GDM. BetaBayes
   has two distinctive features. The first is its flexibility, which allows
   the user to quickly change it to fit the data structure; namely, by
   adding varying effects, incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and
   modelling complex nonlinear relationships. The second is that it
   provides a clear path for performing model validation and model
   improvement. BetaBayes avoids hypothesis testing, instead focusing on
   recreating the data generating process and quantifying all the model
   configurations that are consistent with the observed data.},

Abstract = {We compared two sampling methods, eDNA metabarcoding and microscope
   identification (MSI), for the analysis of zooplankton diversity in
   reservoirs with its inflow and outflow streams. The dynamic patterns of
   Cladocera and Rotifera at different time points were similar between the
   two sampling methods, but there was a slight difference in the Copepoda.
   Specifically, the members of the Copepoda subclass could not be easily
   classified using the MSI method, whereas eDNA metabarcoding could detect
   minor taxa of Cladocera and Rotifera. Upon comparing the list of
   zooplankton communities in Korea with the gene database of NCBI, only
   -56\% of the zooplankton genera reported in Korea could be detected
   based on the 18S rRNA gene. However, eDNA metabarcoding detected a more
   diverse range of zooplankton despite the lack of genetic information. As
   water temperature increased after May, the zooplankton diversity
   decreased according to the MSI method but increased according to the
   eDNA metabarcoding method. Although eDNA metabarcoding has some
   limitations, it was able to detect a wider diversity of zooplankton
   compared to the MSI. eDNA metabarcoding provides a more reliable means
   to identify zooplankton.},

Abstract = {During a survey of aquatic fungi from Anzali Lagoon in Iran, several
   fungal specimens were isolated from freshwater habitats. Morphological
   evidence and comparing sequencing based on rDNA (ITS and LSU) and
   protein-coding genes (TEF1 and TUB2) showed that some isolates belong to
   undescribed fungal species. These isolates belong to Arthrobotrys and
   Sarocladium, two ascomycetes genera. Arthrobotrys hyrcanus, sp. nov.,
   differs from closely related species such as A. dianchiensis by its
   larger conidia and septation of primary conidia. Sarocladium
   pseudokiliense, sp. nov., was similar to S. kiliense, but distinguished
   by its conidial shape and the absence of adelophialides and
   chlamydospores. Morphological descriptions, illustrations and multilocus
   phylogenetic analysis for both new species are provided.},

Title = {The Paradox of Shorebird Diversity and Abundance in the West Coast and
   East Coast of India: A Comparative Analysis},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Migratory shorebirds that move across continents along their flyways are
   undergoing a drastic decline globally. A greater proportion of them that
   regularly winter along the Indian coasts within the Central Asian Flyway
   (CAF) are also undergoing severe declines. However, the mechanisms
   underlying the population trends in these areas remain little
   understood. This study investigated the diversity, abundance, population
   dynamics and distribution patterns of shorebirds along the Indian coasts
   based on the available literature. The west coast of India is relatively
   less studied than the east coast in the CAF. Further, we observed that
   the diversity, abundance, population dynamics and distribution pattern
   of the shorebirds follow different trends on the west coast compared to
   the east coast. These variations are in accordance with the differences
   in topography and biotic and abiotic factors between the coasts.
   Anthropogenic activities have far-reaching effects on the survival and
   persistence of shorebirds along the coasts. The west coast is evidently
   more productive than the east coast at every trophic level and thus the
   west coast is expected to account for more abundance and diversity of
   shorebirds. Paradoxically, we found that the east coast supports a
   greater abundance and diversity of shorebirds than the west coast. The
   west coast, therefore, requires further investigations to obtain a
   better understanding of the causes of apparent differences in abundance
   and diversity as well as the observed declines in shorebirds, compared
   to the east coast of India.},

Title = {Circular Bedforms Due to Pit Foraging of Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus

Abstract = {The Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus is known as an ecosystem
   engineer, rearranging sediment in peculiar bedforms as a consequence of
   its filter-feeding behaviour. In recent decades, the populations of the
   Greater Flamingo have notably increased, and now the species is one of
   the most abundant waterbirds in Mediterranean wetlands. Owing to its
   range expansion, it inhabits and exploits new and suitable foraging
   sites detectable by foraging structures left on the sediment. There are
   few images of the foraging morphologies in the literature, possibly due
   to their ephemeral nature and difficulty in detecting them. In this
   manuscript, we present a very detailed UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)
   image of an aggregate of pit foraging structures of Greater Flamingo
   discovered on a back-barrier washover fan in the Marano and Grado Lagoon
   (Northern Adriatic, Italy).},

Title = {Revisiting the Genetic, Taxonomic and Evolutionary Aspects of Chagas
   Disease Vectors of the Triatoma phyllosoma Subcomplex (Hemiptera,

Abstract = {Triatoma bassolsae, T. longipennis, T. mazzottii, T. pallidipennis, T.
   phyllosoma and T. picturata are species that have great epidemiological
   importance in the transmission of Chagas disease in Mexico. However,
   there is no consensus regarding the specific status of these species,
   since they appear in various articles as species, subspecies and even
   subgenera. Thus, we revisited genetic, taxonomic and evolutionary data
   that allowed us to assess and discuss the specific status of these six
   species of the T. phyllosoma subcomplex. Phylogenetic studies were
   performed with nuclear (18S, 28S, ITS-2) and mitochondrial (16S, cytb,
   COI, COII, 12S) markers deposited in GenBank. In addition, data from
   experimental crosses were pooled and the genetic distance to the cytb
   gene was calculated. The phylogenetic reconstruction enabled us to
   rescue the six species as independent lineages. Post-zygotic
   reproductive isolation barriers (sterility and/or hybrid collapse) were
   observed for some experimental crosses. Although the other experimental
   crosses did not allow us to characterize reproductive barriers, these
   species showed high genetic distances in relation to the cytb gene
   (ranging from 4.6\% to 14.9\%). Thus, based on the revisited literature
   data, we confirmed the specific status of these six species of the T.
   phyllosoma subcomplex based on the phylogenetic and biological concepts
   of the species.},

Title = {Is the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus Funneliformis mosseae a Suitable
   Agent to Control Criconematid Populations?},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Several studies have shown the potential of using mycorrhizal fungi in
   increasing the plant yield by simultaneously reducing damages caused by
   pathogens. Plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are among the most feared
   pathogens for crops. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of
   Funneliformis mosseae as a mycorrhizal fungus on the population
   abundance of three world widespread species of nematodes from the family
   Criconematidae: Mesocriconema xenoplax, Mesocriconema antipolitanum, and
   Criconemides informis. Pure and highly abundant populations of each
   species were collected from Urmia city in Northwestern Iran, after the
   identification morphological and morphometric characteristics. The
   experiments were carried out in greenhouse conditions on three different
   rhizospheres of alfalfa, sugar beet, and wheat. After five months, the
   final population of nematodes and fungus, and the root surface on host
   plants inoculated and non-inoculated with the fungus F. mosseae, were
   evaluated. The results showed that the population of nematodes was
   increased in the presence of the fungus. It could be assumed that the
   extension of the host surface level of roots by the fungus resulted in
   more feeding sites for nematode activity and, consequently, higher
   population densities. In this study, the fungus did not seem to play a
   suitable role in controlling ectoparasitic nematode growth. However,
   since there are still many open questions about mycorrhizal fungi's role
   in agriculture, more research should be conducted.},

Abstract = {Taxonomic studies of bambusicolous fungi in China and Thailand have
   resulted in the collection of three fascinating saprobic coelomycetes
   strains. Morphology coupled with combined gene analysis of ITS, LSU,
   TUB2, and TEF1-alpha DNA sequence data showed that they belong to the
   genus Apiospora, family Apiosporaceae. A new species from Thailand,
   Apiospora mukdahanensis, and new records of A. locuta-pollinis from
   China are herein described. In addition, based on both morphological
   data coupled with phylogenetics and nomenclatural analyses, A. mori is
   proposed as a new combination. Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and
   Bayesian analyses were performed to clarify the phylogenetic affinities
   of the species obtained in this study. Newly obtained strains are
   compared with morphologically- and phylogenetically-related taxa. The
   comprehensive descriptions, illustrations, and updated phylogeny are
   provided and discussed for intra-and intergeneric relationships within
   Apiospora species.},

Title = {Comparative Plastome Analyses of Ephedra przewalskii and E. monosperma
   (Ephedraceae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ephedra species were erect, branching shrubs found in desert or arid
   regions worldwide as the source of ephedrine alkaloids. In this study,
   the complete chloroplast genome of Ephedra przewalskii and E. monosperma
   on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were sequenced, assembled, and annotated.
   Compared with the other four published Ephedra species, the chloroplast
   genomes of Ephedra species were highly conservative, with a
   quadripartite structure. The length of the chloroplast genome was
   109,569 bp in E. przewalskii with 36.6\% GC and 109,604 bp in E.
   monosperma with 36.6\% GC. We detected 118 genes in both Ephedra
   species, including 73 PCGs, 37 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. Among
   them, the ndh family genes were lost, which could be used to study the
   phylogeny and genetic diversity of the genus Ephedra, combined with
   multiple highly variable intergenic spacer (IGS) regions. Codon usage
   preference of Ephedra species was weak. The ratio of non-synonymous
   substitutions and synonymous substitutions was low, showing that the
   PCGs of Ephedra may be under the pressure of purifying selection. ML and
   BI analysis showed similar phylogenetic topologies. Ephedra species
   clustered together in a well-supported monophyletic clade. E.
   przewalskii and E. monosperma were not gathered in one clade, consistent
   with the classification system by Flora of China. This study reveals
   differences in the chloroplast genomes of Ephedra, providing valuable
   and abundant data for the phylogenetic analysis and species
   identification of Ephedra.},

Title = {The Impact of the Honeybee Apis mellifera on the Organization of
   Pollination Networks Is Positively Related with Its Interactive Role
   throughout Its Geographic Range},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Studies at local spatial scales have shown that the generalist honeybee
   Apis mellifera L. can strongly affect the structural organization and
   properties of pollination networks. However, there is still little
   knowledge on how the connectivity of the honeybee within networks (i.e.,
   interactive role) could affect pollination networks at a global scale.
   To fill this gap, we evaluated how the interactive role of A. mellifera
   could affect niche overlap, specialization, and robustness of
   pollination networks. We used 109 weighted pollination networks spread
   across about 94 degrees of latitude and 227 degrees of longitude. We
   developed a new standardized framework based on species removal to
   assess the impact of the honeybee on plant-pollinator networks. We found
   that when the honeybee was removed from the networks, plant species had
   less niche overlap (i.e., shared fewer interactions via their
   pollinators) and the networks became more specialized and more robust to
   species extinctions. Our findings indicate that A. mellifera's effects
   on pollination networks vary geographically and could influence several
   ecological and evolutionary factors acting at local scales, including
   pollination services. We hope this contribution will stimulate new
   macroecological studies involving abundant and generalist species and
   their functional roles within ecological communities.},

Title = {Effect of Polytomy on the Parameter Estimation and Goodness of Fit of
   Phylogenetic Linear Regression Models for Trait Evolution},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic regression models for trait evolution incorporate
   phylogenetic trees for the analysis of comparative data, in order to
   study trait relationships among a group of related species. However, as
   such trees are estimated, it is unlikely that there will be no errors
   when describing the relationships among species. In particular, for
   polytomy trees, where the relationships within a particular clade of
   species are more/less certainly determined (hard/soft polytomy,
   respectively), results of comparative analyses obtained from models
   based on those phylogenetic trees may also be affected. In this study,
   through extensive simulations, the performances of several popular
   Gaussian process-based regression models (Brownian motion, BM;
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, OU; early burst, EB), as well as
   branch-stretching models (Pagel's lambda, delta, kappa), were evaluated
   by assessing their fit and parameter estimation performance when soft
   polytomies are presented on either the root or a clade with insufficient
   phylogenetic information. Comparisons of the models are conducted by
   either assessing the accuracy of the estimator of regression and model
   parameters, or using a measure of fit (AIC, r(2), and mean square
   error). It is found that, although polytomy does not significantly
   impact the fit and parameter estimate within a specified model,
   distinguishable differences and effects may be observed among trees and
   models. In particular, Pagel lambda model and the OU model yield more
   accurate estimates and provide better fitting effects than the other
   models (BM, EB, delta, kappa). While correcting phylogeny is an
   essential step prior to analysis, users may also consider using more
   appropriate models when encountering the polytomy issue.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Marine macroalgae are foundation species that play a critical ecological
   role in coastal communities as primary producers. The macroalgal genus
   Ulva is vital in intertidal communities, serving as a food source and
   shelter for organisms, but these species also form environment-damaging
   nuisance blooms. This project aimed to demonstrate the utility of DNA
   barcoding for determining the diversity of Ulva species in the San Juan
   Islands (Washington, DC, USA). Blade-form Ulva (Ulvophyceae) specimens
   were collected from the lower, mid, and upper intertidal zones at three
   sites experiencing different levels of wave exposure. Sequences of
   plastid-encoded tufA were generated for each specimen and cluster
   analyses revealed the presence of four species at the collection sites.
   Two species were positively identified as Ulva expansa and Ulva
   fenestrata based on their sharing identical tufA sequences with those of
   the holotype specimens. Sequences of plastid-encoded rbcL and the
   nuclear-encoded ribosomal ITS regions of representative specimens were
   used to identify the other two species as Ulva prolifera and Ulva
   californica based on their similarity to epitype and topotype specimen
   sequences, respectively. Additional types of specimen sequencing efforts
   are needed to increase the number of Ulva species that can be accurately
   identified and realize their true biodiversity.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The collection and conservation of chickpea and lentil germplasm has
   great importance due to their role as a staple food for millions of
   people. Nowadays, the largest chickpea collection, 41.2\% of the total
   accessions, is held by ICRISAT, while the main lentil collection is
   stored by ICARDA. The main fraction of both collections is constituted
   by Indian landraces. In recent decades, several efforts have been made
   to integrate all genebanks into a global conservation system of plant
   genetic resources. The release of informatics platforms allowed the
   creation of virtual genebanks, which are powerful tools routinely
   consulted by germplasm users. The information available for the chickpea
   and lentil accessions included in the Genesys and EURISCO platforms has
   been taken into consideration in this mini review. This review also
   presents and discusses the strengths and drawbacks of the worldwide
   collections of both species emerging from the analysis of data obtained
   by enquiring these two platforms. The availability of core collections
   is of great utility for germplasm users, while the lack of origin and
   biological status for a significant fraction of accessions are the main
   drawbacks. Moreover, this review highlights the necessity of sharing as
   much as possible of the non-omic and omic characterization data.},

Title = {Considering the Geographic Diversity of Natural Enemy Traits in
   Biological Control: A Quantitative Approach Using Orius Predators as an
   Example},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The desirable characteristics of effective natural enemies and the
   causes for failure of biological control efforts have been discussed
   extensively in the literature, yet predicting which collection site may
   yield efficient natural enemies remains a challenge. Insect
   characteristics, such as morphology, physiology, life history and
   behavior, often vary across geographic cline and location. These
   variations may reflect phenotypic plasticity across environments, or
   genetically based local (demic) adaptation. Parameters such as body
   size, photoperiod response, thermal tolerance and genetic diversity may
   greatly influence the outcome of biological control efforts. Therefore,
   geographic variation in such characteristics may be used to optimize the
   collection site of efficient enemies to be employed in biological
   control programs. The first step towards this goal is compilation of
   data on the trait diversity of promising natural enemies across their
   geographic distribution range. For example, we used published
   information to compile a database on the geographic distribution of
   various traits of 92 Orius species (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), a genus
   known for its potential contribution to biological control in IPM
   systems. We discuss how the widespread distribution of this genus in
   different ecozones should enable the collection of species and
   populations that differ in various geographically dependent traits
   relevant to biological control. Finally, we suggest a quantitative
   method to optimize collection efforts of natural enemies. This approach
   balances the effects of several natural enemy traits that vary
   geographically. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of this method by
   evaluating the potential employment of two geographically distinct
   populations of O. albidipennis.},

Abstract = {Revisionary taxonomic studies of bees from the Old World Mediterranean
   basin are hindered both by the apparent absence of type material for
   many taxa and a lack of genetic resources. The discovery of important
   type materials in combination with the generation of novel DNA barcodes
   (Cytochrome Oxidase I) has allowed cryptic diversity within the
   widespread taxa Nomiapis bispinosa (Brulle, 1832) and Systropha
   planidens Giraud, 1861 to be clarified. Nomiapis bispinosa actually
   consists of three distinct taxa: Nomiapis bispinosa s. str. from Morocco
   and Iberia to Central Asia, Nomiapis rufiventris (Spinola, 1838) spec.
   resurr. from Morocco to Egypt, including Sicily and Nomiapis paulyi
   spec. nov. from Portugal and Spain. A lectotype is designated for Nomia
   rufiventris Spinola, 1838. Lectotypes are designated for Nomia bispinosa
   Brulle, 1832 and Nomia albocincta Lucas, 1849, and type material for
   Nomia perforata Lucas, 1849 is clarified; both Nomiapis albocincta and
   Nomiapis perforata are synonymised syn. nov. with Nomiapis rufiventris.
   A lectotype is designated for Nomia ruficornis Spinola, 1838, and this
   taxon is confirmed as a synonym of Nomiapis bispinosa. Systropha
   planidens also consists of three distinct taxa: S. planidens from
   Central Europe to Iran and the European part of Russia, S. grandimargo
   Perez, 1905 spec. resurr. from Portugal, Spain, and France, and S.
   anatolica Warncke, 1977 stat. nov. from Turkey, Syria, and northern
   Israel. A lectotype is designated for Systropha planidens Giraud, 1861.
   Systropha chrysura Perez, 1905 is synonymised syn. nov. with S.
   grandimargo. These findings illustrate the extent to which our
   understanding of the taxonomy of Mediterranean bees remains incomplete.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In developing countries, long-term conservation goals are hindered by
   the high economic costs of human-wildlife conflicts. The grey wolf is
   one of the prominent species indulged in these incidents. We
   investigated human-wolf conflicts (HWCs) by interviewing 104 respondents
   from five villages in Kumrat Valley, northern Pakistan. The respondents
   declared the grey wolf a common and highly dangerous carnivore. The grey
   wolf was found implicated in livestock predation, inflicting a yearly
   economic loss of USD 9225 (USD 88.70 per household (with monthly average
   income of 119 USD)). Our results confirmed that livestock predation was
   the main reason for the community's hostile attitude (65.38\%) and
   perception of the grey wolf. Concerning occupation, farmers have the
   most significant negative attitude (p = 0.040) towards the grey wolf,
   yet employees (p = 0.025) and students (p = 0.030) showed a positive
   attitude. In addition, the other factors contributing to the negative
   attitude towards the grey wolf were the grey wolf sightings and
   livestock predation (p = 0.016 and p = 0.006), respectively. Based on
   the findings, we believe that predation compensation and livestock
   vaccination programs (as done in Gilgit-Baltistan Province of northern
   Pakistan as a measure of snow leopard conservation, to prevent mass
   mortalities of livestock due to diseases and in turn safeguarding the
   predator from retaliatory killing by locals in case of livestock
   predation) educating the populous can be very promising in minimizing
   the HWCs in the study area. We also recommend robust and continuous
   coordination between the local communities and the concerned
   departments.},

Abstract = {Early Neolithic communities penetrated in southwestern Transylvania and
   were established in the Mures Valley where they found suitable
   territories for domestic animal herds and probably plant cultivation.
   The present study tries to answer questions related to the beginnings of
   the neolithisation in this area, from an interdisciplinary perspective,
   valuing archeozoologically and archeobotanically the Starcevo-Cris site
   of Soimus-Teleghi (Hunedoara County), dating to the 7th-6th millennium
   BC. Animal skeletal remains and phytoliths are the proxies analysed in
   this paper, offering data about the palaeoeconomy and palaeoenvironment
   of the Early Neolithic settlement. In the archaeozoological samples, the
   remains coming from domestic mammals are the most frequent, being
   identified as cattle (Bos taurus), sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Capra hircus),
   pig (Sus domesticus), and dog (Canis familiaris). The fact that pig
   remains are almost absent in the samples is significant, suggesting a
   mobility of the evaluated communities. The skeletal remains of wild
   mammal species are rare, belonging to red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe
   deer (Capreolus capreolus), aurochs (Bos primigenius), wild boar (Sus
   scrofa), and polecat (Mustela putorius). The strong dominance of grasses
   is attested through the phytoliths' assemblages. ELONGATE DENDRITIC
   phytoliths are well represented. This morphotype, which originates from
   the inflorescence or the husk of Poaceae, is most likely derived from
   cultivated plants (cereals such as wheat, barley, etc.).
   Archaeozoological and archaeobotanical data resulting from this study
   suggest an open environment around the Early Neolithic settlement, where
   communities of the Starcevo-Cris culture mainly raised herds of cattle
   and sheep/goat. Sporadically, hunting and gathering molluscs were
   practised by the inhabitants, as indicated by archaeozoological results.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eranthis Salisb. (Ranunculaceae) is a herbaceous plant genus, including
   few species disjunctively distributed throughout the temperate zone from
   Southeastern Europe to Eastern Asia. Until recently, only Eranthis
   sibirica DC. was known in South Siberia, being considered endemic and
   tertiary relict. Not long ago, Eranthis tanhoensis Erst was also
   described in Siberia. We report here a reconstruction of the
   phylogenetic relationships between the Siberian Eranthis species based
   on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL + trnL-trnF + trnH-psbA) DNA. The
   phylogeographic structure of Siberian Eranthis is distinguished by the
   presence of the two ``eastern{''} and ``western{''} supergroups, which
   most likely formed as a result of disjunction caused by active mountain
   uplifts during the late Neogene-early Quaternary and subsequent
   progressive Pleistocene cooling. The eastern supergroup combines lineage
   I, containing populations from the eastern Khamar-Daban Ridge, the
   Eastern Sayan Mountains, and the Tannu-Ola Ridge, and lineage II
   containing western Khamar-Daban populations. The western supergroup
   includes only lineage III, containing Western Sayan populations. Our
   data clearly show that E. tanhoensis is nested in the E. sibirica clade,
   thereby indicating that its description as a separate species is
   unjustified, as it compromises the monophyletic status of E. sibirica.
   Therefore, we suggest here to consider E. tanhoensis as a synonym of E.
   sibirica.},

Title = {How Many Mammals Are Killed on Brazilian Roads? Assessing Impacts and
   Conservation Implications},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Millions of animals are killed on roads annually due to collisions with
   vehicles, particularly medium-large mammals. Studies on mammal road-kill
   flourished in Brazil in the last decade and an assessment of research on
   road-kill impacts at a country level will help define science-based
   conservation strategies. In this study, we used the compiled scientific
   literature to provide the state of knowledge on medium and large-sized
   mammals killed by road traffic in Brazil, their conservation status, and
   an approximation of the road-kill magnitude. We reviewed a total of 62
   scientific papers that reported road-kill data accounting for 11.817
   individuals. Of the 102 species of medium-large mammals found in the
   IUCN list, more than half (n = 62; 61\%) were recorded as road-kill on
   Brazilian roads. The Carnivora order comprises over a quarter (n = 23;
   37\%) of the total road-killed species. A total of 9 species (14.5\%)
   were classified as threatened, with a further 10 (16\%) as Near
   Threatened. Over half of the road-killed species (n = 33, 53\%) showed
   declining population trends according to their IUCN conservation status.
   Our extrapolation of the results for the entire Brazilian paved road
   network showed that the number of medium-large road-killed mammals can
   reach almost 9 million yearly (maximum 8.7 million; mean 1.3 million),
   representing a biomass of more than 10000 tons. The highest roadkill
   rates were recorded for common generalists and least concern species,
   although there were also threatened and near threatened species within
   the top 15 highest road-kill rates. The declining population trends
   found for most species reflect serious conservation concerns, since
   there is a lack of information on the mortality effects at population
   levels. Our results suggest that medium-large mammals are severally
   affected by road mortality in Brazil. More investigations are needed at
   local and abundance population levels, in a way that allows the
   inclusion of road network as an important threat for target species
   impacted by road-kill in the national territory, in order to develop
   adequate plans to mitigate those impacts.},

Title = {Current Status of and Threats to Sicilian Turtles},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Based on the critical review of the literature published in the last 22
   years, an attempt was made to evaluate the current knowledge gap on the
   distribution and status of the native Testudines taxa occurring in
   Sicily (namely Caretta caretta, Emys trinacris, and Testudo hermanni
   hermanni), as well as the available knowledge of the only non-native
   species with putative viable populations occurring on the island, i.e.,
   Trachemys scripta. Summarizing the current information, all of the
   Testudines species occurring in Sicily showed a fragmented and
   incompletely-known distribution, and only scarce data are available
   about their phenology. Moreover, despite their inclusion of
   international and national laws (Bern Convention, CITES, Habitat
   directive), all three native species are facing several threats (e.g.,
   habitat alteration, the occurrence of invasive species, parasite
   spillover) leading to a reduction of their populations on the island.
   Future monitoring programs on the island should be enhanced, with an
   emphasis on those taxa in decline. Moreover, involve Citizen Science
   programs should also be implemented in order to increase the awareness
   of non-experts and facilitate the monitoring task.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {Orchids have attracted much attention from researchers, because of their
   richness of species and their great ornamental and medicinal value.
   Jiangxi Province, which is located in southeastern China and ringed on
   three sides by mountains, contains many nature reserves and harbors
   large number of orchids. Here, we conducted field surveys of orchids in
   35 nature reserves in Jiangxi, using sampling lines and plots. We also
   analyzed the relationship between orchid richness and density with
   environmental variables and studied the relationship among these nature
   reserves. We found that the mountainous areas of southwestern, southern,
   and northeastern Jiangxi have a high richness and density of orchids,
   while the mountainous areas of central and northwestern Jiangxi have low
   richness and density. Jiulianshan and Jinggangshan are the two most
   rich-species reserves, with 58 and 55 orchids, respectively. Eight
   reserves (22\% of those surveyed) had fewer than 10 orchids. Compared
   with soil, climate, and vegetation, topography was more closely related
   to the richness and density of orchids. Topographical variables
   explained 19\% and 20\% of the total variation in SR and SD,
   respectively. The result of hierarchical clustering analysis showed that
   the 35 nature reserves of Jiangxi obviously fall into two main clusters,
   which are separated by the Ganjiang River-Poyang Lake water system. In
   conclusion, the geographical patterns of richness and the density of
   orchids in Jiangxi are uneven and are affected by topography and
   vegetation, while their distribution is affected by the terrain of
   Jiangxi. Our work explains the richness and density patterns and the
   assembly mechanism of the orchids in Jiangxi and also provides new ideas
   for the protection of orchids in this region.},

Title = {The Importance of Being Diverse: The Idiosyncratic Ethnobotany of the
   Reka Albanian Diaspora in North Macedonia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cultural diversity and biodiversity are strongly intertwined through the
   ways in which local human communities have understood, categorized,
   perceived, and used nature and species for centuries. Folk nomenclature
   and uses of wild plants in particular are strongly linked to specific
   ethno-diversities and have often been considered as cultural markers. In
   the current study, through thirty-one interviews with elderly villagers,
   the ethnobotany of five Albanian villages in North Macedonia was
   recorded, as these villages are inhabited by descendants of Reka
   Albanians, whose peculiar dialect and customs have been the subject in
   the past of some linguistic, historical, and ethnographic works. A few
   folk names and utilizations of commonly used species (such as Rumex,
   Urtica, Tilia, Crocus, and Hypericum spp.), as well as the traditional
   customs of collecting tree cambium during the spring and ritually
   adorning home doors with Cornus mas and Salix spp. branches on St.
   George's Day, partially overlap Macedonian/Bulgarian folklore, and, to a
   minor extent, data previously collected in NE Albania and South Kosovo.
   Nevertheless, some archaic uses (such as the consumption of Crocus
   corms) remain very idiosyncratic. While the origin of the Reka Albanians

Title = {Power Lines and Birds: Drivers of Conflict-Prone Use of Pylons by
   Nesting White Storks (Ciconia ciconia)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy infrastructure is expanding at a global scale and can represent a
   major threat to wildlife populations. Power lines are one of the main
   sources of human-induced avian mortality due to electrocution or
   collision, but many species use electricity pylons as a structure for
   nesting. Pylon nesting results in human-wildlife conflict because it can
   cause power outages and structural damage to power lines. The white
   stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large-size semicolonial species that
   increasingly nests on pylons, causing growing operational and economic
   issues to power companies and energy consumers. In this study, the
   likelihood of problematic pylon use by nesting storks was predicted
   using a suite of explanatory variables related to the availability of
   foraging habitat and human disturbance. During a five-year period
   (2015-2019), we assessed the distribution of stork nests removed from
   the highly-risky top part of transmission pylons (220-400 kV) by power
   company technicians in South western Spain. A total of 839 nests were
   removed from 11\% of the transmission pylons (n = 1196) during the study
   period. Pylon use intensified on pylons located near to landfills,
   surrounded by high proportion of grassland, and when close to freshwater
   sources (water body or river) and other occupied pylons. Human
   disturbance was unlikely to deter storks from using pylons and pylon use
   increased in urban areas. The approach used here to predict pylon use by
   nesting birds has applications for both human-wildlife conflict
   mitigation and conservation purposes where endangered species use human
   infrastructure. Power companies may use this kind of information to
   install anti-nesting devices (to reduce power outages and avian
   mortality or nesting platforms on suitable pylons (to promote pylons use
   by endangered species), and to account for the likelihood of
   conflict-prone use of pylons when siting future power lines.},

Title = {Distribution and Diversity of Diaptomid Copepods in Freshwater Habitats
   of Cambodia (Crustacea: Copepoda: Calanoida: Diaptomidae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Freshwater diaptomid copepods in Cambodia are poorly studied, and only
   seven taxa were known previously. From February to October 2007, 255
   samples were collected from 237 freshwater sites in nine provinces
   representing four regions (northwest, Cardamom and Elephant Mountains,
   Mekong Lowlands, and east) of Cambodia. Diversity, seasonal occurrence,
   geographical distribution of each species, and a checklist of diaptomid
   copepods are documented. In this case, 24 species were recorded,
   including two undescribed species belonging to the genera
   Phyllodiaptomus and Tropodiaptomus. In this case, 14 species are
   recorded for the first time in Cambodia, and Mongolodiaptomus formosanus
   has been recorded for the first time in Southeast Asia. One species
   appears to be endemic to Cambodia and nine to the lower Mekong River
   Basin. Mongolodiaptomus malaindosinensis was the most common, frequently
   recorded throughout the four regions (40.5\% of the sampled sites),
   followed by Vietodiaptomus blachei (39.2\%), Eodiaptomus phuvongi
   (38.8\%), Mongolodiaptomus formosanus (31.2\%), and Eodiaptomus
   draconisignivomi (27.4\%). Very rare species such as Eodiaptomus
   sanoamuangae, Tropodiaptomus vicinus, Mongolodiaptomus calcarus, and
   Tropodiaptomus sp. were only recorded at 0.4\% to 0.8\% of the sampled
   sites. The species diversity of Cambodia is most similar to that of
   Thailand, where 22 species (91.6\%) occur both in Cambodia and Thailand,
   and 12 (50\%) of the species have been recorded in both Cambodia and
   Vietnam.},

Title = {Evaluation of Genetic Diversity and Parasite-Mediated Selection of MHC
   Class I Genes in Emberiza godlewskii (Passeriformes: Emberizidae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a multi-copy immune gene
   family in vertebrates. Its genes are highly variable and code for
   antigen-presenting molecules. Characterization of MHC genes in different
   species and investigating the mechanisms that shape MHC diversity is an
   important goal in understanding the evolution of biological diversity.
   Here we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol to
   genotype the MHC class I genes of 326 Godlewski's buntings (Emberiza
   godlewskii) sampled in the Western mountain area of Beijing from 2014 to
   2016. A total of 184 functional alleles were identified, including both
   non-classical and classical alleles, clustering into nine supertypes.
   Compared with other passerine birds, the number of MHC class I alleles
   per individual in Godlewski's buntings is high (mean 16.1 +/- 3.3,
   median 16). In addition, we demonstrated signatures of historical and
   contemporary selection on MHC genes. Reflecting historical selection,
   ten amino acid sites in the antigen-binding domain showed signatures of
   balancing selection, eight of which exhibit high amino acid
   polymorphism. In terms of contemporary selection, we found that specific
   MHC supertypes were nominally associated with the infection of two
   malaria parasite lineages. These findings indicate the action of
   historical and possibly also contemporary balancing selection and
   suggest negative frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection as
   possible selection mechanisms.},

Title = {Diversity and Benefits of Arbuscular Mycorrhizae in Restored Riparian
   Plantations},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing use of vegetation for fuel wood, cattle,
   agriculture, and due to population pressure that negatively affects
   biodiversity values, more plantations are needed to obtain a permanent
   vegetal cover. Attention has been paid to microbial interactions
   (arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM)) for management and inoculation. To
   evaluate the benefits of inoculation, the root colonization of
   inoculated seedlings, soil aggregation, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) diversity were examined by two field treatments (fertilized with
   organic matter (OM) vs. fertilized with natural rock phosphate (P)). The
   preserved and experimental areas presented higher AMF spore number and
   richness (nine species) than the degraded areas. The addition of OM or P
   did not improve root colonization by AMF; however, it was a guarantee
   for a successful restoration as, in the restored fields, a high soil
   aggregation was found, in addition to a high root colonization, spore
   number, and richness of AMF. However, the undisturbed site presented the
   more prominent values. This study showed that AMF are important
   components in riparian areas, and it brings information for inoculant
   production in ecological restoration using mixed plantations,
   contributing to the establishment of mycorrhizal vegetation and soil
   aggregation that not only benefit AM plants, but also allow non-host
   plants in degraded areas.},

Abstract = {The European flounder, Platichthys flesus, is a polymorphic flatfish,
   which has a large population variation in the proportion of left-sided
   and right-sided morphs across its geographic range. We compared the
   frequencies of these morphs in the White Sea (Kandalaksha, Onega, Dvina,
   and Mezen bays), the region in the northeastern part of species' range
   adjacent to the Arctic. The proportion of the two morphs in the
   populations of White Sea flounders showed high variability and specific
   regional characteristics. The highest frequency of left-sided
   individuals was observed in the northwestern (Kandalaksha Bay) and
   southwestern (Onega Bay) parts of the White Sea. Flounders living in the
   eastern part of the White Sea (Dvina and Mezen bays) showed a much lower
   frequency of this trait. No consistent pattern of geographic variation
   in the proportion of the morphs was found in the geographic range of P.
   flesus. The lowest frequencies of left-sided individuals were recorded
   in the flounder populations living at the eastern and western margins of
   the geographic range. Geographic variation in the proportion of
   left-sided individuals in flounder populations is likely to be
   determined by a set of biotic and abiotic factors. Selective influence
   of the latter, acting through the trophic relationships of this species
   with other marine organisms, can differ in different parts of flounder's
   geographic range.},

Abstract = {Many aquatic species have restricted dispersal capabilities, making them
   the most vulnerable organisms to climate change and land use change
   patterns. These factors deplete Nymphaea species' suitable habitats,
   threatening their populations and survival. In addition, the species are
   poorly documented, which may indicate how scarce they are or will
   become. Members of Nymphaea are ecologically important as well as having
   cultural and economic value, making them of conservation interest.
   Therefore, using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach, climatic
   variables, land use, and presence points were modeled for seven Nymphaea
   species in South America, using three general circulation models (CCSM4,
   HADGEM2-AO, and MIROC5) and in two representative concentration pathways
   (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) and two scenarios (2050 and 2070). Our results
   indicated that mean diurnal range (bio2), precipitation of the wettest
   month (bio13), temperature seasonality (bio15), and land use (dom\_lu)
   were the main influencing factors. For all species, suitable areas were
   concentrated east of Brazil, and they were variable in northern parts of
   the continent. Besides, inconsistent expansion and contraction of
   suitable habitats were noticed among the species. For example, N.
   amazonum, N. rudgeana, and N. lasiophylla future habitat expansions
   declined and habitat contraction increased, while for N. ampla and N.
   jamesoniana, both future habitat expansion and contraction increased,
   and for N. pulchella and N. rudgeana it varied in the RCPs. Moreover,
   the largest projected suitable habitats were projected outside protected
   areas, characterized by high human impacts, despite our analysis
   indicating no significant change between protected and unprotected areas
   in suitable habitat change. Finally, understanding how climate change
   and land use affect species distribution is critical to developing
   conservation measures for aquatic species.},

Abstract = {The exotic Japanese jumping snail, Ovachlamys fulgens, was first
   recorded in Santa Catarina state, Brazil, in 2013. Based on data
   gathered from the literature, natural history collections, field
   samplings, and the iNaturalist platform, we assess its current
   distribution in the country. Our data show that the jumping snail has
   had a dramatic range expansion since its introduction, reaching six
   other states from the southern region of the country toward the Midwest.
   The affected locations are mostly urban but also include three
   biological reserves and protected areas, and possibly more. We discuss
   the consequences of this rapid invasion, its means of introduction, its
   local ecology, and prospects for monitoring and control.},

Abstract = {Farmland bird populations have declined globally raising concerns over
   habitat loss for a wide range of species. In this study, we explored the
   significance of agroecosystems for birds at different temporal and
   spatial scales along the Cauvery delta region, South India. Our results
   recorded a wide range of 102 species, with passerines and wetland birds
   dominating the landscapes. Among the guild types, omnivores and
   insectivores were the well-represented groups followed by carnivores,
   granivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Species richness and diversity
   were recorded higher during winter which could be associated with the
   maturing phase of rice paddies in the agroecosystem. There were
   significant differences recorded in species diversity and richness
   between the cropping period and the non-cropping periods, thus
   recognizing the high potential of paddy ecosystems in biodiversity
   conservation. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that the
   diversity of birds in the agroecosystem was more influenced by the woody
   vegetation cover, crop cover, and field size; however, bird abundance
   was related to farm activities, plantations, and herbaceous cover
   surrounding the agroecosystem. Fewer generalist species revealed an
   interesting pattern of taxonomic homogenization with monoculture
   cropping patterns that could influence the adaptability and functional
   traits of the other species. The results of the study highlight that
   both HNV and the non-HNV zones attract a rich diversity of birds and the
   conservation of this traditional agricultural belt would aid in the
   conservation of threatened species and biodiversity globally.},

Abstract = {Using accurate and precise species-specific parameters in mechanistic
   models can lead to better predictions of population dynamics and
   ecosystem function (e.g. nutrient cycling) across a range of
   environmental conditions. Zooplankton are important in the aquatic food
   web and for nutrient cycling but are highly diverse, and there is only
   limited information on specific species. Knowledge of species-specific
   attributes is patchy. In particular, tropical species are
   underrepresented in this regard. Here, we gather all the known
   information about a wide-spread tropical zooplankton member,
   Ceriodaphnia rigaudi, and add new information from lab and field
   experiments. We determine feeding rate across a range of food
   concentrations and food-dependent population growth rate of C. rigaudi.
   Additionally, we use 16 years of occurrence data from rock pools in
   Jamaica to explore environmental characteristics of the habitat in which
   C. rigaudi live. We compare our data to worldwide records of the species
   attributes and create a reference map of its occurrence.},

Title = {Association between arthropod densities suggests dominance of top-down
   control of predator-prey food-webs on pear trees during winter},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although winter in the temperate zone is considered to be the period of
   arthropod quiescence, some pests and their natural enemies remain active
   and interact in simplified food-webs. Limited information exists about
   the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating
   arthropod food-webs and their spatio-temporal dynamics during winter.
   This information is essential for the development of effective
   conservation biocontrol methods. We investigated how the pest management
   of pear orchards (integrated {[}IPM] vs organic) and tree location
   within orchards (margin vs centre) influence the association between
   densities of winter-active spiders, insect herbivores and
   winter-inactive predators (spiders, insects) from October to April. We
   installed carboard bands on trunks and branches of pear trees in four
   organic and four IPM orchards to collect bark -dwelling arthropods. We
   then modelled relationships between the densities of four functional
   arthropod groups, namely winter-active spiders, winter-inactive spiders,
   winter-inactive insect predators, and herbivores. In early winter, we
   found a hump-shaped relationship between the densities of winter-active
   spiders and her-bivores. This agrees with the top-down model of the
   ecosystem exploitation hypothesis, predicting that predators are first
   bottom-up limited, then accumulate with prey densities, and exert
   top-down control when they become sufficiently abundant. The densities
   of herbivores strongly declined during winter, a phenomenon which may be
   partly, along with other causes of natural mortality, attributable to
   predation by winter active spiders. The as-sociation between
   winter-active spiders and winter-inactive arthropod predators switched
   from positive to none in organic orchards or even to a negative
   association in IPM orchards. Negative intraguild interactions seem to be
   intensified due to the declining availability of alternative prey.
   Overall, the investigated food-webs seem to be mostly top-down regulated
   during winter, and IPM seems to intensify intraguild interactions.},

Title = {Scale of effect matters: Forest cover influences on tropical ant-plant
   ecological networks},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decade, the number of studies dealing with how species
   interaction networks are structured by landscape has increased in the
   literature. However, many studies quantify landscape metrics at one
   single spatial extent, without considering the effects at multiple
   spatial extents. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explicitly
   addressed and discussed the spatial extent at which landscape structure
   best predicts the organization of ecological networks, which is key to
   understanding how ecological interactions are affected by landscape
   modifications. Therefore, two important research questions arise: can
   the spatial scale at which landscape structure best predicts an
   ecological response (i.e., scale of effect) magnify our ability to
   understand ecological networks or can the suboptimal scale just blind
   our view about what really happens? Motivated by these concerns, we used
   ant-plant relationships obtained from 16 landscapes in a human-dominated
   tropical rainforest of Mexico to assess and discuss the spatial extent
   at which forest cover (\%) best predicts ant-plant interaction network
   patterns (i.e., network size, interaction diversity, network
   specialization, and nestedness). In general, we observed that smaller
   scales best predicted the interaction diversity (50 m) and
   specialization (250 m) of ecological networks involving ants and plants,
   which are descriptors associated to abundance and the distribution of
   interactions between plant and ant species. This is possibly because
   ant-plant relationships are being modulated by processes that act at the
   microclimatic level due to the biotic and abiotic conditions that forest
   provides. However, we found that network size and nestedness (i.e.,
   descriptors associated to species detectability and emergent properties)
   were not associated with forest cover at any analyzed spatial extent.
   These findings indicate that the ant-plant ecological network structure
   can be influenced by processes that occur at different spatial extents.
   Moreover, the results presented here have a direct impact on our
   theoretical and empirical understanding of how the landscape structure
   shapes biotic interactions at different spatial extents in highly
   diverse tropical rainforests.},

Title = {Functional diversity in herbivorous fishes on Caribbean reefs: The role
   of macroalgal traits in driving interspecific differences in feeding
   behavior},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding how functional traits drive plant-herbivore interactions
   often illuminates the mechanisms driving niche partitioning and
   functional diversity in this important guild of consumers. On coral
   reefs, a diverse suite of herbivorous fishes is key for controlling
   algal abundance and impacting benthic community dynamics. Here, we focus
   on how algal traits shape complementarity in feeding for a diverse suite
   of large herbivorous fishes on a coral reef in the wider Caribbean. We
   used feeding assays in the field to document feeding patterns of the
   different herbivorous fishes across 50 species of macroalgae. Then, we
   used a suite of macroalgal traits such as dry mass, nutrient content,
   calcification, and chemical defenses to assess how these traits
   influenced patterns of consumption. Algal defenses were the major traits
   determining the overall vulnerability of algae to herbivores, with
   uncalcified algae from undefended genera being consumed 40\% more
   rapidly than algae that were either calcified or chemically defended.
   Nutrient content of algae explained little in patterns of overall
   herbivory. We found significant niche diversification in feeding both
   among and within genera with the three major genera having unique
   feeding patterns on different suites of algae (Acanthurus spp. -red
   macroalgae, Sparisoma spp. -brown and green macroalgae, and Scarus spp.
   -benthic filamentous algae). With respect to how algal traits influenced
   patterns of feeding in individual species, we found that: (1) some
   herbivore species were almost exclusively influenced by avoiding algal
   defenses, (2) some species showed strong interactions between algal
   defenses and nutrient content that determined their feeding, and (3)
   some species (Kyphosus spp., Pomacanthus arcuatus) targeted
   chemically-defended algae with high nutrient content. Our work
   highlights the role that algal traits play in influencing patterns in
   the diversity and redundancy of feeding in herbivorous fishes on coral
   reefs.},

Title = {Food webs supporting fisheries production in estuaries with expanding
   coastal urbanisation},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The prospects that coastal urbanisation propagates in more fish
   production remains untested and thereby a fundamental question for
   managers challenged with approving urban expansion while also protecting
   and conserving habitat resources important for fish production. We
   tested this by collecting giant mud crabs (Scylla serrata) from highly
   urbanised waterways in south-east Queensland, Australia, and report that
   this crab not only occupy urban coastal waterways, but using a Bayesian
   stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) of the potential individual
   autotrophic sources, the range of feasible contributions for autotrophs
   was very broad, limiting the conclusions that could be made directly
   from the modelling. Patterns of contributions from pooled categories of
   autotrophs were clearer; at the site closest to seagrass, the pooled
   enriched autotroph sources contributed 69 to 87\% of crab isotope
   signatures, while at all other sites (beyond approximately 500 m
   distance) it appears that crabs utilise a generalised pool of sources,
   either local or perhaps a mix of local transported sources. Using
   spatial analysis we reveal that the crab isotope values were not
   significantly related to the distance from any of the vegetated habitats
   (mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh). The exception was two sites very
   close to seagrass (< 500 m distance), and not saltmarsh grass which has
   been reported elsewhere, where crabs had the most enriched C value. At
   all other sites (beyond approximately 500 m distance) it appears crabs
   utilise a generalised organic producer pool, either local or perhaps a
   mix of transported sources. Overall, this study provides evidence that
   in an era of coastal urbanisation expansion and loss of natural coastal
   vegetated areas, some fisheries species may have remarkable trophic
   plasticity to the new, engineered, habitat settings.},

Title = {Predicted impacts of global change on bottom-up trophic interactions in
   the plant-ungulate-wolf food chain in boreal forests},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global warming has been accelerating as atmospheric CO2 has risen. The
   mean annual temperature in boreal forests has increased by 1.5 degrees C
   or more, which has profound impacts on plants and wildlife. This
   overview explores available literature, identifies current knowledge
   gaps, highlights hypotheses about the cascading effects of global
   warming in a boreal forest food chain, and suggests future research
   directions. Our climate-driven bottom-up trophic interaction hypotheses
   explore climate change effects on boreal plants via five mechanisms:
   nutrient dilution, water stress, wildfires, snow depth, and phenology
   shifts. Ungulates may experience longer foraging time and reduced
   biomass due to less nutritious food resources. As a result, carnivores
   might benefit from increased stationary prey encounter and vulnerable
   individuals, but also need to cope with decreased prey biomass and
   increased energetic expenditure in hunting. We recommend increasing
   research efforts on nutrient dilution of northern plants, range shifts
   in northern herbivores that might lead to competition among them, and
   overall impacts of climate change on wolves.},

Title = {Diet of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) on farmlands in Namibia},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although their ecology has been well studied across their range, spotted
   hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) diets, espe-cially within Namibia, are
   understudied when compared to other large African carnivores in southern
   Africa. Large carnivores outside of protected areas often faces
   persecution by farmers as they are often perceived as being livestock
   killers and spotted hyaenas on arid farmlands in Namibia does not escape
   this prejudice. Here we investigated the scat composition of spotted
   hyaenas outside of protected areas on farmlands in south-western parts
   of Namibia. A total of 53 scat samples were collected from which 203
   hair samples were used for identi-fication purposes. Our results
   indicate that 69.46\% of hairs in scat were of wildlife species whilst
   30.54\% of hairs were from domesticated species. The asymptote reached
   also suggested that 53 scat samples were sufficient to describe the
   spotted hyaeans's diet in this particular area. We suspect that an
   outbreak of rabies in the study area as well as anthropogenic food
   sources could have influenced prey consumption. As the majority of prey
   consumed were of wildlife species (such as kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros
   and Hartmann's Mountain zebra Equus zebra hartmannae) it is suggested
   that should the natural prey base be maintained livestock predation
   could be mitigated. We recommend that future researchers investigate the
   diet composition of the only other apex predator in this study area,
   leopards (Panther pardus) which could describe the prey selection and
   dietary overlap between these two large carnivores.},

Title = {Coastal hypoxia reduces trophic resource coupling and alters niche
   characteristics of an ecologically dominant omnivore},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy and biomass move through a variety of trophic pathways in coastal
   ecosystems, with pelagic and benthic pathways often dominating food web
   dynamics. Consumers that couple these pathways play important
   struc-turing roles in these food webs by integrating spatially
   disconnected or asynchronous production pathways. The objective of this
   study was to quantify benthic and pelagic trophic pathway contributions
   to the diet of the mysid Neomysis americana in the Choptank and Patuxent
   rivers (tributaries of Chesapeake Bay) and determine if the relative
   contribution of these two trophic pathways differs between ecosystems
   with different environmental, physical, and watershed features. This
   mysid species undergoes daily vertical migrations throughout the water
   column and it was hypothesized that hypoxia (< 2 mg/L) in deep-water
   habitats of the Patuxent River (but not the Choptank) could reduce the
   importance of the benthic pathway for mysids in the Patuxent River
   relative to the Choptank River. Mysids and trophic resources were
   collected in each river during the summers of 2018 and 2019 and analyzed
   for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition and tissue
   stoichiometry (C:N). Stable -isotope based estimates of benthic trophic
   pathway contribution, trophic position, and isotopic niche area (proxy
   for trophic niche) and C:N composition of N. americana were compared
   within and between tributaries. Overall, mysids in the Patuxent River
   assimilated less benthic material, realized lower trophic positions, and
   had lower C:N ratios (proxy for lipid content) than Choptank River
   mysids. No consistent pattern in trophic niche area was observed
   although niche area (and pelagic trophic pathway contribution) of
   Choptank River mysids increased during a high river discharge event.
   This study provides evidence that hypoxic conditions in the Patuxent
   reduced the strength of benthic-pelagic coupling by N. americana and,
   further, is associated with lower trophic position and a reduced
   stoichiometric marker of lipid storage. In addition to their role as
   omnivorous consumers, N. americana are a dominant prey taxon for many
   predators, underscoring the importance of this species to local food
   webs and the potential for bottom-up effects on the dynamics of coastal
   ecosystems in response to changes in their trophic ecology.},

Abstract = {The icon ectomycorrhizal (EcM) species, Tuber melanosporum, requires

   fruitbodies and to explore why, Oniscus asellus were presented with T.
   melanosporum as a food source. Fruitbodies were consumed at a rate of
   4.0 mg per isopod, over 24 h. Most of the recovered faecal pellets
   contained ascospores after 12 h. Gut-transit inflicted little mechanical
   damage to ascospores, and the majority were still contained with an
   ascus 30 h post feeding. Further, ascospores were observed in faecal

   previously overlooked role for isopods in EcM spore dispersal. The
   impacts for EcM ecology and the role of isopods in Tuber spp.
   lifecycles, including mating type distribution, is discussed alongside
   the emerging threat of climate change and how such knowledge can inform

Title = {High-throughput sequencing reveals prey diversity overlap between
   sympatric Sulids in the tropical Atlantic},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Seabirds breeding at tropical latitudes suffer an increased pressure to
   forage efficiently, because oligotrophic waters have less abundant and
   more patchily distributed prey. In related species living in sympatry,
   trophic or spatial niche partitioning may emerge as a strategy to
   mitigate increased competition. However, studies using molecular
   methodologies such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test for these
   strategies are still scarce. In this study we used HTS to assess prey
   diversity partitioning on two sulid species living sympatrically in the
   tropical Raso Islet (Cabo Verde). Brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) breed
   in Raso Islet throughout the year while Red-footed boobies (Sula sula)
   occur during molt, from June to October. We compared Brown boobies diet
   prey diversity between the two periods (non-coexistence vs. coexistence
   with Red-footed booby), as well as between both sulids while in
   coexistence. Overall, the diets of all groups were clearly dominated by
   a small number of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), with a
   predominance of flying fish. The diet composition of Brown boobies was
   significantly different between the two time periods, most likely due to
   temporal differences in prey availability or possible competition with
   other seabird species. Brown boobies exploited a wider taxo-nomic range

Title = {Effects of urbanization on the trophic niche of the brown anole, a
   widespread invasive lizard},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most dramatic forms of environmental change
   with the potential to alter trophic relationships among organisms in
   cities. In this study, we combine gut-content and stable isotope
   analyses of brown anole diets with field sampling of arthropods to
   assess whether and how urbanization-induced variation of basal resources
   influence trophic niche variation of anole populations inhabiting urban,
   suburban, and natural habitats. We found clear evidence for trophic
   niche variation across the urbanization gradient. Stable isotope
   analyses revealed that urban and suburban anoles had strongly elevated
   813C levels and slightly lower 815N levels compared to anoles from
   natural forests- results consistent with increased reliance on grasses
   across the ur-banization gradient. Isotopic niche widths were also
   greater in urban habitats. However, our analysis of anole diets revealed
   no difference in the diversity of prey consumed-despite urban habitats
   having the highest di-versity of available prey compared to suburban and
   natural forest habitats. Overall, our results suggest that much of the
   observed variation in food web structure results from a shift in the
   diversity of basal resource pools across the urbanization gradient. The
   broader effects of a shift towards grass-dominated food webs in urban
   habitats remains to be understood.},

Title = {Surplus killing of olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivace) by jaguar
   (Panthera onca) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Surplus killing is a rare behavior in large predators and its
   documentation has been scarce. This phenomenon has been observed mostly
   in carnivores and comprises on the predation of several prey in a short
   period that eventually would not be consumed, this behavior presents a
   challenge to ecological theory because it appears to be a waste of
   energy. Although there are several records of surplus killing behavior
   for the Panthera genus, this behavior has not been reported on free
   roaming jaguar (Panthera onca) populations. Hence, this report describes
   in-situ evidence of surplus killing by jaguars during the arribada
   massive nesting on olive ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea) in Nancite
   beach, Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. This new report has
   interesting implications for food web theory, as it shows that under
   certain circumstances some predators are capable of killing more prey
   than they can consume, showing how strong the hunting instinct can be
   for certain species.},

Abstract = {In the light of unprecedented planetary changes in biodiversity,
   real-time and accurate ecosystem and biodiversity assessments are
   becoming increasingly essential for informing policy and sustainable
   development. Biodiversity monitoring is a challenge, especially for
   large areas such as entire continents. Nowadays, spaceborne and airborne
   sensors provide information that incorporate wavelengths that cannot be
   seen nor imagined with the human eye. This is also now accomplished at
   unprecedented spatial resolutions, defined by the pixel size of images,
   achieving less than a meter for some satellite images and just
   millimeters for airborne imagery. Thanks to different modeling
   techniques, it is now possible to study functional diversity changes
   over different spatial and temporal scales. At the heart of this
   unifying framework are the ``spectral species{''}-sets of pixels with a
   similar spectral signal-and their variability over space. The aim of
   this paper is to summarize the power of remote sensing for directly
   estimating plant species diversity, particularly focusing on the
   spectral species concept.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Numbers of temperate-breeding Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Canada
   geese have greatly increased since the 1980s. Consequently, numbers of
   yearlings, sub-adults and failed breeders undertaking pre-molt migration
   to northern latitudes has also increased, potentially providing
   additional hunting opportunities for Cree hunters living near James Bay,
   Canada. We described movement patterns and habitat use of molt migrant
   Canada geese Brenta canadensis maxima along the east coast of James Bay
   based on nine geese fitted with GSM-GPS devices during 11 northward and
   eight southward migrations between 2015 and 2019. Geese staged for 2.8
   +/- 0.6 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at 3.2 +/- 0.6
   staging sites (mostly tidal flats and salt marshes) from the first week
   of June in spring and 3.8 +/- 1.8 days at 2.0 +/- 0.5 staging sites
   (mostly inland freshwater wetlands, peatlands and tidal flats) from the
   first week of September when returning south. Shallow and deep water
   habitats were used as resting sites during both migrations. In spring,
   molt migrants were mostly harvested in June well after the migration of
   sub-arctic breeding geese whereas in autumn, both subspecies were
   harvested in September. Molt migrant temperate-breeding geese can
   increase harvest opportunities and represent supplementary wildlife food
   for Cree communities. However, the current number of molt migrant geese
   harvested by Cree hunters is not sufficient to significantly impact
   populations of temperate-breeding geese.},

Title = {Snow limits polecat Mustela putorius distribution in Sweden},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many species show range expansions or contractions due to climate change
   induced changes in habitat suitability. In cold climates, many species
   that are limited by snow are showing range expansions due to reduced
   winter severity. The European polecat Mustela putorius occurs over large
   parts of Europe with its northern range limit in southern Fennoscandia.
   However, it is to date unknown what factors limit polecat distribution.
   We thus investigated whether climate or land-use variables are more
   important in determining the habitat suitability for polecats in Sweden.
   We hypothesized that 1) climatic factors, especially the yearly number
   of snow days, drive habitat suitability for polecats, and that, 2) as
   the number of snow days is predicted to decline in the near future,
   habitat suitability in northern Sweden will increase. We used a
   combination of sightings data and a selection of national maps of
   environmental factors to test these hypotheses using Maxent models. We
   also used maps of future climate predictions (2021-2050 and 2063-2098)
   to predict future habitat suitability. The number of snow days was the
   most important factor, negatively determining habitat suitability for
   polecats, as expected. Consequently, the predictions showed an increase
   in suitable habitat both in the current distribution range and in
   northern Sweden, especially along the coast of the Baltic Sea. Our
   results suggest that the polecat distribution is limited by snow and
   that reduced snow cover will likely result in a northward range
   expansion. However, the exact mechanisms for how snow limits polecats
   are still poorly understood. The potential range expansion might result
   in a population increase of the Scandinavian polecat population, in
   contrast to many populations elsewhere in Europe, where numbers are
   declining. Due to polecat predation, the expansion of the species might
   have cascading effects on other wildlife populations.},

Title = {Seasonal home range and habitat selection patterns of sika deer Cervus
   nippon in southern Hokkaido, Japan},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In 1980 and 1981, eight and nine individual sika deer Cervus nippon were
   reintroduced in southern Hokkaido, Japan, respectively, to address
   population declines in this species during 1900s. As recent population
   growth has led to human-wildlife conflicts, this study investigated the
   responses of sika deer to resource availability and geomorphic factors
   during the summer and winter seasons in southern Hokkaido. Global
   positioning system-collared data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used
   to assess the home range patterns and habitat selection of 14 female
   sika deer located in Mount Esan and Shiriuchi. The core home range size
   was defined using a 50\% kernel density estimation that indicated a
   larger home range in winter than summer for all deer. Habitat selection
   was assessed using generalized linear mixed models. The results showed
   variation in habitat selection between resident deer of Mount Esan and
   Shiriuchi, as well as migratory deer in Shiriuchi during summer.
   Resident deer in Mount Esan and Shriuchi preferred areas closer to crops
   during summer. Interaction effects revealed that migratory deer utilized
   natural grassland close to forest edge habitat in Shiriuchi. By
   contrast, resident deer in Shiriuchi selected forest edge habitat and
   natural grasslands close to crops. In winter, low elevation was the most
   important habitat factor for all deer across the study area. Thus, sika
   deer habitat selection depends on resource availability in summer and
   topographic factors in the winter.},

Title = {The roles of climate and alternative prey in explaining 142 years of
   declining willow ptarmigan hunting yield},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Long time series are important because they extend back to an era when
   animal populations were less influenced by habitat loss and climate
   change. Annual fluctuations in harvest yields are good proxies for large
   changes in population size and may reveal underlying ecological
   processes. From a variety of sources, we built a 142-year long time
   series representing the mean daily catch (CPUE) of willow ptarmigan
   Lagopus lagopus in southeastern Norway. CPUE decreased over the 142
   years, from approximately 35 birds shot per day in early years to around
   two in the last years. There were three periods in the time series: a
   first period with 3-5 year cycles of high peaks and low troughs
   (1872-1900), a short second period with similarly high peaks, variable
   depth of troughs and variable cyclicity (1901-1916), and a third long
   period with much lower peaks and faded cycles (1917-2013). Yearly
   variation in CPUE was best explained by an interacting effect of small
   rodent peak years and period, with a reduced positive effect of rodents
   in the last period, and a positive effect of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation index in spring and early summer. None of the weather
   variables with significant time trends explained any variation in CPUE
   and we could therefore not attribute the decline in CPUE directly to
   climate change. We postulate that a long-term dampening of the amplitude
   in small rodent cycles combined with an increase in red fox numbers,
   have increased predation on alternative prey like ptarmigan, and
   prevented the populations from reaching their earlier peaks. Even though
   the present population of willow ptarmigan is only a fraction of what it
   was in former days, we recommend light hunting to motivate for
   monitoring and to keep public attention on the bird.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are under multiple stressors and it is crucial to
   find methods to better describe, manage, and sustain aquatic ecosystems.
   Ecosystem modelling has become an important tool in integrating trophic
   relationships into food webs, assessing important nodes using network
   analysis, and making predictions via simulations. Fortunately, several
   modelling techniques exist, but the question is which approach is
   relevant and applicable when? In this study, we compare three modelling
   frameworks (Ecopath, Loop Analysis in R, STELLA software) using a case
   study of a small aquatic network (8 nodes). The choice of framework
   depends on the research question and data availability. We approach this
   topic from a methodological aspect by describing the data requirements
   and by comparing the applicability and limitations of each modelling
   approach. Each modelling framework has its specific focus, but some
   functionalities and outcomes can be compared. The predictions of Loop
   Analysis as compared to Ecopath's Mixed Trophic Impact plot are in good
   agreement at the top and bottom trophic levels, but the middle trophic
   levels are less similar. This suggests that further comparisons are
   needed of networks of varying resolution and size. Generally, when data
   are limiting, Loop Analysis can provide qualitative predictions, while
   the other two methods provide quantitative results, yet rely on more
   data.},

Title = {An evidence-based approach to identifying resting sites of Eurasian
   otter Lutra lutra from camera-trap and field-sign data},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Mammals' resting sites (dens) are important features of their ecology.
   Eurasian otter Lutra lutra resting sites are strictly protected by UK
   and European legislation and are ostensibly identified from associated
   field-signs. This legislation is difficult to apply given the poor
   understanding of resting sites coupled with the lack of evidence
   supporting a field-sign signature. We aimed to use camera-trap data to
   identify resting sites, investigate whether field-signs differed between
   resting and non-resting sites and describe behaviours recorded on
   camera-traps that are associated with resting. An evidence-based
   approach to identifying resting sites of Eurasian otter Lutra lutra from
   camera-trap and field-sign data camera-trap data showed that otters
   frequently visited potential resting sites, characterised by a very
   short time within the structure (often < 4 min). Resting sites were
   characterised by longer durations (often hours) during the daytime and
   night-time. Based on these data, six of our 26 sites were identified as
   resting sites. Modelling suggested that no single field-sign had a clear
   association with resting sites. However, we found a hitherto
   unrecognised distinction between otter latrines (defecation sites) and
   spraint (scent-marking) sites, and that camera-trap observations of
   latrine behaviour and bedding collection were exclusive to resting
   sites. As bedding and latrines are not always visible, presence of
   either indicates a resting site but no interpretation can be drawn from
   their absence, so camera-trapping would be recommended to identify
   resting site status. Data simulations found that camera-trapping for 38
   d in winter, followed by 38 d in spring, was the optimal approach for a
   95\% chance of detecting a rest across all resting sites. Ours is the
   first study to identify standards and expectations for surveys using
   camera-trap and field-signs at Eurasian otter resting sites. Our novel
   account of their resting activity facilitates better interpretation of
   legislation.},

Abstract = {Rock outcrops are unique habitats in terms of their geological and
   ecological specializations, soil availability, water seasonality, and
   environmental extremes. These habitats have attracted the attention of
   many researchers worldwide in the last few decades. Indian rock outcrops
   spread throughout the country with more concentration in the Western
   Ghats region, supporting many endemic and unique habitat specialist
   species. Despite Indian outcrops having become hotspots for novel
   species discoveries in recent times, ecological studies on them are
   still in their infancy. In the present review, we discuss studies,
   research gaps, and the scope for future investigations on Indian
   outcrops. We also compare outcrop studies across the world with the
   Indian systems in order to understand their uniqueness and
   peculiarities. Literature and observations revealed the presence of 390
   taxa on rock outcrops of the Western Ghats with various adaptive traits
   such as desiccation tolerance, succulence, carnivory, and geophytism, a
   trend common to most of the tropical outcrops. The dominance of Poaceae
   endemics, large extents of monocotyledonous mats, and
   underrepresentation of succulence are unique features of Indian rock
   outcrops. In the light of various disturbances, faced by Indian
   outcrops, further studies that would lay a foundation on which
   conservation strategies can be formulated are a want of time.},

Title = {Understory floristic diversity and soil seed bank status of planted and

Abstract = {South Busoga Central Forest Reserve, an isolated reserve in Uganda has
   been degraded for over forty years. To restore the reserve, the National
   Forestry Authority established plantations in some parts of the reserve
   and plans to reserve 40\% under native vegetation. Until now, no study
   exists to inform management of the availability of native species in the
   degraded area to support natural forest regeneration. The objectives of
   this study were to: (i) establish if there are seeds of native forest
   species in the soil seed bank of plantations and unplanted areas (ii)
   assess the potential of the understory of plantations to serve as `seed
   sources'. A seed bank assay of soils from plantations; Eucalyptus
   grandis, Maesopsis eminii and Pinus caribaea and unplanted areas was
   performed. Understory vegetation was sampled in 125 subplots of 5 x 5 m,
   randomly distributed in the plantations. In the seed bank, we recorded a
   total of 56 species in plantations and 22 in unplanted. There were more
   species in soils under E. grandis (12) > M. eminii (10) > P. caribaea
   (9) > unplanted area (3). Apart from Ficus sp. and Drypetes sp. that are
   woody, the rest of the species were non-woody. In the understory, we
   encountered a total of 56 species but only fifteen were native tree
   species with occurrence of less than five individuals each. These
   results show that sustained forest degradation depletes soil seed banks
   of native forest species and that plantations of exotic species can also
   nurse native species in their understory.},

Title = {Regeneration response of Vepris dainellii, an endemic species of
   Ethiopia to disturbance in moist forest ecosystem},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Examining the regeneration response of species is one of the key
   ecological analyses vital to understanding and predicting the spatial
   structure of plant populations and designing specific management plans
   in the face of anthropogenic and climate change factors. Despite the
   ecological and traditional importance of Vepris dainellii species,
   little is known about the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on its
   natural regeneration patterns and recruitment structure. This study
   investigates the regeneration and recruitment response of Vepris
   dainellii and its correlation to disturbance particularly clear-cut in
   Sirso moist evergreen Afromontane forest, Ethiopia. By employing
   transect sampling technique, fifty sample plots (20 m x 20 m size) were
   laid in five transect lines for exploring V. dainellii species in Sirso
   moist evergreen Afromontane forest. In plots, where V. dainellii were
   found, vegetation data and stumped individuals (timber pieces resulting
   from the illegal cutting of trees) were recorded. Regeneration was
   recorded using sub-plots. Vepris dainellii is the first ranked woody
   species by recorded a higher number of bowdlerized stems. The
   regeneration of V. dainellii species was higher in disturbed sites
   compared to undisturbed sites. Besides, the regeneration of the species
   positively correlates with the intensity of clear-cuts or the number of
   stump individuals of the species (73.5\%). Whereas, the species
   regeneration and forest canopy cover, altitude, slope and aspect were
   not correlated. Vepris dainellii is a disturbance resilient species with
   the presence of mother trees. Though, this study suggested detailed
   research on the threshold of clear-cut intensity and functional traits
   in response to disturbance in moist forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Soil-litter arthropod communities under pasture land use in southern
   Rwanda},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Land use change caused by human activities is the main driver of
   biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem functioning. However, less is
   known about how the conversion of a natural to pasture land favour the
   biological diversity of soil-litter arthropods to advance effective
   conservation plans and management systems. To fill the gap, this study
   focussed on soil-litter arthropod communities under a pasture land use
   in southern Rwanda. Data have been collected using pitfall traps and
   hand collection between April and June 2021. Sampled specimens of
   soil-litter arthropods have been identified to order and family levels
   by using dichotomous keys. Further, the species name was given when the
   identification key was available, while the morphological description
   was provided in absence of the identification keys. Results indicated a
   total of 3013 individuals of soil-litter arthropods grouped into 3
   classes, 13 orders, 46 families and 87 morpho-species. Coleoptera showed
   a high number of families, while higher abundance and the number of
   morpho-species were found for ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Higher
   abundance of sampled soil-litter arthropods is a sign that the studied
   area offers suitable habitat for soil-litter arthropods. However, less
   abundance found for some groups of soil-litter arthropods might be
   influenced by the used sampling techniques which were not appropriate
   for them. We recommend surveys using multiple sampling techniques to
   maximize chances of capturing a wide range of soil-litter arthropods.},

Abstract = {Soil samples were collected monthly from a forest in the sub-Himalayan
   alluvial plains. The influence of four major edaphic factors on the
   abundance fluctuation of microarthropod assemblages were investigated.
   Soil temperature and organic carbon exhibited significant (p < 0.05)
   negative and positive correlations respectively with the abundance while
   the soil moisture and pH appeared of less importance. Four edaphic
   factors collectively can explain from 37.1 to 53.7\% abundance
   fluctuation as the multiple regression analyses indicated. Result of
   stepwise regression substantiated the observations made in correlation
   analysis. Relatively high temperature in the region appeared to be the
   reason for significant negative correlation, fluctuations of organic
   carbon were parallel to the monthly waves of abundances, sufficient soil
   moisture and narrow range of variation of pH appeared to account for
   their relatively inconspicuous impact.},

Title = {Effect of habitat specific wood specific gravity on biomass and carbon
   stock of trees in tropical dry deciduous forest of central India},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wood specific gravity (WSG) is one of the important variables in biomass
   and carbon stock estimation through non-destructive method. Present
   study was conducted in a tropical dry deciduous forest in central India.
   A non-destructive method was adopted for biomass estimation. Habitat
   specific WSG of all the species present in the study area was determined
   using maximum moisture content method. Reported WSG values of the same
   species were procured from global wood density database. The present
   paper deals with the comparison of biomass and carbon stock of mature
   individuals estimated using habitat specific WSG and WSG procured from
   the database for the same species. Further, comparison was made among
   biomass and carbon values estimated using habitat specific WSG and
   without WSG for juvenile individuals. Procured WSG from database for
   different tree species were found to be higher in most cases than the
   WSG determined in the habitat. Results envisage that biomass estimates
   using non habitat specific WSG (database) over-estimate the biomass and
   carbon stock. Total biomass (including both mature and juvenile
   individuals) per hectare was 24.2\% higher with reported WSG for mature
   individuals and without WSG for juvenile individuals than using habitat
   specific WSG for both mature and juvenile individuals. It is calculated
   that using WSG from data base may result in increased AGB by 1.5 x 10(8)
   Mg and 6.6 x 10(8) Mg at state and national level respectively. We
   suggest the consideration of habitat specific WSG for biomass and carbon
   estimation in non-destructive method for both mature and juvenile
   individuals.},

Title = {Occupancy modeling of habitat use by white-tailed deer after more than a
   decade of exclusion in the boreal forest},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce
   the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of
   desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), selective
   browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir -
   white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce
   forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca 10-12 years in
   clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist
   in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and
   food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use
   exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial
   configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic
   cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging
   from 3.1 to 11.2 km(2) (n = 25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer
   were reduced for 10-12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models
   that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while
   simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection
   probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased
   by 19\% when forage resources, represented by the cover of Cornus
   canadensis, increased from 0 to 100\%. None of the other variables
   (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance
   between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the
   use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of
   exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest
   management that improves food production during summer should help
   maintain or increase habitat use by deer.},

Title = {Revisiting discrepancies between stochastic agent-based and

Abstract = {Predicting which species will present (or absent) across geographical
   regions, and where, remains one of the important issues in ecology. From
   a methodical viewpoint, one of the concerns in examining species
   presence-absence across an environmental gradient is about the
   robustness of model-based predictions, which are given by distinct
   modelling frameworks used. Generally, different complexities and
   ecological factors are incorporated into such models, e.g. abiotic
   environments, spatial dispersal process, and stochasticity. Motivated by
   these ecological issues, we revisit a single-species logistic growth
   problem by employing stochastic agent-based model (ABM) and
   deterministic system and extend these frameworks to incorporate the
   effects of spatially changing environments. We observe that our ABM,
   which is formulated using random walk theory and birth-death process,
   demonstrates important qualitative behaviours that are consistent with
   the underlying theories of stochastic process. The results of ABM with
   large population sizes also agree with those of the deterministic
   equation. However, some discrepancies are observed when the population
   size is small. The ABM densities seem to underestimate the deterministic
   solutions, which illustrate the effects of stochasticity on small
   populations with some individuals may go extinct simply by chance. To
   quantify the underestimation of ABM as opposed to deterministic
   predictions, we employ certain probabilistic techniques: while the means
   of quasistationary probabilities distribution appear to give a
   counterintuitive prediction particularly near the edge of species
   ranges, the expected values given by state probabilities distribution
   are in agreement with the ABM densities observed for small population
   sizes across spatial locations. These salient observations depict
   emergent behaviours of stochastic ABM, which can contribute to
   additional insights on the dynamics of ecological species. It also shows
   how such small-scale interactions coupled with local dispersal and
   spatial phenomena occurring at a microscopic level can affect
   macroscopic-level dynamics. As such, comparing and contrasting the
   dynamics of different models can help in understanding the generality of
   ecological results and may offer important insights into the robustness
   of model-based predictions of species presence-absence.},

Title = {A non-destructive approach to develop tree-level allometric equations
   for estimating aboveground biomass in the forests of Tripura, Northeast
   India},

Abstract = {Forest tree biomass estimation is a significant issue for the forest
   management system and to mitigate climate change. Aboveground biomass
   (AGB) is an indicator of the potential productivity of the ecosystem.
   However, an accurate estimation method of carbon stock is important for
   perfect carbon accounting. So, selecting a more appropriate method for
   biomass assessment is crucial to reaching the goal. Though allometric
   equations have been used to estimate AGB for both individual species as
   well as multiple species for regional and pan-tropical scales,
   species-specific models for a smaller area produce better accuracy. The
   current initiative has been taken to develop individual tree-level
   species-specific and generalized local allometric models in a
   non-destructive manner for the Tripura state of Northeast India, which
   was the main limitation of carbon stock estimation in the region. Five
   different forms of log-transformed linearized power equations were
   tested in the regression models, with AGB as the response variable. The
   best fit models were chosen based on adjusted R-2, F-statistic, Akaike
   information criterion, Breusch-Pagan test, Variance Inflation Factor,
   and three assumptions of linearity. A paired t test was conducted
   between the predicted and observed AGB values. The best fit generalized
   equation developed in this study was found to be AGB = 1.03 x exp (-
   3.95 + 1.09 ln D-2 + 0.97 ln H - 0.20 N). Compared with some existing
   pan-tropical and regional models for their predictive accuracy, this
   equation expressed the highest R-2 value of 0.9089 in an independent
   testing dataset. When measuring the tree height is difficult due to a
   closed canopy, the equation AGB = 1.07 x exp (- 2.77 + 2.55 ln D) can be
   applied to obtain a quick estimation using just the DBH. The equations
   presented here may be the instrument for estimating carbon stock at the
   local level.},

Title = {Is time partitioning the currency of coexistence for a grassland canid
   community?},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Habitat and diet preferences are often considered major aspects of
   niches differentiation among species; however, partitioning of habitat
   and resource use temporally is often overlooked in modeling coexistence.
   The plasticity of temporal activity patterns of individuals may
   influence the species' response to selective forces and long-term
   persistence. Temporal avoidance may be a mechanism by which subordinate
   species can reduce the likelihood of direct competition with dominant
   sympatric species. Here, we examine temporal activity patterns of three
   canid species (swift fox Vulpes velox, red fox Vulpes vulpes and coyote
   Canis latrans) to determine how temporal activity patterns and activity
   overlap varies among species. We found that all species presented
   seasonal differences in activity patterns. When activity patterns were
   compared among species, the estimates of activity overlap in the spring
   season (i.e. breeding and pup-rearing periods) were higher than the
   activity patterns in the fall (i.e. juvenile dispersal and
   pair-formation periods); however, activity pattern overlap among species
   was significant only during the fall. Overall, these patterns revealed a
   close temporal overlap between swift fox (subordinate species) and both
   red fox and coyote (dominant species), which provides insight into
   conditions under which time partitioning may not be as clear as
   predicted, and other mechanisms may facilitate species coexistence.
   Considering swift fox population decline and distribution contraction
   across the North American grasslands, investigating temporal activity
   patterns of the canid species may reveal the implications of altering
   such patterns for individual animals, populations and ecosystems.},

   length},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wildlife management attempts to balance consumptive and non-consumptive
   values to manage hunting opportunities, considering population
   resilience. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus are particularly
   sensitive to harvest. Using data from 33 792 mountain goats harvested in
   British Columbia (BC), Canada, between 1977 and 2019, we performed
   Bayesian regressions to examine the effect of regulations (limited entry
   hunting (LEH) or general open season (GOS)) on yearly harvest and
   harvest sex ratios. We also investigated temporal trends and the effect
   of licensed hunter residency (resident in British Columbia, or not) on
   harvest sex ratios. We then examined how horn length of harvested
   mountain goats was influenced by sex, year of harvest, age and mountain
   range. The more restrictive LEH regulations generally reduced harvest of
   mountain goats. The annual proportion of males harvested appeared
   independent of regulation and increased over time. Non-resident hunters
   harvested a greater proportion of males compared to resident hunters.
   The combined length of the first and second horn growth increments
   decreased slightly with age at harvest for males but increased for
   females, suggesting a possible very weak hunter selection for males with
   rapid early horn growth and possibly against lactating females. Our
   study supports LEH regulations and hunter education to distinguish sex
   and age as key tools for mountain goat harvest management. Similar tools
   could be considered to manage other ungulates that are sensitive to
   harvest.},

Abstract = {Landscape alterations and ecosystem services (ES) are crucial elements

   landscape alterations, ES, and sustainable development at the county and
   regional scales. Results show that more than 85\% of local counties have
   a supply - demand mismatch in terms of ecosystem services. Supply -
   demand distributions for provisioning and supporting services were
   relatively balanced compared to cultural services, which were
   imbalanced. Although the overall supply - demand relationship is
   relatively balanced because of the significant influence of ecological
   restoration, it shows an increasing trend toward imbalance as human -
   land conflict is prominent in some regions. SDGs emphasize on specific
   ES information such as ecosystem conservation, sustainable agriculture,

Abstract = {The rapid conversion of highland forests into agricultural areas has
   caused deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia. Since 2017, in the Cameron
   Highlands, the Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia has reforested
   degraded highland areas by planting native tree species. To date, little
   is known about the effect of highland reforestation on wild mammals in
   the region. This study aimed to examine the relationship between mammal
   detections and habitat variables in the reforested areas that previously
   had been coverted into intensively managed vegetable farms (for at least
   10 years), using camera trapping over four forest reserves. Seven wild
   mammal species were detected across the study area, including
   conservation priority species such as the Sumatran serow (Capricornis
   sumatrensis), the otter civet (Cynogale bennettii), and the Asian golden
   cat (Catopuma temminckii). The wild boar (Sus scrofa) had the highest
   detection and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was the most common
   carnivorous species at almost all of the study sites. Eight predictor
   variables determined mammal detection numbers in the highland
   reforestation areas. Mammal detections increased with elevation, sapling
   abundance, and number of trees with a DBH above 5 cm. While, detection
   numbers decreased with the number of fallen trees, palm abundance, and
   undergrowth coverage. Mammal detections varied with forest reserves and
   sampling months. Continuous monitoring is vital to understand long term
   trends in reforestation on wild mammal communities in highland areas,
   however, the outcome of our study is very promising and suggests
   reforestation could help reverse defaunation of highland forests in
   Peninsular Malaysia.},

Title = {Optimal distance to escape terrain of bharal in presence of livestock in
   Greater Himalayan alpine rangelands},

Abstract = {Escape terrain is an integral component in species ecology for survival
   and predation avoidance, alongside other factors. For mountain
   ungulates, escape terrains are steep cliffs serving as refuge in case of
   predation or other disturbances. Mountain ungulates can exploit their
   habitat safely within certain distance from these escape terrains. This
   distance to escape terrain depends on topography,
   availability/distribution of nutritious forage and nature and extent of
   interspecific interactions in different montane habitats. Alpine
   pastures of the Greater Himalaya are shared by mountain ungulates as
   well as pastoralists who migrate to graze their livestock in
   summer-monsoon season. In such habitats, nutritious grasses are often
   distributed in patches, far away from cliffs. In presence of livestock,
   mountain ungulates have to tradeoff between food acquisition and
   avoiding predation, competition and disturbance by maintaining an
   optimal distance between their escape terrain and available forage. In
   this regard, we estimated optimal distance to escape terrain which
   bharal (Pseudois nayaur) maintains in alpine areas of Greater Himalaya.
   Spatial analysis was carried out with observation data and considering
   slopes above 45 degrees as cliffs, providing appropriate cover in our
   study area. The results revealed bharal maintained optimal distance till
   795.2 m from cliffs during livestock presence. This contrasts with Trans
   Himalayan habitat where bharal tend to remain closer to cliffs as
   nutritional forage is more evenly distributed here compared to
   cis-Himalayas. Such crucial information on topographic factors affecting
   bharal ecology with respect to livestock can help in strategizing
   management decision and species monitoring in Greater Himalayan
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Global biodiversity is in crisis as a result of human activity. This
   biodiversity crisis has been well documented by scientists, recognized
   by world leaders, politicians, businesses, and citizens. Both the
   biodiversity and climate crises need to be addressed now. 2020 was when
   this change was supposed to start, with the 15th Conference of Parties
   (COP15) of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) meeting in Kunming, and
   the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the UN Framework Convention on
   Climate Change meeting in Glasgow, but both meetings were postponed.
   COP26 was held a year late (November 2021), while COP15 was split into
   two, with the first part held in Kunming in October 2021, and the second
   part scheduled for Montreal in December 2022. This meeting in Montreal -
   arguably the most important in the CBDs history - must agree on the
   Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), to reverse biodiversity
   loss. Failure to reach agreement in Montreal would ultimately be a
   failure of us all, with irreversible consequences for life on earth.
   Yet, with three months before the final deadline only 20\% of text and
   two targets are agreed. This paper reviews the factors hindering
   progress on the agreement and suggests possible solutions.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria blooms occur frequently in lakes and reservoirs worldwide
   and the blooms are often accompanied by changes in the taste and odor of
   the water caused by cyanobacterial metabolites, such as geosmin. The
   amount of geosmin in drinking water in Japan is limited legally and
   requires regular monitoring. The approaches for detecting geosmin are
   generally based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which
   requires experienced personnel or sophisticated instrumentation. Here,
   we applied a TaqMan probe method for detecting geosmin-producing
   cyanobacteria, Anabaena (Dolichospermum) spp. in a Japanese reservoir.
   Quantitative PCR amplification using the methods which targeted geosmin
   synthase gene, worked successfully and the DNA concentrations may
   correspond with both the number of Anabaena spp. cells and the geosmin
   concentration. The tests of suitable glass microfiber filters for
   monitoring Anabaena spp. revealed that the samples filtered through GF/D
   (particle retention size 2.7 mu m) yielded significantly higher
   concentrations of Anabaena DNA compared with the samples filtered
   through the GF/F and GF/A.},

Abstract = {Diversity gradients are observed for various groups of organisms. For
   fishes in streams, the water-energy, productivity, and temporal
   heterogeneity hypotheses can explain richness patterns. The relationship
   between species diversity and the variables that represent these
   hypotheses is generally linear and stationary, that is, the effect of
   each of those variables is constant throughout a geographically defined
   area. But the assumption of spatial stationarity has not yet been tested
   on a great number of diversity gradients. Therefore, we aimed to
   quantify the spatial stationarity in the relationships between fish
   species richness in small stream (653 streams) located throughout
   Brazil, and the water-energy, productivity, and temporal heterogeneity
   hypotheses using a geographically weighted regression-GWR. There was a
   conspicuous absence of spatial stationarity in fish species richness.
   Furthermore, water-energy dynamics represented a possible metabolic
   restriction acting on the community structuring of fish species richness
   in streams. This mechanism separated the fish fauna into two regions:
   (i) The Amazonian region, characterized by a stable climate and
   populations that are less resistant to climatic variation; and (ii) The
   central region, featured by greater ranges of temperature and fish
   populations that are resistant to climatic variation.},

Title = {Spatial grain size effects of landscape metrics in different gradients
   of coastal areas},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 23},
Abstract = {As an essential object of regional development and utilization, the
   coastal area was affected by the increasing human activities, resulting
   in a profound impact on the coastal landscape. However, how landscape
   metrics respond to increasing spatial grain size in coastal areas
   remains unclear. Therefore, four gradients are divided according to the
   distance from the coastline, and 16 landscape metrics are introduced in
   this study. The spatial grain size effects of multiple landscape metrics
   in different gradients of coastal areas were analyzed using the methods
   of change trend analysis, variation coefficient, and Fragstats model. It
   was revealed that apart from the diversity metrics, the responses of the
   density metrics, area and edge metrics, shape metrics, and distribution
   metrics to increasing grain size were highlighted in coastal areas.
   There were significant differences in spatial grain size effects of
   landscape metrics in different gradients of coastal areas. The
   sensitivity of most landscape metrics to increasing grain size in
   gradient I the (region near the coastline) was evidently higher than
   that of other gradients (regions far away from the coastline).
   Furthermore, the composition, proportion, and distribution of landscapes
   in different gradients of coastal areas under the influence of human
   activities are crucial factors influencing the grain size effects of
   landscape metrics.},

Abstract = {Different types of agricultural cropping systems involving wheat coupled
   with rice, maize and cotton are adapted by most of the farmers around
   the world. In order to increase the production of food grains with the
   adaptation of these cropping systems, intensive cultivation is required
   which eventually needs more quantity of macro as well as micronutrients.
   The availability of micronutrients to plants is majorly affected by
   cropping patterns and their profile distribution and the chemical pools.
   For instance, rice-wheat (R-W) cropping system depletes the available
   micronutrients status in soil. Many crops have a deep root system that
   allows them to fulfill their micronutrients requirement from deeper soil
   layers. In pedon, the surface layer of soil is richer in micronutrients
   than sub-surface soils. Thus, the knowledge of all the forms or
   fractions of micronutrient in soil and conditions that help in
   converting them to their available forms is essential. Excessive use of
   macronutrient fertilizers in soil with alkaline pH, results in an
   upsurge accumulation of micronutrients under R-W system. Consequently,
   it is essential to understand the relationship between accumulation of
   micronutrients by plants and different chemical pools of micronutrients
   and their distribution in the pedon. Also, the incorporation of
   different crops in various cropping systems has a marked influence on
   microbial communities in soil which play a crucial role in nutrient
   cycling, gaseous exchanges, aggregation and soil biochemical processes
   that ultimately influences crop productivity and soil health. Thus,
   imaging the extent of micronutrient availability to plants, various
   fractions of micronutrients and microbial community in soil under
   different cropping systems is necessary.},

Title = {Embedding trait-based ecology within indigenous knowledge to advance
   sustainable management of Tibetan rangeland},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Questions Traditional pastoralists attribute high numbers of plateau
   pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) to impoverished soils that favor more and
   better forage for pika, suggesting a bottom-up control of pika density.
   Conversely, government policies focus on excessive numbers of this small
   mammalian herbivore as the primary top-down cause of degradation in
   Tibetan rangeland. Despite concerted campaigns to reduce pika abundance
   in recent decades, the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands remains
   uncertain. Location Alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We
   proposed a conceptual model based on indigenous knowledge that predicted
   pika numbers from soil condition and plant traits. At three alpine
   meadow sites lightly grazed by livestock, we tested whether spatial
   variation in pika burrow density could be explained by changes in the
   functional composition of the plant community attributable to species
   turnover and intraspecific trait variation associated with changes in
   soil fertility. Results Due primarily to intraspecific trait variation,
   changes in the functional composition of the meadow community accounted
   for 56\%-68\% of the spatial variation in pika density, changes in the
   proportion of plant functional groups for 62\%-74\%, and changes in
   edaphic conditions for 71\%-82\%. Greater pika density was associated
   with a decline in soil phosphorus availability and a lower-growing
   vegetation profile enriched in both the quantity and quality of forage
   preferred by pikas. Conclusions These results, which are in accord with
   indigenous knowledge, suggest that compensating soil phosphorus losses
   and maintaining a well-calibrated grazing rotation can better manage
   pika populations and improve the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands.
   By combining trait-based ecology and traditional knowledge, our study
   provides new insight into both understanding the dynamic complexity of
   grazing regimes and managing rangeland sustainability.},

Abstract = {In order to achieve the learning objectives aligned with Chilean

   persist over time without the required pedagogical training, putting the
   objectives of quality, inclusion, and pertinence at risk. The
   professional development regulations do not recognize the
   characteristics of these alternative teaching trajectories-which differ
   from the typical educator so it lacks adequate strategies for
   attracting, maintaining, and preparing technical-professional teachers.
   In addition, the higher education supply is highly limited at the
   regional level to respond to this demand. Finally, we present guidelines

Title = {Fertilization and overseeding legumes on native grasslands leads to a
   hardly reversible degraded state},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {AimsDiverse practices related to livestock intensification often have a
   deep impact on grassland diversity. Moreover, alternative degraded
   states that are hardly reversible can be observed, resulting in
   low-diversity communities, dominated by invasive alien species.
   Therefore, the need arises to understand above-ground vegetation
   dynamics in these communities, and the potential of the seed bank to
   revert this degradation. In this study, we evaluated the impact of
   overseeding alien legumes coupled with phosphorus fertilization on
   native grasslands, in terms of above-ground vegetation composition and
   soil seed bank. MethodsA long-term experiment (23 years) was performed
   in eastern Uruguay with three treatments: (1) native grasslands and
   native grasslands overseeded with alien legumes and fertilized at a (2)
   moderate or (3) high phosphorus dosage. Vegetation surveys were done in
   2009 and 2019 to evaluate changes, and the seed bank was sampled in
   2019. ResultsNative grasslands had higher total richness, native species
   richness and abundance in both years, as well as a higher species
   turnover in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The dominant species
   in overseeded treatments was the invasive alien grass Cynodon dactylon.
   The seed bank was similar between treatments in terms of seed density
   and richness, but differed in composition, with a higher abundance of
   alien species in the overseeded grassland. Seed banks showed low
   similarity with the above-ground vegetation. ConclusionsThe overseeded
   grassland appears to be in a degraded state of low species diversity,
   with low turnover and invaded by alien species. The seeds in the soil
   appear to be insufficient to revert this condition and might be a
   hindrance for restoration due to the high abundance of alien species.
   Grasslands that have been degraded by long periods of fertilization and
   overseeding legumes present a great challenge for ecological
   restoration, since invasive alien species should be controlled before
   native species are reintroduced.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been widespread concern regarding the carbon
   footprint (CF) of food waste due to the key impact of CF on climate
   change, particularly as China's food waste is rising with its economic
   development. China has the largest scale of higher education in the
   world, and the amount of food waste in university canteens is
   considerable and cannot be ignored. This study attempts to assess the
   carbon footprint (CF) of food waste at Chinese universities for the
   first time based on a national survey. It is estimated that 1.55 million
   tons of food were wasted in Chinese university canteens in 2018, based
   on 9,192 samples covering 29 provinces in China. The associated CF was
   2.51 Mt CO2eq. The top two food categories contributing to the total CF
   were meat and grains, accounting for 46.28\% and 36.52\%, respectively.
   Furthermore, the location of the university was significantly associated
   with the CF of plate waste. It also indicated that household income,
   meal satisfaction, sex, education, meal days, and food-saving campaigns
   were important factors influencing the CF of food waste. This study
   highlights areas that can help reduce the environmental impact of plate
   waste. It also provides targeted measures to reduce the associated CF of
   food waste in Chinese universities.},

Abstract = {Whether environmental DNA (eDNA) testing methods are effective for
   semi-aquatic organisms that spend time both in rivers and on land
   remains unclear. We designed a species-specific primer-probe set for the
   semi-aquatic Japanese water shrew, Chimarrogale platycephala, an
   endangered top predator species for which limited ecological information
   is available. The designed primer-probe set was used to determine the
   effective sampling time for detecting eDNA from this species in running
   water. Hourly water sampling was conducted for 25 h in the autumn of
   2020. Water sampling and camera trapping were conducted in the two
   streams in which feces had been observed on stream rocks. No C.
   platycephala activity was captured by the camera traps at any sampling
   point during the investigation. However, eDNA was mainly detected at
   night in both streams and twice during the daytime in one stream; the
   eDNA detection periods differed between streams (21:00-23:00 vs.
   1:00-8:00 and daytime). These results demonstrate that eDNA testing
   methods are effective for detecting small semi-aquatic mammals. However,
   the sampling time affected the results, and eDNA was mostly detected at
   night, possibly because of the nocturnal activity of the species.
   Therefore, the sampling time should be adjusted to match the activity
   period of a species to improve the efficiency of eDNA testing for
   semi-aquatic organisms.},

Abstract = {Context. House mice (Mus musculus) on temperate Gough Island (6500 ha)
   are known for their large size, boldness, and tendency to kill large
   prey such as albatross chicks and even adults. To remove this threat, a
   mouse eradication operation was implemented in June-August 2021. How
   mice react to bait during eradications is not well understood, so we
   capitalised on this operation and conducted the first study with wild
   house mice during an actual eradication. Aim. To document how rapidly
   mouse activity declined after application of rodent bait, to improve
   eradication guidelines. Methods. We set up a monthly monitoring regime
   using 10 trail cameras without lures, active for three nights in various
   habitats around a research station, because this area supported the
   highest abundance of mice and was logistically feasible. Monitoring
   commenced before the mouse eradication operation (January-May 2021), and
   continued when rodent bait was spread (from June 2021), when mouse
   activity was monitored for 17 consecutive nights, starting the day
   before baiting. In addition, an increasing number of cameras (up to 15)
   associated with lures were set further afield in July-August to detect
   survivors. Key results. In the months before bait application, mean
   daily mouse activity was 3.2 detections/camera (range: 0-56
   detections/camera). Immediately after the first bait application,
   detection rates declined dramatically, from 9.6 to zero
   detections/camera per day on Day 4 post-baiting. From 1 week
   post-baiting, mouse detections were extremely rare on both cameras with
   and without lures. Our last mouse record, 27 days after the first bait
   application, may be related to initial rapid bait disappearance.
   Opportunistic camera traps first detected surviving mice 6 months after
   the first bait drop. Conclusions. The rapid decline in detections
   suggests that most mice consumed bait as soon as it became available,
   which is faster than what laboratory trials suggest. Future similar
   operations can expect that mouse activity will decline sharply within 1
   week, although some mice may survive longer. Implications. Documenting
   similar declines in mouse activity using cameras could inform
   operational decisions such as timing of a second bait application or
   non-target monitoring on future eradication projects. Cameras,
   particularly with attractive lures, are an effective addition to the
   mouse detection toolkit, and facilitated a timely confirmation of
   eradication outcome.},

Title = {Set free: an evaluation of two break-away mechanisms for tracking
   collars},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Context. One of the welfare and ethical challenges with tracking animals
   is ensuring that the tracking device is removed from the animal at the
   conclusion of the study. However, for animals that are not readily
   re-trapped, the impact of devices and alternatives for their retrieval
   are rarely examined. Aims. We compared the retention time of two types
   of break-away mechanisms for tracking collars deployed on mainland
   quokkas (Setonix brachyurus). Methods. We tested a cotton thread (CT)
   weak-link, where the collar was cut and then a looping stitch was made
   to link the cut ends of the collar. We compared collar retention time of
   this simple mechanism with a lightweight automatic micro timed-release
   device (mTRD, Sirtrack). Key results. Of the 17 radio collars with CT,
   the fates of 15 collars contributed to retention time data. Seven
   collars released: six fell off and were recovered 148 +/- 64 (s.d.) days
   after deployment and another collar fell off 136 days after deployment
   but could not be recovered. Eight quokkas were recaptured (161 +/- 109
   days after deployment) and collars removed. Two quokkas were each
   tracked for over a year but then disappeared. Of the 11 GPS collars
   fitted with a mTRD, the fates of nine collars contributed to retention
   time data. Two released early at 16 and 29 days and were recovered.
   Seven fell off around the scheduled release date. There were two unknown
   fates. Re-trapped collared quokkas did not show evidence of injuries
   from wearing collars or any significant change in body mass (P = 0.442).
   Conclusions. The timing of release for the CT weak-link was
   unpredictable, with a third of the collars releasing within 1 year and
   7/15 lasting only about 6 months. Over two-thirds (7/9) of the GPS
   collars fitted with timed-release device released on schedule while 2/9
   released early.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to develop and compare regression and
   classification models to predict the number of years of accreditation of

   research approach was used, using the resolutions and accreditation
   certificates of 118 pedagogy careers taught by 40 Chilean Universities
   between 2016 and 2020 (30.8\% of the national total), all of them
   examined by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA). In this sense,
   data was processed and grouped in accordance with the dimensions and
   evaluation criteria defined by the CNA. The findings obtained indicate a
   logistic regression of 75.55\% accuracy, as the most accurate
   quantitative model when determining the number of years of accreditation
   in a career. On the other hand, it was possible to verb a high variation
   between the dimensions observed, product of the large number of
   subjective evaluations, at the moment of deciding the accreditation.},

Abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O-3) is a phytotoxic air pollutant and the
   O-3-induced visible foliar injury (O-3 VFI) is a biomarker. A recently
   developed Free-air O-3 eXposure (FO3X) is a promising facility to verify
   field-observed ``O-3-like{''} VFIs and to establish a flux-based
   threshold for the O-3 VFI onset. The present study compared O-3-like VFI
   registered in the southern European forest sites with actual O-3 VFI
   observed in a FO3X experiment. The O-3-like VFIs were evaluated by eye
   in forests and thus it was subjective. According to the imaging
   analysis, we firstly demonstrated that major parts of the colors were
   similar in the field and the FO3X. The color pallets for O-3 VFI was
   species-specific and considered a advanced tool for the O-3 VFI
   diagnosis. In addition, we calculated a flux-based threshold for the O-3
   VFI onset at the FO3X based on a Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD1), which
   ranged from 4.9 to 18.1 mmol m(-2) POD1. This FO3X-derived threshold
   partly explained but did not necessarily match with the observation for
   several tree species in actual forests. The multivariate analysis showed
   that O-3 VFI was decreased by the presence of various species and
   suggested the importance of continuous monitoring activities in the
   field for the further analysis.},

Abstract = {The development of a solution for the reuse of cork waste is studied, by
   forming a coating for a cotton textile material, integrating principles
   of sustainability and circular economy. Cork is a material widely used
   to make stoppers for containers in the wine industry. Sustainable
   alternatives, such as the reuse of this type of waste, allow the
   development of high-potential materials that can be applied in various
   areas of product design. The methodology includes the design of a
   coating based on cork and Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) in the
   laboratory and a user study to determine aspects of perceived quality,
   based on Kansei engineering. User evaluations are positive regarding the
   developed prototypes. The discussion raises the relevance of the design
   of emerging materials as an alternative to traditional materials, as is
   the case of the material resulting from the experience carried out. The
   conclusions are oriented to the capabilities of cork as a resource in
   the field of material design and the design approach for its application

   crop yield, soil properties improved in structure, compaction,
   nutrients, and microbiological activity in sandy loam soils. The

Abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly experiencing stressful conditions, such as
   high temperatures, that cause corals to undergo bleaching, a process
   where they lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts. Bleaching
   threatens both corals' survival and the health of the reef ecosystems
   they create. One possible mechanism for corals to resist bleaching is
   through association with stress-tolerant symbionts, which are resistant
   to bleaching but may be worse partners in mild conditions. Some corals
   have been found to associate with multiple symbiont species
   simultaneously, which potentially gives them access to the benefits of
   both stress-sensitive and -tolerant symbionts. However, within-host
   competition between symbionts may lead to competitive exclusion of one
   partner, and the consequences of associating with multiple partners
   simultaneously are not well understood. We modify a mechanistic model of
   coral-algal symbiosis to investigate the effect of environmental
   conditions on within-host competitive dynamics between stress-sensitive
   and -tolerant symbionts and the effect of access to a tolerant symbiont
   on the dynamics of recovery from bleaching. We found that the addition
   of a tolerant symbiont can increase host survival and recovery from
   bleaching in high-light conditions. Competitive exclusion of the
   tolerant symbiont occurred slowly at intermediate light levels.
   Interestingly, there were some cases of post-bleaching competitive
   exclusion after the tolerant symbiont had helped the host recover.},

Title = {Energetic basis for bird ontogeny and egg-laying applied to the bobwhite

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Birds build up their reproductive system and undergo major tissue
   remodeling for each reproductive season. Energetic specifics of this
   process are still not completely clear, despite the increasing interest.
   We focused on the bobwhite quail - one of the most intensely studied
   species due to commercial and conservation interest - to elucidate the
   energy fluxes associated with reproduction, including the fate of the
   extra assimilates ingested prior to and during reproduction. We used the
   standard Dynamic Energy Budget model, which is a mechanistic
   process-based model capable of fully specifying and predicting the life
   cycle of the bobwhite quail: its growth, maturation and reproduction. We
   expanded the standard model with an explicit egg-laying module and
   formulated and tested two hypotheses for energy allocation of extra
   assimilates associated with reproduction: Hypothesis 1, that the energy
   and nutrients are used directly for egg production; and Hypothesis 2,
   that the energy is mostly spent fueling the increased metabolic costs
   incurred by building up and maintaining the reproductive system and,
   subsequently, by egg-laying itself. Our results suggest that Hypothesis
   2 is the more likely energy pathway. Model predictions capture well the
   whole ontogeny of a generalized northern bobwhite quail and are able to
   reproduce most of the data variability via variability in (i) egg size,
   (ii) egg-laying rate and (iii) inter-individual physiological
   variability modeled via the zoom factor, i.e. assimilation potential.
   Reliable models with a capacity to predict physiological responses of
   individuals are relevant not only for experimental setups studying
   effects of various natural and anthropogenic pressures on the quail as a
   bird model organism, but also for wild quail management and
   conservation. The model is, with minor modifications, applicable to
   other species of interest, making it a most valuable tool in the
   emerging field of conservation physiology.},

Title = {Modelling the impact of condition-dependent responses and lipid-store
   availability on the consequences of disturbance in a cetacean},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Lipid-store body condition is fundamental to how animals cope with
   environmental fluctuations, including anthropogenic change. As it
   provides an energetic buffer, body condition is expected to influence
   risk-taking strategies, with both positive and negative relationships
   between body condition and risk-taking posited in the literature.
   Individuals in good condition may take more risks due to state-dependent
   safety ('ability-based' explanation), or alternatively fewer risks due
   to asset protection and reduced need to undertake risky foraging
   ('needs-based' explanation). Such state-dependent responses could drive
   non-linear impacts of anthropogenic activities through feedback between
   body condition and behavioural disturbance. Here, we present a simple
   bioenergetic model that explicitly incorporates hypothetical body
   condition-dependent response strategies for a cetacean, the sperm whale.
   The model considered the consequences of state-dependent foraging
   cessation and availability of wax ester (WE) lipids for calf
   provisioning and female survival. We found strikingly different
   consequences of disturbance depending on strategy and WE availability
   scenarios. Compared with the null strategy, where responses to
   disturbance were independent of body condition, the needs-based strategy
   mitigated predicted reductions in provisioning by 10\%-13\%, while the
   ability-based strategy exaggerated reductions by 63\%-113\%. Lower WE
   availability resulted in more extreme outcomes because energy stores
   were smaller relative to the daily energy balance. In the 0\%
   availability scenario, while the needs-based strategy reduced deaths by
   100\%, the ability-based strategy increased them by 335\% relative to
   null and by 56\% relative to the same strategy under the 5\%-6.7\% WE
   availability scenario. These results highlight that state-dependent
   disturbance responses and energy store availability could substantially
   impact the population consequences of disturbance. Our ability to set
   appropriate precautionary disturbance thresholds therefore requires
   empirical tests of ability- vs needs-based response modification as a
   function of body condition and a clearer understanding of energy store
   availability.
   Body condition-dependent risk-taking is observed in many animal taxa but
   is little explored in cetaceans. We used model simulations to explore
   how uncertainties surrounding this behaviour and the metabolic
   physiology of deep-diving cetaceans may be limiting our understanding of
   the energetic consequences of anthropogenic disturbance.},

Title = {Blood biochemistry and hematology of adult and chick brown pelicans in
   the northern Gulf of Mexico: baseline health values and ecological
   relationships},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The northern Gulf of Mexico supports a diverse community of nearshore
   seabirds during both breeding and nonbreeding periods of the annual
   cycle and is also a highly industrialized marine ecosystem with
   substantial levels of oil and gas development particularly in the west
   and central regions. Stakeholders in the region often assess risk to
   species of interest based on these differing levels of development. We
   collected blood samples from 81 adult and 35 chick eastern brown
   pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis carolinensis) from 10 colonies across
   the northern Gulf of Mexico and used these to establish baseline values
   for hematology and blood biochemistry. We assessed the potential
   influence of body condition, sex and home range size on hematology and
   blood biochemistry. We also assessed potential influences of oil and gas
   activity by considering differing levels of oil and gas development that
   occur regionally throughout the study area. Although blood analyte
   concentrations of adults and chicks were often associated with these
   regional differences, the pattern we observed was not entirely
   consistent with the differing levels of oil and gas activity across the
   Gulf, suggesting that regional levels of oil and gas activity around
   breeding sites may not be the primary drivers of hematology and blood
   biochemistry. We note that baseline values or reference intervals are
   not available for other nearshore seabirds that breed in the northern
   Gulf. Given that exposure and risk may differ among this suite of
   species based on diet, foraging strategies and life history strategies,
   similar assessments and monitoring may be warranted.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has introduced a series of environmental problems
   worldwide, and particulate matter (PM) is one of the main threats to
   human health. Due to the lack of high-resolution, large-scale monitoring
   data, few studies have analyzed the intraurban spatial distribution
   pattern of PM at a fine scale. In this study, portable air monitors
   carried by five taxis were used to collect the concentrations of PM1,
   PM2.5 and PM10 for five months in Shenyang during the heating season.
   The results showed that high concentrations of PM were distributed in
   the suburbs, while relatively low concentration areas were found in the
   central area. Agricultural, industrial and development zones had higher
   concentration values among the eight observed types. The PM
   concentration exhibited strong spatial autocorrelation based on Moran's
   I index analysis. Meteorological factors were the most important
   influencing factors of the three pollutants, and their total
   contribution rate accounted for more than 80\% among the 13 factors
   according to boosted regression trees analysis. The taxi monitoring
   method we proposed was a more efficient and feasible method for
   monitoring urban air pollution and could obtain higher spatial-temporal
   resolution data at a lower cost to elucidate the region's dynamic air
   pollution distribution patterns.},

   recently studied in marine and freshwater environments. However, our
   understanding of MP effect on terrestrial ecosystems, especially carbon
   (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover remains poor. This review summarizes the
   sources and distribution characteristics of MPs in terrestrial
   ecosystems and explores their effects on soil properties, plant growth,
   C and N turnover. Once entering the terrestrial ecosystem, MPs could
   involve in sequestrating carbon and nitrogen by changing soil properties
   (e.g., pH, soil aggregate stability, and soil porosity). MPs could exert
   direct influences on plants or on soil physical environment and
   microbial metabolic environment to indirectly affect plant growth, thus
   altering the quantity and quality of soil C and N inputs by shifts in
   plant litter and roots. The changes of the dominant bacteria phyla,
   related functional genes, and enzymes caused by MP pollution could
   affect C and N cycles. Additionally, the MP effect varies with its
   properties (e.g., types, shapes, elemental composition, functional
   groups, released additives). Future researches should unify the standard
   system of MP separation, detection, and reveal the ecological effects of
   MPs, especially their impacts on terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles
   in the context of climate changes.},

Abstract = {The article aims to highlight some of the most representative aspects of
   the creation and crisis of private banking at the end of the 19th
   century in the province of Neiva, a peripheral population located in the
   south of Colombia. The research was approached from the theoretical
   perspective of the trust and commitment of the clients towards the
   banking establishments. It was carried out from the deductive method and
   of a documentary nature. In this regard, the tracking and documentary
   analysis carried out in the newspapers of the time, the gazettes and the
   notarial file, allowed to identify and reconstruct financial aspects of
   the banks of Neiva and Tolima at the end of the 19th century, with which
   it will expose that, at the less, in the case of the banks created
   during this period in the aforementioned province, it was not
   exclusively the state with the use of formal mechanisms (such as the
   issuance of Law 39 of 1880), who determined their liquidation, but that
   there was another, factor of greater incidence: the lack of confidence
   by the public and the shareholders themselves in the nascent private
   financial system.},

Abstract = {Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), a highly polyphagous lepidopteran
   pest, is impacting millions of hectares of maize crops and thereby
   posing a major threat to food security. Yet, up till present, limited
   research has been conducted on the biological determinants and digestive
   enzymes of S. frugiperda fed on different plants. Our results showed
   that there were differences in developmental duration, and body and
   pupal weight by statistical data. Individuals from F1 and F3 generations
   fed on Zea mays had the shortest development period, and the 10d weight
   (0.173mg, 0.177mg) and pupa weight (0.171mg, 0.193mg) were the heaviest,
   while the 10d weight (0.046mg, 0.054mg) and pupa weight (0.108mg,
   0.138mg) were the lightest in those fed on Eleusin indica and Triticum
   aestivum, respectively. There were also significant differences in the
   digestive enzyme activities of S. frugiperda fed on four host plants.
   The ttypsin activity, a-amylase activity, and lipase activity were the
   highest in F1 larvae fed on Z. mays. In F3 generation, ttypsin activity
   had a high level in Z. mays, which was 856.26 folds higher than that in
   Triticum aestivum, which indicate digestive enzymes play key roles in
   helping S. frugiperda to adapt to the host plants. These findings
   provided a foundation for further understanding the role of digestive
   enzyme in S. frugiperda larvae in response to host plants.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Catch-and-release fishing is an important component of ecotourism
   industries and scientific research worldwide, but its total impact on
   animal physiology, health and survival is understudied for many species
   of fishes, particularly sharks. We combined biologging and blood
   chemistry to explore how this fisheries interaction influenced the
   physiology of two widely distributed, highly migratory shark species:
   the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and the tiger shark (Galeocerdo
   cuvier). Nineteen sharks were caught by drum line or rod-and-reel
   angling; subcutaneous body temperature measurements were taken
   immediately upon capture, with six individuals also providing subsequent
   subcutaneous body temperature measurements via biologging as they swam
   freely for several hours post-release. We found that short-term capture
   caused shark body temperature to increase significantly and rapidly,
   with increases of 0.6 degrees C-2.7 degrees C for blue sharks (mean, 1.2
   +/- 0.6 degrees C) and 0.5 degrees C-0.9 degrees C for tiger sharks
   (mean, 0.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and with capture-induced heating rates of
   blue sharks averaging 0.3 degrees C min(-1) but as high as 0.8 degrees C
   min(-1). Blue shark body temperature was even higher deeper into the
   white muscle. These heating rates were three to eight times faster than
   maximum rates encountered by our biologging sharks swimming through
   thermally stratified waters and faster than most acute heating
   experiments conducted with ectotherms in laboratory experiments.
   Biologging data showed that body temperatures underwent gradual decline
   after release, returning to match water temperatures 10-40 mins
   post-release. Blood biochemistry showed variable lactate/glucose levels
   following capture; however, these concentrations were not correlated
   with the magnitude of body temperature increase, nor with body size or
   hooking time. These perturbations of the natural state could have
   immediate and longer-term effects on the welfare and ecology of sharks
   caught in catch-and-release fisheries and we encourage further study of
   the broader implications of this reported phenomenon.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the influence of soil variables (pH, total
   potassium (TK), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), total
   phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), cation exchange capacity ,
   soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (Moisture), subsurface
   temperature (TEMP), and metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn)) on
   the distribution patterns of earthworm ecological categories, diversity,
   and species composition in Hebei Province, North China. In total, 535
   earthworms were collected from 18 sites, and belonged to three families,
   six genera, and ten species. Drawida gisti (17.9 inds m(-2), 37.8\%) and
   Amynthas hupeiensis (9.3 inds m(-2), 39.5\%) were the dominant species.
   The Co-inertia analysis ranking results among the soil factors and
   earthworms indicated that SOC and AK enhanced the earthworm density (R =
   0.76{*}{*}, p < 0.01; R = 0.77{*}{*}, p < 0.01). The distribution
   patterns of epigeic and endogeic species appeared to follow an opposite
   trend to soil variables (SOC, K, and Moisture) under different
   agricultural management practices. Anecic species differed considerably
   from the other ecotypes, and were unaffected by the soil properties
   (except for TEMP) and metals. The redundancy analysis results showed
   that the abovementioned dominant species (D. gisti and A. hupeiensis)
   belong to ecological groups with different propensities for the soil
   factors (K, P, and SOC). Overall, the soil metal (Cd and Pb)
   concentrations were not the dominant regressors for the earthworm
   assemblage. Soil properties (K and SOC) were the main factors affecting
   earthworm density, category, and species dominance in the study areas.},

   catch-and-release fishing},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is often touted as a sustainable form
   of ecotourism, yet the fine-scale behaviour and physiological responses
   of released fish is often unknown, especially for hard-to-study large
   pelagic species like Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT; Thunnus thunnus).
   Multi-channel sensors were deployed and recovered from 10 ABFTs in a
   simulated recreational C\&R event off the west coast of Ireland. Data
   were recorded from 6 to 25 hours, with one ABFT (tuna X) potentially
   suffering mortality minutes after release. Almost all ABFTs (n = 9,
   including tuna X) immediately and rapidly (vertical speeds of similar to
   2.0 m s(-1)) made powered descents and used 50-60\% of the available
   water column within 20 seconds, before commencing near-horizontal
   swimming similar to 60 seconds post-release. Dominant tailbeat frequency
   was similar to 50\% higher in the initial hours post-release and
   appeared to stabilize at 0.8-1.0 Hz some 5-10 hours post-release.
   Results also suggest different short-term behavioural responses to
   noteworthy variations in capture and handling procedures (injury and
   reduced air exposure events). Our results highlight both the immediate
   and longer-term effects of C\&R on ABFTs and that small variations in
   C\&R protocols can influence physiological and behavioural responses of
   species like the commercially valuable and historically over-exploited
   ABFT.},

Abstract = {Reintroduction programs are important tools for wildlife conservation.
   However, captive rearing environments may lead to maladaptive behavior
   and physiological alterations that reduce survival probability after
   release. For captive rearing programs that raise individuals captured
   from the wild during early ontogeny for later release, there is a lack
   of information about when during ontogeny the detrimental effects of
   captive rearing may become evident. In this study we compared cortisol
   levels, predation rates and swimming behavior between hatchery-produced
   and wild-caught larval lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a
   threatened fish species, at three times over 9 days. Cortisol levels did
   not indicate that hatchery-produced individuals were more stressed, but
   cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor disappeared for both
   hatchery-produced and wild-caught larvae after 9 days in the hatchery.
   Swimming activity levels decreased over time for hatchery-produced
   larvae but increased over time for wild-caught larvae, suggesting that
   behavioral trajectories may be programmed prior to the larval stage.
   Neither increasing nor decreasing activity levels was advantageous for
   survival, as predation rates increased over time in captivity for larvae
   from both treatments. Results suggest that physiological and behavioral
   phenotypes may not accurately predict survival for individuals released
   from reintroduction programs and that the captive environment may
   inhibit transition to the wild even if cortisol levels do not indicate
   high stress. Findings emphasize that even a short amount of time in
   captivity during early ontogeny can affect phenotypes of individuals
   captured from wild populations, which may impact the success of
   reintroduction programs.},

Title = {Short-term response of research activities on white shark behaviour},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {260-271},
Abstract = {Context: Researchers studying animals need to ensure that sampling
   procedures and the methods they use are as harmless and non-disruptive
   as possible, particularly when their focal species are threatened or
   protected. White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are Vulnerable under
   the IUCN Red List, protected globally, and are frequently studied by
   marine ecologists. Aims: To assess white shark responses to research
   activities (i.e. tagging and biopsy procedures, and electric deterrent
   trials) conducted at the Neptune Islands Group Marine Park (South
   Australia, Australia). Methods: Trends in shark residency following
   research activities were assessed by comparing shark abundance (number
   of sharks detected by acoustic receivers and sighted by cage-diving
   operators) before, during, and after scientific expeditions, and to
   natural fluctuations in the absence of research activities using 8 years
   (2013-2021) of acoustic tracking and daily sighting reports from a
   wildlife tourism industry. Key results: Number of white sharks and
   residency decreased after sampling. However, changes observed following
   research activities were similar to natural fluctuations, suggesting
   that these changes reflected natural variations rather than being due to
   sharks responding negatively to the research activities. Conclusions:
   Our study showed that external tagging, biopsies, or deterrent trials do
   not affect short- and long-term residency or abundance of white sharks,
   probably owing to the research activities being minimally intrusive and
   to sharks having efficient immune systems and remarkable ability to heal
   from injuries.},

Title = {Estimation of above and belowground biomass for grass, herb, and fern

Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {There are no models for estimating the above- and belowground biomass
   (AGB and BGB) of herbaceous and fern species in Southeast Asia, and
   therefore we developed a set of allometric equations for this purpose
   that were applicable to Malaysia. Grass species, herbs, and ferns of
   different sizes were harvested and excavated to measure the AGB and BGB.
   After being harvested and oven-dried, the biomass of plant parts was
   weighed to develop allometric equations between plant size parameters
   (height and diameter) and biomass. When comparing the allometric
   equations among the three plant groups (grass, herbs, and ferns), no
   differences were found between grass and fern groups in both AGB and
   BGB, whereas herbs versus grass and/or ferns significantly differed.
   This suggests that the accuracy of the estimation may improve if plant
   species were separated into these groups. The allometric equation, which
   pooled all groups, also showed significant relation with high
   correlation coefficient, and thus it was possible to make estimations
   with a certain degree of accuracy, even without grouping. The ratio of
   BGB to AGB (RSR) increased with plant size for herbs and ferns, whereas
   the RSR was constant with plant size for grasses. These relationships
   indicated that the RSR potentially used to estimate BGB from AGB with
   size parameter in each group, though there was larger variation compared
   with allometric equations. We concluded that developed allometric
   equations and the RSR can be used to estimate the AGB and/or BGB without
   the destructive sampling of grassland species in the region.},

Abstract = {In 2002 the World Bank (WB) adopted the so-called Sustaining Forests: A
   Development Strategy, in accordance with the commitments assumed in the
   Rio Declaration (ONU, 1992). In recent decades, this multilateral
   financial institution has man-aged a significant volume of resources for
   development projects aimed at the forestry sector in China, contributing
   to the growth of the tree mass, which is increasing, representing 23.3\%
   of the total its surface in 2020. The purpose of this research is, first
   of all, to know the activities financed and the amount received by the
   Asian country between 2002 and 2021, which are intended to contribute to
   the sustainability of forests. Second, the relative importance of these
   resources is analyzed both in relation to the rest of the actions that
   have obtained financing in the country and in the geographical
   distribution of the Bank's active operations in forestry. The work is
   based on an extensive literature review on China's forest policy in
   recent decades and statistical information obtained from the World Bank
   and FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) databases. The study
   carried out contributes to the scarce literature on financing and
   recovery of forests and allows conclusions to be drawn to guide the
   development of actions in favor of sustainable forest management.},

Abstract = {The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan
   implemented the College Students-in-Residence Rural Community
   Competition Program in 2011 in Taiwan. The program provides incentives
   through competition, encourages young students to travel to rural

   funding, human and material resources for counselling and coordination.
   The program brings students with expert knowledge and new ideas to rural
   communities. Thus far, most research on the benefits of the program has
   been based on the results of quantitative questionnaire surveys.
   However, these do not provide insight into the experiences of individual
   participants in the program. Therefore, this study adopted a responsive
   evaluation approach to qualitative policy evaluation and conducted
   in-depth interviews to learn about the participants' understanding of
   and views on the program through accounts of their participation
   experiences and impressions. The results of this study can help to
   address the shortcomings of current quantitative policy evaluations and
   provide a reference for related agencies to improve policy management

Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The lack of space in cities has favoured the development of vertical
   gardens in indoor and outdoor environments. For an adequate development
   and appearance of the plants in these living walls, it is necessary to
   provide nutrients (usually by means of fertigation). One of the main
   limitations is the difficulty in obtaining a uniform distribution of
   nutrients, especially in felt systems. The objective of this research
   was to identify whether the distribution of nutrients (particularly iron
   and phosphorous) applied by fertigation in a felt living wall depended
   on the species used and the location of the plants in height. Three
   modules of a Fytotextile (R) felt-based living wall were used, each
   module containing three columns of different species: Soleirolia
   soleirolii, Philodendron hederaceum, and Nephrolepis exaltata.
   Fertigation was applied using a Hoagland-Arnon solution for 4 months.
   Measurements of leaf area, normalised difference vegetation index
   (NDVI), chlorophyll meter readings (CMR), fresh and dry weight, and P
   and Fe concentration were carried out for each of the plants. Comparing
   variables within the same species at different heights showed no
   significant differences in the variables. This means that the
   distribution of nutrients along the living wall (especially in height)
   was uniform. It is important to note that these results could vary for
   other types of living walls or for other configurations of the
   fertigation system.},

Title = {A phylogenetic investigation of the taxonomically problematic Eucalyptus

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {To investigate the relationships among species in the taxonomically
   problematic Eucalyptus odorata species complex, we generated molecular
   data using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   (ddRADseq) and Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArTseq). These
   data were analysed utilising principal-component analysis (PCA),
   phylogenetic networks, phylogeny reconstruction and hybridisation tests.
   Twelve species that are variously recognised in the complex were sampled
   from across their ranges, along with co-occurring members of E. section
   Adnataria, to allow for patterns of hybridisation and gene flow to be
   identified. Despite the large genetic datasets generated, many
   relationships within the E. odorata complex were poorly resolved, and
   few species were monophyletic, likely owing to both biological factors
   including recent speciation and extensive hybridisation and
   introgression, and potential over-splitting of taxa. We show that
   multiple taxa with limited distributions are the result of reticulate
   evolutionary events and that typical Eucalyptus viridis R.T.Baker and
   the possibly con-specific E. aenea K.D.Hill are sister to the rest of
   the complex. The remaining species appeared to represent a discontinuous
   crescent-shaped cline running from the Flinders Ranges to the
   south-western slopes region of New South Wales, with limited support for
   an east-west split in this cline across the Murray River Basin.
   Eucalytpus viridis var. latiuscula Blakely, which is not closely related
   to the typical variety of this species in our data, may represent a
   northern extension to this cline.},

Abstract = {Although some authors previously questioned the circumscription of
   Nicotiana benthamiana, it has never been treated taxonomically as more
   than a single widespread, variable species. A recent study employing
   phylogenetic and population genetic analyses has demonstrated that N.
   benthamiana comprises five species that are geographically and
   morphologically distinct. Here, we describe four new species in the N.
   benthamiana complex, namely, N. bilybara M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N.
   candelabra M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N. rupestris M.W.Chase \& Christenh.
   and N. scopulorum M.W.Chase \& Christenh., and illustrate all five. We
   provide descriptions, a diagnostic key and a table of morphological
   characters distinguishing these closely related species. The major
   morphological feature that distinguishes N. benthamiana from the other
   four species is its petiolate leaves that become sessile only near the
   apex of the inflorescence; N. candelabra is distinct in its bifacial
   branching, N. bilybara in its commonly winged petiole with an auriculate
   base, N. rupestris in the leafy apices of its calyx lobes, and N.
   scopulorum is the least morphologically divergent species, conforming
   most closely to the general description of the N. benthamiana species
   complex.},

Title = {Disentangling the effects of phosphorus, nitrogen and species identity
   on the vegetation reflectance spectrum},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Questions Effective and successful restoration of species-rich
   semi-natural grasslands requires knowledge of the soil nutrient status,
   including soil phosphorus availability. Plants are solid indicators of
   soil nutrient status, because their growth reflects nutrient
   availability integrated over a certain period. The use of reflectance
   spectroscopy to estimate vegetation nutrient content has the potential
   to offer a fast and efficient approach to provide information about soil
   nutrient availability for plants. Here, we investigated the effect and
   relative importance of vegetation phosphorus content compared with
   vegetation nitrogen content and species identity in explaining variation
   in vegetation reflectance. Location Pot experiment mimicking Western
   European grassland communities on a restoration trajectory. Methods We
   combined a pot experiment with a broad range of mesotrophic grassland
   species growing along a soil phosphorus gradient with a multivariate
   modelling approach. We measured vegetation spectra and vegetation
   phosphorus and nitrogen content in monocultures and mixtures. Results
   Although vegetation biochemistry explained a considerable part of the
   variation in vegetation reflectance, we found no pronounced absorption
   features for vegetation nitrogen and phosphorus content across the
   reflectance spectrum. The relatively large effect of species and
   community identity suggest that other drivers, for example vegetation
   architecture, overruled the effect of vegetation biochemistry on the
   reflectance spectrum. Our findings indicate that species detection and
   indirect case-specific estimation of nutrients is possible, especially
   in structurally less-complex canopies such as monospecific grass swards.
   Conclusions Disentangling the specific drivers of variation in spectral
   reflectance is challenging. Many studies confound the effect of species
   identity on the vegetation reflectance spectrum with the effect of
   vegetation biochemistry. Here, we showed the importance of explicitly
   taking species identity into account. Gaining insight into
   light-vegetation interactions and the in-depth integration of ecological
   theory in remote sensing are the way forward.},

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Questions(1) What can be learned by extending a national classification
   into unsampled forest types? (2) Are both remotely sensed and
   environmental predictors needed to model and map associations? (3) For
   mapping, are LiDAR-generated canopy structure parameters or reflectance
   from spectral imagery more useful? (4) How can we assess uncertainty of
   a final map? LocationWarawara Forest, Northland, New Zealand. MethodsWe
   sampled 205 vegetation plots and assigned them to an existing national
   classification using the fuzzy classification framework of noise
   clustering. Plots too distinct to be assigned were used to define new
   associations. We produced spatial models of each association using
   boosted regression trees. Predictors included 11 environmental, 11
   canopy reflectance, and 17 canopy structure variables. We created a
   composite map by assigning each map pixel to the association with the
   highest occurrence probability. We evaluated uncertainty by examining
   locations where no class was predicted with probability above 0.2 and by
   creating a confusion map based on entropy. ResultsForty-five plots were
   assigned to six of 79 existing national associations and 147 plots were
   used to define two new forest associations. Three shrubland types are
   widespread nationally, whereas two young forest types are northern.
   Three mature forest types are narrowly distributed nationally, with the
   new ``High-elevation hardwood forest{''} largely restricted to Warawara
   Forest. Three associations were mapped using remotely sensed predictors
   alone, whereas two also required environmental predictors. Overall,
   canopy reflectance predictors explained more deviance than canopy
   structure. Examining locations where no association was predicted well
   and where multiple associations were predicted equally showed areas
   mapped as younger forests to have greatest uncertainty. ConclusionsIn
   answering our questions, we present a vegetation classification and map
   for Warawara Forest that provides a framework to guide the indigenous
   people's management responses to threats to valued communities and their
   species.},

Abstract = {The research analyzes the impacts of tourism in the Villa de Zaachila,
   Oaxaca, considering community perceptions and their relationship with
   sustainable development in the context of COVID-19. A five-point
   Likert-type scale was used, over a three-year period, considering time
   variables (before, during, and after) related to the pandemic and its
   link with social, economic, and environmental issues. Representative
   local stakeholders in the tourism sector were interviewed using
   qualitative convenience sampling. Community tourism operators'
   perception of tourism activity was erroneous, as they considered it
   irrelevant. However, they were indirectly dependent on the consumption
   of goods and services by visitors from outside the community. Changes
   and adaptations were made at the community level that made it possible
   to cope with the pandemic and identify the importance of tourists to the
   community's economy and development. The authors conclude that
   perceptions play a significant role in the analysis of reality and in
   the success of any community tourism project to achieve development

Title = {Burning the seed bank: Seed response of eight species to different fire
   intensities in Patagonian steppe},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Questions: Fire intensity influences the soil seed bank in fire-prone
   environments. The aim of this investigation was to study the effects of
   fire intensity on seed germination and seedling growth of native species
   which belong to three functional groups (grasses, shrubs, and fire
   ephemerals). We addressed the following questions: (1) How does fire
   intensity affect the seed germination and seedling growth of the
   functional groups? Are there differences among species within each
   functional group? (2) How do seed traits (shape, size, protection
   structures of seeds, and embryo position) influence the resistance to
   high temperatures? (3) What conclusions at the community level can we
   infer from our results?
   Location: Northwestern Patagonian grasslands, Argentina.
   Methods: We performed two experimental burns using different amounts of
   grassland biomass to simulate low and high fire intensities on sowed
   seeds of eight native species (four grasses, two shrubs, and two fire
   ephemerals). We calculated the frequency of seed germination, mean
   germination time, and estimated seedling growth by weighing the dry
   biomass (roots and leaves). We examined the relationship of seed mass,
   length, and shape to the percentage of seed germination in low- and
   high-temperature treatments.
   Results: Both temperature treatments negatively affected the seed
   germination of all functional groups and species, except for the fire
   ephemeral Boopis gracilis with protected linear embryos. Among grasses,
   the presence of protective structures in Pappostipa speciosa seeds and
   of hairs in Poa ianuginosa seeds probably provides resistance to high
   temperatures. Root growth of seedlings of the grasses Pappostipa
   speciosa and Festuca paliescens was stimulated by high-temperature
   treatment ensuring post-fire establishment.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that fire intensity influences the
   post-fire seed germination and seedling growth of the three dominant
   functional groups of northwestern Patagonian grasslands. In addition, we
   can affirm that the species of these functional groups have adaptations
   to resist wildfires and are capable of exploiting post-fire resources.},

Title = {Increased diversity of the species pool via seeding augments
   establishment of native species in experimental vacant-lot restorations},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Question The harsh geophysical template characterized by the urban
   environment combined with people's choices has led ecologists to invoke
   environmental filtering as the main ecological phenomenon explaining
   urban biodiversity patterns. Yet, dispersal is often overlooked as a
   driving factor, especially on expanding vacant land. Does overcoming
   dispersal limitation by seeding native species in urban environments and
   increasing the functional or phylogenetic diversity of the seeding pool
   increase native plant species diversity and abundance in urban vacant
   land? Location Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Methods We took an experimental
   approach to learn how different dimensions of plant biodiversity within
   a regional species pool augmented via seed additions, can explain
   variation in community structure over a three-year period. Vacant lots
   were cleared and manipulated with seeding treatments of high or low
   phylogenetic and functional diversities from a pool of 28 native
   species. Establishment success, total native cover and native-species
   richness were followed and compared to cleared, unseeded control lots as
   well as unmanipulated lots. Results Seeding increased native plant
   abundance and richness over uncleared plots, as well as cleared and
   unseeded control plots. Phylogenetically diverse seed mixtures had
   greater establishment success than mixtures composed of closely related
   species. Diversifying seed mixtures increased the likelihood of
   including species that are better able to establish on vacant land.
   However, there were no differences in varying levels of either
   functional or phylogenetic diversity. Conclusions Augmenting the
   regional species pool via diverse seed mixtures can enhance native plant
   cover and richness under the harsh environmental conditions conferred by
   land abandonment.},

Abstract = {A prevailing hypothesis of microbial biogeography holds that all species
   are ubiquitous, but this may lead to fitting Pacific specimens into
   European taxa on the basis of light microscopy. There is now evidence of
   regional endemicity in freshwater diatoms in Australia and recent
   studies have shown large diversity in the Guam marine Licmophora flora.
   The aim was to compare Australian samples with Guam Licmophora spp.,
   especially their girdle bands. Valves and girdle bands from samples
   collected from Australia and Micronesia were described from observations
   made via light and scanning-electron microscopy. Of the nine species
   present in Australian samples, six were previously undescribed. Species
   with unusual characters included Licmophora insolita Lobban \&
   Emm.S.Santos sp. nov. with a novel location for the apical rimoportula
   and a Tharngan strip on the valvocopula; Licmophora ballerina Lobban \&
   S.Blanco sp. nov., with distinctive 3rd and 4th pleurae; and the
   licmosphenioid Licmophora johnwestii Lobban \& Emm.S.Santos sp. nov.
   Specimens resembling Licmophora debilis (Katz.) Grunow and L abbreviata
   C.Agardh, described from Europe, occurred in Great Barrier Reef samples.
   The study brings the Guam flora to 20 novel v. 2 matching
   Atlantic-European taxa. The proportion of new to known species in
   Australian and Guam samples suggests regional endemicity, at least being
   broadly different from European Licmophora floras.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to determine the effectiveness of a
   teleworking program applied by the National Superin-tendency of Customs
   and Tax Administration of Peru (SUNAT) with a view to describe its
   effectiveness during the period of confinement by COVID-19 in the
   country. The research carried out was of a descriptive correlational
   type, the population was of a finite type, made up of 74 SUNAT
   collaborators. A positive Spearman correlation, significant at 0,521,
   was generated between the labor flexibility variable and the
   productivity variable. The organizations that had not had the
   opportunity to work remotely before the COVID-19 pandemic, were affected
   by having to drastically assume a change for which they were not
   prepared, generating adaptation and productivity problems. It is
   concluded that the program that has been implemented in the population
   sample before the COVID-19 pandemic, allowed for a favorable
   organizational management to overcome the period of confinement without
   the adversities that arise in other work environments. Consequently, it
   is important to supervise, from a flexible view of work, since it is
   natural for staff to venture into social networks and other pages not
   directly related to work. In this sense, it is reasonable to propose as
   a productivity strategy, the fulfillment of goals to be executed in
   specific periods.},

Journal = {INTERCIENCIA},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to analyze the psychological effects caused
   by Covid-19 on the workers' readiness to return to work during the
   current pandemic. A cross-sectional study was designed that explored the
   perception of fear, work stress, and burnout in a sample of 333 workers
   belonging to the maquiladora industry in northern Mexico. The
   perceptions were gathered using a Likert scale survey of 5 points based
   on previously validated scales. The statistical technique used was the
   structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The results obtained reflect that
   the fear of Covid-19 influences directly the presence of stress and
   burnout in workers. It was demonstrated that burn-out influences
   negatively and significantly the intention to re-turn to work, however,
   no evidence was found that proves the negative effect of fear of
   Covid-19 on returning to work. We conclude that the pandemic is an event
   that affects the occupational health of the maquila workers, and it
   represents new risks in the performance of work due to workers'
   exposure. This situation generates fear, stress, and burnout, which
   finally affects the readiness to return to work, with its subsequent
   effects in terms of performance.},

   ecosystems: A review},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Context Coastal wetlands are ecotones interspaced by land and ocean and
   are among the most sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide. They
   are unique in hydrological, edaphic, atmospheric, and biological
   characteristics, and play important roles in maintaining the ecological
   security and ecosystem services of coastal zones. Arbuscular mycorrhizae
   (AM) are symbiont composed of plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF), which are soil-borne microorganisms widely distributed in
   various habitats. Many previous studies on mycorrhiza have focused on
   terrestrial ecosystems while few on wetlands, especially coastal
   wetlands. Method We systematically reviewed previous relevant studies to
   explore the formation and functions of AM in coastal wetland ecosystems
   as well as the environmental factors that affect them. Habitat
   characteristics, morphological types, and species diversity of AMF in
   the coastal wetlands were summarized. Both responses of AMF to
   environmental factors during AM formation and the functions of AM in
   coastal wetlands were discussed. Result AMF are worldwide distributed in
   coastal wetland and are mainly limited by flooding, hypoxia, soil pH,
   salinity and the host plants identification. AMF play important roles in
   coastal wetlands, involving promoting nutrient uptake of host plants,
   improving the characteristics of rhizospheric soil, and enhancing plant
   resistance to salt and flooding stress. Conclusion More comprehensive
   studies of AMF in vitro in coastal wetlands would be helpful for the
   conservation and restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in the
   changing world.},

Title = {Vegetation cover and configuration drive reptile species distributions
   in a fragmented landscape},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 28},
Abstract = {Context. Habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity
   loss worldwide, yet the influence of landscape structure on species
   distributions is unknown. Globally, reptiles are thought to be
   especially sensitive to landscape modification due to their limited
   capacity for dispersal and reliance on native vegetation. New knowledge
   of how landscape structure influences species distributions is needed to
   inform conservation strategies. Aims. Our principal aim was to examine
   the influence of landscape structure on the distributions of 40
   terrestrial reptile species in Victoria, southeast Australia. Methods.
   We obtained species occurrence records from the Victorian Biodiversity
   Atlas, and used MaxEnt to model the distributions of reptile species
   within Victoria using biophysical and landscape structure variables. A
   moving window analysis was applied to a land cover map to derive five
   landscape structure metrics; two metrics represented landscape cover and
   three represented landscape configuration. Key results. Climate
   variables were generally found to be the strongest drivers of species
   distributions, although 80\% of reptile species were also influenced by
   landscape structure (permutation importance >= 5\%). Of the five
   landscape structure variables, extent of native vegetation had the
   greatest influence (30 of 40 species), followed by habitat shape. For
   Lerista bougainvillii and Tiliqua rugosa, native vegetation cover had a
   greater influence on their distributions than climate variables. Most
   species responded positively to native vegetation extent, whereas
   responses to other landscape structure variables were varied.
   Conclusions. Although most studies of reptile distributions only use
   biophysical variables in modelling, our research shows that at the scale
   of our study area, reptile species distributions were also influenced by
   landscape structure; extent of native vegetation was an important
   predictor for most species. Integrating landscape structure in modelling
   has the potential to improve our ability to predict species
   distributions. Implications. Because species distributions are likely to
   shift due to climate change, knowledge of the influence of landscape
   structure on distributions will help land managers to facilitate
   successful range expansions in fragmented landscapes. Our findings
   indicate that management focused on increasing the extent of native
   vegetation is likely to provide benefit to most reptile species.},

Title = {Plugging urban ecology science into design practice: a research
   perspective},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {There is a broad consensus that urban ecology science needs to be more
   effective in informing and supporting urban planning and design. How to
   bridge the two disciplines is still a grand challenge because scientific
   research often cannot find its way into practice. Underlying reasons
   have often been explored around governance, policies and institutional
   aspects. From a scientific research perspective, this paper briefly
   outlines the divergence between the two disciplines and seeks potential
   intersections of them. Overall, starting from the practical needs, this
   paper argues that there are many ``plug-in{''} opportunities that should
   be explored in the whole research chain to accommodate successful
   co-development of research in practice, such as sharing similar research
   interests, jointly identifying research questions and objectives,
   adopting suitable research methods, well-designed research experiments
   and parameters (e.g., matched scales, resolution levels, metrics and
   indicators), co-collection of site-specific data. Furthermore, this
   exploration can be enhanced, particularly at a local scale, where urban
   dwellers' perceptions, interests and the consequent influences on
   decision-making and actions can be well incorporated.},

Title = {Translocating captive female white-tailed deer},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {108-119},
Abstract = {Thousands of captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   facilities exist across North America for the purpose of producing
   trophy-quality deer (i.e., exceptionally large-antlered). Many of these
   deer get marketed to private landowners with the expectation that
   introduced deer will enhance genetics in the population, resulting in
   larger-antlered male deer. Previous research suggests that white-tailed
   deer experience highly variable survival and reproductive success
   post-translocation, however, little is known about the fate of
   translocated white-tailed deer sourced from captive-breeding operations.
   We translocated 24 adult female deer over a 3-year period into a
   private, 300-ha high-fence enclosure in east-central Alabama. We
   monitored survival, reproductive success, and fawn recruitment of the
   translocated deer using VHF radio collars and vaginal implant
   transmitters (VITs). We found that survival rates were greater than
   studies where deer were translocated from the wild, but fawn survival
   and recruitment was poor. We believe our findings provide a baseline of
   expectations for captive deer translocations. Our following research
   objectives focus on improving camera survey output for white-tailed deer
   by reducing sex-age misclassifications. Previous research suggests that
   misclassifications may be an important source of error in wildlife
   camera surveys. We developed and tested the effects of species-specific
   training material designed to reduce sex-age misclassification
   associated with white-tailed deer images. We found exposure to training
   material produced the greatest significant improvement on classification
   accuracy of deer images compared to any other respondent-based factors
   we investigated. We also found that other experiential factors were
   positively associated with classification accuracy of deer images. Our
   findings suggest that use of species-specific training material can
   reduce misclassifications, leading to more reliable data.},

Abstract = {Rhodeus atremius suigensis is an extremely endangered bitterling fish,
   designated as one of the Nationally Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
   Flora by the Ministry of Environment of Japan. To prevent its
   extinction, effective ecological survey methods are necessary in order
   to guide habitat management. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis
   has proven useful for detection and censusing of endangered aquatic
   species that are difficult to locate and capture. In this study, we
   developed and evaluated a semi-quantitative system to track R. a.
   suigensis using eDNA. We designed primers and a fluorescent probe
   specific to the mitochondrial gene for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1
   (ND-1) of R. a. suigensis for quantitative real-time PCR. We first
   confirmed the utility of this analysis in aquarium experiments, before
   performing field surveys. We sampled water for eDNA analysis and set
   fish traps at 48 points in an agricultural channel in the Ashida River
   basin, inhabited by R. a. suigensis, and examined the relationship
   between fish occurrence and eDNA concentration. The concentration was
   correlated with the distance downstream from the point where specimens
   of R. a. suigensis were captured, indicating that the eDNA concentration
   reflects distribution and abundance of R. a. suigensis. These results
   not only demonstrate the reliability of this method, but also suggest
   its feasibility for conservation measures.},

Title = {The effect of temperature on specific dynamic action of juvenile
   fall-run Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin experience temporally and spatially
   heterogenous temperature regimes, between cool upper tributaries and the
   warm channelized Delta, during freshwater rearing and outmigration.
   Limited water resources necessitate human management of dam releases,
   allowing temperature modifications. The objective of this study was to
   examine the effect of temperature on specific dynamic action (SDA), or
   the metabolic cost associated with feeding and digestion, which is
   thought to represent a substantial portion of fish energy budgets.
   Measuring SDA with respect to absolute aerobic scope (AAS), estimated by
   the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), provides a snapshot of its respective energy
   allocation. Fish were acclimated to 16 degrees C, raised or lowered to
   each acute temperature (13 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22
   degrees C or 24 degrees C), then fed a meal of commercial pellets
   weighing 2\% of their wet mass. We detected a significant positive
   effect of temperature on SMR and MMR, but not on AAS. As expected, there
   was no significant effect of temperature on the total O-2 cost of
   digestion, but unlike other studies, we did not see a significant
   difference in duration, peak metabolic rate standardized to SMR, time to
   peak, percent of meal energy utilized, nor the ratio of peak O-2
   consumption to SMR. Peak O-2 consumption represented 10.4-14.5\% of AAS
   leaving a large amount of aerobic capacity available for other
   activities, and meal energy utilized for digestion ranged from 5.7\% to
   7.2\%, leaving substantial remaining energy to potentially assimilate
   for growth. Our juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon exhibited thermal
   stability in their SDA response, which may play a role in maintaining
   homeostasis of digestive capability in a highly heterogeneous thermal
   environment where rapid growth is important for successful competition
   with conspecifics and for avoiding predation.},

Abstract = {Actual loss of lizard biodiversity continues, even with the
   implementation of conventional conservation programs. An approach
   including assisted reproductive techniques such as sperm
   cryopreservation may contribute to the management of endangered species.
   We developed a method for sperm cryopreservation in sceloporine lizards
   and compared the response among the studied species. Prior to the mating
   season, we obtained semen from adult males of Sceloporus aeneus (n =
   21), Sceloporus grammicus (n = 20) and Sceloporus torquatus (n = 21) via
   pressure of the genital papilla. Volume and sperm concentration were
   measured before semen dilution in a Tris-egg yolk (TEY) medium to
   evaluate progressive motility, sperm viability, morphology, plasma
   membrane and acrosome integrity. Then, we cooled the remaining volumes
   to 5 degrees C at a rate of 0.1 degrees C per minute to incorporate
   glycerol (8\% v/v) in two fractions. Immediately afterwards, we placed
   40 mu l of the mix on solid CO2 to form pellets and immersed them in
   liquid nitrogen for storage. We thawed the pellets at 29 degrees C for 3
   minutes and diluted them 1:1 (v/v) in TEY medium to assess sperm
   quality. We found a positive relationship between body weight and
   seminal volume in S. grammicus and S. torquatus and a negative
   correlation with sperm concentration in S. grammicus (P < 0.05).
   Moreover, we observed that the freezing-thawing process decreased sperm
   quality in the three species, mostly affecting motility and viability.
   However, S. torquatus and S. aeneus showed a higher sperm tolerance than
   S. grammicus.},

Title = {A comparison of methods for monitoring a sparse population of the red
   fox (Vulpes vulpes) subject to lethal control using GPS telemetry,
   camera traps and sand plots},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {366-380},
Abstract = {Context. The introduced red fox has driven the decline or extinction of
   numerous wildlife species in Australia, yet little information exists on
   the population densities of foxes in most ecosystems. Fox monitoring
   programs will differ widely depending on the goals of management, which,
   in turn, will determine whether the appropriate metric is a density
   estimate, or some proxy thereof, and the time and resources required.
   Aims. This study aims to assist wildlife managers to design
   fit-for-purpose monitoring programs for foxes by providing a better
   understanding of the utility and precision of various monitoring
   methods. Methods. We surveyed foxes monthly over four consecutive years
   in a semi-arid region of Australia by using sand plots, camera traps and
   GPS telemetry. The resultant data were used to produce population
   estimates from one count-based method, two spatially explicit methods,
   and two activity indices. Key results. The incorporation of GPS-collar
   data into the spatial capture-recapture approaches greatly reduced
   uncertainty in estimates of abundance. Activity indices from sand plots
   were generally higher and more variable than were indices derived from
   camera traps, whereas estimates from N-mixture models appeared to be
   biased high. Conclusions. Our study indicated that the Allen-Engeman
   index derived from camera-trap data provided an accurate reflection of
   change in the underlying fox density, even as density declined towards
   zero following introduction of lethal control. This method provides an
   efficient means to detect large shifts in abundance, whether up or down,
   which may trigger a change to more laborious, but precise, population
   monitoring methods. If accuracy is paramount (e.g. for reintroduction
   programs) spatially explicit methods augmented with GPS data provide
   robust estimates, albeit at a greater cost in resources and expertise
   than does an index. Implications. Our study demonstrated that the
   shorter the survey period is, the greater is the likelihood that foxes
   are present but not detected. As such, if limited resources are
   available, longer monitoring periods conducted less frequently will
   provide a more accurate reflection of the underlying fox population than
   do shorter monitoring periods conducted more often.},

   from Te Waipounamu / South Island, Aotearoa, New Zealand, identified a
   priori with three different informal tag names, belong to the
   bracteate-prostrate group, are morphologically distinct from each other
   and from other species, and merit scientific description. Myosotis
   hikuwai Meudt, Prebble \& G.M.Rogers is known from one location near
   Wanaka (Otago), has an unusual erect, spring annual habit, and is most
   similar to M. brevis and M. glauca, with which it is sympatric. Myosotis
   venticola Meudt \& Prebble comprises plants that were sometimes
   previously identified as M. cheesemanii from certain ranges in Otago and
   southern Canterbury, but with retrorse trichomes present on the abaxial
   and adaxial side of the rosette leaves. Myosotis ultramafica Meudt,
   Prebble \& Rance comprises individuals from ultramafic sites in certain
   ranges in Southland, and is most similar to M. cheesemanii and M.
   lyallii. We recommend that all three new species are listed as
   Threatened under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In
   addition to descriptions and illustrations, the three new species are
   also included in a revised key to the nineteen species of southern
   hemisphere bracteate-prostrate Myosotis.},

Abstract = {Crinum flaccidum Herb. is widespread across southern and eastern
   Australia, but suffers from taxonomic uncertainty. This ambiguity is in
   part due to widespread hybridisation in the genus, but also
   morphological variability within and among populations. Morphological
   and molecular analyses of the complex using 24 morphological characters
   and 59 chloroplast coding and non-coding regions (similar to 50 000 bp)
   provided support for the separation of C. flaccidum from C. luteolum
   Traub \& L.S.Hannibal ex Traub, with the latter representing populations
   from the Flinders Ranges and Lake Eyre Basin. Within Crinum flaccidum,
   there was greater inferred genetic structure at the population level for
   New South Wales flood plain accessions, compared with South Australian
   populations from along the Murray River. The greater structure of the
   South Australian populations is theorised to be attributed to lower
   seed-dispersal rates leading to lower gene flow.},

Abstract = {The grain size structure of phytoplankton has great influence on
   shellfish culture. The present study aimed to assess the spatial and
   temporal variation in the phytoplankton community structure in the Yalu
   River Estuary and to explore the relationship between the phytoplankton
   community structure and various environmental parameters in 2020.
   High-throughput sequencing was used in this study. The results showed
   that nanophytoplankton, especially Karlodinium veneficum, dominated the
   estuary throughout the year. The biomass ratio of picophytoplankton,
   nanophytoplankton, and microphytoplankton were 20:63:17 in spring,
   30:44:26 in summer, 1:38:61 in autumn, and 2:45:53 in winter,
   respectively. Meanwhile, Dinophyta had the greatest biomass throughout
   the year, followed by Bacillariophyta. On the spatial dimension (Station
   average), COD, T, SST had a positive impact on total phytoplankton
   communities, and Dep had a negative impact. In the time dimension
   (Monthly average), the environmental factor that significantly
   controlled the phytoplankton community structure were NO2 and SST.},

Title = {Fire in Mexican grassy-pine ecosystems},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aims Fire is an important factor contributing to the diversity of many
   ecosystems. Unfortunately, misconceptions about fire frequently guide
   policies, threating fire-prone ecosystems whose persistence depends on
   such disturbance. In this paper, we highlight the importance of fire,
   both current and in recent history, in grassy-pine ecosystems of Mexico
   and clarify why it is important to understand the role of fire in such
   ecosystems. We also consider evidence on current fire regimes and
   management practices, and how they may be impacting different
   grassy-pine ecosystems. Results We propose a classification of pine
   ecosystems that acknowledges their huge differences in terms of climate,
   structure, and composition. Three of these communities have frequently
   open canopies with grassy understories: pinon woodlands, tropical
   savannas (Pinus oocarpa savannas) and subalpine woodlands. The majority
   of the grassy-pine communities are pinon woodlands, mostly in the
   northern Sierra Madre Oriental. Tropical savannas represent a small
   proportion of the total, distributed in the plains near the Pacific
   coast. Subalpine woodlands have the smallest area. Conclusions The lack
   of recognition in Mexico of the diversity of pine-dominated ecosystems
   as different types of vegetation with contrasting characteristics and
   dynamics has resulted in fragmentary information on their natural fire
   regimes. Evidence suggests that frequent fires may have shaped Mexican
   grassy-pine ecosystems. Nevertheless, evidence for pinon woodlands is
   still inconclusive and there may be a large variability in the natural
   fire regime between sites. Satellite data suggest that current fire
   frequency in grassy-pine ecosystems is lower than the natural one, and
   that it increased in recent years just as the budgets for fighting fires
   diminished in the country. It thus seems that misguided fire suppression
   policies have strongly altered natural fire regimes.},

   human thermal comfort of urban vegetation patches},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Extremely hot environments can trigger serious health problems. To
   evaluate the effects of microclimate on thermal comfort, we proposed and
   validated a modified thermal humidity index (MTHI) that combined air
   temperature and relative humidity with land surface temperature (LST).
   MTHI was more sensitive to microclimate changes than the general thermal
   humidity index that includes only T and RH, and thus the thermal comfort
   could be better indicated. In an urban riparian buffer study, we
   estimated the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of MTHI values
   for 47 vegetation patches and explored how structural characteristics of
   patches affect the thermal comfort. The results showed that planting
   could significantly reduce LST and MTHI. Vegetation patches with complex
   vertical structures had considerably higher thermal comfort than those
   with simple structures. Decreasing nearest distance to river or
   increasing plant abundance could reduce the thermal discomfort. There
   were significant differences in the structure characteristics between
   the patches with MTHI 70, implying the critical thresholds of variations
   in thermal comfort with patch structure. Given that people always feel
   uncomfortable during the daytime in July, optimizing the patch structure
   is essential to improve the microclimate regulation services of an urban
   landscape.},

Abstract = {Exposure to natural landscapes can benefit human health. However,
   several knowledge gaps remain regarding the impacts of duration and
   cultural differences on the health benefits of nature. If these gaps are
   filled, designers and planners can better design landscapes for stress
   recovery. This study examined the effects of durations of virtual
   exposure to the built and natural environments across three countries
   using an experimental design. Two-hundred and seventy people from USA,
   Taiwan, and Thailand were induced with an acute stressor and then
   randomly assigned to watch 360 degrees videos of urban or natural
   landscapes for 1, 5, or 15 min. Self-reported stress recovery data were
   collected before and after the exposure. The results suggested that
   gender and duration of exposure to virtual natural landscapes impacted
   stress recovery. Female participants recovered from stress more when
   exposed to the virtual natural landscapes than urban landscapes. Among
   those participants who were exposed to virtual natural landscapes, 5 min
   of exposure resulted in greater stress recovery than shorter or longer
   durations of exposure. Perceived familiarity did not influence the
   extent of stress recovery. These findings support previous research on
   how nature exposure is related to stress recovery and varies by dosage,
   leading to better understanding toward landscape design. Future studies
   should explore other measures of stress, different landscape designs,
   participants' immersion, and levels of control in simulated nature
   scenes.},

Title = {Classification of rocky outcrops plant communities in the mountains of

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aims Classification of plant communities and identification of their
   diagnostic species in different types of rocky outcrops in mountains
   from Central Argentina. We also explored how these plant communities
   differ in their endemisms, chorotypes and non-natives species
   composition, as well as in rock chemistry, elevation and climatic
   variables. Location Cordoba Province, Central Argentina. Methods The
   study was based on 505 phytosociological releves collected from 2009 to
   2019 using the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale. The hierarchical
   ISOmetric feature mapping and Partition Around Medoids (ISOPAM) analysis
   was applied. The vegetation matrix was ordinated through isometric
   feature mapping (ISOMAP), and the geochemical and bioclimatic variables
   were related to the ISOMAP ordination. Results We identified 14 plant
   communities distributed in three main clusters. We recorded 59 endemic
   species at the national level and 28 narrow endemics, restricted to the
   study area and nearby mountains. The number of non-native plants was
   relatively low (26 species). Perennial herbs (221 species), grasses (97
   species) and shrubs (68 species) were the most prominent life forms.
   Plant communities were associated with rock chemistry (carbonate and
   acidic rocks), and also with elevation and climatic variables.
   Conclusion This study highlights the remarkable heterogeneity of outcrop
   vegetation in Central Argentina. It reveals that elevation and rock type
   (geochemical composition) were relevant factors associated with the
   floristic composition of plant communities and also, that outcrop
   habitats comprise a high level of endemisms, as well as a low number of
   non-native species, suggesting a high value for the conservation of
   local and regional biodiversity.},

Title = {Holocene climate-fire-vegetation feedbacks in tropical savannas:
   Insights from the Marura sinkhole, East Arnhem Land, northern Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {AimsInformed management of savanna systems depends on understanding
   determinates of composition, structure and function, particularly in
   relation to woody-plant components. This understanding needs to be
   regionally based, both past and present. In this study, Holocene plant
   patterns are explored at a site within the eucalypt savannas of northern
   Australia. Australian savannas are the least developed globally and
   uniquely placed to track ecological change. LocationNorthern Territory,
   Australia. MethodsPalynological analyses were undertaken on a 5-m
   sediment core, spanning the last 10,700 calendar years. Pollen was
   categorised to capture vegetation type, classified further according to
   plant function and/or environmental response. Detrended Correspondence
   Analysis was used to quantify ecological dissimilarities through time.
   ResultsAt the Pleistocene transition, grasses were abundant then
   declined and remained low relative to increased woody cover from the
   mid-late Holocene. Savanna composition gradually transitioned from
   Corymbia to Eucalyptus dominance until significantly disturbed by a
   phase of repeated, extreme climate events. Highest non-savanna
   variability in terrestrial and wetland plant types formed mixed
   vegetation communities through the mid-Holocene. ConclusionsSavannas are
   not homogeneous but the product of plant changes in multiple dimensions.
   In the Northern Territory, dynamic though restricted non-eucalypt shifts
   are embedded within larger, slower eucalypt change processes. Primary
   climate-vegetation relationships determine the long-term fire regime.
   The role of large but infrequent disturbance events in maintaining
   savanna diversity are significant, in degrees of impact on tree-grass
   turnover, its form and the extent of vegetation recovery. People's
   landscape interactions were found to be interwoven within this feedback
   hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an
   invasive pest that is ravaging crops in many provinces of China. In
   order to specifically control this invasive pest, understanding of the
   relationship between the insect and hosts is necessary. In this study,
   we have compared the biological indices of S. frugiperda by feeding it
   with five different host-plants (Zea mays, Triticum aestivum, Digitaria
   sanguinalis, Glycine max and Eleusine indica) under laboratory
   conditions. The biological indices of S. frugiperda feeding on Z. mays
   were the best. The pupa weight and fecundity of S. frugiperda fed with
   G. max and E. indica were significantly lower than those fed with other
   hosts. The host total phenol content was negatively correlated with the
   growth and development of S. frugiperda, while the C/N ratio was
   positively correlated. When fed on different plants, the biological
   indices of S. frugiperda were different, but the insect completed its
   life cycle in any host. Therefore, S. frugiperda also has a tendency to
   feed on other hosts, especially plants with high C/N content, when Z.
   mays is insufficient.},

Title = {Response of ground macrolichens to site factors, co-existing plants and

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim Ground lichens have declined in boreal and temperate Europe. The
   potential causes of the decline were explored by analysing the response
   of lichen cover to forest management, site and stand variables as well
   as co-existing plants in different boreal vegetation subzones. Location
   Finland. Methods Understorey vegetation was surveyed on a systematic
   network of 1721 sample plots in forests on mineral soil. The response of
   macrolichen cover to explanatory variables was analysed by generalised
   linear mixed models (GLMMs). Results Ground lichens favoured old Pinus
   sylvestris forests on xeric sites with sufficient light conditions.
   Intensive forest management regimes, such as regeneration cutting and
   soil ploughing decreased lichen cover, while lighter scarification
   methods had less effect on lichens. Lichens benefitted from intermediate
   cutting on sites with low bryophyte cover. Lichens responded similarly
   to site and stand variables in all boreal subzones, showing that despite
   heavy reindeer grazing these response patterns apply also in the
   northern boreal subzone. Lichens showed both negative (Vaccinium
   myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum and Calluna vulgaris) and positive (Vaccinium
   vitis-idaea) responses to increasing dwarf shrub cover. Generally,
   lichens negatively responded to increasing bryophyte cover, indicating
   either that bryophytes benefit from a decline of lichens or that there
   is real competition between these groups. The negative relationship
   between bryophytes and lichens strengthened as the tree canopy becomes
   denser. Conclusions Our study provides new quantitative insights into
   the effects of forest management and changes in forest structure as
   underlying factors for lichen decline both inside and outside the
   reindeer-herding area (i.e., the northern boreal subzone). These factors
   include increased canopy cover with increased shading as well as
   disturbance caused by regeneration cutting and soil preparation. The
   possible effects of the long-term legacy of nitrogen deposition, lack of
   forest fires and climate change are also discussed.},

Title = {Recounting bias can affect abundance estimates from intensive helicopter
   surveys of feral goats},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {389-397},
Abstract = {Context. Aerial surveys are widely used for estimating the abundance of
   wildlife over large areas. The failure to count all animals within
   survey transects is commonly acknowledged and there are many techniques
   to measure and correct for underestimation. However, the possibility of
   animals being counted more than once in intensive surveys, which leads
   to overestimation, is rarely examined. Animals can move in response to
   observers or vehicles, and bias can occur when animals move before or
   after detection. Movement of animals immediately prior to and associated
   with observation processes is methodologically accommodated in distance
   sampling but bias attributable to responsive movement after observation
   platforms have passed requires investigation. Aims. We sought to
   investigate potential biases caused by animal movement during intensive
   helicopter surveys of feral goats, and to quantify the probability that
   animals are available for recounting because of their responsive
   movements. Methods. Using ground-based behavioural studies simultaneous
   with intensive helicopter strip surveys of feral goats, we measured the
   extent of responsive movement, distances and directions moved, and
   sampling design parameters, and contrasted those with random movements.
   Key results. Feral goats did not move randomly in response to
   helicopters. Animals within the transect strips, and therefore
   potentially visible from the aircraft, were more likely to move than
   those outside the transect. Considerable responsive movement (flushing)
   occurred between transects and more animals (64\%, n = 448) moved
   towards unsampled transects than towards transects already sampled.
   Because of the spatial separation of transects, 21\% of goats were
   available for recounting in adjacent transects, leading to potential
   overestimation. Conclusions. Although most extensive surveys of
   macropods and other wildlife in Australia account for overestimation in
   their design, surveys that sample intensively and apply valid
   corrections for undercounting are likely to produce positively biased
   estimates of abundance where flushing occurs. Likewise, intensive
   thermal surveys could be subject to positive bias for animals prone to
   flushing. This is routinely ignored in wildlife management and research
   where close transects are used to estimate abundance. Implications.
   Responsive movement requires consideration when designing intensive
   aerial surveys of wildlife. Randomised transects without replacement or
   larger distances between transects will counteract recounting bias.},

Title = {Nutritional stress and population density influence risk/reward
   decisions by elk},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-159},
Abstract = {Context: Optimal foraging strategies can be influenced at the group
   level by population density, which can increase competition, hunger, and
   activity levels. Optimal foraging can also be influenced at the
   individual level by personality, which in part governs how individuals
   assess risk versus reward. Aims: The purpose of this study was to
   quantify the influence of population density on risk-taking. I focused
   on captive elk that had previously been studied in tandem with wild elk
   in order to quantify personality trait characteristics. I hypothesised
   that risk-taking would be shown to be a density-dependent affect, in
   addition to varying individually. Methods: Automated cameras recorded
   visitation to four rotating treatments sites in each of high and low
   density pens, and which had either: forage, a novel object, forage +
   novel object, or a control site. Novel objects were regularly changed to
   elicit a spectrum of responses ranging from neofilia to neophobia.
   Selection or avoidance of sites was determined by comparing elk
   visitation to visits to control sites. The experiment was done in summer
   when natural forage was most abundance, and in again in autumn when
   natural forage was limited. Key results: High density elk showed
   year-round selection for all treatment sites. In summer low density elk
   showed weak selection for forage and forage + novel and no selection for
   novel objects, and no selection for any site in autumn. These patterns
   showed that elk in the high density pen, which were in poorer condition,
   had to increase their levels of both activity and risk taking. Neither
   elk pen exhibited any group-wide avoidance of novel objects, indicating
   a group-wide gradient of neophobia to neofilia, known personality traits
   in elk. Conclusions: These results show that risk-taking behaviour can
   be a density dependent effect. This increase in neofilia may be driven
   by hunger stress, but also through increases in competition that may
   favour elk of certain personalities.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {43-57},
Abstract = {D.H. Janzen argued that tropical mountains, for their heights, pose
   greater migration barriers than temperate mountains owing to lower
   temperature seasonality, and consequent greater niche and ecosystem
   specialization. These result in distinct altitudinal zonation under
   hardly varying temperature lapse rates. The Asian Far East alone
   provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis owing to latitudinal
   continuity of evergreen forests from equator to warm temperate zone.
   With data from four mountains, we find Janzen's hypothesis broadly
   correct. The primary and most consistent mediator of forest zonation and
   therefore species' habitat specificity is soil, itself indirectly
   mediated by climate. But declining habitat niche specificity does not
   proceed north along a continuum, instead in a series of latitudinal
   steps initiated by quite sudden habitat changes. Tropical montane
   forests are altitudinally floristically and structurally zoned by
   factors only indirectly mediated by temperature. Equatorial forests
   experience continuously wet climates and a frost line at c.4100 m. North
   of 8 degrees N, temperature and rainfall seasonality increases and
   winter air frosts descend to c.2000 m. Upper montane forest becomes
   truncated, while lower montane forest continues to the frost line which
   remains constant in moist climates. The margin of the wet tropics is
   pushed north to 27 degrees N by the Himalaya. Annual frost at c.2000 m
   here marks a narrow ecotone between tropical lower montane forest and
   warm temperate evergreen lucidophyll forest, a formation unique to east
   Asia. In equably moist South China, the lowland tropical-warm temperate
   ('subtropical') margin returns to the Tropic of Cancer and appears to be
   narrow at all altitudes. The temperate forests exhibit less distinct and
   inconsistent altitudinal zonation, instead manifesting an altitudinal
   floristic and structural continuum mediated by winter frost frequency
   and intensity.},

Title = {Spatially structured brown-headed cowbird control measures and their
   effects on Kirtland's warbler long-term population sustainability},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Context. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), through brood
   parasitism, can exert extrinsic population growth pressures on North
   American songbirds. Cowbird removal programs may reduce parasitism rates
   on host species but can be expensive and difficult to implement
   throughout a host species' breeding range. Aim, We estimated cowbird
   abundance and nest parasitism rates within Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga
   kirtiandii) primary breeding range in Michigan, USA, and determined the
   maximum sustainable parasitism rate for Kirtland's warblers under
   several spatially structured cowbird removal designs. Methods. We
   conducted point counts to estimate cowbird abundance and monitored nests
   to quantify nest parasitism rates during 2019-2021. We used the
   modelling software STELLA to determine the maximum sustainable
   parasitism rate for Kirtland's warblers under different spatially
   structured cowbird removal scenarios (complete, core-only, and no
   removal). Key results. Cowbird abundance and parasitism rates remained
   low following cowbird trap closures in 2018. In the simulation study,
   complete removal was the most robust scenario with no replications
   having <1000 Kirtland's warbler males. The core-only removal scenario
   had a substantially higher sustainable parasitism rate in the peripheral
   breeding area than the no removal scenario. Assumed hatchy-ear dispersal
   distance had the greatest impact on the maximum sustainable parasitism
   rate in the core-only scenario. Conclusions. Low cowbird abundance and
   nest parasitism following suspension of cowbird removal efforts showed
   resuming the removal program may not be required in the short-term. If
   cowbird abundance increases, however, adaptive cowbird removal programs
   can be used to sustain Kirtland's warbler populations long-term.},

Abstract = {Questions Management practices in permanent grasslands affect plant
   community structure and thus resources for both the herbivore and the
   decomposer subsystems. While their effects on digestibility or litter
   decomposition had been studied separately, few, if any, studies have
   tested the responses simultaneously and the underlying relationships
   with community functional structure. We tested whether the mass ratio
   hypothesis or the niche complementarity hypothesis held in scaling up
   from species to community level. Location Dry calcareous rangelands of
   southern France on a limestone plateau. Methods We measured
   digestibility and litter decomposability of 24 communities in three
   management regimes representing an intensification gradient
   corresponding to a combination of increased fertility and grazing. Key
   structural leaf traits (e.g. leaf dry-matter content, LDMC) and chemical
   traits (e.g. leaf nitrogen content, LNC, and leaf neutral detergent
   fiber, LNDF) were measured as well as communities' mean (i.e.
   community-weighted mean, CWM) and variance (i.e. community-weighted
   variance, CWV). Results Digestibility and litter decomposability were
   higher in intensively grazed and fertilized than in lightly grazed and
   abandoned communities. Increased nutrient availability combined with
   more intense grazing induced an increase in CWM LNC and a decrease in
   CWM LDMC and CWM LNDF. Communities in these regimes were less
   functionally diverse, with lower CWV LDMC and lower CWV LNDF.
   Conclusions The close relationship between digestibility and
   decomposability was maintained at the community level. Relationships
   between CWM, community digestibility and decomposability were more
   consistent across the management regimes than relationships with CWV,
   supporting the dominance rather than the complementarity hypothesis.},

Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},

Pages = {190-200},
Abstract = {Context. Camera trapping is an effective tool for cost-efficient
   monitoring of species over large temporal and spatial scales and it is
   becoming an increasingly popular method for investigating wildlife
   communities and trophic interactions. However, camera trapping targeting
   rare and elusive species can be hampered by low detection rates, which
   can decrease the accuracy and precision of results from common
   analytical approaches (e.g., occupancy modeling, capturerecapture).
   Consequently, researchers often employ attractants to increase detection
   without accounting for how attractants influence detection of species
   among trophic levels. Aims. We aimed to evaluate the influences of a
   commonly used non-species-specific olfactory lure (i.e. sardines) and
   sampling design on detection of four species (i.e. bobcat {[}Lynx
   rufus], coyote {[}Canis latrans], raccoon {[}Procyon lotor], and eastern
   cottontail {[}Sylvilagus floridanus]) that represented a range of
   foraging guilds in an agricultural landscape. Methods. We set 180 camera
   stations, each for similar to 28 days, during the summer of 2019. We set
   cameras with one of three lure treatments: (I) olfactory lure, (2) no
   olfactory lure, or (3) olfactory lure only during the latter half of the
   survey. We evaluated the influence of the lure at three temporal scales
   of detection (i.e. daily probability of detection, independent sequences
   per daily detection, and triggers per independent sequence). key
   results, The lure tended to positively influence detection of coyotes
   and raccoons but negatively influenced detection of bobcats and eastern
   cottontails. The influence of the lure varied among temporal scales of
   detection. Conclusions. Scent lures can differentially influence
   detection of species within or among tropic levels, and the influence of
   a scent lure may vary among temporal scales. Implications. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of evaluating the influence of an attractant
   for each focal species when using camera data to conduct multi-species
   or community analyses, accounting for variation in sampling strategies
   across cameras, and identifying the appropriate species-specific
   temporal resolution for assessing variation in detection data.
   Furthermore, we highlight that care should be taken when using camera
   data as an index of relative abundance (e.g. as is commonly done with
   prey species) when there is variation in the use of lures across
   cameras.},

Title = {Snow track counts for density estimation of mammalian predators in the
   boreal forest},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {425-434},
Abstract = {Context. Methods for estimating density of meso-carnivores in northern
   ecosystems are labour intensive and expensive to implement if
   mark-recapture and radio collaring are used. One alternative is to count
   tracks in the snow along transects as an index of density, but this
   method has been criticised as imprecise and lacking validation. Aims. We
   aimed to examine the utility of track counts along snowmobile trails in
   the snow for measuring changes in populations of Canada lynx and coyotes
   in the boreal forest of north-western Canada. Methods. We compared
   winter track counts of Canada lynx at three study sites and of coyotes
   at one site with concurrent estimates of density based on locations of
   radio-collared animals and estimates of numbers of uncollared animals
   from three 7-9-year studies in the Yukon and Northwest Territories,
   during a period of cyclical population fluctuations. Key results. Snow
   track counts were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.83) with density of
   Canada lynx, estimated by live trapping and radio collaring in the three
   survey areas. Coyotes also showed a clear relationship (r(2) = 0.80)
   between known density and snow track counts, but track counts were
   strongly affected by season, with much higher counts in the early winter
   when snow was shallower. This indicates the need to control for season
   or snow depth when using track counts as indices of coyote abundance. We
   recommend sample sizes of at least 10 track counts per winter along a
   25-km transect to maximise precision. Conclusions. Snow track counts are
   a relatively simple, inexpensive method of concurrently tracking
   abundance of multiple species of meso-carnivores. These data indicate
   that track counts may be reliably used to monitor trends in numbers, but
   we suggest site-specific validation of the regressions reported here
   between tracks and animal abundance are required to translate these
   indices into estimates of density. Implications. Track counts have the
   potential to be an affordable alternative to more intensive methods of
   monitoring trends in abundance of medium-sized mammals, for purposes
   such as management of harvest or to measure the success of programs to
   increase or reduce population abundance.},

Title = {Abundance, demography, and harvesting of water snakes from agricultural
   landscapes in West Java, Indonesia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 8},
Abstract = {Context. Across much of its geographic range, the masked water snake,
   Homalopsis buccata, is harvested each year in large numbers, questioning
   the sustainability of that offtake. Aims. To quantify abundance and
   demography of water snakes in anthropogenically disturbed habitats in an
   area of West Java, where these snakes are subject to intensive harvest.
   Methods. We accompanied professional snake-collectors, and conducted our
   own surveys of ponds and irrigation canals, to record the numbers and
   attributes (species, sex, size, etc.) of snakes that were captured using
   a variety of methods. Key results. Snakes of several species were
   abundant, with mean capture rates of 32 666 snakes km(-1) of irrigation
   canals, and 57 501 snakes km-2 of fishponds (9500 and 43 788 for H.
   buccata alone). Sex ratios of H. buccata were female-biased in ponds but
   not irrigation channels. Ponds underlain by deeper mud contained more
   snakes. Collecting methods varied among habitat types, in a way that
   reduced collateral risk to commercially farmed fish in ponds.
   Conclusions. These water snakes are extremely abundant in Java, despite
   high levels of historical and continuing harvest. The inference of low
   population sizes for H. buccata in Indonesia, as presented in the IUCN
   Red List, is erroneous. Implications. An ability to utilise
   anthropogenic resource subsidies (in this case, fish farmed in village
   ponds) allows some native predator species to attain remarkably high
   abundances, and to withstand intense efforts at harvesting.},

Abstract = {Aim Boreal peatlands are very sensitive to nitrogen (N) enrichment due
   to the low soil N availability. Our aim was to reveal how increased N
   availability altered plant composition in boreal permafrost peatlands
   with dense vascular plants (>50\%). Location Greater Khingan Mountains,
   Northeast China. Methods A nitrogen addition experiment with four N
   addition levels (0, 3, 6, and 12 g N m(-2) year(-1)) was conducted in a
   poor fen in the continuous permafrost zone with vascular plant coverage
   above 60\%. Plant diversity, community composition, and above-ground
   biomass were investigated after four, six, and eight years of N
   addition. Results Nitrogen addition decreased species richness and
   diversity but enhanced total above-ground biomass. Plant height
   determined the plants' responses to N addition, and the magnitudes
   increased with N addition level and experimental duration. The relative
   coverage of high-stature (>50 cm) species increased, but the relative
   coverage of low-stature (<50 cm) species decreased with elevating N
   addition levels. When N addition proceeded, the relative coverage and
   above-ground biomass of tall deciduous shrubs and nitrophilous grasses
   increased, whereas the relative coverage and above-ground biomass of
   dwarf evergreen shrubs, mosses, and lichens declined. Regardless of N
   addition levels, cryptogams (i.e., mosses and lichens) and a dwarf
   evergreen shrub (Chamaedaphne calyculata) disappeared after eight-year N
   addition. Conclusions Cryptogams and dwarf evergreen shrubs are highly
   vulnerable to increased N availability, and N enrichment-induced
   biodiversity loss, especially the disappearance of cryptogams, will
   deteriorate ecosystem structure and function in boreal permafrost
   peatlands.},

Abstract = {For the sustainable management of coastal pine forests as green
   infrastructure, the condition of coastal pine forests, including the
   effects of storm surge flooding, must be assessed, and the resulting
   information should be presented to the management entity. Low-altitude
   remote sensing (LARS) using vegetation indices is considered to be an
   effective tool for the rapid assessment of the condition of coastal pine
   forests. This study aims to demonstrate that the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to assess changes in the condition
   of coastal pine forests following a storm surge flooding through the
   analysis of the relationship between the NDVI calculated by LARS and the
   condition of trees surveyed in the field. The study site was a coastal
   pine forest in Osato Matsubara, Kaiyo Town, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan.
   In this forest, a lot of the trees died due to a storm surge flooding
   caused by a typhoon in October 2019. Trees within the study area were
   surveyed to assess their vitality. Vegetation indices were calculated by
   LARS. In the area without storm surge flooding, 90\% of the trees had a
   vitality level of 5 (healthy), whereas in the area with storm surge
   flooding, 67\% had a vitality level of 1 (completely dead). The NDVI was
   low in the area with storm surge flooding, indicating that tree
   mortality due to storm surge flooding can be evaluated by NDVI.},

Title = {Late-season drought exerts more negative effects on plant diversity and

Abstract = {Questions Drought timing during the growing season can profoundly
   influence plant diversity and cover, with subsequent impacts on
   ecosystem functions and services in terrestrial environments. However,
   the different responses of plant communities to drought in different
   periods of the growing season remain uncertain. Location The research
   was conducted in a semi-arid grassland at the Duolun Restoration Ecology
   Research and Demonstration Station, in Inner Mongolia, China. Methods
   The responses of plant species richness and cover to early- and
   late-season drought with a four-year field experiment were examined in a
   semi-arid grassland in northern China. Soil moisture at different depths
   was measured to explore the underlying mechanisms of the drought effects
   on plant richness and cover. Results Over the four years, late- rather
   than early-season drought suppressed plant richness. Decreased species
   richness (-1.65 species) under late-season drought was mainly due to
   suppressed perennial forb richness (-1.88 species). Late-season drought
   also exerted greater negative effects on plant cover than early-season
   drought. Effects of late-season drought on plant cover depended on
   annual precipitation. Reduced plant cover (-7.5\%) under early-season
   drought stemmed from declines in shrubs and semi-shrubs, particularly
   Artemisia frigida cover (-4.9\%), which is sensitive to water deficits
   because of its shallow root depth (14.01 cm). Declined plant cover
   (-39.0\%) under late-season drought was mainly caused by suppressed
   perennial forb (-21.5\%) and shrub and semi-shrubs cover (-17.4\%). The
   combined effects of early- and late-season drought on plant cover were
   greater than the treatment alone, likely due to aggravating water
   deficits under growing-season drought. Conclusions Our results suggest
   late-season drought is more critical for shifting plant communities.
   than early-season drought. Our findings highlight the regulatory role of
   drought timing on plant community composition and development in arid
   and semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Regarding planting plans for urban residential green spaces, essential
   issues associated with tree plantings, such as the species ratio,
   density, and cost, have been independently addressed. However, it is
   necessary to explore these issues in an integrated manner for more
   comprehensive and efficient planting plans. This study addresses a
   tree-selection optimization problem incorporating variables for planting
   planning in a mathematical model. Three scenarios are evaluated:
   minimizing costs, maximizing CO2 absorption, and maximizing species
   diversity. The proposed optimal tree selection model is applied to a
   park in an apartment complex. Based on the case study, optimal tree
   species are selected very efficiently to satisfy various objective
   functions. The suggested approach and optimal solutions of this study
   will be helpful in tree planting planning for urban community parks and
   serve as practical guidelines for decision-makers for comprehensive
   urban tree plans, residential land development, and urban planning.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Question What constrains Juniperus virginiana encroachment in semi-arid
   grasslands: precipitation-based constraints on establishment or
   dispersal-based constraints on spread? Location Sandhills grassland,
   Nebraska, USA. Methods We tracked juvenile and adult stages of J.
   virginiana encroachment using field sampling and remote sensing across a
   network of 40 sites spanning a wide precipitation gradient (399-655 mm).
   Regional patterns of encroachment were then used to assess the relative
   support for precipitation-based constraints on establishment versus
   dispersal-based constraints on spread in a region transitioning to a
   more encroached state. Results Woody encroachment was widespread and we
   found no evidence that low precipitation precludes encroachment in the
   Sandhills. Instead, encroachment patterns were best described by
   proximity to planted propagule sources. However, levels of encroachment
   were highly variable. Encroachment density was low at more arid sites
   that lacked nearby stands of planted J. virginiana, and encroachment
   tended to increase with proximity to plantings and higher mean annual
   precipitation, suggesting that both variables play a role in the rate of
   encroachment. Conclusion Our results indicate that woody encroachment is
   constrained by dispersal in the Sandhills and that planted propagule
   sources increase grassland vulnerability to encroachment, regardless of
   mean annual precipitation. This may be true for other intact grassland
   regions where barriers to woody plant establishment have been altered or
   overcome. A key implication is that programs and policies need to
   consider encroachment risks from planted propagule sources and how to
   manage them to avoid fragmentation of intact grasslands.},

Abstract = {QuestionDifferences in understorey vegetation between ancient and recent
   forests have been thoroughly explored; however, few studies have
   investigated the legacies of different former land uses in recent

   composition), we applied multiple linear regressions to analyse soil
   properties, canonical correspondence analysis to analyse plant taxonomic
   composition and multispecies generalised linear mixed-effects models to
   analyse relationships between plant functional composition and former
   land uses. ResultsThe soils of former cropland were richer in nutrients
   and more alkaline compared to other past land uses, while soils on
   former pastures and meadows differed only slightly from ancient forests.
   Ancient forests were characterised by acidophilic, shade-tolerant,
   low-stature, forest-dependent species, whereas former cropland was
   characterised by calcicolous non-forest species. Former pasture and
   meadow communities displayed a distinct taxonomic composition compared
   to other past land uses, but a functional composition closer to ancient
   forest than to former cropland. ConclusionFormer cropland has a stronger
   legacy effect than former pastures or meadows. This could explain small
   differences between ancient and recent forests observed in previous
   studies conducted in mountain landscapes where former cropland was rare.},

Abstract = {Context. Biodiversity monitoring programs provide information on the
   status and trends in wildlife populations. These trends are unknown for
   most mammals within African montane forests, which harbour many endemic
   and threatened species. Camera traps are useful for assessing mammal
   populations, because they allow for the estimation of species richness,
   occupancy, and activity patterns. Aims. We sought to explore the
   richness and distribution of small- to large-sized mammals by using
   occupancy models while accounting for imperfect detection in Volcanoes
   and Mgahinga Gorilla National Parks, in Rwanda and Uganda. Methods. We
   used camera-trap data collected from 2014 to 2017 by the Tropical
   Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) network and multi-season
   occupancy models with multispecies data to assess the dynamics of
   species richness and distribution in the Virunga Massif and the
   influence of site covariates on species detection probability,
   occupancy, colonisation and extinction. Key results. We identified 17
   species from 7047 trap-days, with most of them showing an uneven
   distributional pattern throughout the park. We found that average
   species richness per site increased from five to seven species in 2017.
   Average local colonisation was estimated at 0.13 (s.e. 0.014), but the
   probability of local extinction was 0.17 (s.e. 0.028) and negatively
   influenced by distance from the park boundary. Detection probability was
   highest for medium-sized species. For species distribution, we found
   that black-fronted duiker, Cephalophus nigrifrons, and bushbuck,
   Tragelaphus script us, declined in distribution but remained widespread
   in our study area, while all other species showed an increase in
   distribution over the study period. Conclusions, Our approach allowed us
   to draw inferences on rare species, such as African golden cat, Caracal
   aurata, by estimating detection probability on the basis of shared
   covariate information with more common, widespread species. As such, we
   were able to estimate all occupancy parameters across the terrestrial
   mammal community.},

Title = {Which regionalization scheme is the best to predict wetland plant
   distribution in Western Patagonia?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {QuestionsGiven the current multiplicity of threats to pond biodiversity,
   there is a clear need to examine which environmental drivers determine
   the composition and distribution of species. Using wetland plants as
   pond biodiversity surrogates, two questions led to this work: How do
   wetland plant species assemblages and abundance vary across local- and
   regional-scale classification schemes in wetlands? How does wetland
   plant beta-diversity vary within these wetland classification schemes?
   LocationWestern Patagonia, Argentina, from 36 degrees S to 56 degrees S
   and from 73 degrees W to 65 degrees W. MethodsWetland plant distribution
   constrained by water and climatic factors was analyzed using canonical
   correspondence analysis. Variance partitioning analysis was performed to
   assess which classification scheme (phytogeographical units, wetland
   regions, wetland genesis and hydrogeomorphological types) better
   explained variation in plant composition. An IndVal analysis was also
   carried out to detect taxa with the highest association values
   (indicator taxa) for the different categories of wetland classification.
   Beta-diversity was calculated to evaluate variation patterns within
   classification schemes. ResultsPlant distribution was mainly related to
   site location across the latitudinal gradient, following a decreasing
   pattern of air temperature from northern to southern wetlands. Variance
   partitioning analysis confirmed the effectiveness of a regional-scale
   classification (wetland regions) in predicting plant associations, and
   the IndVal analysis also highlighted this classification scheme above
   the remainder, sustaining the highest number of indicator taxa. Wetland
   plant beta-diversity patterns were explained by relatively high species
   turnover, with species composition showing low nestedness values.
   ConclusionClimate factors rather than local characteristics were the
   main drivers of plant distribution at the wide regional scale analyzed.
   Wetland region (classification based on climatic criteria) was the most
   effective scheme in predicting plant associations and sustaining the
   highest number of indicator taxa. Also, ponds located in the Patagonian
   Andes and those with a glacigenic origin contribute most to the regional
   wetland plant diversity. Therefore, these aspects should be taken
   directly into account in the future delineation of protected areas to
   increase the resilience of Patagonian wetland habitats and their
   associated biota, and to maintain the ecosystem services that they
   provide.},

Title = {Tree use by koalas after timber harvesting in a mosaic landscape},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {7},
Pages = {581-592},
Abstract = {Context: A better understanding of how individual animals use their
   habitat after disturbance can help optimise management practices for
   their conservation. Forestry is one such disturbance for koalas that
   operates under regulations based on best available information to
   minimise impacts. Aims: This study aimed to investigate tree use by
   koalas in a mosaic of young, regenerating trees after timber harvest and
   mature trees in adjacent exclusion zones. Methods: Tracking collars
   using very high frequency radio and Global Positioning System
   transmitters were used to track 10 koalas (five males, five females)
   across all seasons in three forests, 5-10 years after timber harvesting
   as regulated by practices current at that time. Tree use was compared to
   availability based on basal area in different parts of the forest. Key
   results: We tracked koalas to 429 day-trees and 70 night-trees during
   this time. Males and females displayed little difference in tree use.
   Blackbutt Eucalyptus pilularis and turpentine Syncarpia glomulifera were
   the most commonly used species during the day, but blackbutt was ranked
   with the highest preference relative to tree availability. Tallowwood
   Eucalyptus microcorys was by far the most commonly used tree at night.
   Koalas used a broad range of tree sizes during the day and night, but
   most often used medium-sized trees, with preferences for a diameter of
   30-60 cm (slightly smaller at night). Koalas used all topographic
   positions in the landscape, but more than half of the trees used were in
   lower topographic areas (gullies and lower slopes). Areas mapped as
   having previous heavy timber harvesting were the most used forest
   category, followed by riparian exclusion zones. Conclusions: Our results
   demonstrate that koalas commonly used trees regenerating after harvest,
   although preferences for medium-sized trees and tallowwood as a night
   browse tree suggest current forestry regulations can be fine-tuned by
   retaining a greater proportion of these features.},

Title = {Reproductive biology of the rainbow mudsnake (Enhydris enhydris) in West
   Java, Indonesia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 4},
Abstract = {Context: Unsustainable harvesting can threaten wildlife populations and
   jeopardise the livelihoods of people relying on wildlife resources.
   Although millions of rainbow mudsnakes (Enhydris enhydris) are harvested
   from wetland agroecosystems in tropical Asia each year, few detailed
   studies have been conducted on the biology of this species. Aims: We
   aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining the reproductive
   biology and resilience to harvesting of E. enhydris, collecting from
   agricultural landscapes in West Java, Indonesia. Methods: We measured
   and examined 1731 specimens that had been collected and killed for skins
   and meat near the city of Cirebon in West Java. Key results: Most snakes
   that we examined were adults (94\% of females, 88\% of males), with
   females outnumbering males overall (69\% female). Sex ratios varied
   seasonally and among processing facilities. Females attained larger body
   sizes than males, were more heavy-bodied, and had shorter tails relative
   to snout-vent length. Reproductive traits varied among months, with two
   peaks in the incidence of gravid snakes occurring in March and
   September. Litter sizes averaged 11.2 (range 2-31) and increased with
   maternal body size. About half of the adult females were reproductive
   (vitellogenic or gravid) at the time of collection. This proportion
   increased with maternal body size, such that 60-70\% of large females
   were reproductive at the time of collection, suggesting that some
   females may produce two litters per year. Conclusions: Rainbow mudsnakes
   remain exceptionally abundant in West Java, despite significant habitat
   modification and intensive harvesting. Implications: The ability of this
   species to exploit anthropogenic subsidies in disturbed agricultural
   landscapes gives it access to plentiful food, and the resultant early
   maturation, frequent reproduction, and high fecundity enable it to
   withstand high levels of commercial offtake.},

Abstract = {Ornamental grasses are often used in gardens to improve biodiversity and
   as additional aesthetical resources. However, their use in green roofs
   (GR) and living walls (LW) is not so widespread and it has not been
   studied extensively. The aim of this work is to assess the performance
   of seven grass species (Imperata cylindrica `Red Baron', Acorus
   gramineus, Stipa tenuissima `Pony Fails', Carex flagellifera `Bronzita',
   Carex oshimensis `Evergold', Uncinia rubra `Everflame' and Miscanthus
   sinensis) for their use in GR and LW. The growth of the plants was
   evaluated (i.e. biomass production, dimensions), as well as their visual
   quality and survival. C. flagellifera and C. oshimensis showed coverage
   levels greater than 75\% and good visual quality, while A. gramineus
   reached 55-60\%. I. cylindrica and M. sinensis showed coverages slightly
   below 50\% in the LW, however, both performed well in the GR, though
   with a lower visual quality. U. rubra did not develop well, reaching the
   lowest coverage (below 45\%) but maintaining a high visual quality. S.
   tenuissima also attained low coverage in the LW and presented high
   mortality, especially in the GR. In LW, C. oshimensis stood out in
   flowering, while S. tenuissima showed the highest flowering rate in GR.
   The species should be selected considering their characteristics and
   performance in order to achieve a correct appearance and development.
   Interspecific interactions are especially important in LW, as species
   with upward growth should be placed above species with fallen leaves,
   not below.},

Abstract = {Aims We asked how geological substrate affects the distribution of plant
   species between forest interiors, forest edges, and steppe patches in
   the forest-steppe landscapes. Specifically, we sought for the presence
   of the edge effect at the forest-grassland transitions on different
   substrates. Location Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and
   western Ukraine. Methods We recorded the occurrence of vascular plant
   species in forest interiors, at forest edges and in steppe patches on 40
   forest-steppe sites located on four substrates (andesite, dolomite,
   limestone and loess). We compared the distribution of species diversity,
   beta diversity (using multivariate analysis), the number of shared
   species between habitats and the estimation of vegetation biomass among
   forest-steppe habitats on different substrates. Results The edge effect
   was observed on hard rocks, while it was absent on loess, where the
   ecotone species richness was intermediate between that of forest and
   steppe. Loess sites also had the lowest species turnover between forest
   and steppe and the lowest number of edge specialists. Conclusions
   Substrate has a strong effect on the formation of forest-steppe mosaics.
   It shapes the assembly rules and plant community diversity within
   individual habitat mosaics. Plant communities on each substrate can
   respond differently to changing climate. The strong assembly rules on
   hard rocks may be more likely to result in species loss than on loess or
   similar soft sediments, where a larger number of species find their
   optimum in more than one forest-steppe habitat.},

Title = {Oversimplified models underestimate the role of local environmental
   filtering},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aims Fitting community assembly via trait selection (CATS) models is a
   useful method of estimating the relative role of environmental selection
   in community assembly. In the simplest version of CATS models, only
   linear and additive trait-environment relationships are supposed. This
   paper explores the consequences of neglecting non-linearity and trait
   interactions by analyzing simulated and field data. Location Northern
   Hungary, Central Europe. Methods Starting with Gaussian response curves,
   we discussed how more and more complex species-environment relationships
   can be modeled by CATS regression. Using simulated data, we calculated
   the bias unsatisfying linearity and additivity assumptions introduce in
   the estimated role of environmental filtering in community assembly.
   Field data collected in the forest understorey vegetation were used for
   illustrating the magnitude of the underestimation in a real data set.
   Results A non-linear trait-environment relationship appeared even in the
   simplest, but realistic simulation (i.e., a Gaussian response curve).
   Neglecting both non-linearity and trait interactions resulted in
   considerable underestimation of the strength of the trait-environment
   correlation. Moreover, this underestimation was stronger in the middle
   part of the environmental gradients, leading to a spurious pattern.
   Conclusion At least, a second-order polynomial regression model
   (including interactions among traits) should be fitted to avoid the
   underestimation of the strength of environmental filtering.},

Title = {Arid community responses to nitrogen and carbon addition depend on
   dominant species traits and are decoupled between above- and
   below-ground biomass},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Questions Arid communities are strongly limited by soil resources
   including water and nitrogen (N). Plants compete for N with other plants
   and microorganisms, which are also limited by carbon (C). We propose
   that above- and below-ground plant responses to soil resources are
   modulated by community structure (species relative abundances, ``mass
   ratio hypothesis{''}) and species traits (relative growth rates - RGRs).
   We evaluated the single and combined effects of soil N and C addition on
   the above- and below-ground biomass accumulation of perennial grass
   patches in an arid community, and the mechanisms involved in their
   responses. Location Patagonian steppe, Argentina. Methods We added N (2
   g N m(-2); NH4NO3) and C (330 g C m(-2); sucrose) to 1-m(2) field plots
   in a factorial design. After two years, we harvested above-ground (n = 5
   plots) and below-ground biomass (n = 10 soil cores) and sorted it by
   species. We measured potential soil respiration as a proxy of microbial
   activity. Results Total above-ground biomass increased by 55\% as a
   result of N and decreased by 45\% as a result of C addition, in relation
   to controls. C addition reduced total below-ground biomass by 42\%. The
   above-ground differences were associated with changes in the biomass of
   dominant species according to their RGRs. Poa ligularis (dominant, high
   RGR) increased by 92\% as a result of N addition while Pappostipa
   speciosa (dominant, low RGR) decreased by 55\% as a result of C
   addition. Intermediate and subordinate grasses did not modify their
   biomass, independently of their RGR. Potential soil respiration was
   three times higher in plots with C addition than in control plots.
   Conclusions Community biomass was explained by a combination of mass
   ratio hypothesis and specific RGR, as dominant grasses controlled
   above-ground community responses to N (high-RGR species) and C addition
   (low-RGR species). Our findings highlight the independence between the
   above- and below-ground processes and the importance of considering
   community equitability and species characteristics to predict plant
   community responses to changes in soil resources.},

Title = {Microbial nutrient limitation in tropical forest soils determined using
   the V-T model contradicts the traditional view that C is the major
   limiting element},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {59-63},
Abstract = {Traditionally, microbial activity in tropical forest soils has been
   thought to be limited predominantly by carbon (C) availability,
   prompting investigations of whether phosphorus (P) is a stronger
   limiting factor (next to C) than other nutrients. However, a recently
   developed enzyme vector model has sometimes shown that P or nitrogen
   (N), but not C, is the predominant limiting factor, likely due to biased
   C vs. N vs. P limitation thresholds. In the latest update of this
   approach (the V-T model) this problem was addressed by revising the
   threshold, or balance point, that represents the enzymatic ratio at
   which microbial metabolism is not limited by nutrients. However, it
   remains unclear whether results obtained using the V-T model are
   consistent with the traditional view that C is the predominant limiting
   element for soil microbial activity. In this short note, I analyzed the
   microbial resource limitations of tropical forest soils using the V-T
   model approach based on previously published global data, and discussed
   the consistency of the results with the traditional view. The V-T model
   results showed that up to 78 \% of the data indicated that P, and not C,
   was the limiting element, contradicting the traditional view. This
   finding may have been the result of a bias in the balance point toward C
   limitation (i.e., the balance point, or threshold, used for determining
   microbial nutrient limitation is under C-limited condition, rather than
   under no nutrient limitation), resulting in underestimation of C
   limitation. The present study suggest that the V-T model requires
   further improvement; however, the traditional view of C limitation of
   soil microbial activity is also poorly supported, and further direct
   observation is needed.},

Abstract = {QuestionsTo explore whether temporal variation and context dependency of

   LocationDry grasslands of northern Bohemia, Czech Republic, Europe.
   MethodsWe assessed interspecific competition at the end of each year of
   a three-year garden experiment, in all pairwise combinations of species
   and in a mixture of all species, using multiple competition designs to
   test for robustness of the observed competitive outcomes. We replicated
   the experiment in soils from two localities, differing in structure and
   chemical composition. ResultsBased on a single harvest at the end of the
   experiment, Brachypodium was the strongest competitor, both in terms of
   competitive effect and competitive response, and Bromus and Inula the
   weakest. However, the competition outcomes changed over time: during the
   first two experimental years, Bromus was the strongest competitor,
   followed by Inula. Competitive outcomes also depended on soil origin:
   Bromus was a stronger competitor when grown in soil resembling soil at
   the sites it naturally dominates while Inula showed the opposite
   pattern. ConclusionsWe showed that variation in competitive abilities of
   individual species over time, under different competition scenarios and
   in soils of different origin provide the opportunities for each species
   to locally dominate over the others.},

Title = {Species-rich plant communities in interior habitats of small forest
   fragments: The role of seed dispersal and edge effect},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Questions What are the effects of environmental and dispersal filters on
   vegetation in small and species-rich fragments of temperate forests in
   which species richness increases along the edge-interior gradient?
   Location Small fragments of thermophilic forests in central Bohemia,
   Czech Republic. Methods Repeated vegetation surveys and seed rain
   samplings were conducted in 71 plots located in 17 forest fragments (0.4
   to 255 ha) in an agricultural landscape in Central Europe. A subsequent
   assessment of seed viability was performed via germination in a
   greenhouse. We evaluated species richness, composition and the
   similarities between forest vegetation and viable available seeds,
   accounting for potentially significant environmental conditions.
   Particularly, we examined the effects of species with different
   associations to the forest environment in combination with prevalent
   dispersal strategies. Results Species richness and composition of the
   herb layer vegetation (including tree and shrub seedlings) in small
   forest fragments reflected seed distribution and, to a lesser extent,
   seed viability. Plant species composition showed a nested pattern
   according to the distance from the forest edge; the species at the edge
   represented a subset of the species in the forest interior. Forest
   specialist species with spatially limited dispersal consistently
   achieved the highest species richness in forest interiors (>200 m from
   the forest edge), although this differed depending on aspect. Species
   richness of generalists and open-land species benefitted from higher
   light quality and vice versa for forest specialists. Conclusions Small
   forest fragments maintain species-rich herb layer communities confined
   in area-limited interior habitats. They do this despite being mostly or
   entirely under the influence of the edge effect and impoverished of
   forest specialists. Moreover, the species-rich interiors of the small
   forest fragments are likely prone to negative changes in species
   composition induced either by canopy closure or opening in the future.},

Abstract = {Question How does plant species richness respond to simulated area loss
   based on the realistic geometry of area loss in subalpine moorland
   ecosystems? Location Hakkoda mountain range, Aomori, Japan. Methods We
   constructed species distribution models based on relationships between
   species distributions and environmental conditions in subalpine moorland
   ecosystems. We then simulated moorland area loss based on the realistic
   geometry of area loss from the past (1967) to the present (2019) to
   predict future changes in plant diversity. Here, we defined the
   realistic geometry of area loss as the plausible spatial pattern of
   future habitat loss. Finally, we analyzed how the rate of species loss
   in response to the realistic area loss can be explained by a range of
   factors including spatial patterns in species distributions, total
   number of species present, and environmental variables for the focal
   moorland. Results Within each moorland site, areas prone or those less
   prone to be lost were distributed non-randomly at a local scale. In
   general, the patterns of species loss caused by the realistic area loss
   differed from those caused by random area loss. At most sites, realistic
   area loss caused a relatively small decline in species richness up to a
   certain threshold of area loss, and accelerating decline thereafter.
   None of the factors can explain the rate of decrease in species richness
   caused by the realistic area loss. At the species level, however,
   species with lower occurrence rates at a given site can be lost earlier
   than those with higher occurrence rates by the realistic area loss.
   Conclusions Patterns of habitat loss and species distributions are not
   spatially random, and the classical approach based on the species-area
   relationship assuming random area loss can thus either under- or
   overestimate the risk of species loss.},

Abstract = {Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict.
   They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of
   rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing
   excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and
   environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to
   pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and
   intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these
   competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland
   grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is
   largely under the control of the people who manage the business.
   However, there are significant external influences that can impede
   progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this
   paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional
   experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental
   sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing
   enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial
   and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry,
   and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially
   antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude
   with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve
   (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability.},

Title = {A comparison of lead-based and lead-free bullets for shooting sambar
   deer (Cervus unicolor) in Australia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Month = {2022 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Context. In response to the toxic health threats posed by lead (Pb),
   there is currently a focus on transitioning to lead-free bullets for
   shooting wild animals. Aim. We aimed to quantify the killing efficiency
   and animal welfare outcomes of lead-based and lead-free (copper-based)
   bullets for ground-based shooting of sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) in
   Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Methods. We used shooter-collected
   data from recreational diurnal hunting and professional nocturnal
   culling during 2020-2021. Shooters recorded rifle calibre, cartridge
   type, bullet mass, bullet type, shooting outcomes (miss, wound or kill),
   shooting distance, flight distance (the distance between where the
   animal was shot and where it died) as an assumed positive correlate of
   time to incapacitation, anatomical zones struck by bullets, and
   frequency of bullet exit wounds. We used flight distance as our response
   variable, assuming that it is positively correlated with time to
   incapacitation. To examine the role of several predictor variables
   (including bullet type) potentially influencing flight distance, the
   dataset was reduced to those deer killed with a single thoracic shot.
   Key results. Our data captured shooting events involving 276 deer, with
   124 deer shot at with lead-based bullets and 152 with copper-based
   bullets. Most (87\%) of the deer were killed with a single shot. The
   frequency of non-fatal wounding was <4\% for both bullet types and there
   was no distinct difference in the probability of a single shot kill for
   deer shot with either bullet type. For those deer killed with a single
   thoracic shot (n = 198), there was no evidence that bullet energy or
   shooting distance influenced flight distance. After accounting for
   differences in terminal kinetic energy, the mean flight distance of deer
   shot with lead-free bullets (35 m) was 56\% greater than that of deer
   shot with lead-based bullets (22 m). Conclusions. Lead-based and
   lead-free bullets produced similar animal welfare outcomes for shooting
   sambar deer. Implications. A transition to lead-free ammunition for
   shooting sambar deer would have minimal impact on efficiency or animal
   welfare outcomes.},

Title = {Social-identity dynamics in rural communities: a motive for resistance
   to change},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {299-307},
Abstract = {This research found that rural social resistance to change and newcomers
   can be explained in part by the influence of social-set membership.
   Eighty-nine interviews were conducted in two Australian inland rural
   communities with population <2000 and analysed with a recognised
   cultural dynamics framework. This found attachment to local social
   identity, social hierarchy and cultural norms that represented social
   power. Established residents defended the status quo when valued facets
   of social identity were perceived to be threatened, resisting efforts to
   introduce change. Persons representing a challenge to established local
   identity norms could be socially undermined and censured to preserve the
   power of dominant social sets, defending their preferred narratives and
   norms. Understanding social identity influences can explain rural
   communities' tendency to conservatism, why newcomers and new ideas are
   often derided, ignored or attacked. It can explain the motives for
   negative social capital and suggests social identity as a factor in
   small town newcomer business failure, and resistance to new knowledge
   transfer and practice adoption. Welcome and induction to local social
   codes is critical to newcomer integration. Outsiders and newcomers may
   meet discretely with like-minded or similar persons to safely fulfil
   social needs or influence as a social minority, providing support to
   their own unique group. Where residents cannot find inclusion, they may
   disengage. Understanding social identity can provide insights for
   community leaders, development practitioners, extension officers and
   newcomers struggling to serve and innovate in rural and rangelands
   communities.},

Abstract = {Pettalidae is a family of mite harvestmen that inhabits the former
   circum-Antarctic Gondwanan terranes, including southern South America,
   South Africa, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand.
   Australia is home to two pettalid genera, Austropurcellia, in northern
   New South Wales and Queensland, and Karripurcellia, in Western
   Australia, until now showing a large distributional gap between these
   two parts of the Australian continent. Here we report specimens of a new
   pettalid from South Australia, Archaeopurcellia eureka, gen. et sp.
   nov., closing this distributional gap of Australian pettalids.
   Phylogenetic analyses using traditional Sanger markers as well as
   ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) reveal that the new genus is related to
   the Chilean Chileogovea, instead of any of the other East Gondwanan
   genera. This relationship of an Australian species to a South American
   clade can be explained by the Antarctic land bridge between these two
   terranes, a connection that was maintained with Australia until 45 Ma.
   The UCE dataset also shows the promise of using museum specimens to
   resolve relationships within Pettalidae and Cyphophthalmi.},

Abstract = {The reef lobsters of the family Enoplometopidae de Saint Laurent, 1988
   are attractive marine aquarium pets but the generic assignments have
   been controversial. Molecular phylogeny using five genetic markers
   (three mitochondrial and two nuclear) on 11 of the 12 species known in
   the family successfully reconstructed a robust phylogenetic tree for the
   reef lobsters with two well-supported groups. The genus Hoplometopus
   Holthuis, 1983 is revived but with diagnostic characters revised and H.
   voigtmanni (Turkay, 1989) should be treated as a synonym of H. holthuisi
   (Gordon, 1968). Foursynapomorphies are identified in Enoplometopidae,
   including the number of the intermediate andpostcervical teeth on the
   carapace, the shape of abdominal pleura and the spination of the palm
   oflarge chelipeds. Fossil calibration and ancestral range reconstruction
   analyses suggested that reeflobsters had a Tethyan deeper water origin
   and emerged during the Cretaceous period. Enoplometopus s.s. was
   relatively primitive, whereas Hoplometopus diverged in the Central
   IndoPacific in the Upper Cretaceous and later crossed the Mediterranean
   into the Atlantic. Overall thefamily Enoplometopidae mainly speciated in
   the Central Indo-Pacific, and actively re-occupiedshallowwater habitats
   and invaded temperate regions.},

Abstract = {Ophiuroidea is the most speciose of all classes of Echinoderma. It is an
   important component in benthic ecosystems, occurring in almost all

   In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes

   Histampica sp. CS049 and Ophioplinthaca sp. M5261. These two deep-sea
   ophiuroids displayed reversed strand-compositional bias and rearranged
   gene orders. Thirteen distinct patterns of mitochondrial gene order
   among ophiuroid mitogenomes were detected, with two gene order newly
   found in Ophiuroidea. Our data supported the gene order found in all
   sampled Ophiuridae as the most likely ancestral order of all
   Ophiuroidea. To improve phylogenetic accuracy based on nucleotide
   differences, two different criteria were used for the analyses: (i)
   nucleotide sequence from all codon positions (PCG(123)); (ii) the NTE
   method ({''}Neutral Transitions Excluded{''}) for ameliorating the
   misleading effects of a reverse strand bias in the data. The two methods
   confirmed the polyphyly of the orders Ophiacanthida and Amphilepidia. At
   family and genus level, Ophiuridae, Ophionotus and Ophioplinthus were
   not monophyletic. The most notable exception was that the NTE phylogeny
   showed low variation of branch length. NTE dataset generated younger age
   for most lower-level nodes than that from PCG123 dataset. All analyses
   suggested that the ophiuroids radiation occurred around the
   Permian-Triassic mass extinction event, and the divergence time of the
   deep-sea lineages was during the Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {Unravelling the evolutionary history of taxa requires solid delimitation
   of the traits characterising these. This can be challenging especially
   in groups with a highly complex taxonomy. The squat lobster family
   Munididae contains more than 450 species distributed among 21 genera,
   Munida being the most speciose (similar to 300 species). Previous
   phylogenetic studies, based on a small part of the diversity of the
   group, have suggested polyphyletic origins for Munida and the paraphyly
   of Munididae. Here, we use an integrative approach based on multi-locus
   phylogenies (two mitochondrial and three nuclear markers) paired with
   120 morphological characters, to resolve taxonomic and evolutionary
   relationships within Munididae. Our study covers similar to 60\% of the
   family's known diversity (over 800 specimens of 291 species belonging to
   19 of the 21 genera collected from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific
   oceans). Using this information, we confirm the validity of most genera,
   proposing new ones in cases where the genetic analyses are compatible
   with morphological characters. Four well-defined munidid clades were
   recovered, suggesting that new genera should be erected in the currently
   recognised Munididae (three for the genus Agononida and eleven in
   Munida), and the genus Grimothea is resurrected. A key to all genera of
   the family is presented. Molecular clock estimates and ancestral
   biogeographic area reconstructions complement the taxonomic profiles and
   suggest some explosive diversification within Munididae during the
   Cretaceous and the Palaeogene. Further anagenetic events and narrow
   sympatry accounting for changes in distribution indicate a more limited
   dispersal capacity than previously considered. Our study unravels how
   diversification may occur in deep waters and further highlights the
   importance of the integrative approach in accurately delineating species
   in understanding the history of a family and the factors driving the
   evolution.},

Title = {Integrative taxonomy of the stick insect genus Austrocarausius Brock,
   2000 (Phasmatodea: Lonchodidae) reveals cryptic species in remnant
   Queensland rainforests},
Journal = {INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {849-873},
Abstract = {Austrocarausius Brock, 2000 is a stick insect (Phasmatodea: Lonchodidae)
   genus containing two species restricted to the tropical rainforests of
   northern Queensland. Recent specimen collections between the two
   species' type localities, Lizard Island and Rockhampton, have suggested
   that Austrocarausius might represent more than the two nominal species.
   Here, we apply morphological and molecular analyses to revise the
   taxonomy of this genus. Using both field-collected and historic museum
   samples, we developed morphological species hypotheses and descriptions.
   Genetic sequencing of mitochondrial COI and 16S were undertaken for
   species delimitation and phylogenetic analysis, including an estimate of
   the evolutionary timescale of the genus. Based on these results, we
   propose nine new Austrocarausius species, increasing the number of
   species in the genus to eleven: A. nigropunctatus (Kirby, 1896), A.
   mercurius (Stal, 1877), A. coronatus sp. nov., A. decorus sp. nov., A.
   eirmosus sp. nov., A. gasterbulla sp. nov., A. tuberosus sp. nov., A.
   macropunctatus sp. nov., A. truncatus sp. nov. A. waiben sp. nov. and A.
   walkeri sp. nov. Our results suggest Austrocarausius species diversified
   over the last c. 25-70 Ma, resulting in the now endemic distributions in
   the tropical rainforests of the central and northern Queensland coasts.
   This is the first integrative systematic study of an Australian phasmid
   genus, combining morphological, molecular and biogeographical methods.
   Additional species of Austrocarausius likely remain undescribed as can
   be inferred from methodical sampling of rainforest patches along the
   Queensland coast.},

Abstract = {Trunk biomass in a forest is necessary information for good forest
   management. The trunk biomass is usually calculated by an allometric
   formula using trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (TH)
   as non-destructive input values. To confirm the measurement errors of a
   backpack LiDAR system in forest inventory, DBH and TH values obtained by
   the LiDAR system were compared with conventional survey data from
   Japanese plantation forests. Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and
   Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) form large plantation forests in
   Japan. The backpack LiDAR system was used in five plots of these
   species-dominated forests (20 m x 20 m for each plot). The tree
   detection rates were 100\% in all plots. The relative RMSEs of the DBH
   and TH estimations ranged from 6.8 to 10.0\% and 5.4-10.1\%,
   respectively. The negative biases indicated underestimation of DBH and
   TH. The DBH and TH results of the present study were close to those
   obtained using the backpack LiDAR approach in previous studies. The
   paper demonstrated a fully automated solution for measuring DBH and TH
   using the backpack LiDAR system. The solution showed that the system has
   a distinct capability as an efficient and practical tool for forest
   inventory and management.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis and diversity of peculiar new lecanicephalidean

Journal = {INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {879-909},
Abstract = {The three members of the lecanicephalidean tapeworm family
   Eniochobothriidae are unusual among tapeworms in that they lack a vagina
   and possess a series of expanded proglottids forming a trough at the
   anterior end of their body. They exclusively parasitise cownose rays of
   the genus Rhinoptera (Myliobatiformes: Rhinopteridae). New collections
   from six of the nine known species of cownose rays from the waters off
   Australia, Mexico, Mozambique, Senegal, Taiwan and the United States
   (off Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina) yielded eight new
   species and a new genus of eniochobothriids. Here we erect
   Amiculucestus, gen. nov. and describe six of the eight new species -
   four in the new genus and two in Eniochobothrium - expanding the number
   of genera in the family to two and the number of described species in
   the family to nine. Morphological work was based on light and scanning
   electron microscopy. The tree resulting from a maximum likelihood
   analysis of sequence data for the D1-D3 region of the 28S rDNA gene for
   11 species of eniochobothriids supports the reciprocal monophyly of both
   genera. The mode of attachment to the mucosal surface of the spiral
   intestine of the host was investigated using histological sections of
   worms in situ. These cestodes appear to use the anterior trough-like
   portion of their body, which consists of an unusual series of barren
   proglottids, rather than their scolex, to attach to the mucosal surface.
   Based on our new collections, we estimate that the total number of
   eniochobothriids across the globe does not exceed 27 species.},

Title = {Reappraisal of the hyperdiverse Platynereis dumerilii (Annelida:

Abstract = {Morphologically similar species are often overlooked but molecular
   techniques have been effective in signalling potential hidden diversity,
   boosting the documentation of unique evolutionary lineages and
   ecological diversity. Platynereis dumerilii and Platynereis massiliensis
   are part of a recognised species complex, where differences in the
   reproductive biology have mainly been highlighted to date. Analyses of
   DNA sequence data (COI, 16S rDNA and D2 region of the 28S rDNA) of
   populations of the apparent morphotype of P. dumerilii obtained from a
   broader sampling area along European marine waters, including the Azores
   and Webbnesia islands (Madeira and Canaries), provided compelling
   evidence for the existence of at least 10 divergent evolutionary
   lineages. Complementing the genetic data, morphological observations of
   the better represented lineages revealed two major groups with
   distinctive paragnath patterns. Two new Platynereis species were
   erected: P. nunezi sp. nov., widespread in the Azores and Webbnesia
   islands, and P. jourdei sp. nov., restricted to the western
   Mediterranean. The new combination P. agilis is also proposed for Nereis
   agilis, previously unaccepted for one of the lineages present both in
   the Northeast Atlantic and western Mediterranean. Platynereis dumerilii
   is redescribed based on topotypic material. However, uncertainty in the
   identity of P. massiliensis due to the original brief description and
   the absence of type and topotypic material prevents the unequivocal
   assignment to the lineage assumed in this and previous studies. The
   remaining five lineages are represented by only a few small specimens
   with morphological features poorly preserved and were therefore not
   described in this study.},

Abstract = {Alpha taxonomy is fundamental for many biological fields. Delineation of
   the species boundary, however, can be challenging in a species complex,
   where different species share a similar morphology and diagnostic
   characters may not be available. In this context, integrative approaches
   that incorporate molecular and morphological data sets, and account for
   speciation history can be helpful to alpha taxonomy. Different
   approaches to species delimitation based on different assumptions are
   complementary and by integrating the results from multiple approaches we
   can generate a more reliable and objective taxonomic decision. In this
   study, we applied three molecular approaches to species delimitation and
   inferred the demographic history based on an isolation with migration
   model to test a morphologically based taxonomic hypothesis for the
   Cylindera pseudocylindriformis complex. We discuss the association
   between genetic divergence and microhabitat specialisation, and further
   corroborate that C. subtilis sp. nov. is a valid new species by
   integrating the results from model-based species delimitation and the
   genealogical divergence index. We argue that genetic endemism can occur
   at a small geographic scale, even in a winged insect like tiger beetles.
   Our results also indicated that there may still be undocumented species
   diversity of Taiwanese Cylindera remaining to be discovered.},

   permissible limit of CPCB however, concentration of BOD (1.2 mg/l to 12
   mg/l) and COD (8 mg/l to 31 mg/l) reveals moderate degree of organic
   pollution at some intervals. All the water samples collected during the
   period 2019-20 contain significant amount of nitrate and orthophosphate
   that facilitated growth and development of few indicator species of
   macro benthic community. On the basis of physical, chemical and macro
   zoobenthic study, the Lake water can be classified as moderately

Title = {Environmental drivers of above-ground biomass in semi-arid rangelands},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-175},
Abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB), as a key biophysical and functional
   parameter of rangeland ecosystems, plays an important role in ecosystem
   carbon (C) stocks. The aim of this study was to explore the important
   environmental drivers of AGB in an arid rangeland by using structural
   equation modelling (SEM). Vegetation and soil (physical and chemical
   properties) were sampled using randomised-systematic methods within
   sampling plots. The topographic (elevation, slope, aspect, hillshade
   (i.e. a technique for showing the topographical shape of hills and
   mountains to indicate relative slopes and mountain ridges)) and climatic
   (mean temperature (MT), mean precipitation (MP), actual
   evapo-transpiration (AET) and land-surface temperature (LST)) properties
   were extrapolated using a raster-based digital elevation-model (DEM)
   map, and their values extracted at each sampling plot. SEM was then
   applied to assess the direct and indirect impacts of environmental
   factors on AGB. The AGB was directly affected by soil (41\%, P< 0.05)
   and climatic properties (34\%, P< 0.05). The effect of topographical
   factors on AGB was non-significant (P> 0.05). However, climatic
   properties were directly affected by topographical properties, with a
   path coefficient of 34\%. Among soil properties, nitrogen, phosphorus
   and potassium concentrations, silt content and soil pH were the key
   factors affecting AGB. Climatic variables (MT, MP) were equally
   effective in explaining the climate latent variable (with loading
   factors of -0.97 and 0.99 respectively) and AGB changes. This study
   highlighted the importance of soil and climatic properties in AGB
   variation. SEM simplified and revealed the complex relationships among
   ecosystem components affecting AGB, which could assist proper management
   of rangelands.},

Title = {Spatial constraints and seasonal conditions but not poaching pressure
   are linked with elevated faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations
   in white rhino},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Context. Due to considerable declines in African wildlife populations,
   most large African mammals are managed inside protected areas. Protected
   areas come in various sizes, and have different environmental features,
   climates and management strategies (i.e. ``hands-on' or ``hands-off')
   that can influence an animals' homeostasis. White rhinos (Ceratotherium
   simum simum) are found almost exclusively within protected areas where
   population sizes are driven by natural factors and poaching pressures.
   Aims. Our aim was to understand the effect of natural and anthropogenic
   factors on the adrenocortical response of white rhinos within three
   protected areas. Specifically, we wanted to understand how poaching
   pressure, protected area size (< 500 km(2)), season (wet and dry) and
   rainfall patterns were responsible for driving adrenocortical activity
   in white rhino. Methods. To understand the relationship between rhino
   adrenocortical responses and different environmental and anthropogenic
   stressors, we quantified glucocorticoid metabolites in faecal samples
   (fGCM) collected from four populations within three protected areas
   (i.e. two small parks, one big park) during the wet and dry seasons. Key
   results. We found differences in seasonal fGCM concentrations, with a
   42\% increase during the dry season, and no differences in fGCM
   concentrations between the high and low poaching areas. Additionally, we
   found fGCM concentrations in samples from the small parks were
   respectively 38\% and 42\% higher than in samples from the large park
   during both the dry and wet seasons compared. Conclusions. Our results
   suggest that white rhinos may experience physiological stress in smaller
   parks, especially during the dry season when resources are limited.
   Implications. By mitigating stress associated with reduced access to
   resources and spatial constraints, managers may better promote the
   viability of large mammals in small protected areas.},

Title = {Fox and cat responses to fox baiting intensity, rainfall and prey
   abundance in the Upper Warren, Western Australia},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {201-211},
Abstract = {Context: Invasive predators are major drivers of global biodiversity
   loss. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus) have
   contributed to the decline and extinction of many native species in
   Australia. The deployment of poison baits to control fox populations is
   a widespread conservation tool, but the effects of baiting intensity,
   rainfall and prey abundance on baiting effectiveness remain poorly
   understood. Aims: We aimed to understand what influences the association
   between fox baiting intensity, red fox activity and feral cat activity,
   to provide inferences about what might affect the effectiveness of fox
   baiting in reducing fox activity. Methods: We used generalised linear
   models to assess how fox and cat activity changes in relation to fox
   baiting intensity, rainfall, native prey availability and distance to
   agricultural land over a 6-year period (2006-13) in the forest
   ecosystems of the Upper Warren region of south-western Australia. Key
   results: We found that fox activity was negatively associated with
   rainfall in the previous 12 months and positively associated with prey
   abundance and fox baiting intensity. We also found an interaction
   between fox baiting and prey abundance, with fox activity increasing
   with prey activity in areas of low and moderate baiting intensity, but
   remaining constant in areas of high baiting intensity. Feral cat
   activity was positively associated with prey abundance and fox baiting
   intensity. We found no clear relationship between fox and cat activity.
   Conclusions: The drivers of the association between fox baiting and fox
   activity are unclear because intense fox baiting was targeted at areas
   of known high fox abundance. However, our results indicate that intense
   fox baiting may be effective at decoupling the positive association
   between fox activity and prey abundance. Our results also suggest a
   positive association between fox baiting intensity and feral cat
   activity, thus supporting the case for integrated fox and cat
   management. Implications: We caution interpretation of our results, but
   note that management of invasive predators could be improved by
   adjusting the intensity of management in response to changes in
   environmental conditions and local context (e.g. strategically
   conducting intense predator management where prey abundance is highest).
   Improved understanding of these associations requires a monitoring
   program with sufficient replication and statistical power to detect any
   treatment effects.},

Title = {Coastal dolphins and marine megafauna in Exmouth Gulf, Western
   Australia: informing conservation management actions in an area under
   increasing human pressure},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {435-450},
Abstract = {Context. Exmouth Gulf is adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park, a
   UNESCO-listed area in Western Australia. The gulf remains largely
   unprotected, and is under increasing anthropogenic pressure from
   proposed industrial activities that pose threats to marine megafauna
   inhabiting the gulf. Threatened and near threatened species, such as the
   Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific
   bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), reside in the gulf; however,
   detailed information on their ecology and behaviour is lacking. Aims.
   The aim was to (1) provide baseline data on the distribution, encounter
   rate, group size and behaviour of coastal dolphins over an area where
   current industrial developments are proposed, and (2) report on the
   occurrence of other marine megafauna within this area. Methods.
   Boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted on the western
   coastline of Exmouth Gulf along predetermined line transects (150 km(2))
   over austral autumn/winter 2021. Key results. Across 809.35 km of
   surveyed waters (181 h), a total of 93 bottlenose dolphin, 15 humpback
   dolphin, and six interspecific dolphin groups were sighted. Bottlenose
   dolphin groups were encountered at a rate of 0.077/km, humpback dolphin
   groups at 0.015/km and interspecific dolphin groups at 0.005/km.
   Dolphins were predominantly recorded in shallow (mean 10 m) and warm
   (mean 21 degrees C) waters, and were commonly travelling and foraging.
   In total, 199 individual bottlenose dolphins and 48 humpback dolphins
   were photo-identified (excluding calves). There were 30 bottlenose
   dolphin calves (including three newborns) and four humpback dolphin
   calves (including two newborns) identified. Other marine megafauna group
   sightings included humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae; n=32),
   southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, n=1), dugongs (Dugong dugon,
   n=25), turtles (n=54), sea snakes (n=27), manta rays (Mobula alfredi,
   n=13) and sharks (n=2). Conclusions. The presence of threatened marine
   species feeding, socialising, and resting highlights the importance of
   these waters for the identified species.},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles popularly known as drones are gadgets that do
   not require an onboard pilot and can move in the air either by the
   guidance of an operator or on their own. These are made of composite
   material to ensure that they light weighted and can fly at high
   altitudes. In the present scenario, the use of drones is not restricted
   to the military but includes various other purposes such as delivery,
   journalism, filmmaking, rescue operations, natural calamities,
   archaeological surveys, geographical mapping, agriculture, wildlife
   monitoring, aerial photography etc.
   With the coming of this new technology, it has paved the way for many
   new crimes, one of which is the breach of privacy. Privacy has been made
   a Fundamental Right under Article 21 of the constitution. But the means
   through which this privacy can be breached is not categorized in any
   statute, it is decided by the judiciary on a case-to-case basis.},

Title = {Should we burn the Cerrado? Effects of fire frequency on open savanna
   plant communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {AimsTropical savanna evolved in the presence of fire, depending on it to
   maintain its physiognomies and biodiversity. Open ecosystems of tropical
   savanna burn frequently, and thus changes in fire frequency can affect
   their plant communities. In this study we aimed to analyze the effects
   of different fire frequencies on the composition, structure and
   post-fire regeneration of open savanna plant communities of the Cerrado.
   LocationOpen savannas, Central Brazil (13 degrees 35-38 ` S and 47
   degrees 45-51 ` W). MethodsWe conducted surveys in areas with different
   fire frequencies (fire exclusion, burned annually and burned biennially
   for 6 years, from 2013). Vegetation sampling was carried out before
   application of fire treatments in 2017, and then 1 and 2 years after.
   Species cover was estimated visually and later grouped into graminoids,
   shrubs and forbs. ResultsEvaluation of the plant communities after 6
   years of fire treatment indicated that fire frequency did not affect
   species richness. Fire frequency did, however, promote alteration in
   species occurrence and abundance, resulting in three dissimilar plant
   communities. Regarding post-fire regeneration, annually burned plots
   showed consistency in species richness and growth form cover over 6
   years of annually applied fire. Biennially burned plots tended to be
   more variable than the other treatments, with a large increase in
   species richness and growth form cover in the first year after fire,
   succeeded by a decrease in the second year. Not all species that were
   recruited just after fire were able to persist in the above-ground
   community in the second year after fire. ConclusionsOpen savannas of the
   Cerrado are highly resilient to fire, even to annual fires, with 6 years
   of annual fire treatments not affecting post-fire species diversity or
   growth form cover. However, communities differed in species composition,
   which can influence their functional diversity and lead to alterations
   in ecosystem services. Our findings encourage long-term studies to
   evaluate the resilience of areas frequently burned, as well as longer
   fire exclusion periods.},

Abstract = {AIoT is the melding of AI and IOT. The use of artificial intelligence in
   conjunction with the Internet of things is a modern trend in the field
   of digital devices and their respective data processing (IoT). AI is
   capable of giving these devices a sense of life while IoT can give them
   a global link. To help keep everyone informed, the system will also send
   information about the patient's current health status and full medical
   information to any family members and doctor. Preliminary stage illness
   prediction using data mining techniques would also allow deciding the
   best approach. It is anticipated that the internet of things (IoT) will
   combine the power of artificial intelligence, blockchain and other
   emerging technology in order to create future ``smart hospitals.{''} The
   emerging categories of IoT devices, including adhesive sensors for skin,
   will make a financial contribution and will enhance the security,
   interoperability and analytical potential of these tools while
   developing technologies including block channels. By using AI to
   incorporate things into our environment, death rates can be
   substantially reduced, enabling us to identify high-risk patients early
   on, monitor disease spread, and predict mortality risk by examining the
   health history of the patient. Standardization is a major challenge in
   this area, with obstacles including the protection of patients' privacy,
   operational simplicity, portability, and low power requirements.},

Title = {Marine surf to freshwater: a molecular phylogeny of Donacidae (Bivalvia:
   Heterodonta)},
Journal = {INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {984-1001},
Abstract = {Donacidae is a commercially important family of heterodont bivalves and
   one of the few bivalve lineages that has successfully colonised brackish
   and fresh waters. However, to date, no phylogenetic hypothesis exists
   for this widely distributed group. Here we turn to molecular data from
   the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and combine these with the
   extensive fossil record of donacids to propose an evolutionary
   hypothesis for the family. Our analyses strongly support the monophyly
   of Donacidae, including Galatea, Iphigenia and `Plebidonax' deltoides,
   but render Donax paraphyletic. The subgenus Latona is therefore elevated
   to genus to accommodate a clade of Indo-Pacific species, while retaining
   Donax for a clade of mostly Atlantic and American Pacific species, and a
   few Indo-Pacific species. This latter clade is sister group to Galatea +
   Iphigenia. The diversification of Donacidae seems to be tightly
   connected to the opening of the North and South Atlantic Oceans in the
   Cretaceous, and to the closing of the Tethys Ocean during the Oligocene.

Abstract = {The antidiabetic activity of several combinations of aqueous extract of
   plant Butea monospermea and a potent antidiabetic agent Metformin was
   studied. Tissue protein (mg/ml tissue homogenate) is an easily altered
   biochemical system and was measured at regular intervals during the
   experiment period. According to the findings, all of the treatments
   investigated had an optimistic consequence on tissue total protein
   concentration in Diabetes Mellites. Glycogen content, which is a
   recovered form of carbohydrate (glucose), is a direct indicator of
   insulin action in the body. Treatment with Butea monosperma aqueous
   extract at various dosages aimed at 15 days exhibited a substantial
   surge in the liver carbohydrate (glycogen) amount as compared to normal
   control. When the hepatic glycogen concentration of all the extracts was
   analysed independently, it was found that the extract at a dose
   concentration of 600 mg kg-1 body weight was most efficient in
   recovering the hepatic glycogen content.},

Abstract = {Until now, tribal and rural people have enjoyed a variety of wild leafy
   vegetables that are unexplored by the common man. Nutritional properties
   of two such leafy vegetables Rungia pectinata and Dicliptera
   bupleuroides were evaluated in terms of moisture, ash, fiber, protein,
   carbohydrate, fat, and minerals. These two leafy vegetables are rich in
   calcium and potassium. Besides, they contain chlorine, sulphur,
   phosphorus, iron, silicon, manganese, titanium, chromium, copper, zinc,
   bromine, rubidium, and stadium. The results suggest that these two
   underutilised leafy vegetables are good sources of essential
   micronutrients in addition to the presence of nutrients. Hence, the
   inclusion of these leafyvegetables in our diet can supplement
   nutritional requirements necessary for overall good health, thereby
   protecting us against deficiency},

Abstract = {The Cephalomalthinus semifumatus species group, referred to as the
   ``semifumatus{''} group henceforth, is interesting because of its
   heterogeneous morphology resembling either Cephalomalthinus Pic, 1921 or
   Rhagonycha Eschscholtz, 1830. To elucidate its phylogenetic status,
   mitochondrial genomes of four species of the ``semifumatus{''} group, 11
   Cephalomalthinus species, and 11 Rhagonycha species were sequenced and
   examined. All analysed mitogenomes were similar with respect to genome
   size, nucleotide composition, and AT content. Surprisingly, a
   rearrangement of the trnW-trnC and trnY genes was detected in the
   ``semifumatus{''} group, presumably caused by tandem duplication and
   random loss events. Furthermore, genetic distance analyses showed that
   the proximity of the ``semifumatus{''} group to Cephalomalthinus and to
   Rhagonycha was comparable to that between the latter two. Moreover, the
   produced phylogeny strongly supported the monophyly of the
   ``semifumatus{''} group, and molecular clock analyses dated its
   divergence from Cephalomalthinus to 32.52 Ma. Thus, the new genus
   Amphimorphus gen. nov. is suggested to comprise the ``semifumatus{''}
   group, in which the observed gene rearrangement was a synapomorphy.
   Moreover, morphological evidence regarding the unique structure of the
   aedeagus supported this separation. These results indicate that
   mitochondrial gene rearrangement provide important phylogenetic
   implications for revising Cephalomalthinus, a speciose genus that is
   puzzling in the morphology-based taxonomy.},

   individuals who died in road-vehicle collisions belonged to 30 bird
   species. The Accipitridae family had the most electrocuted birds
   individuals, followed by Corvidae and so on. During the study we found
   that most road-killed species were from the Columbidae family followed
   by two families containing three species each; Sturnidae and Turdidae.
   Two-two species of road kill were from five families Cuculidae,
   Hirundinidae, Corvidae, Motacillidae, Pycnonotidae and the remaining
   family Dicruridae, Accipitridae, Meropidae, Passeridae, Phasianidae,
   Leiothrichidae, Timaliidae, Charadriidae and Strigidae contained only
   one species of road-killed in the study area. Columbidae family had the

   showed the most frequent growth forms followed by foliose (14\%), but no
   presence of fruticose lichen is recorded. The family graphidaceae with a
   number of 47 species exhibit their dominance in the area followed by
   pyrenulaceae and caliciaceae with 9 and 6 species respectively. The
   genus graphis revealed their luxuriant growth with 38 species of lichen
   followed by pyrenula with 9 species.},

Journal = {ACTA AMAZONICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {299-302},
Abstract = {One of the constraints in pirarucu, Arapaima gigas farming is the
   reproduction in captivity, due to inconsistent number of spawning events
   per reproductive cycle, thus, unreliable availability of juvenile fish.
   This is a first-hand report on predation of pirarucu larvae by
   opportunistic fish species in a breeding pond. Fish samples were
   collected for stomach content analysis from a pirarucu-breeding pond
   with reported predation on the larvae. We obtained 61 fish of different
   species (Tetragonopterus sp., Astyanax bimaculatus, Moenkhausia
   intermedia, Hoplias malabaricus, and Apistogramma sp.). Tetragonopterus
   sp. stomachs had the highest frequency of occurrence of pirarucu larvae
   (83.3\%), followed by A. bimaculatus (7.4\%). The relationship between
   the feeding behaviour of these species and their predation upon pirarucu
   offspring is discussed.},

Journal = {ACTA AMAZONICA},

Abstract = {Green maize has great economic value, and the consumer market
   increasingly demands the production of ears for fresh consumption that
   are free from damage by pest attacks. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the performance of varieties of AG1051 green maize and Roraima
   maize (ethnovariety Milh??o) intercropped with dwarf grain sorghum,
   forage sorghum and millet in an environment of the Amazon savannah. We
   evaluated phytotechnical characteristics of the maize and damage from
   the leaf-footed bug (Leptoglossus zonatus). The experiment was set up in
   a 2 x 4 factorial randomised block design with four replications, where
   the two maize varieties corresponded to the first factor and four
   intercropping systems to the second factor. Regarding vegetative and
   reproductive components, Milh??o had a longer cycle, greater plant
   growth and smaller stem diameter than AG1051, causing plant lodging. The
   intercropping systems had no influence on the production or quality of
   maize ears for any of the cultivars under study. Milh??o did not differ
   from the AG1051 hybrid in any ear quality variable (ear length, number
   of grains per ear, cob diameter, ear weight and total number of ears).
   The AG1051 cultivar was preferred by L. zonatus, but had the highest
   yield of commercial ears. The intercropping systems had no influence on
   the damage caused by the leaf-footed bug.},

Abstract = {Two sites in a semi-arid region of western Haryana were evaluated for
   the stray dog sighting using Scan sampling on an opportunistic
   basis/random encounter while conducting ecological studies for a period
   of two years from 2019-20. Monthly mean sightings were calculated from
   field visits based on random encounters. The chasing and group or pack
   hunting behaviour exhibited by stray dogs were also observed randomly in
   single, pair and moderate size packs. Significant presences of dogs were
   found during the present investigation and data on blackbuck and other
   wildlife causalities by dogs were also obtained from State Forest
   Department (2016-2020) revealing that it is a serious concern for
   wildlife and providing the baseline information to categorize them as
   only predator in this region. The establishment of dog sterilization cum
   vaccination centres and regular dog census in wildlife dominated regions
   are suggested to understand and mitigate this issue and for long term
   conservation of wildlife in the state of Haryana.},

Abstract = {Yajna is an ancient Vedic ritual, been done since ancient times and is
   performed for favourable conditions related to the various environmental
   issues. The present study was conducted to reveal the effect of Gayatri
   Yajna on seed germination and seedling development of Trigonella
   foenum-graecum (fenugreek). The seeds were divided into two groups-group
   A was treated with Gayatri Yajna and group B was treated with only mango
   wood smoke, seeds of group A were kept under the environment of Gayatri
   Yajna for four days and then soaked in sterile water overnight and group
   B were treated with mango wood smoke for 4 days than soaked in sterile
   water for overnight. The data were tabulated as on the first day of
   germination, seed germination rate, last day of germination, final
   germination percentage, mean germination time, coefficient of the
   velocity of germination, pseudo leaves appear day, root length and shoot
   length. Observations revealed notable differences in seed germination
   and seedling development between the two groups. The present study thus
   aims in proving a major breakthrough in gaining access to the precious
   Vedic knowledge, understanding the Vedic science and employing their
   scientific analysis to enhance the crop quality, decreasing the
   germination time and increasing the root and shoot development thereby
   making our environment more sustainable and harmful chemicals free.},

Volume = {52},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The phylogeny of the very diverse Neotropical fish family Characidae has
   been the subject of several recent contributions based on morphological
   characters, molecular data or both in combined analyses. In cases of
   conflict between these kinds of data, resolution by combined analyses
   most often tends to agree with the molecular evidence, given the
   disproportionate number of characters it contains in comparison with
   morphological datasets. This happens especially after the advent of
   massive DNA sequencing methods. In this contribution, we present the
   most comprehensive set of characters from sperm and spermiogenesis of
   the Characidae. Since these traits are not expected to be functionally
   correlated with the general morphology or molecular markers, we consider
   them a third source of data. We provide a phylogenetic analysis from a
   combined dataset of seven molecular markers (6444 characters), general
   morphology (520 characters) and reproductive features (94 characters)
   coded for 165 species of characiform fishes. Parsimony analyses were
   done under extended implied weighting under 30 different combinations of
   weighting schemes and strengths. Most parsimonious trees from two
   different weighting conditions were selected as representative samples
   of the obtained topologies, in order to evaluate the performance of the
   reproductive characters. One of these hypotheses is more conservative
   regarding the currently accepted phylogenies and the other is the most
   parsimonious tree that we found as the best correlated with the
   morphological data. Reproductive characters are shown to be more
   homoplastic than general morphology and DNA, but provided synapomorphies
   for 23-24 nodes that had no morphological synapomorphies, justifying
   their use in phylogenetic analyses. Also, in combination with data from
   general morphology and considering details of the phylogenetic analysis,
   they showed to have the potential to challenge well-established
   hypotheses based on molecular data.},

Abstract = {The current distribution patterns of many Mediterranean species are
   often a consequence of large and impactful past geoclimatic events, such
   as the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) and the Quaternary glacial
   cycles. Cicadas are flying insects with poor dispersal ability, which
   have experienced intense local differentiation in the Mediterranean,
   where the genus Tettigettalna has surfaced as a biogeographic model. The
   genus includes 10 species with species-specific calling songs but
   identical morphology. All Tettigettalna species are restricted to
   Southern Iberia, with the exception of T. estrellae (northwest Iberia),
   the widespread T. argentata (mainly Iberia, France and Italy), and T.
   afroamissa (Morocco). With an expanded genetic dataset involving nuclear
   (EF1 alpha) and mitochondrial (5 ` and 3 ` COI and ATP) loci, we
   reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus and estimated divergence dates
   for Tettigettalna species under a Bayesian framework. Phylogeny with the
   new mitochondrial dataset was in agreement with previous studies,
   whereas the nuclear EF1 alpha supported T. josei and T. afroamissa as
   monophyletic clades but lacked resolution to resolve the remaining taxa.
   Some sister taxa share mitochondrial haplotypes, hinting for incomplete
   lineage sorting. Estimates of divergence time settled T. josei as the
   earliest diverging lineage, likely as a pre- or early-MSC event. As for
   the origin of T. afroamissa in Morocco, though time estimates could not
   entirely rule out post-MSC dispersal, the most likely scenario points to
   isolation of African Tettigettalna after the reopening of the strait of
   Gibraltar. The Pleistocene glaciations that followed likely impacted on
   the diversification of the remaining species of the genus in southern
   Iberia refugia.},

Title = {Integrative taxonomy tests possible hybridisation between Central Asian
   cerambycids (Coleoptera)},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hybridisation can lead to the formation of new evolutionary lineages and
   some described insect species may in fact be first-generation hybrids of
   their parental species. Anoplistes forticornis and A. galusoi are two
   closely related cerambycid taxa endemic to Central Asia that exhibit a
   peculiar geographical distribution. Although the common diagnostic
   elytral pattern makes these beetles superficially easily
   distinguishable, there are marked resemblances in their morphology. By
   applying an integrative taxonomy approach, we verify the taxonomic
   status of A. forticornis and A. galusoi and test the possibility of
   hybridisation. The results of our comprehensive morphological
   examination and molecular analyses targeting mitochondria! (COI, 16S
   rRNA) and nuclear (arginine kinase, CAD, 28S rRNA) genes support the
   specific status of these taxa. In mtDNA, the putative hybrid specimen is
   more closely related to A. forticornis, which indicates that a female of
   this species bred with a male of A. galusoi. The supposed ecotypic
   variability (manifested in elytral pattern) is apparently not related to
   the topography or spatial structure of habitat. The phylogenetic
   hypothesis supports a peripatric scenario in which populations of the
   common ancestor had been separated for a significant period of time,
   first by the mountain ranges of Dzungarian Alatau (similar to 11-10 Ma)
   and ultimately by the Ili River. The diverged taxa came into recent
   secondary contact following these isolation events. The methodology
   presented herein can be widely applied to identify first-generation
   hybridisation in Coleoptera.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to know the intentions of Indian parents

   of 85 parents who were between the age group of 30 to 50 years and the
   age of at least one of their children between 8 to 18 years participated
   in the study. The results of the study revealed that the majority of the
   parents do have intentions to have communication about sexuality with
   their children. The actual indulgence of the parents in sexual
   communication with their children was seen to be moderate. The
   intentions of the parents were seen to be significantly associated with
   their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control.},

Abstract = {In a typical year in the central Amazon, there is a mild dry season, but
   its effect on stem growth of multipurpose forest tree species is not yet
   well known. This study aimed to determine the individual effect of
   microclimatic parameters on stem growth after removing the influence of
   intercorrelation among microclimatic variables. Monthly stem diameter
   increment was measured in six species (46 trees) from January 2018 to
   December 2020. Microclimatic variables recorded were irradiance, air
   temperature, rainfall, and vapor pressure deficit. Principal component
   regression was used to assess the effect of micrometeorological
   variability on stem growth. On average, stem growth increased with an
   increase in rainfall and soil water content, but decreased with rise in
   maximum temperature and maximum vapor pressure deficit. These findings
   indicate that, when removing the effect of intercorrelation between
   microclimatic parameters, vapor pressure deficit may, in fact, affect
   stem growth. We demonstrate that the reduction in stem growth during the
   dry season can also be related to an increase in maximum temperature and
   maximum vapor pressure deficit, and not only to a decline in soil water
   content.},

   analyses did not reveal any statistically significant differences as per
   the league levels for the confidence, constancy and control dimensions
   of mental toughness. But, the education levels showed a statistically
   significant difference only for the confidence dimension of mental
   toughness but not for constancy and control dimensions. It revealed,
   that there is no difference in mental toughness levels of professional
   footballers as per the leagues they play for. Interestingly, the
   confidence dimension of mental toughness levels of professional
   footballers significantly differs according to education levels.},

Title = {Mercury bioaccumulation, genotoxic and biochemical biomarkers reveal the
   health status of yellow-spotted Amazon River turtles (Podocnemis
   unifilis) in an environmental protection area in the Amazon},
Journal = {ACTA AMAZONICA},

Abstract = {Chelonians are considered good bioindicators of environmental quality.
   The assessment of the health status of chelonian populations in the
   Amazon is important because they are traditionally consumed in large
   numbers in riverine communities and sustainable use reserves. The
   present study aimed to evaluate the health of Podocnemis unifilis
   (Testudines, Podocnemididae) in an environmental protection area in the
   Amazon region in Brazil. We analyzed the biomarkers lipoperoxidation,
   carbonylation of proteins, occurrence of micronuclei and erythrocytic
   nuclear abnormalities, quantified metallothioneins, and evaluated
   mercury bioaccumulation. We generated pioneering data regarding
   biomarkers in wild Amazonian freshwater turtles. All biomarker responses
   did not vary significantly between the sexes. The occurrence of
   oxidative and genotoxic damage, as well as concentrations of
   metallothioneins was low compared to other studies. In addition, the
   bioaccumulation of mercury in the muscle of the animals was below the
   limit recommended for human consumption by the World Health
   Organization. Our results provide baseline data on mercury
   bioaccumulation and biomarker responses that can be useful for future
   comparisons with other freshwater turtles. The data also provide
   evidence that the sustainable exploitation of these turtles in the study
   area (Piagacu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve) does not pose a
   risk to local riverine communities, as the detected mercury
   concentrations are safe for human consumption. In this sense, our
   results highlight the importance of protected areas for the conservation
   of healthy turtle populations, at the same time ensuring the health of
   the human populations that use them as a food resource.},

Abstract = {We report two cases of hemochromatosis-like disease in captive Brazilian
   tapirs, Tapirus terrestris in Par?? state, Brazil. Both animals
   presented symptoms of chronic hepatopathy associated with marked
   accumulation of hemosiderin. The coloration of Perls demonstrated
   pronounced iron accumulation in macrophages in the portal space, Kupffer
   cells, and, to a lesser extent, in the hepatocytes of the periportal
   region. Marked portal fibrosis was evidenced by Masson???s trichrome.
   The pathological mechanisms of this disease in tapirs are not yet well
   established. It has been suggested that the species may have different
   mechanisms of iron absorption and elimination, rendering them sensitive
   to elevation in dietary levels of this metal. Two previous reports of
   this disease in T. terrestris exist from zoos in Australia and Scotland.
   This is the first report of this disease in tapirs in Brazil based on
   histopathological and histochemical findings.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to explore bird species diversity and
   conservation challenges in Lake Arekit located in the Guraghe Zone of
   Ethiopia. Point counts along the shoreline of the lake were employed to
   identify and record birds. Potential threats to the lake were identified
   through field observation and via key informant interviews. A total
   number of 56 bird species belonging to 23 families, and 11 orders were
   observed. One species, the Blue winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) was
   endemic, three species were near-endemic, and five species were
   vulnerable in their conservation status. A significantly higher number
   of species (i.e., 47) was recorded in the dry season than in the wet
   season (i.e., 24). The relative abundance of birds was also
   significantly higher during the dry season (t = 2.23, P > 0.05). The
   study also showed that Lake Arekit is under severe threats including
   urbanization with unwise waste disposals, siltation, and intensive
   agricultural expansion. Therefore, urgent stakeholder actions are
   required to save this lake and thereby the vast array of its
   biodiversity particularly the birds.},

Abstract = {Carbon (C) and silicon (Si) are essential lake ecosystem components,
   impacting both phy-toplankton growth and other available elements and
   nutrients. In this study, we selected a typical floodplain-lake system
   to explore the seasonal role of coupled C and Si as mat-ter is imported
   and exported through lotic water processes. Results showed considerably
   higher dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   and dissolved to-tal carbon (DTC) concentrations during the transitional
   stage between the dry and wet season (here referred to as TDW) compared
   to the other seasonal stages (5.81 mg/L-28.80 mg/L), indicating that
   imported runoff significantly effects the transport of C and Si. Rock
   weathering was the main source of dissolved silicon (DSi). The dilution
   effect and water temperature may also impact DIC, DOC, and DTC
   concentrations. Except for the wet sea-son, Bacillariophyta was the
   dominant phytoplankton taxon, and diatom growth as well as the growth of
   other algae taxon may influence DSi and DTC concentrations through
   sev-eral biochemical processes. This study describes effects of coupled
   C and Si and highlights variation in environmental variables driven by
   the resident phytoplankton communities in a lake ecosystem.(c) 2022

Abstract = {The discovery of magnetosome and magnetotaxis in its most simple form in
   the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) had created the tremendous impetus.
   MTB, spanning multiple phyla, are distributed worldwide, and they form
   the organelles called magnetosomes for biomineralization. Eight
   phylotypes of MTB belong to Alphaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae. MTB
   show preference for specific redox and oxygen concentration. Magnetosome
   chains function as the internal compass needle and align the bacterial
   cells passively along the local geomagnetic field (GMF). The nature of
   magnetosomes produced by MTB and their phylogeny suggest that
   bullet-shaped magnetites appeared about 3.2 billion years ago with the
   first magnetosomes. All MTB contains ten genes in conserved mamAB operon
   for magnetosome chain synthesis of which nine genes are conserved in
   greigite-producing MTB. Many candidate genes identify the aero-, redox-,
   and perhaps phototaxis. Among the prokaryotes, the MTB possess the
   highest number of O-2-binding proteins. Magnetofossils serve as an
   indicator of oxygen and redox levels of the ancient environments. Most
   descendants of ancestral MTB lost the magnetosome genes in the course of
   evolution. Environmental conditions initially favored the evolution of
   MTB and expansion of magnetosome-formation genes. Subsequent changes in
   atmospheric oxygen concentration have led to changes in the ecology of
   MTB, loss of magnetosome genes, and evolution of nonMTB.},

Abstract = {Obesogenic diets lead to fat accumulation and dysfunctional adipose
   tissue. Active compounds were described in copaiba oleoresin, which
   presents anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties.
   However, there are no data regarding the effects of copaiba oleoresin in
   adipose tissue. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the copaiba
   oleoresin could prevent or minimize obesity and adipose tissue
   inflammation and oxidative stress in response to a high sucrose diet.
   Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receiving commercial chow (C,
   n = 8), commercial chow and 30\% sucrose added to the drinking water (S,
   n = 8), or commercial chow and 30\% sucrose added to the drinking water
   + copaiba oleoresin (S+CO, n = 8). Copaiba oleoresin was given at a dose
   of 200 mg kg(-1) day(-1) by gavage for eight weeks. C and S animals
   received vehicle, at equivalent volume, by gavage. At the end of the
   experiment, blood samples and epididymal adipose tissue were collected
   for biochemical, inflammatory, and oxidative stress analyses. Copaiba
   oleoresin supplementation prevented weight gain, adiposity, insulin
   resistance, and increased IL-1 beta levels. Additionally, copaiba
   oleoresin partially attenuated the increase in fasting glucose levels,
   lipids, and IL-6 levels, and improved the redox status in adipose
   tissue. Our results suggest that the use of copaiba oleoresin could be a
   good strategy for prevention of obesity and its complications.},

Abstract = {Citizen Science involves people as part of a scientific enquiry.
   However, in an age of great environmental changes, citizens are faced
   with degradation that affects ecosystem structure and function. Their
   role as drivers of change can be also relevant for biodiversity
   conservation. As in Citizen Science, where the citizens, properly
   trained, can initiate a widespread and fine-grained knowledge process,
   it is also possible to start a Citizen Management process, where
   citizens, adequately trained in problem solving, can change the state of
   an environmental system, with positive effects on the latter and on
   themselves. To prepare citizens for the acquisition of a problem solving
   and management paradigms, a quick meeting carried out with citizens by a
   senior manager as facilitator can be an opportunity to explain some
   basic steps: introducing them to the concept of `problem', the
   definition of a project team and SMART objectives, the use of creativity
   during brainstorming, choosing an approach to the decision-making
   process and defining a strategy (actions, times, roles, resources,
   monitoring, and adaptation). According to the Hill and Westbrook's SWOT
   approach, we suggest a list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
   threats that characterize the Citizen Management approach.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play an important ecological role in arid
   and semi-arid ecosystems. So far, most studies on BSCs have focused on
   deserts, while rarely examining the successional process of BSCs in
   artificial/restored grassland. This study aimed to explore the natural
   succession and characteristics of BSCs during the recovery process of an
   artificial grassland in the Source Zone of the Yellow River. Six sites
   in two grassland types, i.e. one healthy alpine meadow and five
   artificial grasslands, were selected in Maqin county, Qinghai Province.
   These artificial grasslands have been established for varying growth
   periods ranging from 1 to 18 years. We examined vegetation
   characteristics in relation to BSC types, BSC coverage and thickness at
   these six sites. Mosses appeared at the early stage of the natural
   succession of the grassland, and lichens and visible algal crusts
   followed. The dominant moss species was Barbula unguiculate. BSC
   coverage increased significantly with recovery period. BSC thickness
   increased initially in the early stage of recovery but decreased after
   14 years of recovery. At an appropriate level (0 similar to 30\%), an
   increase in litter coverage can increase BSCs thickness, but excessive
   litter (> 30\%) can reduce BSCs coverage (P < 0.05). Therefore, an
   increase in the total coverage of vegetation and maintenance of a
   suitable litter coverage (< 30\%) are important to promote the
   establishment and succession of BSCs in recovered grasslands.},

Abstract = {Rhinoclemmys punctularia punctularia is the only turtle of the family
   Geoemydidae with part of its range in Brazil. The species is
   semi-aquatic and widely distributed across the Amazon basin but is still
   poorly studied. We evaluated aspects of the population structure,
   habitat use, seasonal activity, and diet of the species during one year,
   from the beginning of the rainy season to the end of the dry season, in
   two headwater localities in the Tocantins and Tapaj??s river basins, in
   the state of Par??, Brazil. We captured 45 individuals, 14 in the
   Tocantins basin and 31 in the Tapaj??s basin. The size-class frequency
   distributions of captured individuals did not differ between the two
   samples. The turtles were most frequently captured in first-order
   streams, followed by lentic (third-order dammed streams) and
   second-order streams. The capture rate did not vary significantly
   between sampling periods (start and peak of the rainy season; start and
   end of the dry season). The trapping effort to capture a single
   individual was much higher in the Tapaj??s basin (1,215 trap-hours) than
   in the Tocantins basin (136 trap-hours). Overall, the low capture rates
   confirm the secretive nature of the species in Amazonia and its apparent
   rarity. The individuals analyzed in this study consumed mainly plants.},

Abstract = {The Ecohydrology program of UNESCO established demonstration sites
   around the world where the ecohydrologic techniques are demonstrated to
   disseminate the concept and by learning from visualization of real in
   situ experiments and examples. To analyse the impact of applying
   ecohydrological solutions at the demonstration sites (eg. use of
   bivalves as filter feeders, phytoremediation or managing freshwater
   pulses), we propose to use ecosystem service indicators selected by
   expert judgment and literature. The ecosystem services (ES) concept
   provides a recognizable and easy way to evaluate the changes on the
   ecosystem, by measuring the improvement or degradation of the services
   that are provided. The proposed ES indicators table allows the
   evaluation of relevant ecosystem services, for all demosites by
   comparing the following three temporal situations: 1- before the impact
   occurred, 2 - after it occurred but without any restoration measure
   being implemented and; 3- after applying ecohydrology restoration
   solutions. The proposed Ecosystem services matrix was applied to the
   Guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal area demosite, in the south east
   of Portugal, based on extensive research on applying ecohydrology
   solutions at the site and expert judgement. Results show that the
   application of the Ecosystem Services (ES) matrix allows to understand
   the benefits of applying the ecohydrology approach, as it helps defining
   services and areas where more effort in recuperation is needed. (C) 2022

Title = {A novel approach to assessing the impacts of dam construction on

Abstract = {The hydrological situation of rivers, the fundamental driving force of
   river ecosystems, has continued to change due to the impact of human
   activities on water environments. Intra-and inter-annual variation also
   causes alterations in morphology, water quality, flora, and fauna in
   riparian zones. In this study, we present a novel approach to assessing
   the im-pacts of dam construction on flow river regimes and associated
   ecosystems in the Castril River (Spain). We compared the altered flows
   recorded from 20 0 0 to 2018 with those of the natural regime of the
   river obtained from a previously calibrated hydrological model after the
   dam was put into operation in 20 0 0. The Indicators of Hydrologic
   Alteration in RIverS (IAHRIS) method was used because it considers the
   inter-and intra-annual variabil-ities of Mediterranean climates. The
   results showed that the average differences in annual volumes between
   the natural and altered regimes were below 10\% for normal and wet years
   but decreased to 20.49\% in dry years. Thus, the alteration of usual
   values remained between excellent and good. In droughts and floods,
   values were from good to moder-ate, respectively. The flow rate control
   reduced flow peaks downstream from the dam, de-creasing hydrological
   connectivity of river-riverine-flood plains. This decrease may reduce
   the transportation of sediment and organic resources, threatening
   habitat rejuvenation and floodplain biodiversity. This study provides a
   valuable tool to monitor the impacts of ex-isting dams' regulated
   regimens, allowing decision makers to develop flow management strategies
   and adaptation measures to meet ecological water requirements. (c) 2022

Journal = {ACTA AMAZONICA},

Abstract = {Fisheries is an important activity in the Amazon basin and potentially
   has a high impact on ichthyofauna. With the aim of achieving
   sustainability in fisheries of target species, protected areas were
   established within a fisheries management framework known as the Amazon
   Lakes Management System (ALMS). With the aim to evaluate the effect of
   ALMS on fish assemblages as a whole, we compared floodplain lakes with
   different levels of fish management in the lower Solim??es River, in the
   Brazilian Amazon, developing an index of biotic integrity, named
   ALMS-IBI. We sampled fish in three lake categories: protected (PR),
   managed (MN), and commercially fished (CM). The ALMS-IBI was developed
   by selecting and testing fish assemblage metrics based on samplings
   carried out in 2017 and 2018, using gillnets with different mesh sizes.
   We captured 4565 fish of 113 species and seven trophic categories. The
   final index is composed of seven metrics related to species richness,
   trophic structure, and fish abundance, and characterized the fish
   assemblage in the PR and MN lakes as acceptable, and in the CM lakes as
   poor. Our results indicate that the ALMS-IBI can be an efficient method
   to monitor the whole fish assemblage in Amazonian floodplain lakes, and
   can be used as a complementary tool in the ALMS to assess environmental
   sustainability.},

Title = {Effect of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems during Cyclone

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The physical disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions in shaping the
   seagrass meadows were studied in the vicinity of seagrass meadows over
   the south of Port Blair in the An-daman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) during
   the lifetime of Cyclone Lehar using spatial and temporal metrological
   -oceanic parameters and in-situ measurements. A cyclonic depres-sion
   formed on 23 November 2013 over the west coast of the Malay Peninsula
   and then transformed into a severe cyclone named Lehar on 25th November
   2013. It made its first landfall south of Port Blair in the ANI and
   caused extensive damage to life and properties. The present study made
   an attempt to investigate the hydrodynamic condition and their impact on
   the seagrass meadows during the lifetime of the cyclone. The results
   revealed that the floristic composition of seagrass species such as
   Thalassia hemperichii, Halodule pinnifolia and Halodule uninervis was
   badly damaged due to the effect of the high gra-dient of velocities in
   the vertical direction, turbulence, high energetic waves, and storm
   surge. Approximately 32.4\% of the seagrass meadows were uprooted in
   Haddo Bay and 68\% in Sesostris Bay of the South Andaman Islands. A year
   after the cyclone passage (De-cember 2014), 13\% (-0.70 ha) of the
   seagrass meadow in Haddo Bay and 44.5\% (-0.30 ha) of the seagrass in
   Sesostris Bay had recovered. This study emphasises that the
   mor-phometric features of the most dominant species, T. hemperichii,
   were regulated by the physical hydrodynamic mechanisms and led to
   substantial destruction in the study sites. This study is very useful to
   understand the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems
   during a cyclone and brings attention to the real-time monitoring of
   seagrass ecosystems. Monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem can be further
   improved by predicting the behavioural dynamics of the marine ecosystem
   under the various scenarios of extreme weather conditions using
   high-resolution numerical models. It also helps to determine the
   appropriate management policy during extreme natural events.(c) 2022

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems have been heavily affected by environmental changes,
   which led to shift of prokaryotic diversity and distribution, especially
   in the Arctic Ocean. However, how environmental changes affect
   prokaryotic community still unclear. Here, prokaryotic diversity,
   community composition and spatial distribution patterns in marine
   sediments from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean were surveyed.
   The results indicated that the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities
   were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. Moreover, the prokaryotic
   richness and diversity showed strong correlation (R 2 = 0.31 similar to
   0.83, P < 0.05) with heavy metals (such as Cu, Zn, Ni and As). The
   contents of Ni and As repre-sented a range with in which biological
   effects occur occasionally in the Bering Strait, but concentrations of
   Cu, Zn, Ni and As in the western Arctic Ocean showed a probable effect
   range with in which adverse biological effects occasionally or
   frequently occur. Further-more, as geographical distance increased
   archaeal community similarity decreased faster than bacteria. The
   abundances of Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Thaumarchaeota
   significantly increased from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean.
   Conversely, much lower abundances of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes
   and Crenarchaeota were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. In
   addition, all environmental could explain 73.8\% and 85.1\% bacterial
   and archaeal variations, respectively. And heavy metals could
   independently ex-plain 40.3\% and 30.4\% community variation for archaea
   and bacteria, respectively. This study emphasized effects of heavy
   metals on prokaryotic diversities and distribution pat-terns in marine
   sediments, which were helpful to deep understand microbial variation

Abstract = {Protozoan periphytons with their ecological features are considered as a
   robust bioindica-tor for bioassessment of both environmental stress and
   anthropogenic impacts in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a 1-year
   baseline survey was conducted using glass slides in coastal waters of
   Yellow sea, China. Four sampling sites (A-D) were selected from a clean
   area to a polluted station, and samples were collected monthly at a
   depth of 1 m. En-vironmental variables such as salinity, chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), soluble reactive phosphates (SRP),
   ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) were measured
   synchronically to compare with biotic factors. From a total of 144
   identified protozoan species, 53 functional units (FUs) were proposed
   based on four biolog-ical traits: feeding type, resource of food supply,
   body size and movement type. These FUs represented a clear variability
   in spatial distribution among four study sites. Relative abun-dances of
   sessile colonial bacterivores (e.g., BOS5s) showed an increasing trend
   from sites A to D. Multivariate analysis revealed that the patterns of
   protozoan FUs showed a significant variation among four sampling sites,
   and were driven by the increasing levels of nutrients (e.g., NH4-N) and
   decreasing ranks of DO (P < 0.05). The bacterivorous FUs (e.g., BOS5s
   and BIS3v) were significantly positively related to NH4-N, while the
   vagile algivorous FUs (e.g., AIS8v, AOS3v, AOS6v) and sessile predators
   (e.g., RIS4s) were significantly positively corre-lated with
   transparency. These findings suggested that FUs of protozoan periphytons
   may be used as a useful bioindicators of water quality status in marine
   ecosystems.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Abstract = {The disturbances caused to forests by human interferences have a
   significant impact on forest hydrology and the nutrient cycle. The
   stemflow, throughfall, interception loss, and runoff are the major
   components of the forest hydrology and play an active role in nutri-ents
   cycling. A study was therefore carried out in the Sal forests under
   various disturbance gradients in Himalayan foothills to quantify the
   rainfall partitioned components i.e. stem -flow, throughfall, and
   interception loss; runoff; and chemical elements in rainfall
   parti-tioned components. During the study period, a total of 37 rainfall
   events were recorded for the rainfall partitioning study. Results showed
   that the significantly highest average stem -flow was observed in the
   undisturbed Sal forest (3.7 +/- 0.2\%) and lowest in the disturbed Sal
   forest (1.7 +/- 0.1\%). A significantly highest average throughfall was
   observed in the dis-turbed Sal forest (65.2 +/- 1.7\%) and lowest in the
   undisturbed forest (57.8 +/- 1.8\%). Although the highest average
   interception loss was observed in the undisturbed forest (38.5 +/-
   1.8\%) and lowest in the disturbed Sal forest type (33.2 +/- 1.8\%), it
   was not significant ( p = 0.05). Significantly highest average runoff
   (22.2 +/- 1.7\%) was observed in the disturbed Sal forest while the
   lowest runoff (8.5 +/- 1.8\%) was observed in the undisturbed Sal forest
   type. It was also observed that nutrient enrichment i.e. N, P, and K to
   the soil through stemflow and throughfall was 18.6 times, 23.1 times,
   and 10.8 times more as compared to incident rainfall. From the
   statistical analysis, it was observed that average canopy spread, ground
   biomass, and average crown projection area were the most important
   parameters of the Sal forests which affected the proportion of rainfall
   partitioned components and runoff. (c) 2021 European Regional Centre for

Abstract = {As the inlet river of Poyang Lake, it is important to master the source
   of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in water body of Le `an River
   for the water environment safety management in Poyang Lake. Therefore,
   this study aimed to quantify the weight of nutri-ent loss contribution
   from each sub-catchment to the inlet estuary cross-section. A SWAT model
   was constructed to simulate total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus
   (TP) loss of Le `an River Watershed in 1995-2020. A key parameter Ci was
   proposed to quantify the contribution values and weights of the nutrient
   load from the sub-catchment to the inlet estuary cross-section and
   identify the crucial contribution areas. The results showed that: (1)
   The emission intensity of the TN and TP at the confluence section the Le
   `an River Watershed in the past 30 years is 16.54 Gg/yr and 3.69 Gg/yr.
   (2) Nutrient losses in the watershed exhibited clear spatial
   variability. The average intensity of TN and TP loss in the middle and
   downstream plains was 1.38 and 1.12 times higher than in the upstream
   hilly areas. (3) The weight of nutrient contribution in sub-catchments
   varied significantly in space, and the TN and TP from the highest
   contributive sub-catchment was 11.52 and 25.91 times of the lowest,
   respectively. Through the analysis of contribution values, sub
   -catchments of No. 15, 20, and 22 were identified as the nutrient
   crucial areas. (c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Abstract = {The Ilha River is one of the main tributaries of the Sinos River,
   consequently contributing to its ecological impact. The present study
   aimed to associate the use of different biomark-ers in vitro and in vivo
   to assess the water quality of three points along the Ilha River during
   2019. For this purpose, water samples were collected at the source and
   mouth of the river, and in an intermediate section. In the laboratory,
   samples were used for in vitro toxicity tests with the V79 cell line, in
   which we evaluated the protein content and mi-tochondrial activity
   through the MTT assay. The results indicated a possible disruption in
   cellular mitochondrial activity. Acute toxicity tests were also carried
   out in Danio rerio and Daphnia magna , and a chronic toxicity test was
   performed in C. elegans. No significant dif-ferences were observed in
   the antioxidant defense enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx); however, the point
   of greatest agricultural impact inhibited the activity of muscle AChE in
   zebrafish. All samples delayed the development of C. elegans,
   characterizing toxicity. Phosphorus was above the limit established by
   Brazilian legislation at the three sampling points in two of the three
   collections, indicating the probable presence of agricultural components
   in the water. The results alert to the need for the association of
   different bioindicators and, whenever possible, the use of chronic
   toxicity tests for the best environmental diagnosis.(c) 2022 European

Abstract = {While numerous studies demonstrated the reduction effect of infiltration
   changes with natural vegetation conversion to croplands, few information
   is available examining inher-ent differences between natural ecosystems.
   We examined the steady state infiltration rate and other topsoil
   properties in two adjacent native ecosystem types (of the Brazilian
   trop-ical savanna) occurring under a similar soil type (oxisol), a
   native grassland and a savanna. We found a significantly higher steady
   state infiltration rate in the savanna (698 +/- 521 mm h -1) compared to
   native grassland (413 +/- 181 mm h -1). All soil properties were
   sig-nificantly different when comparing both ecosystem types indicating
   that higher topsoil permeability in the savanna is potentially related
   to higher organic matter content, lower bulk density, and lower
   penetration resistance. Previous studies have documented differ-ences in
   soil hydraulic properties between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems
   under a similar soil type. Here we showed that such differences can also
   occur among natural ecosystems.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for

Abstract = {Vegetation water content is a critical aspect of ecosystem water balance
   and plant phys-iology, including how plants cope with drought. Deciduous
   trees store significant water for use in transpiration throughout the
   growing season in the boreal forest of Alaska. Wa-ter content of shrub
   stems, and their role in the water balance, remains unquantified for
   many woody species in boreal and arctic tundra ecosystems. We adapted
   time-domain re-flectometry (TDR) to continuously measure shrub water
   content. We created calibration equations relating apparent dielectric
   constant to volumetric water content of shrub stems of felt-leaf willow
   (Salix alaxensis), diamond-leaf willow ( S. pulchra) and dwarf birch
   (Be-tula nana). Our results show seasonal patterns of volumetric stem
   water content ranging from 40 to 70\%. Stem water content prior to
   leaf-out was minimal (scaled by biomass, < 2mm) compared to total
   snowmelt water, implying little water uptake of snowmelt wa-ter. Stem
   water content was small compared to other components of the hydrologic
   water budget (precipitation, runoff, evaporation, evapotranspiration,
   infiltration), indicating the importance of shrub transpiration and
   dependence of shrubs on available soil moisture for uptake. The
   technique and findings here are needed to quantify the role of deciduous
   shrub vegetation in the hydrologic cycle of ecosystems, particularly
   those where shrubs predominate.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Pages = {149-156},
Abstract = {We studied the species diversity of algae and cyanobacteria on the
   colored snow surface (red, brown and black) of mountain slopes in the
   northern regions of the Urals (Polar, Subpolar and Northern Urals) and
   Western Sayan (the eastern part of the State Nature Reserve ``Pozarym
   named after V.M. Zimin{''}). The area of the snow patches was 50-45,000
   m(2). In average, 17.6-142.4 thousand algal and cyanobacteria cells were
   found on the 1 cm(2) of the snow surface. We identified 29 algal and
   cyanobacteria species from five divisions (Cyanobacteria - 1,
   Bacillariophyta - 1, Ochrophyta - 3, Chlorophyta - 21, Charophyta - 3).
   Unicellular coccoid green algae predominate. Most of the identified
   species are widespread in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They are
   able to vegetate under conditions of low temperatures and high solar
   radiation. Chloromonas reticulata (Gorozh.) Gobi and Chlamydomonas
   proteus E.G. Pringsh. are main sources of the red bloom of the snow
   patches. These species were found during direct visual inspection of
   snow samples in the field. Species cf. Xerochlorella minuta (J.B.
   Petersen) Mikhailyuk \& P.M. Tsarenko and Stichococcus cf. bacillaris
   Nageli also had a high frequency of occurrence in the snow samples, but
   these species were found in laboratory conditions when cultivating on
   nutrient media. We also studied chemical indicators in places of mass
   development of algae and cyanobacteria, including: pH, conductivity,
   color, chemical oxygen demand (COD), permanganate value (PV), N-total,
   P-total, C-total, C-inorg., C-org., a number of macro and micro
   elements. The molted snow is characterized by a slightly acidic pH, low
   electrical conductivity and low content of the main biogenic elements.},

Title = {Monitoring of parks in the coastal zone of the Neva bay with the snail
   Arianta arbustorum},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {75-81},
Abstract = {Analysis of environmental problems, assessment and prediction are
   closely related to the study of populations of widespread animal
   species, in our case, of mollusk Arianta arbustorum (Linnicus, 1758),
   mass invasion of which is known for the Leningrad region and in St.
   Petersburg since the second half of the 2000 years. The concentration of
   heavy metals (HM) in snail's hepatopancreas was measured on an atomic
   absorption spectrophotometer and an atomic emission spectrometer using
   inductively coupled plasma emission. In order to monitor accumulated
   anthropogenic pollution in the parks on the coast of the Neva bay the
   thermoresistance of snails from various coastal biotopes was studied.
   The rate of decrease in heart rate (HR) after switching off the heat
   exposure (lasting for 20 minutes) was compared in snails from the
   village of New Ropsha (reference location) and other locations:
   Alexandria Park, Oranienbaum Park, Dubki Park. According to the
   accumulation of HM in the snail's hepatopancreas, in Oranienhaum Park
   significant (p <= 0.05) excess for all studied HM (Cu, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cd,
   Pb) was found in comparison with the reference location in the village
   of New Ropsha and with other locations. The potential environmental risk
   determined according to Hakanson in Oranienbaum Park was rated as high.
   The thermoresistance of snails from this location contaminated with HM
   is characterized as low, which suggests a possible violation of the
   protective system of heat shock proteins. This may reduce their ability
   to restore heat: denatured proteins, including contractile proteins of
   the heart, which usually leads to a rapid drop in HR in mollusks from
   polluted sites.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the primary producer diversity is crucial in understanding
   ecosystems balance, as imbalanced nutrients richness and diversity may
   induce red tide situations. The present study deals with evaluating the
   impact of hydrological factors regulating the dynamics of phytoplankton
   communities and the influence of chemical parameters on phytoplankton
   growth in Pearl River Estuary (PRE). During wet season (April), around
   50 different species of phytoplankton were identified at 14 different
   sampling sites including 24 diatoms, 9 di-noflagellates, 10 green algae
   and 6 cyanobacterial species respectively. The diatom Melosira granulate
   was the dominant species at most of the sampling sites. Phytoplankton
   surveys during the dry season (November) showed Bellerochea malleus and
   Skeletonema costatum species as dominant at most of the sampling
   locations. Silicate (SiO3) distribution was one of the reason for the
   abundance of diatoms in west shoal sites. The concentration of
   nu-trients and hydrological factors like water depth and salinity
   strongly supported phyto-plankton growth. In addition, PRE west and
   middle shoal sites showed evidence of rich phytoplankton diversity when
   compared to east shoal and channel sites. The Non-metric
   Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis and cluster grouping analysis
   demonstrated the uniqueness of plankton species diversity at PRE west
   and east shoal sites. The results of Canonical Correspondence Analysis
   (CCA) suggested that diversity of phytoplankton com-munities was

Abstract = {While de-icing salts improve safety on roads and sidewalks during
   winter, they have a neg-ative impact on the environment. This has
   spurred the search for more environmentally -friendly alternatives. The
   present study tests the impact of NaCl and six other de-icing salts
   (pure CaCl2, CaCl2 + NaCl, ``eco-label{''} CaCl2, MgCl2, solid and
   liquid CH3COOK), promoted as more eco-friendly alternatives to NaCl, on
   four zooplankton species from biotests: Ceri-odaphnia dubia
   (Ceriodaphtokit), Daphnia magna (Daphtoxkit), Brachionus calyciflorus
   (Ro-toxkit) and Thamnocephalus platyurus (Thamnotoxkit). 24-h EC50
   evaluation showed that only solid CH3COOK was less toxic for all tested
   species than NaCl. The other tested de-icing salts had similar or even
   higher toxicity, with CaCl2, MgCl2 and liquid CH3COOK being
   significantly more toxic for all species than NaCl. Of the tested
   species, Thamnocephalus platyurus demonstrated toxicity response at
   significantly lower concentration of all used de-icing salts, while
   Daphnia magna had significantly the highest concentrations of toxicity
   response. Our findings demonstrate that these alternatives are not less
   toxic in this regard than the commonly-used NaCl and underline the need
   to verify the accuracy of the term ``eco-friendly{''} on the labels of
   these products.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Abstract = {The campus is facing the problems of waterlogging and runoff pollution.
   To mitigate these phenomena, this study constructs a SWMM model using a
   campus as the study area. The reduction effects of runoff volume and
   pollutant load under four LID facility combination scenarios were
   simulated. Eleven evaluation indicators were selected from
   environmental, economic and social aspects, and the weights of each
   indicator were calculated by ap-plying the CRITIC method. The relative
   percentage of different rainfall recurrence periods under the same
   evaluation indicator was obtained. The composite index method is used to
   calculate the composite index for each scenario. The combination of rain
   garden, per-meable pavement, bioretention and green roof is determined
   as the optimal scenario. The Fuzzy pattern recognition method is used to
   select three representative rainfall events and simulate the reduction
   effect of runoff volume and pollutant load under four scenarios to
   further verify the optimal scenario. The results show that the reduction
   rates of runoff volume and pollutant load under scenario 4 are 2.7\%,
   4.2\% and 4.7\% higher than those under scenarios 1, 2 and 3. Based on
   the above study, the optimal LID facility combina-tion selected in this
   paper will provide a reference for the construction of sponge facilities

Abstract = {In the present study, it was analyzed the structure of mesozooplankton
   community, and their spatio-temporal variations along the Caete River
   estuary (northeast of Para, Brazil). Samples were collected during
   spring tides conducted in nychthemeral cycles, in three fixed sectors
   located along the studied estuary (inner-S1, middle-S2 and outer-S3),
   us-ing conical plankton nets of 200 mu m mesh size. Samplings were
   performed in Septem-ber 2014 (dry season) and March 2015 (rainy season),
   totaling 54 samples. A total of 25 mesozooplankton species were
   recorded, being the copepods the most diversified group (21 species),
   mostly dominated by estuarine and coastal species. The most abun-dant
   mesozooplankton species presented significantly higher densities ( p <
   0.0 0 01) be-tween the middle (Pseudodiaptomus richardi, 583.8 +/- 956.5
   ind m -3, Paracalanus quasimodo, 108.9 +/- 181.4 ind m -3 and
   Pseudodiaptomus acutus, 23.4 +/- 66.6 ind m -3) and outer (Acartia
   tonsa, 476.9 +/- 1,298.8 ind m -3 and Acartia lilljeborgii (407.9 +/-
   1,038.1 ind m -3 and Parasagitta tenuis, 59.9 +/- 117.1 ind m -3)
   sectors. The non-metric multidimensional ordination analysis highlighted
   that the average density of the main species varied mainly at a spatial
   scale, with density increasing toward the mouth of the estuary (except
   for P. richardi). Spear-man's correlation (rs) demonstrated that the
   salinity, turbidity, dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a
   concentrations were the prevailing environmental variables associated
   with significant spatial changes of mesozooplankton distribution in this
   area. Overall, the results showed that spatial variation in the water
   physicochemical characteristics of the Caete Estuary have significant
   effects on the structure and succession of the mesozooplankton, which
   may potentially affect the functioning and biodiversity of this coastal
   ecosystem.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Abstract = {Coevolution of living things and their surroundings contributes to the

   concept, the Gaia theory, and the philo-sophical view in ancient China,
   we believe the physical river evolution must somehow takes on biological
   evolution characteristics, and the river biosphere could be an
   anti-entropic system and develop towards the higher beings. Here, beyond
   the traditional un-derstanding of river, we redefine a kind of
   systematic out-branching (Dragon style) river which is characterized by
   a systematic connection between the stable, unobstructed main -channel
   and the active, open, abducent out-branches under some high-resistant
   environ-mental conditions (especially in tropical and polar zones). It
   has the potential to help de-tect the signatures of life on other
   planets which are similar in river landscape to Earth.(c) 2022 European

Abstract = {Understanding how changes in land use and land cover classes influence
   the portioning of rainfall into blue and green water resources as well
   as land use dynamics on ecolog-ically pertinent flows are vital for
   sustainable water resource management and ecology. Guder catchment, one
   of the tributaries of the Upper Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia, was
   con-sidered for the conduction of ecohydrological modeling using land
   use land cover maps and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).
   Cultivation land is expanded while for-est and plantation are declined,
   consequently blue water component increased while the green water
   component declined in the study catchment. Besides, the decline in low
   flow specially during months of dry period and increase in high flow
   during rainy season could have negative consequences for ecology.
   Therefore, sustainable land and water manage-ment at catchment level is
   essential to protect an ecosystem and for sustainable water resources
   management. The vital resilience capacity of the ecosystem to
   accommodate al-teration without loss of consistency should be
   maintained. Change in green water due to land use land cover affects
   biological functions in terrestrial ecosystem as green water is closely
   linked with biological functions and rainfed agriculture. The approach
   applied in the present study to investigate the land use and land cover
   change impact on blue and green water flows as well as on ecological
   pertinent streamflows can be simply imple-mented in other river basin
   systems.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish

Abstract = {Land use and cover change are closely linked to catchment hydrology
   characteristics. Land uses and cover determine the ability of the
   catchment to collect, store, and release water. The catchment water
   storage and flow ability affect the quantity and timing of runoff, soil
   erosion, and sediment transport downstream. Agriculture on of the major
   drivers for the changes in water flow pathways, which also causes a
   catastrophic shift of aquatic ecosys-tems. We assessed the impact of
   land-use changes on the water flow characteristics in the Upper Pangani
   Sub catchment using the hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT). Land use and cover changes within the Upper Pangani Sub
   catchment were ana-lyzed between 1987 and 2017 using QGIS. The result
   shows that agriculture has expanded from 96,737 ha to 314,871 ha between
   1987 and 2017. Bare land and built-up land have gained 14690 ha and 7083
   ha respectively during this period. Land-use changes have af-fected the
   basin's land cover. Forest has decreased from 196558 ha to 106839 ha
   between 1987 and 2017. Bush land cover has lost 83445 ha during this
   period. Bushland cover fall victim to agricultural activities, whereas
   forest is cleared for logging and fire incidences. Consequently, surface
   runoff has increased from 60.84 to 73.02 (20.6\% increase) between 1987
   and 2017. Sediment yield has increase from 6.9 to 12.74 ton/ha (46\%
   increase), and groundwater recharge has decreased from 106.53 to 99.56
   (6.5\% decrease). It concluded that land cover transformation alters
   hydrology characteristics of the catchment, resulting to fast surface
   flow, high rate of soil erosion and low infiltration rate. It is
   recommended that agro-forestry should be emphasized in the catchment.(c)

Title = {NDVI - alpha diversity relationship in tropical montane cloud forest of
   Ecuador},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {58-67},
Abstract = {In tropical forest the biodiversity is in a constant threat, some
   species are listed in the IUCN as vulnerable, endangered or threatened
   with extinction. Thus, a fast method for biodiversity determination or
   monitoring can contribute to its conservation. Remote sensing has
   demonstrated to be a powerful tool, and together with the vegetation
   indexes, can determine the vegetation state of forest. Recently
   researches have correlated the normalized differentiated vegetation
   index (NDVI) with species richness, structure and biodiversity of
   forests obtaining successful results.
   This study, conducted in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) of
   Ecuador, aims to correlate NDVI with alpha diversity estimators to
   understand its relationships. NDVI of Landsat OLI 8 Level 1 images in
   five months was determined. We considered a scene as valid in case of
   cloud coverage in the areas of interest below 25\%. Radiometric and
   atmospheric corrections, with flaash tool, and the delimitation of the
   study site (ROI) were developed in ENVI 5.3 program. NDVI was calculated
   with ENVI 5.3 program (histograms allowed the determination of mean,
   maximum and minimum NDVI), and with ArcGIS 10.3 (for classification
   index). In field, species richness, Chao1, Shannon index, Simpson index,
   and biomass of three plots were quantified for trees with D13H >= 10 cm.
   Then, we calculate Pearson coefficient to correlate and disentangle the
   effects of altitude, diversity, richness, biomass and N DV I. A positive
   relationship was observed between Mean NDVI and Chao1 (p < 0.10) and
   Mean NDVI - richness (p < 0.05). In conclusion, NDVI can be considered
   useful to estimate richness and biodiversity and even to detect ecotone
   as was the case in this research. The application of this methodology
   could allow biodiversity assessment and monitoring in real time and low
   cost, which contributes in forest conservation programs.},

Title = {Seasonal variation of concentration and net CO2 exchange in the spruce
   forest ecosystem of the middle taiga},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {226-234},
Abstract = {Measurements of CO2 concentration in atmospheric air and CO2 fluxes over
   the forest canopy were carried out to quantify ecosystem net exchange
   (NEE) in spruce stands during the growing season of 2017. In the
   conditions of cool and rainy summer, the rate of net CO2 exchange
   between the spruce forest and the surface atmosphere varied from -15.0
   to 15.0 gCO(2)/(m(2).day), the cumulative NEE from May to August was
   -780 gCO(2)/m(2). In the second half of August the spruce forest became
   a source of CO2 release into the atmosphere. The change in the CO2
   concentration in the air column was approaching zero and did not affect
   the accumulation of ecosystem exchange. Measurements at eight heights of
   spruce stands showed a gradual decrease in CO2 concentration in the
   first half of the growing season, the minimum values were noted in July
   and August, during the period of maximum photosynthesis of forest trees.
   The main source of CO2 is soil, respectively, the maximum concentrations
   are noted in the ground layer of air. The amplitude of seasonal
   fluctuations in the CO2 content in the air at a height of 0.5 rn was 92
   ppm, at 2.5 m - 67 ppm, and in the crown space did not exceed 47 ppm.
   The rate of turbulent air mixing and photosynthetic activity of the
   canopy of the stand determined the daily changes in the concentration
   gradient according to the altitude profile of the phytocenosis. Decrease
   of CO2 in the air column 0-30 m after sunrise and before noon
   corresponded to an increase in net exchange in the ecosystem of forest.
   The results of one year of observations indicate that the spruce forest
   ecosystem performs the function of a sink of carbon dioxide, however, to
   assess the interannual variability of net exchange, continuous long-term
   measurements are required.},

Title = {Influence of various methods of forest reclamation on the restoration of
   the community of mammals in the dark coniferous taiga forests},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {183-191},
Abstract = {The restoration of natural communities on anthropogenically disturbed
   lands is one of the world's problems. Our studies in Kuzbass show that
   even after 35-40 years, areas reclaimed in different ways do not create
   full-fledged conditions for mammals, inhabitants of the dark coniferous
   taiga forests. In all studied areas, the indices of the abundance and
   species richness in mammalian communities are significantly inferior to
   the original taiga communities. The similarity with indigenous
   communities of mammals was found in pine plantations adjacent to
   self-growing deforested areas of the dark coniferous taiga. These
   habitats are characterized by the highest indices of abundance and
   species richness among the studied sites. The most impoverished in terms
   of the species richness of small mammals and their number were terraced
   areas with a very insignificant soil layer, reclaimed by the European
   white birch Betula pendula Roth. and sea-buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides
   L. The communities of small mammals that have formed here show a
   faunistic similarity with the population of dry meadows on the place of
   the felled dark coniferous taiga, but not with the indigenous taiga
   population. Large and medium-sized mammals in reclaimed areas are few or
   absent altogether. The reclamation methods should involve the formation
   of forage and protective functions for forest dwellers. During
   reclamation, it is necessary to abandon mono-plantings. To create vital
   conditions, it is necessary to mosaic planting of various groups of
   plants with the obligatory alternation of coniferous, mixed, and
   deciduous forest areas. The share of various shrubs is about 50\%. Since
   animals are concentrated in ecotone areas, when carrying out forest
   reclamation, it is necessary to provide for the formation of an extended
   forest edge line, that is, to lay ``forest glades{''} surrounded on all
   sides by woody plants and shrubs.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {6-13},
Abstract = {The article provides information on the state of climatic factors in the
   Russian Federation over the past 100 years and notes the overall warming
   of the climate by 1 degrees C, while for the cold period of the year -
   by 1.4 degrees C, warm - by 0.4 degrees C. Further, the features of
   changes in the species and intraspecific structure of phytopathogenic
   microorganisms, insect pests and plant communities are considered in
   connection with the unfavorable dynamics of climatic factors in the
   EuroNorth- East of the Russian Federation, including the Kirov region.
   The positive and negative consequences of climate warming on
   plant-microbial interactions are shown. The possibility of the emergence
   of new phytopathogens and insect pests and the elimination of the
   existing harmful biota under conditions of changing ecology and climate
   is substantiated. In the Kirov region, due to warming, the harmfulness
   of snow moll may decrease and it will be possible to fully cultivate
   such crops as winter triticale, winter barley, wintering oats, but the
   damage to grain crops by ergot, porno and stone fruits - by moniliosis,
   field and horticultural crops by viral diseases will increase. New
   diseases and pests are likely to appear, such as yellow rust and yellow
   spot, ramularia and harmful hug on crops. There will be a need to adjust
   cultivated crops and introduce more heat-loving and non-traditional
   ones, for example, corn, soybeans, millet, sorghum, spring triticale,
   etc. Therefore, agricultural production and biological science must be
   prepared for regional environmental and climate changes.},

Title = {Diversity of Siphonaria Sowerby I, 1823 (Gastropoda, Siphonariidae) in

Journal = {ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the characters of the
   reduced shell of the false limpets of the genus Siphonaria Sowerby I,
   1823 are highly variable and often insufficient for species
   delimitation. The taxonomy and distribution of Siphonaria in the Indian
   Ocean are poorly known. We sampled Siphonaria in the Seychelles Bank to
   check the occurrence of recorded species using DNA sequences and to
   study the paths through which Siphonaria species have colonised the
   Seychelles Bank by reconstructing their phylogenetic relationships.
   Analyses of a dataset comprising 16 S rRNA gene sequences of 33
   specimens from the Seychelles Bank and 300 additional Siphonaria
   sequences from other regions from GenBank with various methods for
   species delimitation resulted in 19-102 primary species hypotheses.
   Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning provided a conservative
   estimate of the species number (42) in which several indisputable
   species were lumped. The results of Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery
   depended strongly on the assumed prior maximum intraspecific divergence,
   whereas the tree-based methods Generalised Mixed Yule Coalescent and
   Poisson Tree Processes resulted in high overestimates. The specimens
   from the Seychelles Bank represent three clades, belonging to the
   Siphonaria `atra' group, the Siphonaria `normalis' group and a possibly
   undescribed species recorded previously only from Hainan. At least two
   of the three species recorded from the Seychelles Bank came from the
   east, i.e., from the Coral Triangle in the Indo-Australian Archipelago,
   the region with the highest marine biodiversity worldwide. A major
   transport mechanism across the Indian Ocean was probably the South
   Equatorial Current.},

Abstract = {Global warming may alter microbial ecosystem functions through reshaping
   of microbial diversities, compositions and interactions. Here, the
   community compositions, assembly processes and microbial interactions of
   prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) were compared between the warming
   year of 2014 and 2016 in the Chukchi Sea. Our results indicated that
   prokaryotic diversity was significant higher in the warmer year of 2016.
   Furthermore, stochastic processes always dominated archaeal assembly
   processes, but bacterial assem-bly processes were mainly shaped by
   deterministic processes in 2016. And more keystones were detected in
   bacteria than that in archaea to maintain prokaryotic community
   stabil-ity. Both bacterial and archaeal community variations had
   significant correlations with en-vironmental factors, although many of
   these factors (such as TN, TP, TOC and heavy metals) had not changed
   significantly from 2014 to 2016. Our study provides some new insights
   into microbial responses to climate warming in marine sediments.(c) 2022

Abstract = {To determine the sensitivity of trophic-functional diversity of
   periphytic protozoa to envi-ronmental change, a 1-year baseline survey
   was carried out using glass microscope slides as artificial substrates
   at four sampling sites along a pollution gradient in coastal waters of
   the Yellow Sea, northern China. Eight trophic-functional groups were
   identified from 144 observed species based on feeding type and food
   resource. Results showed that: (1) bacterivores increased, while
   algivores and non-selectives decreased in abundance with increasing
   levels of pollution; (2) the trophic-functional pattern of the
   biofilm-dwelling protozoan communities showed a significant variation
   among the four sites; and (3) the ellipse test based on paired
   trophic-functional distinctness indices ( A 9,+ and A,y+) indi-cated a
   significant departure from an expected trophic-functional pattern in
   polluted areas. Based on these findings, it is suggested that
   trophic-functional distinctness of periphytic protozoa may be a feasible
   bioindicator of marine water quality.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The four typical wetlands of Phragmites australis wetland (TPa), Tamarix
   chinensis wetland (Tc), Suaeda salsa wetland (Ss) and Spartina
   alterniflora wetland (Sa) in the Yellow River Delta were selected to
   clarify the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients and their
   ecologi-cal stoichiometric characteristics under fiddler crab
   activities. The results showed that soil particle size, soil salinity
   and pH in Tc, TPa and Ss were greatly changed by fiddler crab
   activities. The averaged contents of TOC and TN in wetlands with fiddler
   crab activities (FC) were higher than those in wetlands without fiddler
   crab activities (CK). The averaged NH4 +-N contents of FC group in Tc,
   Ss and Sa were 93.42\%, 52.14\% and 20.05\% higher than those of CK
   group ( p < 0.05), respectively. The averaged NO3 --N contents of Tc and
   Sa in FC group were 89.79\% and 167.70\% higher than those of CK group (
   p < 0.01), respectively. The variation tendency of C/N and C/P in four
   wetland types were greatly similar with the TOC, and N/P was similar
   with TN. Multi-ANOVA results showed that soil carbon and nitro-gen were
   significantly influenced by fiddler crab activities and wetland types (
   p < 0.05). The PCA and RDA analysis results indicated that the
   bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient
   elements diversified. The fiddler crab activities were favor-able to the
   soil nutrients accumulation and could reduce the nitrogen limitation of
   coastal ecosystem. Our results should be of importance to insight the
   biogeochemical process of soil nutrient elements differentiation by

Abstract = {The results of monitoring the overgrowth of abandoned agricultural lands
   (deposits) with trees and shrubs on the basis of multi-temporal
   ultra-high resolution satellite images taken in different phenophases
   are presented. The dynamics of overgrowing for more than 12 years is
   shown on the example of three different sites located in the subzone of
   the southern taiga. An analysis of the images made it possible to assess
   the structural parameters of the tree and shrub vegetation forming on
   the fallows. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of post-agrogenic natural
   regeneration of woody vegetation at the local level was revealed. The
   overgrowing of small areas, mostly surrounded by a forest wall, occurs
   almost simultaneously over the entire area. On a fallow with a large
   area and an insignificant forest wall, overgrowing occurs from the
   forest wall, gradually moving away from it over time. At the same time,
   the predominance of deciduous trees near the forest wall is replaced by
   the predominance of conifers as they move away from it. The results
   obtained make it possible to trace the dynamics of the development of
   natural tree and shrub cover on abandoned agricultural lands, to assess
   the state and importance of forest plantations growing on the fallow.},

Title = {Specificity of plant-microbial complexes under anthropogenic soil
   pollution (review)},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {14-25},
Abstract = {The review presents the results of studies on the characteristics of the
   plant microbiome under anthropogenic soil pollution and the
   possibilities of its regulation for bioremediation measures. Any type of
   soil pollution, including the appearance of invasive plants, leads to
   the rearrangement of native microbial complexes, which manifests itself
   in a decrease in the species composition, a decrease in the abundance of
   certain groups of microorganisms (MO), outbreaks in the abundance of
   phytopathogens and antagonist microbes, toxin formers, and melanizati on
   of micromycete complexes. Such negative changes in microbial complexes
   become the cause of inhibition of plank and a decrease in their
   productivity.
   It, is known that in the soil of any type, in the process of
   cohabitation of plants and rhizospheric microbiota, a holobiont is
   formed, which is the unity of the host and all its symbiotic microbes.
   At the same time, the number of the microbial component of the holobiont
   can reach up to 10 thousand species, and the number of microbial cells
   in the rhizosphere can reach 10(11) CFU/g. In many ways, the chemical
   nature and volume of root secretions are regulators of the abundance,
   species and group com position of MO. Plant resistance to stressful
   abiotic and biotic factors is determined by the presence and functioning
   of the rhizosphere microbiome; therefore, not only natural and
   artificially constructed plant-microbial complexes are promising agents
   in the remediation of soils contaminated with various pollutants. Among
   the most promising groups of MO-introducers, representatives of
   cyanobacteria, pseudomonas, bacilli, actinomycetes, micromycetes of
   genus Trichoderma. Plant-microbial complexes enriched with these MO
   groups were successfully used for bioremediation of soils contaminated
   with oil, oil products, heavy metals, benzo{[}a]pyrene, and
   phytopathogens. Therefore, one of the urgent tasks of modern
   agrobiotechnology is the isolation of useful representatives of the
   rhizosphere microbiota into pure cultures and the creation of artificial
   plant-microbial complexes enriched with MO antagonists, growth
   stimulators, and pollutant decomposers for these purposes.},

Abstract = {The results of studying the ecological and demographic parameters of 10
   cenopopulations (CP) of Cypripedium calceolus L. in the subzone of the
   southern taiga in the Kirov region (Slobodskoy, Afanasievsky, Lebyazhsky
   districts) are presented. In habitats with C. calceolus, the main
   background of plant groupings is formed by representatives of boreal and
   non-morale ecological-cenotic groups. The limiting factors affecting the
   spread of the species are the illumination and acidity of the soil. The
   generative-oriented type of the ontogenetic spectrum is predominant.
   According to the ``deltaomega{''} classification, the studied CPs are
   represented by aging and transitional types. According to the vital
   state, most CPs are thriving, with the exception of CP 5, 7. A
   comprehensive assessment of the state of C. calceolus showed that the
   populations are in a state ``close to threatened{''} or ``dependent on
   conservation{''}.},

Abstract = {The research was carried out at the Federal Agricultural Research Center
   of the North-East ( FA RC) in 2018-2020. Taxonomic structure of seed's
   microflora and resistance of plants to the most common fungi diseases
   were analyzed in 18 new spring barley varieties bred in of FARC and
   Vyatka State Agrotechnological University (VSAU). With a high total seed
   infestation (average 83.3\%), the trait state in the FARC's varieties
   was an average 4.2\% less than in the VSAU's mutant lines. In the seed
   contaminant, representatives of 8 fungal taxa are identified: Alternaria
   spp., Bipolaris spp., Torula spp., Cladosporium spp., Stemphylium spp.,
   Curvularia spp., Penicillium spp., and Fusarium spp. In the studied
   accessions, they ranged from three (cv. Ecolog, M 4-10) to six (cv.
   Novichok, Dobryak, Tandem, Pamiaty Rodinoy, Belgorodsky 100, and M
   10-12). Species Alternaria spp., Bipolaris sorokiniana and
   representatives of saprotrophes were found in all varieties with a
   frequency of 13.0-48.0\%, 3.0-32.0\% and 2.0-52.0\%, respectively;
   Fusarium species - in 16 accessions with a frequency of 2 21\%. Among
   fungi taxa, only Alternaria spp. species are statistically significantly
   (at P >= 0.95) associated with seed infestation (r = 0.45). A reliable
   (P >= 0.99) relation was found between the combined proportion of
   saprotrophes and species of Fusariuni spp., Alternaria spp. and
   Bipolaris sorokiniana (r = -0.72), which indicates the possibility of
   the inhibitory effect of alternaria infection on phytopathogens.
   Assessing the studied gene pool of barley by the nature and level of
   infection of seeds and plants, one can select accessions with the best
   bioecological and immunological assessment: cv. Dobryak, Ecolog,
   Novichok and 94-13; mutants: M 11-13 Xa and M 2-37-6. Cv. Dobryak
   successfully passes the State Test.},

Abstract = {Coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and large instream wood (LW)
   belong to ele-ments transported by stream flows, but their pattern of
   storage in nonperennial streams remains unclear, especially in the
   relationship with living trees and shrubs living in the ac-tive
   channels. This study evaluates the role of woody plants that occupy
   relatively wide ac-tive channels of nonperennial streams on the storage
   of CPOM and LW. All CPOM, LW and woody plants were inventoried along 18
   transects in three mutually distinct reaches of in-termittent streams in
   Peloponnese, Greece. We observed high variations of the CPOM (4.85 m3/ha
   -15.65 m3/ha) and LW volumes (1.95 m3/ha -13.35 m3/ha) deposited in the
   studied reaches with their highest abundance in the confined reach
   upstream of a landslide-related knickpoint. Woody plants were recognised
   as an important trapping element for CPOM in the case of a sufficient
   frequency of shrubs and trees in the active channel, which was not the
   case for the lowland reach with the far lowest measured basal area of
   the stems (1.84 m2/ha) in contrast to the other reaches (9.80 m2/ha and
   6.32 m2/ha). A positive association was found between the basal area of
   the stems and the volume of CPOM deposits. How-ever, the importance of
   woody plants in LW storage was confirmed only for the transects with
   abundant large trees with diameters greater than 0.1 m occupying the
   channel. The function of trees and shrubs not only as sources, but also
   as retention elements, should be carefully considered in the
   establishment of CPOM and LW budgets in nonperennial fluvial systems.(c)

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {192-198},
Abstract = {The analysis of the dynamics of phyto-diversity over 10 years of the
   Pinus sylvestris L. formation in the Usman forest of the Voronezh region
   on the territory of Russia is carried out. We used formalized methods
   for processing the data array when describing 140 accounting sites of 1
   m(2) on two test sites in the background and pyrogenic formations of P.
   sylvestris. Accounting for abundance was conducted according to O.
   Drude. The pyrogenic factor, along with temperature, light,
   humidification, and edaphic conditions, has a strong effect on the
   phyto-diversity of forest ecosystems. Four phases of succession of
   pyrogenic phytocenoses with determination of time intervals between them
   have been established. The first phase of 2010 is a pioneer group,
   random plant species are noted, separated among themselves; second phase
   2011 2014 the pioneer group is being transformed, plants are being
   introduced, they are breeding, consort relations between organisms are
   appearing, a weed-ruderal erigeron-pine community (Pinus sylvestris -
   Erigeron canadensis) has been recorded; third 2015-2018 - the initial
   phase is herb-shrub, there is a restructuring of the structure of the
   plant community, which is expressed in the replacement of the dominants
   of the phytocenosis tiers; the fourth phase begins in 2019 - the
   formation of the forest phytocenotic group is associated with dimming
   and, as a result, a change in temperature. The characteristic of
   anthropotolerant groups is given. In the ratio of species in the
   background and pyrogenic areas to the total number, the replenishment of
   species diversity in pyrogenic areas is observed. The obtained values of
   the regression coefficient for anthropotolerant groups emphasize the
   sensitivity of the flora to the pyrogenic effects of especially
   synanthropophytes and hemiapophytes.},

Pages = {212-218},
Abstract = {To study the cultural, morphological and pathogenic properties of fungi
   that cause Septoria blotch of wheat in the conditions of the Kirov
   region, phytopathogenic fungi were isolated from the affected plants. Of
   the 38 fungal isolates selected in pure culture, eight were identified
   by cultural and morphological features as Parastagonospora nodorum which
   causes Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB). To confirm the species identity,
   the DNA of fungi was used for real-time PCR using the commercial test
   system ``Septorioz zlakov (Stagonospora nodorum){''}
   ({''}AgroDiagnostika{''}, Russia). Based on experimental data, a
   modification of the method for isolating fungi that cause Septoria
   blotch of wheat is proposed. Cultural and morphological properties of
   local P. nodorum isolates (TR1, TR2, P12, H7, H9, KR, SR, TC) were
   characterized on potato-glucose agar ( PGA). The use of malt-yeast agar
   as a medium in comparison with PGA stimulated the growth rate of the P.
   nodorum KR isolate and did not affect the growth rate of other fungal
   isolates. Evaluation of the pathogenic properties of local P. nodorum
   isolates on wheat plants showed that TC and H9 isolates are highly
   pathogenic. These isolates can be used to screen the resistance to SN B
   of a wide range of wheat genotypes grown in the Kirov region.},

Title = {Heavy metals in snow cover and urban soils},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {110-117},
Abstract = {The pollution of snow cover and soils of different functional zones of
   the city of Kirov with heavy metals (HM) has been assessed. Judging by
   the state of the snow cover, the level of air pollution with Zn, Cu, Pb,
   Ni, Cd in winter in different functional zones of the northern part of
   the city and in the background territory differs slightly, but varies
   significantly over the years of observation. A correlation was found (r
   = 0.98-0.99) between the content of HMs in the snow cover and their
   total content in the soil.
   It is shown that the level of soil pollution depends on the selected
   background indicators. In the absence of excess of gross forms of HM
   over approximate permissible concentrations, the indicator of total
   pollution (Z(c)) corresponds to the average level of soil pollution in
   the industrial zone. Pollution is diagnosed by the accumulation of
   mobile HM compounds, and the mobility coefficients (indicators that do
   not depend on the selected background) make it possible to assess the
   risk of accumulation of Pb and Cd in soils in exchangeable and
   carbonate-related forms in the industrial, as well as in the
   recreational areas of the northern part of the city, as very high.},

Pages = {96-102},
Abstract = {The Ob River is a multifunctional water body used for fishery purposes,
   shipping, irrigation, recreation and drinking water supply. The research
   on the river water quality related to the assessment of ecological state
   and studying the regularities of chemical composition dynamics is
   topical nowadays. The paper presents the results of investigation of the
   hydrochemical composition (major ions: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42-, Cl-,
   F-, nutrients: N, P, Si and trace elements: Li, Be, B, Al, Ti, V, Cr,
   Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Mo, Cd, Ba, Pb, Fe, Mn) of the Ob River water
   near the city of Barnaul. The study was performed by Chemical-Analytical
   Center, Institute for Water and Environmental Problems of Siberian
   Branch RAS. The content of ions PO43-, Si, and COD (chemical oxygen
   consumption) was determined using a DR-2800 Hach Lange
   spectrophotometer, while the mineral composition, NH4+, NO2-, NO3- ions
   - with a Dionex ICS-3000 ion chromatograph. The concentration of trace
   elements was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (ICP MS) on an ICAP-Qc spectrometer. The dynamics of elements content in
   the Ob water was determined in different hydrological seasons of 2018.
   The river water is enriched by major ions and nutrients due to increased
   runoff of more mineralized groundwater in winter. Based on the factor
   analysis, we revealed three main groups of components, which differ in
   content and spatial distribution within the Ob surface water. In
   addition, we made the assessment of water pollution and revealed the
   excess of MAC for fishing waters in organic matter content (COD), Al,
   Ti, Cu, Fe and Mn.},

Pages = {142-148},
Abstract = {The article presents the results of long-term bioindication studies of
   the mycobiome of the leached chernozem of the B.A. Keller Botanical
   Garden of the Voronezh State Agrarian University. In this article, for
   the first time in our longstanding bioindication studies, we established
   the ecological trend of the succession of soil mycobiome of the
   Botanical Garden. The influence of plant rhizodeposites led to an
   increase in the alpha- and beta-diversity of mycobiome compared to
   virgin soil, the accumulation of copiotrophic, hydrolytic,
   phytopathogenic species. However, the transition of soil mycobiome to
   the adaptive response of ``stress{''} is observed, what appeared in the
   concentration of dominance of typical species, a decrease in the
   proportion of stenotopic species and the accumulation of toxigenic
   micromycetes. A sensitive method was selected for determining the
   biological (phytotoxic) activity of the soil, and the decisive role of
   micromycetes as a biotic factor in its development was confirmed. The
   main direction of succession of the soil mycobiom under intense
   microbial-plant interactions is the accumulation of species of fungi
   that synthesize mycotoxins. The stress reaction of the mycobiome and the
   growth of phytotoxic activity of the soil indicate the important role of
   microbial-plant interactions in reducing the stability of even such a
   high-buffer type of soil as leached chernozem. The results obtained can
   be used to assess and predict the ecological state of soil ecosystems
   using mycoindication.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Investigation into intense impact of industrial pollution on the aquatic
   ecosystems of the Ural region is one of tasks of environmental
   monitoring. To estimate peculiarities of the bioaccumulation of Cu, Zn,
   Cd, Pb in tissues of the leech Haenzopis sanguisuga (L., 1758) from
   aquatic ecosystems of natural and anthropogenically disturbed
   territories of the Ural have been first studied. The studies were based
   on the verification of 100 samples of bottom sediments and 100 adults of
   H. sanguisuga. from 10 water bodies of the Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk
   regions. The gross contents of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb in the skin-muscle tissue
   of leeches and in the bottom sediments were estimated by atomic
   absorption method on an AAS-3 spectrophotometer and on an Analyst-100
   instrument from Perkin Elmer. 800 element determinations were carried
   out. Estimated ranges of background concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb for
   bottom sediments of water bodies of Ural region are determined. It was
   found that the content of Cu, Cd, Pb in the bottom sediments of water
   bodies located in anthropogenic disturbed areas is higher than in
   natural water bodies (p < 0.001), with the exception of Zn (p = 0.929).
   It is shown that in the tissues of H. sanguisuga individuals living
   under anthropogenic stress, the content of HM is significantly higher
   than that of leeches from natural water bodies (p < 0.001). And the
   level of HM in tissues of leeches is directly related to their
   concentrations in bottom sediments: Cu (r = 0.69;p < 0.001), Zn (r =
   0.67; p < 0.001), Cd (r = 0.75; p < 0.001), Pb (r = 0.52; p < 0.001).
   This indicates the fundamental possibility of using leeches as indicator
   organisms when monitoring the pollution of the aquatic. ecosystems of
   the Ural by such pollutants as Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal oxides are potentially highly reactionary capable and
   cytotoxic. They cause direct DNA damage and decrease viability of the
   cells of a living organism. To ensure environmental safety impacts that
   accompany processing gold-bearing sands deposits, studies of
   microelement, phase and grain-size composition of rocks have been
   carried out. There are established elements prevailing by mass:
   phosphorus, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, barium, zirconium, chromium,
   strontium, as well as clay minerals, complicating the process of
   selecting valuable components. The revealed combination of mineral
   components has a high migration ability and toxicity.
   It is developed the technology reducing operations of leaching and
   hydrometallurgical processing. The complex of tools allows you to
   effectively select valuable components by hydrodynamic and cavitation
   impact on the clay component. As a result of the implementation of the
   technology, dispersion fluxes and subsequent geochemical anomalies, the
   costs of monitoring residual concentrations of strong polyelectrolytes
   and systematic toxicological assessment will be significantly reduced.
   The developed technology includes new installations that ensure the
   destruction of the clay component through ultrasonic and cavitation,

Abstract = {Biodiversity maintenance is a main goal in ecology. Hence, phytoplankton
   diversity and biomass were analyzed in a coastal bay (Cuma Bay) of the
   Amazon Macrotidal Mangrove Coast, which has been designated as an
   international hotspot for conservation (Ramsar site) with high
   biological productivity and diversity that provides crucial ecosystem
   ser-vices and elevated fish production. An ecohydrology-based approach
   was applied to iden-tify the main factors that drive the patterns of
   phytoplankton diversity and biomass, con-sidering spatio-temporal
   analyses of physical, chemical, and biological variables from May 2019
   to June 2020. Phytoplankton dynamics were investigated using
   multivariate analyses, correlations, and generalized additive models.
   Seven indices were tested to select the most efficient biodiversity
   metric. The hydrological conditions of Cuma Bay were governed pri-marily
   by elevated precipitation and macrotidal dynamics, resulting in two
   different func-tional zones based on environmental variability: the
   freshwater influence zone and marine influence zone. Seasonally, the
   maximum freshwater discharge, low salinity and light avail-ability
   promoted cell abundance and biomass increase, with blooms of Skeletonema
   costa-tum, which reduced the taxonomic diversity of the community in the
   rainy season. During the dry season, turbid waters resulting from
   macrotidal dynamics and wind speed limited light penetration and
   phytoplankton photosynthesis, leading to a higher uniformity in the
   species distribution. Shannon index was the most sensitive biodiversity
   metric to environ-mental changes. This study found that deterministic
   processes governed the community, which rainfall on the Amazon coast,
   along with wind speed, salinity, light availability and nutrients were
   the main controlling factors for phytoplankton diversity and
   richness.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Title = {The influence of landscape conditions on the functioning of microbial
   communities of postagrogenic soils of the tundra zone},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {157-165},
Abstract = {Microbial communities of postagrogenic soils of the tundra zone of the
   Komi Republic were studied. It has been established that the main part
   of functionally active microorganisms is concentrated in organogenic and
   humus-accumulative horizons of postagrogenic soils. In the upper
   horizons of postagrogenic soils, the number of living bacterial cells is
   62-84\%. The influence of landscape conditions on the quantitative and
   qualitative indicators of microbiocenoses of 13-16-year-old fallows
   occupying different positions in the landscape, is shown. It was
   revealed that in the series of postagrogenic soils, the watershed -> the
   terrace above the floodplain -> the floodplain, the number of bacteria
   changes slightly, and the number of fungi increases. Micromycetes
   dominate in the microbial biomass of the analyzed soils. The proportion
   of mycelium in the total microbial biomass in organic and
   humus-accumulative horizons varies from 36 to 71\%. In mineral horizons,
   where fungal mycelium is not found, the main components of microbial
   biomass are fungal spores - up to 99\% of the total microbial biomass.
   The proportion of living functionally active mycelium in the soil of the
   floodplain fallow (up to 100\%) is higher than in the fallows located at
   the top of the watershed (up to 85\%) and tile terrace above the
   floodplain (up to 70\%). In the series of postagrogenic soils, the
   watershed -> the floodplain terrace -> the floodplain, an increase in
   the reserves of microbial biomass from 2.20 to 8.44 t/ha was
   established. In the soils of the above-floodplain terrace and
   floodplain, the main share in the distribution of microorganism stocks
   belongs to the humus-accumulative soil horizons: 48 and 57\%,
   respectively. In the postagrogenic soil at the top of the watershed, the
   main reserves of microbial biomass are concentrated in mineral horizons
   (70\%).},

Title = {Chemical land degradation under the influence of animal husbandry waste},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-225},
Abstract = {Systematic introduction of significant volumes of liquid fraction (LF)
   of manure effluents into arable land leads to a significant
   transformation of the physical and chemical properties of agrozems.
   Under the influence of LF, the content of mobile forms of phosphorus (up
   to 980-1170 mg/kg), exchangeable potassium (up to 860 mg/kg), and
   organic. matter in the arable horizon significantly increases, and
   acidity decreases. The LF of manure effluents of cattle contributes to a
   more pronounced increase pH(KCl) and a more intensive accumulation of
   organic matter than the LF of pig manure effluents, which may be due to
   the different chemical composition of manure. Cattle manure contains
   more Ca and Mg, which lower the pH, as well as lignin and fiber, leading
   to the accumulation of humus in the soil. The concentration of all
   studied heavy metals (HM) in arable land did not exceed the values
   typical for agrozems of the Kirov region. The content of gross and
   mobile forms Cu, Cd, Pb in the surveyed agro-ecosystems turned out to be
   higher than in the background territories. The amount of HM in corn
   stalks did not exceed the usual content of these elements in plants of
   uncontaminated territories. The accumulation indices of all studied HM,
   except Cu, were significantly higher when growing plants on acidic
   soils. A possible reason for the increased bioavailability of Cu for
   plants in neutral soils may be the formation of soluble chelate
   complexes. To prevent environmental pollution in the area of livestock
   complexes, it is necessary to improve the existing system of animal
   waste disposal and introduce technologies that allow waste to be
   transported over long distances.},

Title = {Host by strain association study of rhizospheric actinobacteria on two
   Algerian date palm cultivars},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {135-141},
Abstract = {Extreme ecosystems such as the Algerian Sahara can be a source of
   untapped microorganisms that produce novel bioactive compounds against
   fusarium wilt disease. Effective control of fusarium wilt agent Fusarium
   oxysporum f. sp. albedinis relies on a thorough understanding of
   host-by-strain relations. Achieving this understanding can be highly
   beneficial, particularly for extensive multidimensional experiments.
   This paper investigates the qualitative and quantitative distribution of
   the actinobacteria in the rhizosphere (endorhizosphere and pneumatodes)
   of two date palm cultivars, one resistant (Takerbucht) and one
   susceptible to fusariosis (Aghamu). Consequently, 199 actinobacterial
   isolates were recorded; 13 species were identified, 6 were identified in
   root tips, and 10 in pneumatodes. The highest actinobacterial densities
   were recorded in the rhizospheric soils of the susceptible cultivar.
   However, the dominant species are present in the roots of the resistant
   ones. Differences in the composition of genera and species were found
   between cultivars. Actinobacteria are mainly represented by the genera
   Streptomyces and Nocardioides, which are respectively related to healthy
   and diseased date palm cultivars. Numerically, the most important
   species are related to S. chartreusis, Nocardioides albus and S.
   gannmycicus. Consequently, correspondence analysis facilitated the
   visual representation (associations patterns) of host-by-strain data and
   confirmed the aforementioned findings.},

Title = {Comparative evaluation of the prospects of using sulfide-conducting
   solid electrolytes in the composition of sensors for hydrogen sulfide
   and sulfur dioxide},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {41-48},
Abstract = {The article presents a comparative evaluation of the prospects for using
   sulfur-conducting solid electrolytes CaY2S4 and CaYb2S4 doped with
   ytterbium sesquisulfide (Yb2S2) as part of solid electrolyte sensors of
   sulfur-containing gases (hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide). The
   relationship between the magnitude of the sensor signal and the
   electrode reactions at the working electrode is considered, taking into
   account the partial pressures over its components, and the nature of the
   signals during the detection of H2S and SO2 is substantiated. The
   intervals of gas concentrations that fall into the group of linear signs
   depending on the content of the detected gas are determined. It has been
   suggested that the reason for the low sensitivity of the sensors in the
   range of P-S < 10(-10) atm is a kinetic nature. As a result of the
   study, it was found that when detecting a gas containing hydrogen
   sulfide, the limiting stage is the reaction of adsorption of hydrogen
   sulfide on the surface of the working electrode (reaction of the first
   order), and when determining the content of sulfur dioxide, the limiting
   rate reaction is the desorption reaction of a by-product - oxygen
   (reaction of the second order). It was carried out a kinetic study of
   the relationship between the sensitivity of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur
   dioxide sensors and outlined the sensitivity path of performance
   sensors. It was found that for the detection of hydrogen sulfide and
   sulfur dioxide, it is more promising to use the sulfur-conducting solid
   electrolyte CaY2S4 - x mol.\% Yb2S3, where x is 0 to 16 mol.\%, the
   sensor sensitivity is an order of magnitude higher than the use of solid
   electrolyte CaYb2S4 - x mol.\% Yb2S8, where x is 0 to 12 mol.\%.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of an analysis of the hydrochemical
   conditions for the formation of wetland ecosystems located on the
   territory and in the vicinity of the state natural reserve of regional
   significance ``Bylina{''}. The swamp Chistoe located on the territory of
   the Bylina State Nature Reserve, is one of the most important marsh
   reserves in Russia, it is characterized by a rich species composition of
   waterfowl and marsh birds, the presence of rare species of plants and
   animals. Several rivers originating from the swamp Chistoye are flowing
   through the territory of the Kirov region. Water taken from the swamp
   Chistoye and 1.5 km from it is characterized by an acidic and slightly
   acidic reaction (pH 4.3-5.8) and a low content of dissolved oxygen. In
   water of the swamp Chistoye, a high content of biogenic elements and
   organic substances was noted, which is associated with intensive
   processes of decomposition of organic matter in this ecosystem. The
   current conditions are unfavorable for the development of coastal
   aquatic vegetation in wetland ecosystems of the swamp Chistoye. Water in
   wetland ecosystems located 3-4 km north from the Bylina State Nature
   Reserve, in the floodplains of the Pushma and Yug rivers, is
   characterized by a low content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic
   compounds, a higher concentration of oxygen dissolved in water, and a
   higher pH value. Environmental conditions in these ecosystems are more
   favorable for the development of aquatic organisms compared to
   ecosystems the swamp Chistoye, however, with an increase in the content.
   of biogenic elements in water, the development of eutrophication and
   waterlogging processes is possible.},

Title = {An approach to the development of an integral index of ecological
   well-being of the territory},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {235-240},
Abstract = {The deterioration of the ecological state of all natural components in
   the territory of the Perm Krai is associated with an intense technogenic
   impact on the environment and an increase in the incidence of the
   population. Currently, in the practice of nature management there is no
   single, generally accepted method of integral assessment of both the
   ecological state of territories and the social conditions of life of the
   population. Most of the existing indicators (indices) consider only
   individual components of the general ecological state and are usually
   based on monitoring data. We believe that for a large region (for
   example, for the Perm Krai), it is advisable to take the technogenic
   impact as the basis for assessing the ecological state of the territory,
   with the obligatory consideration of the consequences of this impact on
   public health. To assess the ecological state of the territory, it is
   proposed to use the integral index of the ecological well-being of the
   territory. The stages of development of the integrated index of the
   ecological well-being of the territory are presented, the methodology
   for assessing the ecological state of the territory, assessing the
   social conditions of life and the incidence of the population is
   proposed. For the first time, a conditional norm was used as an
   evaluation criterion - the value of 50\% probability of exceeding the
   selected calculated indicators. The main results of using the
   methodology are given on the example of the administrative-territorial
   units of the Perm Krai are presented.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have long posited that secondary sexual
   characters experiencing positive directional selection should be
   positively allometric. Support for this hypothesis, however, is limited
   and appears to hold under a specific set of conditions. An alternative
   hypothesis argues that different forms of sexual selection can produce
   similar patterns of allometry, and vice versa, depending on the net
   effect of sexual selection and viability selection. We currently lack a
   general understanding of how particular patterns of allometry emerge
   from particular sexual selection regimes. Here, I empirically examine
   whether patterns of static allometry exhibited by leg and wing traits in
   female and male Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) align with the form
   of sexual selection underlying them. Contrary to expectation, I found
   that patterns of allometry did not universally align with their regime
   of sexual selection. Despite the direction and strength of sexual
   selection differing between the sexes, I found that all traits were
   negatively allometric with the exception of tibia width in males, which
   was isometric. Patterns of allometry for tibia length and wing traits
   were sexually dimorphic under some conditions and the slopes for wing
   traits were steeper in mated than in unmated males. My results support
   the hypothesis that different sexual selection regimes can produce
   similar patterns of static allometry and suggest that viability
   selection on these traits might be stronger than sexual selection and
   could thus be responsible for shaping their patterns of static
   allometry.},

Abstract = {The study of trait evolution in modular animals is more complicated than
   that in solitary animals, because a single genotype of a modular colony
   can express an enormous range of phenotypic variation. Furthermore,
   traits can occur either at the module level or at the colony level.
   However, it is unclear how the traits at the colony level evolve. We
   test whether colony-level aggregate traits, defined as the summary
   statistics of a phenotypic distribution, can evolve. To quantify this
   evolutionary potential, we use parent-offspring pairs in two sister
   species of the bryozoan Stylopoma, grown and bred in a common garden
   breeding experiment. We find that the medians of phenotypic
   distributions are evolvable between generations of colonies. We also
   find that the structure of this evolutionary potential differs between
   these two species. Ancestral species align more closely with the
   direction of species divergence than the descendent species. This result
   indicates that aggregate trait evolvability can itself evolve.},

   population (Ondatra zibethicus L.)},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {175-182},
Abstract = {A few demographic parameters of the muskrat population have been
   obtained. The study is based on data from trapping muskrat samples
   (total 2018 individuals) and information on the fertility of 868
   females. Variation in the cohort's survival rate and reproductive value
   were studied for the first time on the basis of the in usk rat
   population age distribution in the Ili River delta. The females specific
   survival rate was slightly higher than males in all age intervals. Both
   males and females survival rate was dramatically reduced starting at tb
   age 1+. Maximal specific survival rate in the 0+ - 1+ age interval is
   typical for animals of the first cohort, minimal - for the second, which
   is most numerous. The picture of specific survival rate changes as
   cohort is growing older. In older age classes, the maximum survival rate
   turn out to last, third cohort. So, in the last age class the largest
   part of individuals belong to the third cohort (75\%). As a result, the
   largest number of offspring is brought by females of this cohort
   (1.24-1.57 times more than representatives of the first and second
   cohorts). This is indicating the highest reproductive value of the third
   cohort females. No significant discrepancy in the fertility of females
   from different cohorts were found. That is, differences in the
   reproductive value of muskrats belonging to different cohorts arise due
   to the difference in specific survival rate. The number of
   representatives of the first two cohorts, which survived for the next
   year, is quite enough to form the population parent number. The muskrat
   retains the mechanism of forming next year reproductive core, which is
   typical to small voles, but it does not have a determining value for it.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {118-127},
Abstract = {Heavy metals (HM) in the soil cause changes in the ratio of resistant
   and susceptible fungal species, the mechanisms of interaction between
   which are not well understood. The aim of this work is to study the
   resistance to Cu and Pb cations and the antagonistic properties of two
   species of soil micromycetes Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma
   viride. Fungal resistance was assessed by the following test functions:
   biomass accumulation, colony diameter, and sporulation activity. The
   antagonistic activity of fungal species was assessed by competition
   test. The calculated effective concentrations and tolerance indices made
   it possible to conclude that A. alternata and T. viride are highly
   resistant to the investigated HMs. At the same time, species differences
   in the patterns of reactions were found. The growth of A. alternata
   colonies was inhibited to a greater extent than T. viride, however at
   the same HM concentration, the stimulation of sporulation in Alternaria
   was more pronounced than in the rapidly growing Trichoderma. The studied
   strain T. viride turned out to be quite competitive with respect to the
   phytopathogenic fungus A. alternata, and its antagonistic properties
   were well pronounced in the medium with HM. The data obtained can be
   useful for predicting the phytopathogenic activity of micromycetes
   against the background of chemical pollution and the dynamics of
   accumulation of various fungal species under adverse environmental
   conditions.},

Title = {Electrochemical methods for the determination of ascorbic acid in
   biologically active additives},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {34-40},
Abstract = {One of the negative consequences of the impact of adverse environmental
   factors on on a humans is the development of oxidative stress in the
   body, which causes deviations in the state of human health. An important
   role in the fight against oxidative processes is played by antioxidants,
   including ascorbic acid (AA). Along with food, biologically active
   additives (BAA) can be an additional source of AA intake into the body.
   The correct assessment of the AA content in pharmaceutical preparations
   helps to solve an important problem of food ecology - the balanced use
   of vitamin C. Therefore, the development of new and improvement of
   existing methods of analysis for determining the content of AA in
   various objects remains an urgent task.
   The use of instrumental methods for fixing the end point of the
   titration increases the accuracy of the analysis. Simple and economical
   electrochemical methods such as potentiometry and coulometry can be used
   to implement the iodometric titration method. Despite all the advantages
   of coulometric and potentiometric methods of analysis and their widest
   distribution in various fields of science and technology, there are no
   data in the literature on the pussihilily of implementing the
   coulometric determination of AA with potentiometric indication and
   direct potentiometric titration, which are based on the reaction with
   iodine.
   As a result of the study, it was found that in the determination of AA
   by both methods, well-repeated results were obtained (the relative
   standard deviation does not exceed 2.0\%), the dependence of the
   analytical signal on the sample mass (in the range of 80-120\% to
   standard weight 0,1 or 0,2 g depending on the method) is linear with R
   not less than 0.99, and the results obtained by the
   ``introduced-found{''} method satisfy the requirement of correctness.},

Title = {Adenylate cyclase A amplification and functional diversification during
   Polyspondylium pallidum development},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: In Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddis), adenylate cyclase A
   (ACA) critically generates the cAMP oscillations that coordinate
   aggregation and morphogenesis. Unlike group 4 species like Ddis, other
   groups do not use extracellular cAMP to aggregate. However, deletion of
   cAMP receptors (cARs) or extracellular phosphodiesterase (PdsA) in
   Polyspondylium pallidum (Ppal, group 2) blocks fruiting body formation,
   suggesting that cAMP oscillations ancestrally control post-aggregative
   morphogenesis. In group 2, the acaA gene underwent several duplications.
   We deleted the three Ppal aca genes to identify roles for either gene
   and tested whether Ppal shows transient cAMP-induced cAMP accumulation,
   which underpins oscillatory cAMP signalling.
   Results: In contrast to Ddis, pre-aggregative Ppal cells did not produce
   a pulse of cAMP upon stimulation with the cAR agonist 2'H-cAMP, but
   acquired this ability after aggregation. Deletion of Ppal aca1, aca2 and
   aca3 yielded different phenotypes. aca1(-) cells showed relatively thin
   stalks, aca2(-) showed delayed secondary sorogen formation and aca3(-)
   formed less aggregation centers. The aca1(-)aca2(-) and aca1(-)aca3(-)
   mutants combined individual defects, while aca2(-)aca3(-) and
   aca1(-)aca3(-)aca2(-) additionally showed > 24 h delay in aggregation,
   with only few aggregates with fragmenting streams being formed. The
   fragments developed into small fruiting bodies with stalk and spore
   cells. Aggregation was restored in aca2(-) aca3(-) and aca1(-) aca3(-)
   aca2(-) by 2.5 mM 8Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeant activator of
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Like Ddis, Ppal sorogens also
   express the adenylate cyclases ACR and ACG. We found that prior to
   aggregation, Ddis aca(-)/ACG cells produced a pulse of cAMP upon
   stimulation with 2'H-cAMP, indicating that cAMP oscillations may not be
   dependent on ACA alone.
   Conclusions: The three Ppal replicates of acaA perform different roles
   in stalk morphogenesis, secondary branch formation and aggregation, but
   act together to enable development by activating PKA. While even an
   aca1(-) aca3(-) aca2(-) mutant still forms (some) fruiting bodies,
   suggesting little need for ACA-induced cAMP oscillations in this
   process, we found that ACG also mediated transient cAMP-induced cAMP
   accumulation. It, therefore, remains likely that post-aggregative Ppal
   morphogenesis is organized by cAMP oscillations, favouring a previously
   proposed model, where cAR-regulated cAMP hydrolysis rather than its
   synthesis dominates oscillatory behaviour.},

Abstract = {Hybridization is a widespread phenomenon in animals, and hybrid
   heterosis/breakdown could be key processes determining the evolutionary
   dynamics of hybrids. Indeed, hybrids are not consistently disadvantaged
   compared to the parental lineages, as was historically assumed. Multiple
   processes could lead to performance differences between parental
   lineages and their hybrids. Despite many studies evaluated the
   performance of hybrids, a quantitative synthesis is required to assess
   the general pattern. Here we used meta-analytic and meta-regression
   approaches to quantify the fitness differences between parental lineages
   and their hybrids, and to identify possible processes that could lead to
   these differences. Specifically, we tested biological and methodological
   parameters that could determine differences in performance between
   hybrids and parental lineages. Hybrid performance was extremely variable
   across studies, being often significantly higher or lower compared to
   the mean performance of their parents. Nevertheless, the averaged hybrid
   performance was similar to the fitness of parental lineages, with
   differences across studies related to how performance was assessed.
   Genetic divergence between parental lineages, and the approach used to
   identify hybrids were the parameters most strongly related to variation
   in hybrid performance. Performance was lower for hybrids between
   distantly related lineages. Furthermore, study settings and the use of
   imprecise approaches for hybrid identification (e.g. morphology-based)
   can bias assessments of performance. Studies performed on wild
   populations and using genetic approaches for hybrid identification
   detected more often a decreased hybrid performance, compared to
   laboratory studies. We highlight the importance of appropriate settings
   for a realistic understanding of the evolutionary impacts of
   hybridization.},

Title = {Many evolutionary roads led to virus domestication in ichneumonoid
   parasitoid wasps},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The investigation of endogenous viral elements (EVEs) has historically
   focused on only a few lineages of parasitoid wasps, with negative
   results consistently underreported. Recent studies show that multiple
   viral lineages were integrated in at least seven instances in
   Ichneumonoidea and may be much more widespread than previously thought.
   Increasingly affordable genomic and bioinformatic approaches have made
   it feasible to search for viral sequences within wasp genomes, opening
   an extremely promising research avenue. Advances in wasp phylogenetics
   have shed light on the evolutionary history of EVE integration, although
   many questions remain. Phylogenetic proximity can be used as a guide to
   facilitate targeted screening, to estimate the number and age of
   integration events and to identify taxa involved in major host switches.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Half the world's human population is at risk for mosquito-borne
   diseases. Mosquitoes rely mainly on their sense of smell to find a
   vertebrate blood host, nectar source, and a suitable oviposition site.
   Advances in neurogenetic tools have now aided our understanding of the
   receptors that mediate the detection of sensory cues that emanate from
   humans. Recent studies in the anthropophilic mosquito vectors, Aedes
   aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, have implicated the chemosensory
   ionotropic-receptor (IR) family in the detection of behaviorally
   relevant odors and uncovered functions beyond chemical sensing. Here, we
   highlight the multifunctional roles of the chemosensory ionotropic
   receptors in anthropophilic mosquito vectors and suggest future
   directions to improve our understanding of the IR family.},

Title = {Photoprotection properties of terpenophenols in polylactide against UVC
   radiation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {26-33},
Abstract = {Polylactide is one of the most environmentally friendly polymers to
   replace fossil-based materials. In this work we quantitatively evaluated
   the effectiveness of new photostabilizers in preventing the
   photodegradation of polylactide under UVC radiation by using the
   spectrometric criteria calculated from FTIR spectra. We have proposed a
   method including a treatment of the samples of polylactide mixed with
   the photostabilizers by the UV radiation with a wavelength of 254 nm for
   4 hours followed by the calculation of the effectiveness of the
   photostabilizer based on the FTIR spectrometric data. The number of
   terminal hydroxyl groups increased during photodegradation due to the
   cleavage of ester bonds in the polymer, this caused the increase of the
   absorption at 3600-3100 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra. Several
   photostabilizers of the terpenophenol class were studied, namely
   4-methyl-2,6-diisobornylphenol, 2-isobornylphenol,
   2-isobornyl-4-methylphenol and 2-isobornyl-6-mothyl phenol, as well as
   bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate - the well-known hindered
   amine light stabilizer. The mass concentrations of these
   photostabilizers varied from 0.05 to 1.00\%.
   The best protection effect from the UVC radiation in regard to
   polylactide was shown by 4-methyl-2,6-diisobornylphenol at the
   concentration of 0.05\% by weight. Its photoprotective activity was
   almost 2 times higher than that of
   bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate of the same concentration.
   The high photoprotecting activity of 4-methyl-2,6-di isobornylphenol was
   due to the increased stability of the phenoxy radical provided by bulky
   isobornyl substituents in the aromatic ring. In the opposite, the strong
   photosensitizing effect accelerat ing the photodegradation of
   polylactide was manifested by 1\% concentrations of
   2-isobornyl-4i-methylphenol and 2-isobornyl-6-methylphenol. In this
   case, the delocalization of the unpaired electron in the conjugation
   chain with the formation of many resonance forms contributed to the
   transfer of the radical to polylactide macromolecules. The protection of
   polylactide from UVC radiation opens up prospects for expanding the
   areas of application of polylactide, a polymer synthesized from
   renewable raw materials.},

Title = {Biological contamination of arable land with pig waste},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-205},
Abstract = {Large industrial pig farms are a source of biological contamination of
   arable lands located in the immediate vicinity of these enterprises, as
   a result of the introduction of large volumes of liquid fraction of
   manure effluents. Utilization of these biogenic wastes is a serious
   economic and environmental problem for the agro-industrial complex. The
   work is devoted to the study of the influence of the liquid fraction of
   pig farm manure effluents on the sanitary condition of arable land
   according to agrochemical and microbiological studies of soil samples.
   The study revealed that the regular introduction of pig manure into
   arable land (for 5 years) led to a significant increase in the content
   of mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium; there was a pronounced
   tendency to the accumulation of copper and zinc in the arable horizon of
   the soil, in addition, high values of the total microbial number, the
   index of bacteria of the group Escherichia coli, Enterococci and
   Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella, including pathogenic and
   thermophilic bacteria, were found in significant quantities. In
   addition, pig manure effluents are potential sources of ingress into the
   soil of agricultural land, as well as adjacent territories with
   saprophytic microorganisms, as well as bacteria of the group E. coli, C.
   perfringens, Proteus spp., Clostridium spp., Salmonella enteritidis,
   fungi Alternaria alternate, Botrytia cinerea, yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. Insufficient attention to environmental monitoring of
   territories adjacent to livestock enterprises can lead to chemical and
   biological pollution of the environment by a wide range of pollutants
   present in manure runoff, and the intensification of the development of
   the industrial pig industry will accelerate this process.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {424-432},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Claws are the most common attachment mechanism in vertebrates. The
   comparative anatomy and morphology of claws has been studied mainly in
   reptiles and birds. However, as far as we know, studies focusing on
   turtles' claws are lacking. Turtles occupy a wide range of habitats,
   from aquatic to terrestrial, and vary in form and behavior, being an
   ideal model organism for ecomorphological studies. We performed
   qualitative and quantitative analyses to find a relationship between
   morphological variation and both ecological factors and phylogenetic
   constraints that could have driven the evolution of turtles' claws. The
   claws of 35 adult turtle and tortoise specimens of 12 species of
   testudines with different locomotor modes were compared. Our data show
   several convergence traits in claw shape, with convergence being
   reinforced by the low phylogenetic signal exhibited by most characters.
   We propose that claw morphology in turtles is mainly associated with
   some mechanical functions, such as freshwater-swimming, bottom-walking
   and tearing of prey.},

Title = {Social complexity and brain evolution: insights from ant
   neuroarchitecture and genomics},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Brain evolution is hypothesized to be driven by requirements to
   adaptively respond to environmental cues and social signals. Diverse
   models describe how sociality may have influenced eusocial insect-brain
   evolution, but specific impacts of social organization and other
   selective forces on brain architecture have been difficult to
   distinguish. Here, we evaluate predictions derived from and/or
   inferences made by models of social organization concerning the effects
   of individual and collective behavior on brain size, structure, and
   function using results of neuroanatomical and genomic studies. In
   contrast to the predictions of some models, we find that worker brains
   in socially complex species have great behavioral and cognitive
   capacity. We also find that colony size, the evolution of worker
   physical castes, and task specialization affect brain size and
   mosaicism, supporting the idea that sensory, processing and motor
   requirements for behavioral performance select for adaptive allometries
   of functionally specialized brain centers. We review available
   transcriptomic and comparative genomic studies seeking to elucidate the
   molecular pathways functionally associated with social life and the
   genetic changes that occurred during the evolution of social complexity.
   We discuss ways forward, using comparative neuroanatomy,
   transcriptomics, and comparative genomics, to distinguish among multiple
   alternative explanations for the relationship between the evolution of
   neural systems and social complexity.},

Title = {Economic analysis of pest problems in agriculture and food chains in
   Africa},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Economic impact of agricultural pests remains poorly studied, resulting
   in interventions rarely being evidence-based. When pests (re)emerge,
   researchers and donors often implement quick studies that tend to
   overestimate losses, leading to recommendations for immediate and
   substantial interventions. Incentives are lacking for
   scientists/research institutes to invest in objective pest assessments,
   as donors routinely fund projects without them. In this review, we argue
   for inclusion of social scientists and systematic economic analysis of
   pest problems and their control, consisting of four major steps: (1)
   estimating pests' extent and intensity, (2) conducting trials for
   technical and economical efficacy of control methods, (3) randomized
   controlled trials with participatory evaluation and effectiveness
   analysis of control options, and (4) impact assessment of pests and
   control methods. To optimize pest control, scientists and donors need to
   include socioeconomic analysis, leading to better use of research funds
   and reduction of negative environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {The differentiation by microsites of the population of dung beetles
   inhabiting horse droppings in the southern Sikhote-Alin, Primorsky krai,
   has been studied for the first time. The heterogeneity of the substrate
   has a significant effect on the distribution of beetles among
   microstations. The key factor affecting the seasonal dynamics of the
   species composition, abundance, and biomass of beetles in different
   parts of the droppings are the temperature and humidity regime. It is
   shown that the confinement of certain species of dung beetles to areas
   of horse manure can serve as a way of dividing their ecological niches
   and a way of avoiding competition within one functional group.},

Title = {Insect resistance management facing African smallholder farmers under

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Changes in climatic conditions affect pest populations and ultimately
   result in increased pest status and yield losses. While pesticide
   application is usually the first defensive tool used to control pest
   species that threaten crop production, genetically modified (GM) crops
   with insecticidal traits (Bt crops) are becoming more common. The
   indiscriminate and over use of insecticides, and absence of insect
   resistance management (IRM) strategies ultimately lead to evolution of
   resistance against these technologies. IRM faces significant challenges
   in the African context. In this paper we use examples of cotton, maize,
   cowpea and tomato pests to illustrate their potential to evolve
   resistance to insecticides and also highlight the importance of IRM
   strategies, both with regard to the use of pesticides and the
   cultivation of Bt cotton, Bt maize and Bt cowpea.},

Abstract = {How the size and shape of developing tissues is encoded in the genome
   has been a longstanding riddle for biologists. Constituent cells
   integrate several genetic and mechanical signals to decide whether to
   divide, die, change shape or position. We review here how morphogenetic
   cell behaviors contribute to leg formation from imaginal disc epithelia
   in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, as well as to direct embryonic
   limb outgrowths in the non-insect pancrustacean Parhyale hawaiensis.
   Considering the deep conservation of developmental programs for limb
   patterning among arthropods and other bilaterians, moving forward, it
   will be exciting to see how these genetic similarities reflect at the
   cellular and tissue mechanics level.},

Title = {Nesting Features of the Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus L., 1758) in Urban

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {As birds adapt to life in urban areas, separate urban populations are
   formed which are, in regards to many biological and ecological
   characteristics, distinct from birds of the same species that inhabit
   natural environments. The woodpigeon is one of the most common
   representatives of synurbic bird species that has successfully managed
   to spread to cities in most of Europe over the past century. This
   article explores the history of formation of synurbic woodpigeon groups
   in Belarus and looks at the differences in the breeding biology of
   forest and urban birds based on research in 2000-2021. During this
   period, we collected information about 109 woodpigeon nests in forest
   areas and 368 nests in urban areas. In the course of our research, we
   found out that the synurbic woodpigeon continues spreading to northern
   and eastern parts of Belarus. By now, urban birds live in around 70\% of
   the entire territory of the country. Our analysis of the woodpigeon
   breeding biology shows that there are differences between forest and
   urban birds that stem from the fact that the latter live in urban areas.
   Despite the absence of clear differences in the phenology of the arrival
   of the woodpigeon in cities and natural landscapes, the nesting period
   of urban birds starts earlier and lasts much longer. In addition, the
   share of birds that breed more than once per season is larger than in
   forest birds. The peculiarities of nesting sites observed in urban birds
   as opposed to wild birds result from the peculiarities of urban green
   spaces and the effect of predation. We discovered that the share of nest
   failures peaks in spring (April-May). The breeding success of the
   woodpigeon in urban areas amounts to 52\% of all nesting cases.},

Title = {Technogenic impact of wastewater on the hydrochemical composition of the
   Angara River},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {90-95},
Abstract = {The Angara River is a sou me of drinking water supply for the population
   of Irkutsk Oblast (Russia). The ecosystem of the river has been under
   anthropogenic impact from the large Usolie-Sibirsky industrial zone for
   several decades. The aim of the present study was to analyze the
   concentrations of trace elements in the wastewater entering the Angara
   River and to determine their impact on the river's hydrochemical
   composition. For this purpose, concentrations of 21 trace elements were
   measured in the wastewater and waters of Angara River at different
   distances from the technogenic sources. The results obtained show that
   wastewater contains high concentrations of a large range of trace
   elements. The intensity of anthropogenic impact was determined using a
   contamination factor (CF), which allowed to identify four groups of
   trace elements depending on their concentration exceeding the background
   level. The largest factors are determined for Sb (CF up to 123), B (CF
   up to 345), Ti (CF up to 651), Br (CF up to 913), Ge (CF up to 1093), Hg
   (CF up to 1991). The inflow of elements of anthropogenic origin is
   reflected in a negative change in the hydro-chemical composition of the
   Angara River at sites where waste- and river water are mixed. However,
   due to intensive dilution of wastewater by the Angara River,
   concentration of most trace elements in the river water at a distance of
   5 km downstream of contamination sources are reduced to background
   levels. At the same time, elements ( Li, As, V, Mo, B, Br, Ge, Hg) have
   been identified, whose concentrations in the water of the Angara River
   in this section remain above the background values. Increased
   concentrations of the observed trace elements can lead to negative
   consequences for hydrobionts, which are vulnerable even to minor changes
   in the chemical composition of the Angara River.},

Title = {The Predictable Complexity of Evolutionary Allometry},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Allometry has been a paradigm of constraints, including intrinsic
   constraints on the evolvability of allometry, as a source of
   developmental and genetic constraints on the evolution of form, and of
   functional constraints, maintaining functional equivalence as body size
   evolves. Yet, allometry may be the simplest case of varied constraints,
   and of morphological integration, even though allometry itself is not
   simple. Evolutionary allometry may be especially complex because it
   depends not only on developmental origins of allometry and determinants
   of allometric variation but also on the evolutionary dynamics of size
   and shape. It should also depend on the ecological opportunity for
   size-dependent ecomorphological specialization. We predict that lineages
   that converge in those would exhibit similar evolutionary allometries
   but otherwise, evolutionary allometries would be heterogeneous.
   Countering this expectation are familiar craniofacial evolutionary
   allometries, often ascribed to developmental bias. To test both those
   hypotheses, we compare evolutionary allometries of mandibles across
   lineages of squirrels and evolutionary to growth allometries. As
   expected, lineages that converge on size-dependent specializations
   exhibit similar evolutionary allometries, but otherwise their
   allometries are no more similar than expected by chance. Growth
   allometries of squirrels (and a cricetid rodent) slightly resemble the
   evolutionary allometry of one lineage, but growth allometries of species
   from other lineages are orthogonal to their own lineages' evolutionary
   allometry. We would expect that craniofacial allometries that are not
   brain-driven would, like mandibular evolutionary allometries, be
   predictable only from size-dependent ecological specializations.},

Title = {The Role of Vicariance and Paleoclimatic Shifts in the Diversification
   of Uranoscodon superciliosus (Squamata, Tropiduridae) of the Amazonian
   Floodplains},

Abstract = {Wetlands are present in different parts of the globe, holding a
   significant portion of the local biodiversity, and have been under the
   constant influence of climatic changes worldwide on different time
   scales. Investigations with a phylogeographic approach have revealed the
   role of Quaternary climatic shifts on a global scale, favoring constant
   changes in the amplitude of floodplains and affecting the evolutionary
   history of multi-taxa. This pattern was observed in the Amazonian biota,
   but due to the complex geological history, some of these models alone
   are insufficient, especially in widespread species that live in specific
   regions of the biome. Herein, we investigated the species delimitation
   and biogeographic history of the semi-aquatic lizard Uranoscodon
   superciliosus (U. superciliosus), widely distributed in Amazonian
   floodplains, a habitat that was for a long time considered a corridor to
   gene flow. Our results support a high genetic diversity with five
   well-supported lineages within U. superciliosus: North of the Amazon
   River, East Xingu, Solimoes, Purus, and Tapajos-Madeira, with the basal
   split within this group in the Miocene and others in the
   Plio-Pleistocene. These results corroborated a mixture of distinct
   processes that shaped the diversity of U. superciliosus with rivers as
   vicariant barriers and the already known role of paleoclimatic shifts
   during the Quaternary promoting diversification. Among tetrapods, our
   work is one of the first to describe the genetic structure in a
   widespread taxon along river-edge environments, thus supporting both
   patterns of diversification with the compartmentalized lineages along
   different Amazonian rivers (floodplains) and also the more common
   pattern found in upland forest species, with main rivers acting as
   vicariant barriers and playing a role in allopatric speciation.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Diet can impact the outcome of parasitic infection in three,
   non-mutually exclusive ways: 1) by changing the physiological
   environment of the host, such as the availability of key nutritional
   resources, the presence of toxic dietary chemicals, the pH or osmolality
   of the blood or gut, 2) by enhancing the immune response and 3) by
   altering the presence of host microbiota, which help to digest nutrients
   and are a potential source of antibiotics. We show that there are no
   clear patterns in the effects of diet across taxa and that good evidence
   for the mechanisms by which diet exerts its effects are often lacking.
   More studies are required to understand the mechanisms of action if we
   are to discern patterns that can be generalised across host and parasite
   taxa.},

Title = {Balancing sensitivity, risk, and immunopathology in immune regulation},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Activation of an immune response is energetically costly and excessive
   immune system activity can result in immunopathology, yet a slow or
   insufficient immune response carries the risk of pathogen establishment
   with consequent pathology arising from the infection. Mathematical
   theory and empirical data demonstrate that hosts balance the costs of
   immunity against the risk of infection by closely regulating
   immunological dynamics. An optimal immune system is rapidly and robustly
   deployed against a true infectious threat and rapidly deactivated once
   the threat has been controlled. Genetic variation in the sensitivity of
   an immune system, as well as in the activation and shutdown kinetics of
   host immune responses, can contribute to the evolution of pathogen
   virulence and host tolerance of infection. Improved understanding of the
   adaptive forces that operate on immune regulatory dynamics will clarify
   fundamental principles governing the evolution and maintenance of innate
   immune systems.},

Abstract = {To date, several ecological studies have addressed the influences of
   environmental noise. However, fundamental studies on noise reduction
   depending on the acoustic characterization of natural materials are
   still lacking. The present study quantitatively evaluates experimental
   data on sound absorption and attenuation of untreated plant leaves
   commonly found in urban areas. The leaves of English Ivy (Hedera helix
   L.), Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), Hortensia (Hydrangea
   macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser.), Japanese Privet (Ligustrum japonicum
   Thunb.), Laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), Linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench),
   Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.), Osmanthus (Osmanthus heterophyllus
   (G.Don) P.S.Green), Plane Tree (Platanus orientalis L.), and Cherry
   Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) were collected from branches of healthy
   plants grown under identical climate and soil conditions. To
   acoustically characterize plant leaves, impedance tube and pulse-echo
   techniques were used to experimentally determine the normal incidence
   sound absorption coefficient (SAC), speed of sound and sound attenuation
   coefficient (SC) values, respectively. In addition, as more effective
   numerical outputs, the normalized SAC (SAC `) and normalized NRC (NRC `)
   values were calculated by empirical modelling. As a statistical
   approach, multiple regression was also conducted to predict the
   dependent acoustic variables based on the independent physical
   parameters of the samples.},

   Diplozoon paradoxum von Nordmann, 1832 from bream from the same water

Title = {Firefly genomes illuminate the evolution of beetle bioluminescent
   systems},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fireflies are one of the best-known bioluminescent organisms, and the
   reaction mechanism and ecological utility of bioluminescence have been
   well-studied. Genome assemblies of six species of bioluminescent beetles
   have recently been published. These studies have focused on the
   evolution of novelties; luciferase, and the biosynthesis of luciferin
   and defensive chemicals. For example, clustering of the luciferase gene
   with acyl-CoA synthetase genes on a chromosome in luminous beetle
   genomes suggests the involvement of tandem gene duplications and
   neofunctionalization during the evolution of beetle bioluminescence.
   Several candidate genes for critical roles in beetle bioluminescence
   have been identified, but their functional analyses are still ongoing.
   The establishment of a long-term mass-rearing system and strain will be
   the key for the post-genome research on bioluminescent beetles. Lastly,
   the application of contemporary chromosome-scale genome assembly
   techniques to luminous beetles will help resolve outstanding
   evolutionary questions, such as how many times bioluminescence evolved
   in this clade.},

Abstract = {The forest biomass dynamics in boreal forests has a significant effect
   on global carbon cycles. Biomass estimates provide insight into the
   carbon balance of forest vegetation in Siberia. This paper discusses the
   methods used in modern studies (2010-2021) to estimate aboveground
   forest biomass on the basis of radar remote sensing data. Biomass
   estimation methodologies are described, including field data collection,
   data preprocessing, and modeling of relationships between remote sensing
   (RS) data and biomass. In terms of forest biomass estimation, radar
   sensing has limited capabilities determined by the characteristics of
   the survey equipment and parameters of studied forest stands. Modern
   studies combine optical and radar RS data to estimate forest biomass
   more accurately using regression models, machine learning, and special
   techniques (BIOMASAR, SWCM, and MaxEnt). Vegetation optical depth values
   estimated on the basis of microwave surveys make it possible to solve
   the saturation problem hindering the estimation of large amounts of
   biomass. It is difficult to compare the accuracy of biomass estimation
   methods due to the lack of uniform approaches to experimental and error
   computation procedures. Errors in biomass estimates produced on the
   basis of optical and radar data vary considerably (similar to 25\% on
   average). The small amount of reference field data complicates biomass
   estimations in boreal forests of Siberia. It is believed that the
   application of machine learning algorithms to remote sensing data
   collected by the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-PALSAR satellites will make it
   possible to estimate the biomass of boreal forests with a high spatial
   resolution.},

Title = {Influence of Abiotic Environmental Factors on the Accumulation of

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The composition and content of phenolic compounds in the leaves of
   Dasiphora fruticosa growing in the Far East and Southern and Eastern
   Siberia in the range of 43 degrees 13 `-62 degrees 52 ` N has been
   studied. The phenolic complex of D. fruticosa is composed of 16-22
   components and remains constant. Its variation is caused mainly by minor
   components. Seven flavonol glycosides (hyperoside, isoquercitrin, rutin,
   avicularin, quercitrin, astragalin, and kaempferol-rutinoside), two
   aglycones (quercetin and kaempferol), and ellagic acid and its glycoside
   have been found using HPLC and UV spectrometry. The total content of
   phenolic compounds in plant leaves ranges from 13.5 to 28.3 mg/g, the
   content of quercetin glycosides ranges from 4.8 to 17.3 mg/g, and the
   content of kaempferol glycosides ranges from 0.1 to 1.3 mg/g. The total
   content of ellagic tannins in the leaves varies from 6.9 to 12.9 mg/g.
   It is found that the content of all individual components increases
   except for avicularin (which, on the contrary, decreases) as D.
   fruticosa moved from south to north with insolation on the background of
   low-temperature stress and drought. It is shown that the content of
   phenolic compounds (in total and in groups) is determined by temperature
   (by 53-75\%) and the content of flavonols by drought (50-91\%) and solar
   radiation (50-54\%). The accumulation of ellagic compounds in leaves of
   D. fruticosa is 60\% determined by temperature; other factors are of low
   importance. Air temperature, drought, and UV radiation make a
   significant contribution to the accumulation of phenolic compounds in D.

Abstract = {Understanding and predicting the spread of invading insects is a
   critical challenge in management programs that aim to minimize
   ecological and economic harm to native ecosystems. Although efforts to
   quantify spread rates have been well studied over the past several
   decades, opportunities to improve our ability to estimate rates of
   spread, and identify the factors, such as habitat suitability and
   climate, that influence spread, remain. We review emerging sources of
   data that can be used to delineate distributional boundaries through
   time and thus serve as a basis for quantifying spread rates. We then
   address advances in modeling methods that facilitate our understanding
   of factors that drive invasive insect spread. We conclude by
   highlighting some remaining challenges in understanding and predicting
   invasive insect spread, such as the role of climate change and biotic
   similarity between the native and introduced ranges, particularly as it
   applies to decision-making in management programs.},

Title = {Towards integrated pest and pollinator management in tropical crops},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Biotic pollination and pest control are two critical insect-mediated
   ecosystem services that support crop production. Although management of
   both services is usually treated separately, the new paradigm of
   Integrated Pest and Pollinator Management (IPPM) suggests synergetic
   benefits by considering them together. We reviewed the management
   practices in two major tropical perennial crops: cocoa and coffee, to
   assess IPPM applications under the tropics. We found potential synergies
   and antagonisms among crop pest and pollination management, however,
   very few studies considered these interactions. Interestingly, we also
   found management practices focusing mainly on a single service mediated
   by insects although species can show multiple ecological functions as
   pests, natural enemies, or pollinators. The tropics represent a
   promising area for the implementation of IPPM and future research should
   address this concept to move towards a more sustainable agriculture.},

Abstract = {Metazoans are well represented in temperate environments but few occur
   at the thermal edges of life. Only three animal phyla-Annelida,
   Arthropoda and Rotifera-are known to have representatives in both
   psychrophilic and thermophilic habitats. Here we report species of
   Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Rotifera that have independently colonized
   both ends of the thermal spectrum, from maritime glacier ice to
   geothermal hot springs in New Zealand. By phylogenetic analyses with
   nuclear and mitochondrial loci, we present evidence that glacial
   populations have deep haplotype diversity and have likely persisted
   throughout the Pleistocene, while residents of geothermal environments
   appear more contemporary. Bdelloid rotifers in particular display robust
   dispersal capabilities both within New Zealand (thermophiles) and
   worldwide (psychrophiles), linking genetically with populations in
   Antarctica and the northern hemisphere.},

Abstract = {The hydrological role of forest communities dominating in the
   Podkamennaya Tunguska basin has been assessed by their contribution to
   the total evaporation in the watershed area based on the landscape
   differentiation of the region. We have used evapotranspiration
   parameters obtained by remote sensing data from MODIS Global
   Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16 ET), which takes into account the
   climatic data of the studied area, the types of the terrestrial surface,
   and the diversity of the landcover. The studies show that the
   evapotranspiration of the specified classes of forest vegetation is
   characterized by significant variability both in space and with time.
   The variability of evapotranspiration from year to year is primarily
   related to changes in meteorological parameters and the leaf index. The
   evaporation variability in space is determined by general climatic
   characteristics of the research area and different species composition
   of forest stands. The analysis of data reveals the tendency to a
   decrease in the annual evapotranspiration in the Podkamennaya Tunguska
   basin from 2000 to 2014. A comparative analysis of evapotranspiration
   trends with those in air temperature and precipitation confirms that the
   evapotranspiration decrease is related to changes in climatic conditions
   in the studied area. It is revealed that the landscape structure of
   watersheds may be used to indicate the processes forming
   evapotranspiration as an important component of the water balance, as
   well as to determine the hydrologically significant boundaries of
   landscapes. The assessment of evaporation from the land surface based on
   remote sensing data (product MOD16 ET) may be used for water balance
   calculations in watersheds of various sizes, particularly in the absence
   of a runoff database.},

Abstract = {The response of Darlingtonia californica Torr. on the effect of Cu, Co,
   and Mg ions in vitro is studied. The following concentrations of mineral
   salts are tested: 0.1 (control), 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mu M CuSO4
   center dot 5H(2)O (which corresponds to 0.006, 0.6, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, and
   6.4 mg/L of water-soluble Cu ions); 0.1 (control), 10, 25, 50, 75, and
   100 mu M CoCl2 center dot 6H(2)O (corresponding to 0.006, 0.6, 1.5, 3.0,
   4.4, and 5.9 mg/L of water-soluble Co ions); and 1500 (control), 4500,
   7500, 10500, and 15 000 mu M MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O (corresponding to
   36, 108, 181, 253, and 362 mg/L of water-soluble Mg ions). The results
   show a direct significant correlation between the accumulation of Cu,
   Co, and Mg ions in D. californica plants depending on their content in
   nutrient solutions. The maximum accumulation of ions is found after 45
   days of cultivation, Cu-138.24 mg/kg of dry matter, Co-249.92 mg/kg, and
   Mg-4722.26 mg/kg. It is shown that the concentrations used do not
   significantly affect the parameters of plant growth and development in
   vitro. Morphological and anatomical studies confirm the high level of
   ecological adaptation of this species to extreme conditions. In
   addition, the plants do not require specific cultural conditions; they
   are able to grow on nutrient media rich in mineral composition at a
   temperature of 24 +/- 1 degrees C and do not require low positive
   temperatures for the root system. The results show that D. californica
   plants are able to accumulate Cu, Co, and Mg ions and tolerate high
   concentrations of these elements in nutrient media in vitro, but they
   are not characterized by an increased need for these elements for normal
   growth and development.},

Abstract = {Calcareous lands play an important role in the gene reservoir

   to assess soil seed bank dynamics (SSBDs) in a calcareous and a

   was done at two times in 6 and 18 months after seed dispersal.
   Environmental and soil characteristics and diversity and germination
   indices (DIs, GIs) were measured for SSB. Multivariate ordination (CCA)
   and liner regression was performed to detect relationship between SSBDs
   and soil factors. Nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), phosphorous (P),
   and soil moisture (SM) affected SSBDs in short time and lime content had
   a positive effect in persistent SSB in long time, especially in grasses
   (Sig. < 0.05). In calcareous soil, the lime content showed a positive
   relation with GIs, where has led to an inducible seed dormancy and
   preserved vigor index (VI) \{R-2 = 0.67 and 0.45 in grasses and forbs,

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change has various and complex effects on crop pests worldwide.
   In this review, we detail the role of the main climatic parameters
   related to temperature and precipitation changes that might have direct
   or indirect impacts on pest species. Changes in these parameters are
   likely to favour or to limit pest species, depending on their ecological
   context. On a global scale, crop pests are expected to benefit from
   current and future climate change. However, substantial differences
   appear across biomes and species. Temperate regions are generally more
   likely to face an increase in pest attacks compared with tropical
   regions. Therefore, climate change effects should be studied in the
   context of local climate and local ecological interactions across
   biomes.},

Abstract = {According to the results of 9 years of earthworm collections in soil in
   Omsk oblast from 2009 to 2018, their population has been analyzed in
   order to identify the main environmental factors associated with the
   territorial heterogeneity of species richness and group density. Five
   types of Lumbricidae populations have been identified, two of which are
   divided into two subtypes, where ten species and two subspecies of
   earthworms are found. It has been established that environmental factors
   such as zonality and subzonality; the depth of the soil layer; and, to a
   lesser extent, the topography characteristics have the greatest
   influence on the distribution of worms: 9, 7, and 0.7\% of the
   considered variance of the density similarity matrix, respectively. In
   general, all environmental factors and their combinations (modes)
   explain 38\% of the considered variance; the multiple correlation
   coefficient is 0.62. Dendrobaenaoctaedra (7-52\%) and
   Aporrectodeacaliginosa (15-74\%), alien species of European origin, and
   the native Eisenian. nordenskioldi (6-28\%) took over in terms of the
   share of the population density in most taxa of the classification, as
   well as Eiseniaventripapillata (42\%) and E. nana (16\%) of Asian
   origin, for the territories of the southern forest steppe and steppe.
   Such changes in earthworm populations, namely the replacement of native
   species of the Eisenia nordenskioldi complex with alien species, can
   significantly affect soil characteristics and ecosystem services
   determined by earthworms.},

Abstract = {The regulation of river flows by constructing hydroelectric power plants
   and dams leads to a significant transformation of the floodplain
   ecosystems downstream and their components. One way to assess the
   ecological state of natural landscapes is to determine enzymatic
   activity. However, the global literature has very little data on the
   enzymatic activity in floodplain landscapes, not only disturbed but also
   natural ones. This results mainly from the difficulties of studying
   floodplain areas, as they are highly dynamic natural objects with strong
   variations of properties and parameters, both in space and time. In this
   work, we partially fill in this gap by showing whether the activity of
   enzymes can be used to assess the ecological state of floodplain soils
   with the long-term regulation of the river flow. The Zeya River has been
   regulated by the Zeya Hydroelectric Power Station since 1975. We have
   determined the activity of enzymes (phosphatases, ureases, catalases,
   polyphenol oxidases, and peroxidases) in five types of floodplain
   landscapes: meadow on the riverine floodplain; meadow, arable land, and
   forest on the central floodplain; and a swamp in the backswamp
   depression. The high activity of phosphatase (max. up to 10 mg/g) and
   low activity of urease (max. up to 0.55 mg/g) and catalase (max. up to
   0.55 g/cm(3)) have been determined. The activities of polyphenol oxidase
   (max. up to 85 mg/100 g) and peroxidase (max. up to 290 mg/100 g),
   expressed through the humus accumulation coefficient (max. 41\%),
   indicate the average level of floodplain soil fertility. The diversity
   of enzymes has been evaluated using Pielou's index and geometric mean.
   Under the long-term regulation of the river flow, the highest levels of
   enzymatic activity have been determined for the soils under the
   floodplain forest and the lowest for arable soils. However, we have not
   identified a specific soil parameter that would reliably affect all
   enzymes. Phosphatase, urease, and catalase exhibit significant positive
   relationships with exchangeable acidity. Catalase has been characterized
   by strong positive relationships with organic matter and negative with
   pH. The data allow us to state that the long-term regulation of river
   flow leads to a decrease in the activity and diversity of enzymes.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aedes-borne viruses, yellow fever (YF), dengue, Chikungunya and Zika are
   taking a huge toll on global health as Africa faces re-emergence with
   potential for massive human catastrophe. Transmission driven by diverse
   vectors in ecological settings that range from urban to rural and
   sylvatic habitats with human and nonhuman primate/reservoir activities
   across such habitats has facilitated virus movement and spillover to
   susceptible human populations. Approved vaccine exists for YF, although
   availability for routine and mass vaccination is often constrained.
   Integrating vector surveillance, understanding disease ecology with
   rationalised vaccination in high-risk areas (YF) remains important in
   disease prevention and control. We review trends in disease occurrence
   in Africa, hinting on gaps in disease detection and management and the
   prospects for prevention and/or control.},

Title = {Genomics and genome editing techniques of crickets, an emerging model
   insect for biology and food science},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most tools available for manipulating gene function in insects have been
   developed for holometabolous species. In contrast, functional genetics
   tools for the Hemimetabola are highly underdeveloped. This is a barrier
   both to understanding ancestral insect biology, and to optimizing
   contemporary study and manipulation of particular large hemimetabolous
   orders of crucial economic and agricultural importance like the
   Orthoptera. For orthopteran insects, including crickets, the rapid
   spread of next-generation sequencing technology has made transcriptome
   data available for a wide variety of species over the past decade.
   Furthermore, whole genome sequences of orthopteran insects with
   relatively large genome sizes are now available. With these new genome
   assemblies and the development of genome editing technologies such as
   the CRISPR-Cas9 system, it has become possible to create gene knock-out
   and knock-in strains in orthopteran insects. As a result, orthopteran
   species should become increasingly feasible for laboratory study not
   only in research fields that have traditionally used insects, but also
   in agricultural fields that use them as food and feed. In this review,
   we summarize these recent advances and their relevance to such
   applications.},

Title = {Anatomical Correlates of Cursoriality are Compromised by Body Size and
   Propensity to Burrow in a Group of Small Mammals (Lagomorpha)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {464-481},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Highly cursorial animals are specialised for fast, sustained running via
   specific morphological adaptations, notably including changes in limb
   segment length and mechanical advantage. Members of the order Lagomorpha
   (hares, rabbits and pikas) vary in cursorial ability; hares are
   generally highly cursorial, rabbits more frequently saltate, and pikas
   predominantly trot. Previous investigations of lagomorphs have
   identified anatomical trends correlated with this `cursoriality
   gradient', however, the phylogenetic sampling of such investigations has
   been limited to three American species, namely the American pika
   (Ochotona princeps), brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani), and
   black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Here, we expand the
   phylogenetic sample and body size range by including novel data from
   Australian samples of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and
   European hare (L. europaeus), alongside unpublished data on the Eastern
   cottontail (S. floridanus). X-ray Computed Tomography and digital
   landmarking were used to capture proportions within the appendicular
   skeleton of similar to 40 specimens of each European species. In
   doubling the number of species studied, we find the
   previously-identified morphological gradients associated with cursorial
   behaviour are complicated when evaluated in the larger sample. The
   relative length and joint velocity of limbs was found to be lower than
   predicted in European rabbits and hares. Furthermore, we present a novel
   assessment of morphological integration in the lagomorph appendicular
   skeleton, finding between-limb covariation patterns that are generally
   similar to those of other mammals. Broadly, these results suggest
   cursoriality is only one of many selective forces driving lagomorph
   skeletal evolution, with variations in body size and fossoriality
   potentially having measurable impacts.},

Title = {The case for integrated pest management in Africa: transition from a
   pesticide-based approach},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pest management in major cropping systems has long been dominated by
   chemical pesticides in Africa. Smallholder farmers have perceived
   pesticides as insurance to protect their crops. Consumers are less aware
   of pesticide-related food-safety issues, and markets providing economic
   incentives to producers who adopt alternatives to pesticides have been
   slow to emerge. Hence, overuse of pesticides has been constantly
   increasing. Although African countries have a number of
   pesticide-related policies, they are inadequately implemented. However,
   significant investment has been made on integrated pest management (IPM)
   innovations in recent decades. Resistant cultivars, agroecological
   approaches, biological control, and biopesticides have been developed
   against key biotic constraints in major cropping systems. They have been
   adopted at several pilot sites, where significant economic and
   ecological impacts have been documented. However, concerted efforts are
   necessary to harmonize policies and regulations across the continent to
   enhance the availability, accessibility, and affordability of IPM
   innovations to smallholder farmers.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Termite genomes have been sequenced in at least five species from four
   different families. Genome-based transcriptome analyses have identified
   large numbers of protein-coding genes with caste-specific expression
   patterns. These genes include those involved in caste-specific
   morphologies and roles, for example high fecundity and longevity in
   reproductives. Some caste-specific expressed genes belong to multi-gene
   families, and their genetic architecture and expression profiles
   indicate they have evolved via tandem gene duplication. Candidate
   regulatory mechanisms of castespecific expression include epigenetic
   regulation (e.g. histone modification and non-coding RNA) and
   diversification of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements. We
   review current knowledge in the area of termite sociogenomics, focussing

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One Health (OH) has gained considerable prominence since the beginning
   of the 21st century, among others, driven by the recent epidemics and
   the increasing importance of zoonotic diseases. Yet, despite the
   holistic and multidimensional nature of OH, to date, most emphasis has
   been on the interactions between animal and human health, with
   considerably less attention to environmental and plant health. However,
   there is growing evidence that the challenges of climate change, growing
   food and nutritional insecurity, and biodiversity loss can best be
   addressed within the context of the OH framework. Conceptionally,
   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) could perfectly fit into such an
   approach, but historically, IPM has been practiced very much in a
   compartmentalized manner. New approaches such as Regenerative
   Agriculture and Sustainable Intensification offer solutions to how to

   cells. An outline for iron absorption, systemic delivery, and efflux is
   thus beginning to emerge. The proteins Malvolio, ZIP13, mitoferrin,
   ferritin, transferrin, and IRP-1A are key players in these processes.
   While many features are shared with those in mammals, some physiological
   differences may also exist. Notable remaining questions include the
   existence and identification of functional transferrin and ferritin
   receptors, and of an iron exporter like ferroportin, how systemic iron
   homeostasis is controlled, and the roles of different tissues in
   regulating iron physiology. By focusing on aspects of iron trafficking,
   this review updates on presently known complexities of iron homeostasis
   in Drosophila.},

Title = {New records of pollen tube shower in species of Bertolonia
   (Melastomataceae) suggest that autogamy may be the rule in the genus},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that Bertolonia
   (Melastomataceae), an endemic genus to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   (AF) with 35 species, presents a strong correlation regarding species
   distribution and some floral traits. The same analyses showed that all
   species belong to three clades: marmorata (species mostly distributed in
   northern AF), formosa (species only occurring in central AF), and
   nymphaeifolia (species mostly distributed in southern AF). A rare
   delayed selfing mechanism, the pollen tube shower (PTS), was recently
   described for two species in the nymphaeifolia Glade; however, this
   mechanism may also be prevalent in species of the other clades. Here, we
   investigated the potential occurrence of PTS in two other species of the
   genus: B. violacea (marmorata Glade) and B. acuminata (nymphaeifolia
   Glade). We also investigated species, as well as herbarium specimens,
   searching for potential evidence of floral traits that could suggest the
   presence of an autonomous selfing mechanism in other Bertolonia species.
   Both B. violacea and B. acuminata produced seeds through PTS. We also
   observed the occurrence of PTS in two exsiccates from two different
   species: B. maculata (marmorata Glade) and Bertolonia sp. Taxonomic data
   across all clades of the genus indicate the absence of herkogamy,
   presence of post-anthesis petal closure and corolla persistence on the
   floral receptacle, all traits associated with the occurrence of PTS. We
   present here empirical evidence and descriptions of floral traits that
   indicate that the genus Bertolonia is predominantly autogamous, an
   uncommon characteristic in Melastomataceae.},

Title = {Bite Force Performance from wild Derived mice has Undetectable
   Heritability Despite Having Heritable Morphological Components},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},

Volume = {49},

Pages = {434-448},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fitness-related traits tend to have low heritabilities. Conversely,
   morphology tends to be highly heritable. Yet, many fitness-related
   performance traits such as running speed or bite force depend critically
   on morphology. Craniofacial morphology correlates with bite performance
   in several groups including rodents. However, within species, this
   relationship is less clear, and the genetics of performance, morphology
   and function are rarely analyzed in combination. Here, we use a half-sib
   design in outbred wild-derived Mus musculus to study the morphology-bite
   force relationship and determine whether there is additive genetic
   (co-)variance for these traits. Results suggest that bite force has
   undetectable additive genetic variance and heritability in this sample,
   while morphological traits related mechanically to bite force exhibit
   varying levels of heritability. The most heritable traits include the
   length of the mandible which relates to bite force. Despite its
   correlation with morphology, realized bite force was not heritable,
   which suggests it is less responsive to selection in comparison to its
   morphological determinants. We explain this paradox with a non-additive,
   many-to-one mapping hypothesis of heritable change in complex traits. We
   furthermore propose that performance traits could evolve if pleiotropic
   relationships among the determining traits are modified.},

Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mechanisms and evolution of primary axis specification in insects are
   discussed in the context of the roles of beta-catenin and TCF in
   polarizing metazoan embryos. Three hypotheses are presented. First,
   insects with sequential segmentation and posterior growth use
   cell-autonomous mechanisms for establishing embryo polarity via the
   nuclear ratio of beta-catenin and TCF. Second, TCF homologs establish
   competence for anterior specification. Third, the evolution of
   simultaneous segmentation mechanisms, also known as long-germ
   development, resulted in primary axis specification mechanisms that are
   independent of beta-catenin but reliant on TCF, a condition that
   preceded the frequent replacement of anterior determinants in long germ
   insects.},

Abstract = {Global pest invasions have significantly increased in recent years.
   These invasions together with climate warming directly impact
   agriculture. Tropical climates feature extreme weather events, including
   high temperatures and seasonal droughts. Thus, successful invasive pests
   in tropics have to adapt to these extreme climate features. The
   intrinsic factors relevant to tropical invasion of insects have been
   explored in many studies, but the knowledge is rather dispersed in
   contemporary literature. Here, we reviewed the potential biophysical
   characters of successful invasive pests' adaption to tropical
   environments including {[}1] inherent high basal stress tolerance and
   advanced life-history performances {[}2], phenotypic plasticity {[}3],
   rapid evolution to environmental stress, polyphagy, diverse reproductive
   strategies and high fecundity. We summarised how these traits and their
   interactive effects enhance pest invasions in the tropics. Comprehensive
   understanding of how these characters facilitate invasion improves
   models for predicting ecological consequences of climate change on
   invasive pest species for improved pest management.},

Title = {Tripartite interactions: how immunity, microbiota and pathogens interact
   and affect pathogen virulence evolution},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The bipartite interactions betweeninsect hosts and their bacterial gut
   microbiota, or their bacterial pathogens, are empirically and
   theoretically well-explored. However, direct, and indirect tripartite
   interactions will also likely occur inside a host. These interactions
   will almost certainly affect the trajectory of pathogen virulence
   evolution, an area that is currently under researched. The interactions
   within tripartite associations can be competitive, that is,
   exploitative-competition, interference-competition or
   apparent-competition. Competitive interactions will be significantly
   influenced by non-competitive effects, for example, immunopathology,
   immunosuppression, and microbiotamediated tolerance. Considering a
   combination of these interactions and effects, will enable an increased
   understanding of the evolution of pathogen virulence. This new
   perspective allows us to identify several novel research questions,
   which we hope will be a useful framework for future research.},

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Scilla s.l. is taxonomically one of the most problematic genera of the
   Asparagaceae. Within the last few decades, several genera were
   segregated from this genus; however, there is still no consensus on the
   taxonomic status of Scilla segregates. Although some previous studies
   indicated a polyphyletic origin for the genus Scilla, there has been no
   comprehensive phylogenetic study focusing on the entire complex
   including Chionodoxa, Prospero, Puschkinia, and the recently described
   Gemicia. To achieve this, we evaluated three plastid regions, namely
   rbcL, trnL-F, and matK, for 79 accessions. The monophyly of Puschkinia
   and Prospero was supported by our phylogenetic analyses; however,
   Chionodoxa and Gemicia were placed into a clade with representatives of
   the S. bifolia species group. While our divergence time estimation
   analysis indicated a Miocene origin for all studied genera of
   polyphyletic Scilla s.l., the results of our ancestral area and
   ancestral state analyses showed that Scilla, Prospero, Chionodoxa, and
   Puschkinia, together with Brimeura Salisb., Bellevalia, Hyacinthella,
   and Alrawia, probably had a most recent common ancestor without a
   perianth tube and a corona, and with a non-papillate testa surface,
   which evolved about 36 Ma in the Mediterranean region.},

Title = {How does IPM 3.0 look like (and why do we need it in Africa)?},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was introduced sixty
   years ago to curb the overuse of agricultural pesticides, whereby its
   simplest version (IPM 1.0) was aiming at reducing the frequency of
   applications. Gradually, agro-ecological principles, such as biological
   control and habitat management, were included in IPM 2.0. However,
   throughout this time, smallholder farmers did not improve their decision
   -making skills and continue to use hazardous pesticides as their first
   control option. We are therefore proposing a new paradigm - IPM 3.0 -
   anchored on 3 pillars: 1) real-time farmer access to decision-making, 2)
   pest-management options relying on science-driven and nature-based
   approaches, and 3) the integration of genomic approaches, biopesticides,
   and habitat -management practices. We are convinced that this new
   paradigm based on technological advances, involvement of youth,
   gender-responsiveness, and climate resilience will be a game changer.
   However, this can only become effective through redeployment of public
   funding and stronger policy support.},

Abstract = {Preventing infections is crucial for host fitness and many insects
   modify their behaviour upon sensing a contagion. We review chemical cues
   that mediate insect behaviour in response to parasites, and diseased or
   dead conspecifics. Considering the large diversity of behavioural
   disease defences described, surprisingly little is known about
   disease-associated cues that mediate them, especially their
   chemoreceptor and neuronal details. Interestingly, disease cues do not
   only modify host behaviour, but they could also play a direct role in
   immune system activation via neuroendocrine regulation, bypassing the
   need for risky immunological contact with the parasite. Such crosstalk
   is an exciting emerging research area in insect ecological immunology
   that should prove invaluable in studying host-parasite interactions by
   combining analytical methods from chemical ecology.},

Title = {The neural basis of interspecies interactions in insects},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As insects move through the world, they continuously engage in
   behavioral interactions with other species. These interactions take on a
   spectrum of forms, from inconsequential encounters to predation,
   defense, and specialized symbiotic partnerships. All such interactions
   rely on sensorimotor pathways that carry out efficient categorization of
   different organisms and enact behaviors that cross species boundaries.
   Despite the universality of interspecies interactions, how insect brains
   perceive and process salient features of other species remains
   unexplored. Here, we present an overview of major questions concerning
   the neurobiology and evolution of behavioral interactions between
   species, providing a framework for future research on this critical role
   of the insect nervous system.},

Title = {Measuring and modelling crop yield losses due to invasive insect pests
   under climate change},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change and agriculture are strongly correlated, and the fast
   pace of climate change will have impacts on agroecosystems and crop
   productivity. This review summarizes potential impacts of rising
   temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on insect pest-crop
   interactions and provides two-way approaches for integrating these
   impacts into crop models for sustainable pest management strategies
   designing. Rising temperatures and CO2 levels affect insect physiology,
   accelerate their metabolism and increase their consumption, ultimately
   increasing population densities, which result in greater crop injury and
   damage, and yield loss. Whereas these direct effects are empirically
   demonstrated for temperature rises, they are less straightforward for
   CO2 increases. Furthermore, indirect effects of rising temperatures and
   CO2 levels remain largely unexploited and therefore unknown. Coupling
   insect pests and crops using a two-way feedback system model, whereby
   pest variables drive crop variables and vice versa, will improve
   analysis and forecasting of yield losses to better guide preparedness
   and intervention strategies.},

Abstract = {The Halocnemeta strobilacei formation in the Caspian Lowland is
   represented in European Russia by four classes of associations and 14
   associations. Communities of Halocnemum strobilaceum are common in the
   desert and steppe zones have different species compositions and occupy
   different areas. Coenoses belonging to the Halocnemeta strobilacei pura
   classes of association are the most widespread. Communities of the
   following two class of associations are also typical for the study area:
   Halocnemeta strobilacei halosuf-fruticulosa and Halocnemeta strobilacei
   annulosa. Communities of another classes of association, Halocnemeta
   strobilacei graminosa occur rarely. Monodominant communities are
   confined to soils with high concentrations of chloride ions (Cl-). Soils
   under bidominant coenoses, in addition to chloride ions (Cl-), also
   feature high concentrations of natrium (Na+) and sulfate (SO42-) ions.},

Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Abstract = {Satellite DNA is a class of tandemly repetitive sequences characterized
   by rapid evolution and high intra- and inter-specific diversification
   and is usually the major component of the constitutive heterochromatin.
   We investigated the abundance of the satDNA in 77 species of Asclepias
   from Americas, a genus of the Apocynaceae family. De novo identification
   of the most abundant satDNA sequences was performed using Tandem Repeat
   Analyzer and Repeat Explorer pipelines. The abundance of satDNA in 77
   species was determined using mapping reads, and the correlation between
   the abundance of satDNAs and clades on the phylogeny tree was estimated
   by lambda statistics using phytools R package. The repetitive sequences
   in Asclepias were mostly constitutive by transposable elements, ranged
   11.11 to 16.32\%. The satDNA ranged 0.985 to 7.732\% and we obtained 12
   satDNA sequences (call Sat1 to Sat12), being for the Sat1 we obtained
   seven families distributed across all species. The Sat2, Sat3, and
   families of Sat1 showed significant correlations with the topologies of
   the phylogenetic tree, among which some families of satDNAs displayed
   varying abundances across the main clades. We concluded that Asclepias
   is characterized by many satDNAs, and that the abundance of satDNAs is
   in accordance with the phylogeny and geographical distribution.},

Title = {Flower morphology and phylogenetic analysis of some Dioscorea species of
   the section Stenophora (Dioscoreaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The section Stenophora is the most basal clade in the phylogeny of the
   genus Dioscorea. Most of the species in the section have not been
   morphologically and embryologically investigated and phylogenetic
   relationships among species of this section are not very clear.
   Embryological features, such as the structure of anthers, pollen,
   ovules, embryo sacs etc., less undergo phenotypic variability and can be
   used as important characters for systematics and phylogeny. Comparative
   morphological and embryological analyses of the reproductive structures
   in 5 Dioscorea species of the section Stenophora (D. balcanica, D.
   caucasica, D. deltoidea, D. nipponica, D. villosa) are presented. Four
   characters, which may be significant for systematics of this section as
   well as the whole genus Dioscorea, were designated: (1) heteromorphism
   of the stamens in the male flower; (2) the structure of the stigma; (3)
   the structure of the ovule; (4) the type of female gametophyte
   development. It was shown that D. balcanica, D. caucasica, D. deltoidea
   are characterized by similar morphological features and differ from D.
   nipponica and D. villosa. Analysis of haplotype networks showed that the
   section Stenophora consists of genetically close species, that was
   confirmed by the phylogenetic tree of this section. The morphological
   similarity of D. balcanica, D. caucasica and D. deltoidea is consistent
   with their location on the phylogenetic tree. However, detailed
   morphological, embryological and molecular phylogenetic studies of a
   larger number of species are needed for more accurate interpretation of
   the Stenophora phylogenetic system.},

Abstract = {Several floral traits in Papilionoideae (Fabaceae) have been correlated
   to certain pollination mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
   20 qualitative and 21 quantitative floral traits of 17 species of
   Papilionoideae with keel flowers from various tribes and genera native
   to Salta, Argentina, which are representative of the four general
   pollination mechanisms described for the subfamily. We performed field
   and laboratory studies, including description of morphology,
   micro-morphology, position, size, and synorganization of all floral
   organs. Correlation between floral traits and a particular pollination
   mechanism was evaluated through a principal component analysis (PCA).
   According to our results, species with the same pollination mechanism
   share similar qualitative and quantitative traits, the latter being the
   most relevant, according to our statistical analysis.},

Title = {A pentaploid endosperm and a Penaea-type embryo sac are likely
   synapomorphies of Azorella (Apiaceae, Azorelloideae)},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {About 80\% of angiosperms form a monosporic Polygonum-type embryo sac,
   whereas in the remaining species, eleven other types of embryo sac are
   found. Evidence as to the type of embryo sac is lacking for many plant
   species, and the role of higher-ploidy endosperm is unknown. In contrast
   to the rest of the Apiaceae, where a Polygonum-type embryo sac (3n
   endosperm) has been reported, the few species of the Azorelloideae
   studied to form a Drusa-type embryo sac (3n endosperm) or a Penaea-type
   embryo sac (5n endosperm). This variation within Azorelloideae makes
   this subfamily, and its genus Azorella in particular, a good candidate
   for studying the evolutionary importance of the embryo sac and endosperm
   in diversification. We studied the variation in the type of embryo sac
   and the ploidy level of the endosperm in Andean-Patagonian Azorella and
   closely related Pozoa on a sample of 101 individuals from 31 populations
   of 21 species. We employed flow cytometric seed screening and calibrated
   the results of ploidy level estimation against embryological
   observations. In addition, we examined the genome size variation of the
   species sampled. All species of Azorella formed Penaea-type embryo sacs
   and a pentaploid endosperm, whereas one species of Pozoa formed triploid
   and the other tetraploid endosperms. Variations in the type of embryo
   sac and endosperm ploidy have probably shaped the evolution of the
   different lineages of Azorelloideae in the southern Andes. A Penaea-type
   embryo sac, which represents a likely synapomorphy of Azorella, is a
   feature of underestimated significance in the evolution of angiosperms.},

Title = {Transposable element repression using piRNAs, and its relevance to
   endogenous viral elements (EVEs) and immunity in insects},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The piRNA system controls transposable element (TE) mobility by
   transcriptional gene silencing and post-transcriptional gene silencing.
   Dispersed in insect genomes, piRNA clusters contain TE copies, from
   which they produce piRNAs (specific small RNAs). These piRNAs can both
   target the nascent transcripts produced by active TE copies and directly
   repress them by heterochromatinization. They can also target mature
   transcripts and cleave them following amplification by the so-called
   `ping-pong' loop mechanism.
   Moreover, piRNA clusters contain endogenous viral elements (EVEs), from
   which they produce piRNAs. The current idea is that these piRNAs could
   participate in the antiviral response against exogenous viral infection.
   In this review, we show that among insects, to date, this antiviral
   response by the piRNA system appears mainly restricted to mosquitoes,
   but this could be due to the focus of most studies on arboviruses.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},

Abstract = {While traditional scaling for integrated pest management (IPM) in Africa
   requires the movement of expert trainers from village to village, these
   efforts are often costly, time-inefficient, hampered by distance, and
   became impossible under COVID-19's movement restrictions (despite
   tremendously increased public need for IPM-scaling knowledge). One
   solution to this dilemma is IPM-scaling, usable by a diversity of
   development actors expending limited or few resources, to deliver
   critical information to large numbers of people with systems-approach
   information and communication technologies. This paper describes one
   such systems-approach scaling platform, Scientific Animations Without
   Borders, which effectively elicited end-user solution-adoption and
   decreased unit costs over increasing scales in three African countries
   during COVID-19. How to scale game-changing IPM insights `off the shelf'
   and `into people's hands in the field' is also discussed.},

Abstract = {Insect invasions of new territories cause problems globally for
   agriculture. The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is a
   polyphagous, multivoltine tropical species that has greatly expanded its
   geographic distribution from its native origin. The first detections of
   C. capitata in the Neotropical region were recorded in South America,
   followed by several locations in Central America. Here, we review the
   historical invasion of Medfly in the Neotropics, discussing possible
   invasion pathways and the biological and economic aspects that support
   its successful invasions. We highlighted the prevention and management
   strategies for this pest and discussed the perspective for public
   policies covering bio-invasions in the region.},

Abstract = {Metals and organic contaminants in aquatic systems affect the coupling
   of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through two pathways:
   contaminant-induced effects on insect emergence and emergence-induced
   contaminant transfer. Consequently, the impact of aquatic contaminants
   on terrestrial ecosystems can be driven by modifications in the quantity
   and quality of adult aquatic insects serving as prey or contaminants
   entering terrestrial food webs as part of the diet of terrestrial
   predators. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in the field,
   separating metals from organic contaminants due to their differential
   propensity to bioaccumulate and thus their potential contribution to
   either of the two pathways. Finally, this review highlights the
   knowledge gap in the relative impact of these pathways on terrestrial

   The genomes of over 20 aphid species have been sequenced, and
   comparative genomic analyses have revealed pervasive gene duplication
   and dynamic chromosomal rearrangements. Over 120 symbiont genomes (both
   obligate and facultative) have been sequenced, and modern
   deep-sequencing technologies have identified novel symbionts. The

Abstract = {Social parasitism describes a fascinating way of life in which species
   exploit the altruistic behaviour of closely related, social species.
   Social parasites have repeatedly evolved in the social Hymenoptera,
   including ants, bees, and wasps. The common ancestry and shared (social)
   environment with their hosts facilitates the study of molecular
   adaptations to the parasitic lifestyle. Moreover, when social parasites
   are widespread and virulent, they exert strong selection pressure on
   their hosts, leading to the evolution of defense mechanisms and
   triggering a coevolutionary arms race. Recent advances in sequencing
   technology now make it possible to study the molecular basis of this
   coevolutionary process. In addition to describing the latest
   developments, we highlight open research questions that could be tackled
   with genomic, transcriptomic, or epigenetic data.},

Abstract = {Germ plasm is a substance capable of driving naive cells toward the germ
   cell fate. Germ plasm has had multiple independent origins, and takes on
   diverse forms and functions throughout animals, including in insects. We
   describe here recent advances in the understanding of the evolution of
   germ plasm in insects. A major theme that has emerged is the complex and
   convoluted interactions of germ plasm with symbiotic bacteria within the
   germline, including at the very origin of oskar, the gene required for
   assembling germ plasm in insects. Major advancements have also been made
   in understanding the basic molecular arrangement of germ plasm in
   insects. These advances demonstrate that further analysis of insect germ
   plasm will be fruitful in illuminating diverse aspects of evolutionary
   and developmental biology.},

Title = {Vector microbiota and immunity: modulating arthropod susceptibility to
   vertebrate pathogens},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Arthropods, including mosquitoes, sand flies, tsetse flies, and ticks
   are vectors of many bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens that cause
   serious disease in humans and animals. Their microbiota, that is, all
   microorganisms that dwell within their tissues, can impact vector
   immunity and susceptibility to pathogen infection. Historically,
   host-pathogen-microbiota interactions have not been well described, with
   little known about mechanism. In this review, we highlight recent
   advances in understanding how individual microorganisms and microbial
   communities interact with vectors and human pathogens, the mechanisms
   they utilize to achieve these effects, and the potential for exploiting
   these interactions to control pathogen transmission. These studies fill
   important knowledge gaps and further our understanding of the roles that
   the vector microbiota plays in pathogen transmission.},

Abstract = {Benthic macroinvertebrates can provide an integrated picture of
   environmental changes. Health of freshwaters can be assessed based on
   measured changes in the ecological structure of benthic

   nine components (T degrees C, EC, TDS, BOD5, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, PO4-P
   and CI-) account for 92\% of the total variance among the water quality
   parameters. As a result of the UPGMA analysis, the highest similarity
   value was observed between the 1th and 2nd sampling points. SI, BMWP,
   ASPT and BBI indices were more proper than FBI index to determine the
   water quality of Ilke Stream. The results indicate that these indices
   should be adapted based on the ecological, geomorphological and

Title = {What can genetics tell us about the history of a human-mediated
   introduction of the golden-striped salamander south of its native range?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The golden-striped salamander is a streamside species endemic to the
   northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula. In the first half of the
   twentieth century, an undisclosed number of individuals of this species
   were reportedly captured in Bucaco, Central Portugal, and deliberately
   introduced in Sintra Mountains, 170 km south of its native distribution
   range. The discovery of a breeding population of this salamander in
   Sintra during 2015 prompted this work: we used neutral genetic markers,
   the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (cytb), and seven microsatellite loci
   to elucidate on the relict/human-introduced nature of Sintra population,
   identify the potential source population, and infer the severity of
   founder effect. Our results support a human-mediated introduction.
   First, sequencing analysis of cytb showed the presence of a unique
   haplotype (h31) in Sintra, which was detected only in Bucaco and in two
   additional populations located close to Mondego river. Second,
   microsatellite analysis showed that Sintra is more closely related to
   populations in between Douro and Mondego rivers (Central Portugal),
   instead of its geographically closest populations (southernmost), as
   would be expected if Sintra was a relict population isolated in an
   interglacial refuge. Third, Sintra presents both reduced levels of
   genetic variability and effective population size when compared to
   native populations, particularly to those of Central Portugal.
   Consistent with an isolated population funded by a small number of
   individuals (inferred herein to be ca. 10-11 salamanders), Sintra forms
   a geographically coherent genetic unit that is significantly
   differentiated from the extant native C. lusitanica populations.
   Although our data provide supporting evidence for Bucaco as a likely
   source population, as documented in the literature, overall, we cannot
   unequivocally exclude other populations close to Mondego river as a
   potential source of the introduced individuals in Sintra.},

Abstract = {The presented ecological and economic assessment of agricultural land in
   the Republic of Tyva was developed taking into account the theoretical
   foundations of the economic assessment of the cost of land and the
   methods for valuation of environmentally significant factors. According
   to the agricultural and natural-economic zoning of the East Siberian
   region, the Republic of Tyva is assigned to the steppe sheep-breeding
   and cattle-breeding zone. For the purpose of a more rational
   distribution and scientifically based specialization of agricultural
   production, the territory of Tuva is divided into four agricultural
   zones (Economics of the Tuva ASSR, 1973). The agricultural lands of the
   study area are included in the Central agricultural zone, mainly
   agricultural subtaiga, livestock-grain steppe and in the mainly
   livestock-grain Western agricultural zone. These are the largest,
   developed and densely populated parts of the republic, where most of the
   arable land, two-thirds of the hayfields and pastures, and more than
   80\% of the population of the republic are concentrated. Territories of
   agricultural lands are located within the dry-steppe, steppe and
   forest-steppe natural and climatic zones. The climate is characterized
   by the highest degree of aridity. The main types of soils on arable land
   are chestnut sandy loamy soils that are subject to wind erosion (60\%),
   chernozems (23\%), and alluvial soddy soils (15\%). The performed
   assessment shows that the total damage from soil degradation for the
   Central and Western agricultural zones of the republic is estimated at
   more than 3.5 bln rubles, which is about one-third of the cost of
   agricultural land of the republic. A decrease in the cost of land for
   the period from 2012 to 2017 was revealed for the Tandinskii (54.1\%)
   and Chedi-Kholskii districts (47.2\%), which is due to soil degradation.},

Title = {Viable forecasting monthly weather data using time series methods},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The main object of the research was to assess the forecast values of the
   weather parameters by using three-time series methods such as
   Decomposition of time series, Autoregressive (AR) model with seasonal
   dummies and Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) /Autoregressive
   Integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. A recent phenomenon in weather
   changing has disturbed the world in general and Pakistan in particular.
   In Pakistan due to climate change, flood and heat stroke have taken many
   lives. Stationarity was measured through the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
   test; results showed that some variables are I(0) and some are I(1). The
   reliability of the forecast results was examined through the goodness of
   fit test. For finding the best fit model, the performance measures of
   various models: Root Mean Squire Error, Mean Absolute Error and Mean
   Absolute Percentage Error were considered. The model in which the above
   statistics are the minimum was chosen as the appropriate model. After
   model analysis and validation, it was observed that AR-model with
   seasonal dummies was found to be the best fit model between the three
   models. Meanwhile, the forecasting for the period Jan.2018 to Dec.2018
   was made based on the best fit model. Given the future forecasting
   results, the temperature will be normal at selected stations. The wind
   and rainfall will also be present. Overall, it was suggested that the
   obtained findings of meteorological stations' weather might be normal
   for the coming few months over there, and no chance of heatstroke and
   flood might be expected. Future studies must be carried out to provide
   the awareness to well-being regarding ecological hazardous to minimize
   their economic loss through mass media.},

Title = {Plant phylogeography of the Balkan Peninsula: spatiotemporal patterns
   and processes},
Journal = {PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Balkan Peninsula is widely acknowledged as one of the centers of
   European biodiversity and a major glacial refugium for plant species.
   Its extensive geographic heterogeneity and diverse mosaic of habitats,
   coupled with relatively high environmental stability over long periods,
   have enabled the diversification of lineages and simultaneously fostered
   the long-term survival of diverse species. The increasing number of
   phylogeographically studied plant species in the region has
   substantially contributed to a better understanding of the relationships
   among closely related taxa and provides significant insights into
   intraspecific lineage differentiation. The present paper reviews the
   current knowledge on plant phylogeography in the Balkan Peninsula. By
   providing an updated overview of the most recent studies dealing with
   the diversity and evolution of Balkan plants, we explore the
   phylogeographic patterns and roles of refugia in structuring genetic
   diversity and highlight the crucial evolutionary processes that shaped
   the diversity of plants in the region. Molecular clock-based estimations
   highlight the importance of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations across
   taxonomic groups and lineage distribution patterns corroborate the
   persistence of multiple glacial refugia. Spatial congruence in
   phylogeographic splits is determined and discussed. An examination of
   phylogeographic connections with adjacent regions (i.e., the Alps,
   Apennine Peninsula, Asia Minor, Carpathians, and central Europe)
   uncovers several consistent patterns. Additionally, allopatric and
   ecological speciation, polyploidy, and hybridization are identified as
   crucial evolutionary mechanisms acting in the Balkan Peninsula and
   shaping species diversity. Furthermore, the existing research gaps are
   identified and future approaches with the potential to better understand
   the unique Balkan flora are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a multifactorial disease that can lead
   to the development of neurological diseases. To correct violations of
   physiological functions, anti-inflammatory cytokines are used, in
   particular, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The aim of this work
   is to evaluate the effectiveness of the rIL-1RA preparation for the
   correction of post-traumatic neuroinflammation. TBI in rats was
   simulated by dropping a 115 g weight from a height of 120 cm into the
   center of the parietal region, and the drug was injected subcutaneously
   at a dose of 50 mg/kg 60 min after injury. We studied blood
   corticosterone levels and behavioral responses in the ``Open field{''}
   test. To characterize the activation pattern of microglia in different
   parts of the brain, the expression of the Iba1 marker and morphological
   changes of cells were evaluated. Counting the total number and changing
   the shape and size of Iba1-positive microglial cells on 7th day after
   TBI showed that in animals treated with rIL-1RA the number of activated
   microglial cells was significantly higher than in intact animals, but
   the degree of their activation was significantly lower. Studies of CNS
   function disorders after TBI showed that motor and
   orientation-exploratory activities were significantly inhibited, which,
   together with the disturbance of the emotional status of the animals,
   indicates the development of a neurological deficit in intact rats. In
   animals treated with rIL-1RA, changes in behavioral characteristics were
   less pronounced. The decrease in neurological deficit in treated animals
   was directly related to the normalization of the state of microglia. The
   data obtained in the work indicate that the use of rIL-1RA 1 h after TBI
   allows correction of motor, orientation-exploratory activity and reduce
   microglia activation in different parts of the CNS.},

Abstract = {Early changes in the cardiovascular system of young Wistar rats were
   studied in modeling metabolic syndrome by a fructose load. It was found
   that despite some weight loss in rats fed a fructose diet, as compared
   to control animals, these animals showed the signs of metabolic
   syndrome: hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased
   activity of the sympathetic nervous system, arterial hypertension.
   Changes in the mesenteric arteries included an increase in the
   reactivity to phenylephrine and a decrease in acetylcholine-induced
   dilation due to decreased NO production by the endothelium, which is to
   a certain extent compensated by an increased production of the
   endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor realizing its effects through
   the activation of intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels.
   Fructose load led to the inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase in
   arterial smooth muscle cells. In the skin microcirculatory bed of
   fructose-loaded rats, perfusion remained at the level typical for
   control animals, while skin microvessels showed an increase in
   neurogenic tone and an attenuation of endothelium-dependent tone. A
   decreased endothelial NO production was found in microcirculatory
   vessels, which was compensated by the synthesis of other
   endothelium-derived vasodilating factors.},

Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan is very rich in bulbous plants. In general, the group of
   ephemeroids in Kyrgyzstan is widely represented and belongs to different
   taxa (families, genera, and species). This article discusses the current
   state of tulips on the northern macroslope of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too. Strong
   polymorphism, frequent hybridizations, especially among tulips, as well
   as a change in the color of flowers during drying of the herbarium, make
   the scientific identification of individual species quite difficult.
   This article presents the results of initial research and the annual
   regime of conservation of the tulip population in the eastern part of
   the Kyrgyz Ala-Too. According to the data we obtained, tulips are
   sensitive to the reserved regime. Vegetation monitoring was carried out
   on test plots, which were established in 2019, as well as on control
   plots. All trial sites are of the same dimension (10 x 10 m(2)). For
   semi-stationary monitoring, five test sites were allocated and they were
   fenced with chain-link mesh to protect against livestock. To carry out
   comparative characteristics and identify the stage of demutation of test
   sites, monitoring of ten control test sites was carried out in adjacent
   identical territories. The number of wild tulips in the fenced trial
   plots of 1 year ago is much higher than in the control plots. The
   protected regime for 1 year had a favorable effect on the vegetation
   cover of the mid-mountain altitudinal zone. In a short period of time, a
   demutation stage is observed for the entire floristic composition of the
   communities. The short-term (1 year) reserve regime had a positive
   effect on the floristic composition of communities, the projective cover
   of the herbage, an increase in the abundance of wild tulips, and
   contributed to the accumulation of steppe felt.},

Title = {Ungulates of the Arid Ecosystems from the Red Data Book of the Russian
   Federation},
Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {432-440},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the past 100 years, the biodiversity of our planet has declined
   dramatically. To date, more than 142 500 species of animals have been
   included in the Red List of The World Conservation Union and about 40
   000 of them are threatened with extinction (The IUCN horizontal ellipsis
   , 2022). Red Data Books of various levels are documents that keep
   records of rare and endangered species with an indication of their past
   and present distribution, reproduction features, and protection measures
   already taken and those necessary in the future. They act as a formal
   legal basis for the establishment of a special regime of protection in
   relation to these objects. The new edition of the Red Data Book of the
   Russian Federation (2021) includes four species of ungulates that are
   significant in the biocenoses of steppes and deserts. Two of them are no
   longer found in the wild in Russia: Przewalski's horse (Equus
   przewalskii Poljakov, 1881) is extinct in Russia since the 19th century
   and the onager (Equus hemionus Pallas, 1775) since the beginning of the
   20th century. The state of populations of other two species, the saiga
   (Saiga tatarica Linnaeus, 1766) and the Mongolian gazelle or the dzeren
   (Procapra gutturosa Pallas, 1777), causes serious concern. The loss of
   members of this group from the ecosystems will not only reduce the
   biodiversity of arid biomes, but may also lead to their degradation. The
   last time the onager was seen on the territory of Russia in
   Transbaikalia was in 1926. For almost 20 years there have been
   discussions about its reintroduction in Dauria and the Northwestern
   Caspian region, however, the lack of a full-scale scientific research
   may make this initiative to be risky in all aspects. The northern
   boundary of the Mongolian gazelle range passes the territory of Russia.
   However, the number and state of its population in Russia largely
   depends on the state of its population in the territory of Mongolia.
   After the complete disappearance of the species in the 1970s-1980s in
   Altai, Tuva, and Transbaikalia, dzeren population began to recover in
   the 1990s, due to the increase of its North-Kerulen population in
   Mongolia: resuming of winter migrations to the territory of Southeastern
   Transbaikalia, favorable natural conditions, and effective protection of
   the species on the territories of two nature biosphere reserves, Daursky
   and Sokhondo, and the federal zakaznik (nature refuge) Dzeren Valley,
   contributed to the formation of a number of sedentary groups of these
   ungulates (Kirilyuk and Lushchekina, 2017). Now, the total number of the
   species in Russia is about 20 000 individuals (Kirilyuk, 2021). It is
   the first time for the saiga to be listed in the Red Data Book. In the
   1980s, its numbers did not cause any concern: the species amounted to
   about 400 000 individuals. However, overhunting, intensive development
   of agriculture, reduction of suitable habitats, the economic crisis in
   the country, poaching, and temporary suspension of the nature protection
   activities led to a sharp decrease in the saiga population in the
   Northwestern Caspian region. In 2015 the population number was only
   4000-5000 individuals (Karimova and Lushchekina, 2018). Until relatively
   recently, all three species were considered commercial. However,
   environmentally unfriendly forms of economic development of arid
   territories (plowing and land reclamation, overgrazing, construction of
   roads and other technical structures without taking into account
   regional features, etc.
   ) directly or indirectly contributed to the reduction of the ranges of
   the species and disruption of their seasonal migrations and spatial
   structure. All these resulted in population decrease, increasing their
   vulnerability to abnormal weather conditions (heavy snowfall, droughts,
   fires, etc.) and the pressure of legal and illegal hunting. The future
   of these unique animals depends, first of all, on man and his (our)
   attitude to the natural environment. Their well being should be
   facilitated by the implementation of measures developed by specialists
   and listed both in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and in
   approved specific strategies.},

Abstract = {The effect of Ni2+, a T-type low-threshold calcium channel (T-VDCC) and
   Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) blocker, on cardiac and respiratory rhythm
   parameters was studied in newborn rats aged 3-16 days (P3-16). A
   distinct age dependence of the intensity of the arrhythmogenic effect
   evoked by calcium channel blockade was found. In 3-day-old rats injected
   with NiCl2 at a dose of 109 mg/kg (ED100), a transient atypical heart
   rhythm, representing the alternating periods of moderate bradycardia
   with a pathologically slow (up to 20-60 bpm) heart rhythm, occurs in
   100\% of animals. In parallel, a pronounced respiratory system
   dysfunction with burst breathing develops. This symptom complex occurs
   in 75\% of 10-14-day-old rats and is completely absent in 15-16-day-old
   animals. Phenomenologically similar heart rhythm disorders are observed
   in newborn rats after NiCl2 injection, during poisoning with
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and upon activation of the central
   N-cholinergic structures. The obtained data suggest that in the early
   period of rat postnatal ontogenesis, impaired mechanisms of calcium
   metabolism may play a certain role in the development of arrhythmogenic
   disorders.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of the lymph transport system affects not only the
   balance of the interstitial fluid, but also other aspects of
   homeostasis. Lymph transport from the interstitial space to the main
   veins is mainly provided by rhythmic contractions of the lymphatic
   vascular segments, lymphangions. Meanwhile, the lymphatic vascular
   network sequentially incorporates the lymph nodes whose role in lymph
   transport is poorly understood. The aims of this work were to study the
   length-tension ratio in the bull mesenteric lymph node capsule and to
   calculate the pressure the lymph nodes are able to generate, as well as
   to compare the active and passive mechanical characteristics of the
   lymph node capsule in young and aging bulls. Experiments on isolated
   lymph node capsules have shown that lymph nodes are highly extensible
   structures, which allows them to fill readily with lymph even at the
   peak of lymph formation. Our data show that the bull mesenteric lymph
   nodes share the ability to regulate lymph flow along them via the
   intrinsic mechanisms. Smooth muscle cells in the lymph node capsule are
   sensitive to stretching, as manifested in an increase in the strength of
   contractions with an increase in capsule stretching. Lymph nodes are
   able to generate high active pressure with a significant increase in
   volume and passive pressure. The extensibility of the lymph node capsule
   and the active pressure developed by the nodes during spontaneous
   contractions decline in aging vs. young bulls. Thus, we provide here the
   first measurements and analysis of the capsular length-tension and
   nodular diameter-pressure ratios in the mesenteric lymph nodes of young
   and aging bulls.},

Title = {Registration of Changes in the Level of Extracellular Dopamine in the

   the Zone of the Ventral Tegmental Area, Which Also Caused a
   Self-Stimulation},

Abstract = {The aim of the work was to establish the possibility of using fast-scan
   cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) method of recording of dopamine release in the
   nucleus accumbens in response to electrical stimulation of that zone of
   ventral tegmental area (VTA) which used to study the possibility of
   forming a self-stimulation response in rats. Fast-scan cyclic
   voltammetry in vivo was used to record the release of dopamine in the
   nucleus accumbens in response to electrical stimulation of the VTA, and
   then the self-stimulation reaction of the same VTA zones was worked out
   in these animals. At the first stage, the anesthetized animals were
   stimulated (240 mu A) with a burst of pulses with self-stimulation
   parameters (100 Hz), lasting 0.5 s every 3 min for 1 h. Then phenamine
   (1 mg/kg) was injected, and recording was continued for 1 hour. VTA
   electrical stimulation caused an increase in the content of
   extracellular dopamine for 1.45 +/- 0.03 seconds with maximum amplitude
   of 4.6 +/- 0.3 nA. The administration of phenamine during stimulation of
   the zone of positive reinforcement increased both the duration of the
   phasic dopamine reaction to 5.2 +/- 0.1 seconds and the amplitude of
   this up to 20.8 +/- 0.9 nA, which corresponds to a proportional increase
   in the amount of DA. This response was maximally expressed at the 45th
   minute after injection of phenamine. The investigated VTA zones were
   also tested for the suitability for a self-stimulation response
   formation in the ``rise{''} test, when the instrumental reaction for
   intracerebral reinforcement consisted in raising the head by 38 degrees
   in a wireless telemetry unit. The self-stimulation response was tested
   before the administration of phenamine and after that for 1 hour. It was
   found that the number of rises to receive intracerebral reinforcement
   increased by 45 minutes after the administration of phenamine. Thus, the
   present study showed that stimulation of zones of positive reinforcement
   in the VTA in anesthetized animals causes persistent, long-lasting
   effects of phasic dopamine release. Activation of dopamine release after
   phenamine administration corresponds in time to changes in
   self-stimulation. In addition, the combination of the FSCV method and
   the self-stimulation makes it possible to localize the stimulating
   electrode in the VTA more clearly and reliably, under the control of
   dopamine release registration. This gives grounds for the application of
   this method, in the form of two experiments: (1) registration of
   dopamine release using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in anesthetized
   animals, and (2) study of the self-stimulation response. This approach
   holds promise for standardizing protocols for evaluating the effects of
   sensory and pharmacological agents on dopamine-dependent behaviors.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to assess the diversity and regeneration status
   of tree species in different forest types viz., Pinus forest (PF),
   Pinus-Oak mixed forest (POF) and Deodar forest (DF) of Kotla watershed
   (Barkot, Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand). The data were collected through
   quadrat method and analyzed quantitatively. A total of 28 tree species,
   belonging to 21 families were recorded in the sampling area (3 forests x
   10 plots in each x plot size 400 m2). Fagaceae, Pinaceae, Ericaceae,
   Fabaceae and Juglandaceae were the major families (in terms of number of
   species). The species-area curves (SACs) of PF and DF reached an
   asymptote while it predicted more species (din not reach asymptote) in
   case of POF. The resulted values of different diversity indices (i.e.,
   Dominance, Simpson, Shannon, Evenness, Margalef, and Equitability)
   revealed that the POF was most diverse (in tree diversity) followed by
   PF and DF. The ranked species abundance (RSA) curve of POF was log
   normal type but geometric series type for PF and DF. The
   density-diameter curves (d-d curves) was reverse J-shaped for POF while
   in case of PF and DF, the higher densities were observed for middle DBH
   classes in comparison to lowest and highest DBH classes. The overall
   regeneration status of the forests in the area was fair (25.8\% tree,
   18.6\% saplings and 55.6\% seedlings). The present study provides a
   deeper understanding of tree diversity pattern and regeneration status
   from a pocket of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR).},

Abstract = {The present experiment was aimed to study the influence of automatic
   change detection and attention switching processes on event related
   potentials associated with the preparation of voluntary movement.
   Participants performed self-initiated key presses with their right hand
   index finger simultaneously with listening to sound stimuli presented in
   two sequences: the oddball paradigm and the control paradigm.
   Participants were asked to focus on the motor task and ignore the sound
   stimuli. The oddball paradigm is a sequence of repetitive (standard) and
   deviant tones, which leads to the involuntary attention activation. The
   distribution analysis of the number of movements relative to the time of
   sound stimulus presentation showed that in the oddball paradigm, the
   number of pressings performed in the interval of 800-1200 ms after the
   stimulus was significantly greater compared to the interval of stimulus
   presentation (0-400 ms). When analyzing the readiness potential
   amplitude, a significant increase of the bilaterally symmetrical
   component in the interval from -300 to -600 ms before the movement was
   found in the oddball paradigm compared to the control paradigm. The
   results obtained allow us to speak about the activating effect of the
   processes associated with the involuntary attention system on the early
   components of movement preparation.},

   when calculating the total yield, were designed based on the
   interpretation of space images. The legend to the Rangeland map is a
   system of headings that take into account zonality, ecological and
   physiognomic types of vegetation, and soil conditions. Types of
   rangelands are reflected in the legend by 15 numbers; for each the total

Abstract = {There are now a growing number of observations on the transgenerational
   impact of paternal stress on various offspring functions without
   involving direct interaction between offspring and father. In the
   offspring of parents who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) have been observed an increase in PTSD-like symptoms. In
   experiments where a chronically elevated level of corticosterone was
   created in male mice during the entire period of spermatogenesis, a
   decrease in the stress reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis in the offspring of both sexes was shown. However, PTSD in
   patients creates a reduced level of glucocorticoids in the blood, and
   there are no experimental data on the effect of modeling PTSD in fathers
   on the activity of HPA axis of the offspring. The current study examined
   the relative influences of PTSD-like status ({''}stress-restress{''}
   paradigm) and depression-like status ({''}learned helplessness{''}
   paradigm) in male rats before mating on the HPA axis activity of their
   adult offspring. In addition to HPA axis activity, the expression of
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the offspring was analyzed by
   quantitative immunocytochemistry in the hippocampus and medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We demonstrated that in female offspring of
   fathers with a PTSD-like or depressive-like status there is a decrease
   in basal and stress activity of the HPA axis in response to 30-min
   immobilization, which was accompanied by an increase in GR expression in
   the hippocampus and the 2nd layer mPFC. A similar profile of HPA axis
   activity was found in male offspring of fathers with modeling of PTSD.
   However, in male offspring of fathers with a depression-like status, the
   sensitivity of HPA axis to feedback signals decreased and was
   accompanied by a decrease in GR expression in the hippocampus and the
   2nd layer of mPFC. We concluded that the PTSD- or depression-like status
   of male rats during the period of spermatogenesis has a differential
   effect on HPA axis activity and GR expression in the brain of their male
   offspring.},

   each year. This is an attempt to find out the rainfall trend and
   fluctuation which is one of the prime indicator of climate change. For
   this study, the daily rainfall data comprises of almost five decades
   (1975-2015). For achieving the study objectives, daily, monthly and mean
   annual rainfall data were analyzed using Mann-Kendall and Standard
   Deviation combined. Additionally, to further process the rainfall data
   spatio-statistically, GIS technology has been applied. The analysis
   specifies that a positive rainfall detected in the meteorological
   stations of Peshawar, Dir, Chitral, Drosh, Kakul and Saidu, whereas the
   moderate rainfall trend is detected in Cherat, Bannu, and Balakot. The
   remaining stations expressed no obvious trend, due to low time period of
   data.},

Abstract = {Natural resources and social conflict have a strong relationship. The
   current natural resource management problems have caused deforestation,
   resulting in unstable environmental ecosystems. Consequently, a movement
   towards mitigating natural resource management emerged because of the
   threat to the ``Bekantan{''} Proboscis Monkey habitat and population in
   South Kalimantan Province. Indonesian Proboscis Monkey Friends (SBI)
   Foundation is a non-profit organization aiming to protect Proboscis
   monkeys on Curiak Island. SBI adopts collaborative resource governance
   in building stakeholder capacity with shared motivation and principles
   for collective action. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the
   collaborative governance process conducted on Proboscis Monkey
   conservation in Curiak Island. The results showed that anyone, including
   non- government organizations, could initiate collaboration in the
   several programs such as conservation, buy back the land and rambai
   mangrove restoration. Various parties collaborations are proven to
   successfully increase the support for environmental conservation
   efforts, especially the habitat and endemic proboscis monkeys.},

Abstract = {The reuse of treated domestic wastewater is an imperative source of
   water for numerous purposes. The treatment of municipal wastewater can
   be process by utilizing the technique for electrocoagulation.
   Electrocoagulation (EC) is an eco-friendly technique that combines the
   functions and advantages of conventional coagulation, flotation, and
   electrochemistry in water and wastewater treatment. The aim of present
   study was to assess the potential of electrocoagulation process in
   removing COD, BOD, TSS, turbidity, sulphate, nitrate, chloride and TDS
   from municipal wastewater. This experimental study was carried out at a
   batch system by using copper and aluminium electrodes aiming to treat
   the municipal wastewater at (0, 7, 14, and 21 volts, 50mamp for
   60minutes) from Sample Baloch Colony (SBC), Sample Rind Goth (SRG),
   Sample Cattle Colony (SCC), Sample Pakistan Machine Tool Factory (SPMTF)
   and Sample Mehran Highway (SMH). The results revealed that the maximum
   removal efficiency of COD 96\% for SPMTF, BOD 38.5\% for SPMTF, TSS
   98.14\% for SMH, Turbidity 95.7\% for SPMTF, Sulphate 95.9\% for SRG,
   Nitrate 95.23\% for SMH, Chloride 97.92\% for SMH and TDS 96.9\% for SRG
   at 21 volt. The present study suggested that the treated wastewater
   could be safely reuse for lawns, parks, tree plantation and recreation
   purpose.},

Abstract = {Aging is accompanied by the triggering of numerous pathophysiological
   events, which include inflammation, cellular senescence and the
   development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),
   altered glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance (IR).
   Neuroinflammation significantly contributes to the development of brain
   IR due to the activation of the multiprotein oligomeric complex, NLRP3
   inflammasome. The aim of the present study was to explore the impairment
   of the mechanisms underlying insulin signaling and metabolic
   inflammation in the brain of aging C57BL/6 mice. We found that aging in
   these mice is accompanied by an increase both in the number of senescent
   cells in brain slices, as well as neuron-astrocyte co-culture, and in
   the expression of phosphorylated protein kinases PKR and IKK beta,
   metaflammasome components. Another metaflammasome component, whose
   expression increased in the hippocampus during aging, was IKK beta. We
   demonstrated that constitutive IKK beta activation is related with cell
   senescence and aging, as well as overactivation of the NLRP3
   inflammasome and increased lactate production in aging mice. Changes in
   NLRP3 expression in the brain are reflected in changes in complex
   behaviors. Here, we documented the impairment of contextual memory, but
   not the acquisition process and cued memory, in aging mice.
   Nevertheless, aging in mice did not led to a change in the expression of
   insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1phospho-S312),
   suggesting that during physiological aging, without signs of
   neurodegeneration (e.g., reactive astrogliosis), insulin signaling is
   not yet impaired, but the manifestations of metabolic inflammation are
   already observed. Thus, modulation of the activity of PKR and IKK beta
   metaflammasome components may represent a new pathogenetically
   substantiated strategy for managing the mechanisms of metabolic
   inflammation and SASP development in the brain, aimed at improving
   age-related cognitive dysfunctions.},

Abstract = {Changes in acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated dilation of the pial arteries in
   the sensorimotor cortex were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats after the
   formation of metabolic and hormonal disorders similar to those in type 2
   diabetes mellitus (DM2). For this purpose, the rats were kept on a
   high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 months, and then some of them were injected
   with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Next, all animals
   were again receiving high-fat foods for another one month (a total of a
   3-month HFD). The responses of pial arteries to the effects of
   acetylcholie (ACh, 10(-7) M) alone or against the background of L-NAME,
   a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blocker, or aminoguanidine
   (AG), a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) blocker, were
   assessed using intravital microscopy imaging technique. It was found
   that a 3-month HFD led to the development of endothelial dysfunction in
   the pial arteries of the sensorimotor cortex: the number of vessels
   dilated to the effect of ACh in the HFD group was 1.2-1.6 times smaller
   compared to the control group. ACh-mediated vascular dilation was
   endothelial NOS (eNOS)-depended only in the arteries with a caliber < 40
   mu m. In HFD rats, iNOS was not detected in the cerebral arteries.
   Animals with an STZ-induced DM2 model also developed endothelial
   dysfunction in the cerebral arteries: the number of vessels dilated to
   the effect of ACh in the DM2 group was 1.6-2.3 times smaller compared to
   the control group. In DM2 rats, the eNOS-associated signaling cascade
   did not control arterial reactivity, and vascular tone was mainly
   sustained due to iNOS-mediated reactions. In DM2 rats, the major
   abnormalities in the vascular dilatory response included the least
   number of vessels dilated in response to ACh alone with a significant
   decrease in the degree of dilation (by 1.5-1.6 times vs control),
   persistent ACh-mediated vascular dilation despite the presence of
   L-NAME, and the largest number of vascular constrictions in response to
   AG (60-70\% of all the vessels examined). All these disorders were
   revealed in the pial arteries with a caliber < 40 mu m, i.e. exactly in
   the vasculature segment that is maximally involved in blood-tissue gas
   exchange.},

Abstract = {Chronic social stress (CSS) can cause physiological disturbances,
   provoking the development of depression and anxiety, and stress-induced
   immune dysregulation is a trigger for the development of many
   pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases. New data
   in human and animal models suggest an intriguing relationship between
   endoplasmic reticulum stress, depression and inflammation. Under
   cellular stress, the number of protein folding disorders increases,
   which leads to the development of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS).
   The ERS, in turn, activates the ``unfolded protein response{''} system
   (unfolded protein response, UPR), the IRE1-XBP1 signaling system is very
   important. The transcription factor XBP1 is responsible for regulating
   the expression of a large number of genes involved in the proper folding
   and maturation of proteins, the degradation of misfolded proteins and
   regulation of immune responses. In addition, changes in XBP1 expression
   can significantly affect the risk of developing the disease and the
   progression of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including
   inflammatory bowel disease.},

Abstract = {Ischemic injury is one of the most adverse pathogenic factors that evoke
   irreversible changes in organs and tissues. Cardioprotection from
   ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important challenge for modern
   experimental and clinical medicine. This type of injury is a key link in
   the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and, above all, acute
   myocardial infarction, a socioeconomically significant disease that is
   one of the main causes of disability and mortality among the adult
   population. The aim of the study was to elucidate the infarct-size
   limiting effect of postconditioning (Post) with L-lactate during
   myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in young and old rats under
   atropine-induced blockade of M-cholinergic receptors. In experiments on
   rats, it was found that Post with L-lactate has an infarct-size limiting
   effect during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in both young and old
   animals, however, under conditions of systemic atropine administration
   (2 mg/kg), this effect was persistent in old rats only. Apparently, the
   activity of the peripheral M-cholinergic systems is of importance for
   the implementation mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of Post
   with L-lactate in young, but not old rats.},

Title = {Dispersal kernel of green rice leafhopper estimated from truncated data},

Abstract = {Characterizing dispersal kernels from truncated data is important for
   managing and predicting population dynamics. We used mark-recapture data
   from 10 previously published replicated experiments at three host plant
   development stages (seedling, tillering, and heading) to estimate
   parameters of the normal and exponential dispersal kernels for green
   rice leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler). We compared classic
   statistical methods for estimating untruncated distribution parameters
   from truncated data with maximum likelihood (MLE) and the method of
   statistical moments for simulated and empirical data. Simulations showed
   that both methods provided accurate parameter estimates with similar
   precision. The method of moments is algebraically complex, but simple to
   calculate, while the MLE methods require numerical solutions of
   nonlinear equations. Simulations also showed that accurate, precise
   estimates of the parameters of the untruncated distributions could be
   attained even under severe truncation with sufficient numbers of
   recaptures. Both diffusivity and the exponential mean were higher with
   later plant growth stage, showing that insects moved farther and faster
   at the heading stage. Precision of the estimates was not strongly
   related to percent capture, size of the experimental field, or the
   number of leafhoppers captured. The leptokurtic exponential kernel fit
   the data better than the normal kernel for all the experiments. These
   results support an alternative explanation for the strong
   density-dependent population regulation of this species at the heading
   stage. Instead of leafhopper density per se, the increase in movement at
   this stage could integrate the populations in the separate fields,
   leveling densities throughout the landscape.},

Title = {Imbalance of Hormones Involved in Energy Balance Regulation in Obese
   Patients: a Study of Its Relationship with Disturbed Eating Behavior and

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In healthy people, postprandial status is characterized by a particular
   dynamics of the level of hormones involved in the regulation of eating
   behavior and energy balance. However, data obtained from obese patients
   are heterogeneous. The aim of this work was to study the pattern of
   dynamic changes in the level of hormones-leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like
   peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)-and to
   elucidate their relationship with factors characterizing metabolic
   status and eating behavior. Sixty six obese patients (12 men and 54
   women, mean age 37.8 +/- 10.8 years, mean body weight 105.2 +/- 16.7 kg,
   body mass index (BMI) 37.3 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2)) were included in the study.
   All patients underwent anthropometric examination and had their blood
   pressure, as well as parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,
   determined. Hormone levels (leptin, GIP, GLP-1, ghrelin) were assessed
   fasting and 60 min after a standard breakfast containing 60 g of
   carbohydrates. It was found that different obese patients demonstrated
   multidirectional changes in the study hormone levels. Some patients
   retained the dynamics typical for healthy people, while the majority
   exhibited a decrease in postprandial peaks (GLP-1 in 48.2\%, GIP in 50\%
   of patients), or an abnormal dynamics (no decrease in postprandial
   ghrelin levels in 60.8\%, no increase in postprandial leptin levels in
   83.3\%). The abnormal postprandial dynamics of hormone levels was
   associated with more pronounced changes in parameters corresponding to
   the metabolically unhealthy obesity (elevated glucose and triglyceride
   levels, increased HOMA-IR index) and disturbed eating behavior. The
   postprandial dynamics of hormones involved in the regulation of appetite
   and energy balance suggests the presence of different subtypes of
   obesity. Those subtypes, which probably reflect the resistance to these
   hormones and/or their deficiency developing in obesity, are
   characterized by the worse characteristics of metabolic health.},

Abstract = {Genetically engineered animal models have been widely used in various
   fields of medicine and biological research. Thousands of genetically
   modified transgenic mouse models have been generated in recent decades
   and their production is accelerating. Therefore, the maintenance and

   challenges. In our research, we use the transgenic mouse lines that
   express genetically encoded neural probes for noninvasive recording of
   chloride ions (Cl-Sensor) and simultaneous monitoring of chloride and
   hydrogen (ClopHensor). To maintain the purity of these lines, we have
   developed a test system for the genotyping of transgenic mice. The
   method is characterized by a high reliability of results and can be used
   for further control of the genetic purity of these lines, as well as
   other animal lines with slightly different regions of amino acid

Abstract = {Neuroimmune interactions pathways are the current interests of
   neuroimmunophysiology. As it shown, n. vagus is a part of neuroimmune
   communications, so determination of activation patterns of n. vagus is
   the relevant task. The aim of the study is to determine the amount of
   c-Fos-positive neurons in nuclei tractus solitarius (NTS) and dorsal
   motor nuclei (DMX) in rat medulla oblongata after subdiaphragmatic
   vagotomy and various antigens administration. Immunohistochemistry and
   morphometry were performed for determination of c-Fos-positive neurons
   amount in different zones of NTS and DMN. In the cells of DMX were not
   abserved any c-Fos-positive neurons in control and after
   subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. LPS administration (500 mu g/kg) induced the
   increasing of c-Fos-positive neurons amount in NTS, particularly in
   medial NTS. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy leads to increasing of
   c-Fos-positive neurons amount in NTS after LPS or SEB (500 mu g/kg)
   administration. LPS injection after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy induced an
   activation of neurons of the lateral, medial and central NTS, while SEB
   administration induced only medial NTS activation. Therefore, the
   pattern of NTS response to the introduction of certain antigens are
   shown. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy leads to activation of NTS after the
   introduction of LPS and SEB.},

Abstract = {The expression of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein
   kinase and RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mammalian target
   of rapamycin) protein was studied immunohistochemically in neurons of
   the tuberal region of the rat hypothalamus in male rats aged 3, 6, 12,

   mTOR-immunopositive (ip) neurons in the arcuate (ARN), dorsomedial
   (DMN), and ventromedial (VMN) hypothalamic nuclei, as well as RICTOR-ip
   neurons in the ARN and VMN in rats of different ages. In the ARN of
   aging rats, the percentage of mTOR-ip neurons increases, while the
   proportion of mTOR-ip neurons colocalizing mTOR and RICTOR decreases. In
   the VMN and DMN, a highest percentage of mTOR-ip neurons was observed in
   6-month-old rats. A highest percentage of RICTOR-ip neurons was found in
   the VMN of 6-month-old rats. Thus, aging is accompanied by changes in
   mTOR expression in neurons of the hypothalamic tuberal nuclei.},

Abstract = {The article is focused on the evaluation of the electrical activity of
   the heart in rats during ventricular repolarization after a single bout
   of forced treadmill running until exhaustion. Electrophysiological
   properties of the myocardium were studied by conventional ECG and body
   surface potential mapping. Cardiac potentials were registered in
   zoletil-anesthetized rats 3-5 days before (baseline) and 5, 10, 20 and
   30 min after exhaustive treadmill running. Compared with baseline, an
   increase in the duration of the QT(II), JT(II) and Tpeak-Tend(II)
   intervals, an earlier onset and a later completion, as well as an
   increase in the duration of ventricular repolarization on body surface
   equipotential maps (BSPMs) were revealed in rats 5 min after exhaustive
   exercise. Ten min following treadmill running to exhaustion, the
   temporal parameters of the heart electrical activity returned to
   pre-exercise values. Changes in the amplitude characteristics of both
   ECG(II) (ST segment depression, a decrease in the T-wave amplitude) and
   BSPMs (a decrease in the maximum amplitudes of positive and negative
   extrema during ventricular repolarization) were showed after 5-10 min
   and persisted up to 20-30 min after running to exhaustion. A positive
   correlation was found between changes in the maximum amplitude of
   negative extremum of BSPMs and changes in the amplitude of the T-II-wave
   in the analyzed time periods after exhausting exercise. It is assumed
   that the observed changes in the electrical properties of the heart in
   rats during ventricular repolarization after forced treadmill running
   were due to ischemic myocardial damage induced by exhaustive physical
   exercise.},

Abstract = {Reservoirs of anthropogenic genesis are a special component of the
   technogenic landscape. Their environmental conditions differ from those
   of natural water bodies. Such differences include a limited catchment
   area and a low thickness of bottom sediments, as well as high contents
   of metals, metalloids, and salts. The objects of our research are
   various lake formations that formed during the development of mineral
   deposits in the Eastern Transbaikal region. This article describes the
   chemical composition of the waters and the species diversity and the
   structure of hydrobiont communities that are different in their
   formation and purpose of technogenic reservoirs of mining areas. Algae
   and zooplankton of technogenic water bodies in a region with an arid
   climate have been studied for the first time. The studied waters have a
   variety of morphometric and physicochemical characteristics with a wide
   range of pH values (2.99-8.80), total mineralization (85.9-9065 mg/L),
   and content of ore and associated elements. According to the chemical
   composition, the waters are sulphate and bicarbonate-sulphate, with
   different ratios of magnesium and calcium. The species diversity of the
   algae and zooplankton of the studied water bodies is low (75 taxa of
   plankton algae, 8 taxa of macroalgae, and 63 species and subspecies of
   plankton invertebrates). This is associated with extreme environmental
   conditions, where species richness is influenced by physicochemical
   conditions of the habitat. The determining factors for the development
   of Cryptophyta representatives are micro- and macrocomponent composition

Abstract = {Oxidative stress induced by harmful substances activates inflammatory
   signaling pathways and causes excessive proliferation of keratinocytes,
   which is related to the occurrence of psoriasis. Rutin, a natural citrus
   flavonoid glycoside, exhibits protective effects against oxidative
   stress. However, whether rutin is able to influence oxidative stress in
   keratinocytes remains unclear. In the present study, an in vitro cell
   model of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) treated with H2O2 was used to
   explore whether rutin can prevent oxidative stress. The present findings
   suggest that rutin protected HaCaT cells against oxidative damage by
   inhibiting ROS, NO and MDA secretion, increasing SOD activity and
   restoring GSH-Px activity. In addition, rutin supplement limited IL-6,
   IL-1 beta and IL-23A production in HaCaT cells. Moreover, rutin
   upregulated Nrf2 expression, and promoted the downstream NQO1 and HO-1
   expression. These results suggest that rutin may inhibit HaCaT cell
   oxidative stress by modulating the Nrf2-regulated pathway.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms of regulation of the constitutive androstane receptor
   (CAR) under the effect of the nitric oxide (NO) donor
   S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), added to a nutrient medium at
   concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 mu M for 3, 24, and 72 h, were
   studied in vitro on Caco-2 cells. Relative CAR levels were assessed by
   Western blotting. It was found that short-term (3 and 24 h) exposure to
   GSNO at concentrations of 1-500 mu M did not affect the relative CAR
   level, while after a 72-h exposure to GSNO concentrations of 1, 10 and
   50 mu M, it increased. Such an increase in the relative CAR level upon
   exposure to a low GSNO concentration (1 mu M) was proved to be
   implemented via the NO-cGMP signaling pathway. Further increase in GSNO
   concentrations to 10 and 50 mu M triggered the development of
   nitrosative stress, and the relative CAR level was regulated via the
   nitration product bityrosine. Nitrosative stress progression at GSNO
   concentrations of 100 and 500 mu M was accompanied by a decline in
   Caco-2 cell survival, apparently due to the damage to the CAR molecule,
   leading to a decrease in the relative CAR level.},

Abstract = {The review presents experimental data on auditory adaptation to specific
   speech parameters-temporal (tempo-rhythmic) and spectral characteristics
   of the speech signal, including the fundamental frequency, vowel
   formants, timbre features. The aftereffects of the extralinguistic
   information in spoken language-the gender and age of the speaker,
   his/her emotional state-are considered. It is shown how adaptation is
   involved in the segregation of competing speech streams and in the
   mechanisms of auditory attention. The role of auditory adaptation in the
   development of speech processing and the occurrence of voice prototypes
   during ontogenesis are discussed. The main models of speech processing
   and experimental data on phonemic analysis are presented. The results of
   experimental and model studies indicate that adaptive processes play an
   important role in enhancing the signal-background contrast and improve
   signal identification. It is important to consider the auditory
   adaptation to specific speech parameters when developing rehabilitation
   procedures for patients with hearing aids and designing technical speech
   recognition systems.},

Abstract = {In type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), testicular synthesis of testosterone
   is impaired, leading to androgen insufficiency and disorders of
   spermatogenesis. Long-term use of high gonadotropin doses for the
   correction of these abnormalities leads to a decrease in the sensitivity
   of luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG) receptors
   in Leydig cells. The aim of this work was to study the effect of 3-day
   treatment of DM1 (streptozotocin-induced, 45 mg/kg) male Wistar rats
   with the allosteric LH/hCG receptor agonist
   5-amino-N-tert-butyl-2-(methylsulfanyl)-4-(3-(nicotinamido)phenyl)thieno
   {[}2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide (TP03, 15 mg/kg per day) on the
   effects of a relatively low hCG dose (10 IU/rat, single dose, s.c.) on
   blood testosterone levels, expression of steroidogenesis genes, and
   morphometric parameters of the seminiferous tubules. Pretreatment of
   rats with TP03 enhanced the stimulating effect of hCG on blood
   testosterone levels. This effect was produced, on the one hand, by
   enhanced steroidogenesis due to an increase in the expression of the
   Cyp11a1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 side-chain
   cleavage enzyme (P450scc) responsible for the first stage of
   testosterone synthesis, and, on the other hand, by improved testicular
   sensitivity to gonadotropins due to an increase in the testicular LH/hCG
   receptor content in DM1 rats. In addition, pretreatment of DM1 rats with
   TP03 followed by hCG stimulation resulted in a more pronounced
   improvement in the morphometric parameters of the seminiferous tubules
   as compared to the groups that received TP03 or hCG alone. Thus, TP03
   enables to increase the effectiveness of the hCG steroidogenic effect
   and reduce the dose of gonadotropin, which compensates for an androgen
   deficiency in diabetes.},

Abstract = {Octopuses show a wide behavioral range that allows them great
   adaptability to their environment. This makes them a target of great
   interest for biophysics, cytology, and neurobiology studies. To
   adequately execute these investigations, it is essential to have a
   thorough understanding of the neuroanatomy of the species that function
   as good laboratory models, for example, O. maya. In this work, we
   undertake the task of extracting and characterizing various structures
   of the nervous system of O. maya at the level of lobes and connectivity
   between them. O. maya has great advantages as a research model for the
   neurobiology of cephalopods, such as being reproduced in captivity,
   having holobenthic larvae, an adequate size for analysis and performing
   its behavior out of hiding places and not burrowing. All this allows
   behavioral studies to be carried out more easily. In this study we have
   characterized the morphology of 30 lobes in the brain of O. maya from
   young and adult specimens and the cells that constitute the connectivity
   pathways between these regions. We also observed that the brains of O.
   maya at four weeks after hatching do not show a fully mature structure,
   but rather that some lobes related to somatosensory memory have low cell
   density and a simpler morphology than that of adult specimens. It is
   indicative of a maturation process that should be considered for future
   experimental designs. We hope that this nervous system mapping will
   increase the basis for more detailed investigations into the
   neurophysiology of O. maya and other octopuses.},

Abstract = {Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers with an unsatisfactory
   prognosis and high mortality rate. The ability of liver cancer cells to
   evade apoptosis results in the poor therapeutic effect of existing
   treatments and high rates of tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study
   investigated the effects of abnormal miR-338-3p expression on the
   ability of liver cancer cells to avoid apoptosis and the mechanism for
   that avoidance. The levels of miR-338-3p in liver tumor tissues and in
   different liver cancer cell lines were analysed by qRT-PCR which
   demonstrated its downregulation in liver tumor tissues and cells,
   especially in the Huh7 cells. Cell viability and apoptosis rates of Huh7
   liver cancer cells were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay, clone formation
   assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assay. whereas the expression levels of
   apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, caspase-3, Cyt C, and X-linked
   inhibitor of apoptosis protein {[}XIAP]) were analyzed by Western
   blotting. Next, the target relationship between miR-338-3p and Sirtuin 6
   (SIRT6) was identified by conducting a dual luciferase reporter gene
   assay. Overexpression of miR-338-3p was found to inhibit cell viability
   and promote the apoptosis of Huh7 cells. Additionally, an upregulation
   of miR-338-3p significantly promoted Bax, caspase-3, and Cyt C
   expression, and suppressed XIAP and SIRT6 expression. Notably, SIRT6 was
   proven to be a target gene of miR-338-3p, and SIRT6 overexpression was
   shown to reverse the anti-tumor effect of miR-338-3p upregulation in
   Huh7 cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis induction effect of Cisplatin was
   reduced by SIRT6, but restored by miR-338-3p. In conclusion, this study
   demonstrated that miR-338-3p increased apoptosis in liver cancer cell
   Huh7 by inhibiting SIRT6, and thereby enhanced the cytocidal effect of
   the apoptosis inducer Cisplatin. These results suggest miR-338-3p as a
   target for treating liver cancer, which might provide a new therapeutic
   strategy.},

Abstract = {The light-dark cycle is one of the main environmental factors affecting
   the rhythm of biological processes in the body. A change or absence of
   this cyclicity leads to disruption of circadian rhythms and negatively
   affects the functioning of all body systems. The aim of the study was to
   investigate the effect of constant darkness, which began from the
   prenatal period (DD/DD) or from the moment of birth (LD/DD) and
   continued throughout life, on the content of alpha-tocopherol in Wistar
   rats in late ontogenesis (3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). Control animals
   were kept under standard light conditions (LD). The level of
   alpha-tocopherol was determined by HPLC. The modulating effect of
   long-term light deprivation was found in the liver, skeletal muscle and
   lungs, most of the changes were observed in 12-month-old rats. Thus, in
   the liver the level of vitamin decreased in both experimental groups,
   which is probably due to the regulatory role of the organ in maintaining
   vitamin E homeostasis in the body. In the skeletal muscle of rats from
   the DD/DD group, a significant increase in the content of
   alpha-tocopherol was found. This may show the accumulation of lipids in
   myocytes as a result of disorder of homeostasis of the main energy
   substrates of skeletal muscles. In 24-month-old rats of this group, the
   vitamin level in the tissue was significantly lower than in the control,
   which may indicate a decrease in the antioxidant protection of the
   skeletal muscle due to age-related changes. In rats, exposed to constant
   darkness after birth, there were differences in the direction of changes
   in the lungs alpha-tocopherol level compared with the control group at
   the age of 6 and 12 months. In aging and old animals, the effect of
   light deprivation was probably smoothed out by age-related disturbances
   of the circadian system thus in most of the studied tissues the vitamin
   content did not differ in rats of the control and both experimental
   groups. The results can be useful in assessing the physiological state
   of people working or living under poor lighting conditions.},

Abstract = {In three Far Eastern male forest cats (Prionailurus bengalensis
   euptilura) and four male domestic cats (Felis catus) with preimplanted
   (under general anesthesia) loggers, deep subcutaneous back temperature
   and motor activity were recorded in captive conditions for two months in
   the fall-winter period. It was found that in fall, at positive daytime
   temperatures, the circadian rhythm of body temperature is absent in Far
   Eastern forest cats and weakly expressed in domestic cats. However, it
   reappears during the period of winter cold in the form of fluctuations,
   synchronous in all animals, with an amplitude of 3-4 degrees C and
   acrophase in the middle of the daylight period and a minimum in the
   middle of the night. For comparison, the recording of the ``core{''}
   body temperature and activity in two female domestic cats kept in the
   same season in the laboratory revealed no comparable rhythms. It is
   concluded that the rest-activity and deep subcutaneous temperature
   circadian biorhythms are not constant characteristics of the body of Far
   Eastern forest and domestic cats, but can appear, disappear and change
   radically with changes in ambient temperature.},

Abstract = {Modern manifestation of desertification stages and of arid degradation
   and the dynamics of the development of these processes depending on soil
   fertility under arid conditions are analyzed based on the example of
   some areas of the Western Caspian Sea Region: the Terek-Kuma Lowland and
   the Terek River delta. There are two stages of the development of
   degradation processes, which strongly differ in their combination and
   area distribution. The first stage, natural degradation, starts from the
   development of soil-forming processes in the Holocene as one of the
   obligatory elements of the functioning of living organisms on the Earth
   surface. The natural dynamics of degradation processes results in the
   formation of an equilibrium status of formation of soils of particular
   types with a complete profile structure. Depending on soil-forming
   conditions typical for degradation (salinization, pollution,
   solonetzicity of soils at different stages of their evolution),
   solonchaks, solonetzes, and sand and clay deserts are formed. These soil
   properties continue to develop under natural conditions at the present
   time and their evolution that started in the Holocene goes on (Akaev,
   1996). At the second stage, the dynamics of arid degradation and
   desertification is caused by the anthropogenic impact and radically
   differs from the natural degradation. As a result of the increased
   anthropogenic load, the natural soil cover is replaced by an unstable
   secondary one under man-made conditions. The development of new
   directions of soil formation is favored by the expansion of irrigated
   lands in the Terek River delta, the Terek-Kuma Lowland, and other
   regions and by the subject of cultivated soils to salinization, wind
   erosion, and degradation.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results of long-term (2008 and 2012-2019) studies of
   phytoplankton and phytobenthos in seven highly mineralized rivers of the
   Lake Elton basin. Two-hundred-and-fourteen algal taxa belonging to seven
   systematic divisions have been identified in the algal flora; of them,
   the division Bacillariophyta features the greatest species richness and
   abundance. A comparative analysis of the taxonomic structure and species
   diversity of algocoenoses in the mineralization gradient was performed.
   The following structure-forming species represented by widespread
   euryhaline taxa were identified: Chaetoceros muelleri Lemm., Conticribra
   weissflogii (Grun.) S. Suchoples et Williams, Nitzschia closterium Ehr.,
   Halamphora coffeaeformis (Ag.) Meresch., and Achnanthesbrevipes Ag.,
   (Bacillariophyta), as well as Cyanoprokaryota (Phormidium breve (Kutz.
   ex Gom.) Anagn. \& Kom., Oscillatoria limosa Ag. ex Gom., O. tenuis Ag.
   ex Gom., and Geitlerinema amphibium (Ag. ex Gom.) Anagn.). Species of
   the genus Dunaliella (Chlorophyta) predominate in rivers featuring
   critical salinity conditions. It is established that the abundance and
   biomass of algae in algocoenoses vary in a wide range and do not depend
   on the mineralization level. In mesohaline rivers, the negative
   correlation between specific species richness and mineralization is
   weak; while in polyhaline rivers, it is statistically significant (R =
   -0.50, R = -0.52, p < 0.05). Seasonal dynamics of planktonic
   algocoenoses is manifested by changes in the species structure,
   abundance, and biomass.},

Abstract = {Under conditions of an arid climate and insufficient moisture supply for
   plants, the study of soil and the hydrological features of sand massifs
   becomes relevant. The purpose of this study was to investigate water
   regime types in sand massifs of the Don River basin. During 2003-2021,
   route and stationary (laying out of water regime sites) surveys were
   arranged on the territory of sand massifs of the river and its
   tributaries. Laboratory studies were carried out at the hydrological
   complex of the Federal Scientific Center of Agroecology of the Russian
   Academy of Sciences, which included eight large lysimeters and 18
   vegetation sites. Infiltration in open sands reached 70\% of the annual
   precipitation volume on average. The maximum runoff to the groundwater
   was observed for sand massifs of the Upper Don. According to lysimetric
   studies, the average annual intensity of the groundwater runoff under
   black fallow conditions was 0.73 mm/day for sand soils (the highest
   value), 0.65 mm/day for sandy loam soils, and 0.37 mm/day for loamy
   soils. At the same time, in the second half of the year, sandy loam
   soils were able to discharge more water into the groundwater than sandy
   and loamy soils. A nonflushing water regime was observed mainly on the
   third terrace of sandy massifs characterized by deep groundwater
   occurrence (>8 m) and soils with a heavy granulometric composition.
   Daily fluctuations of the groundwater level with the general decrease of
   this index were observed in the areas, where groundwater was available
   for tree roots, since the night water inflow did not compensate for
   transpiration water flow. The seasonal fluctuations of the groundwater
   level in the sands of the Don basin areas were 40-60 cm on average, but
   can also reach 90 cm.},

Abstract = {Under some pathological conditions, such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy,
   status epilepticus or certain forms of genetic abnormalities, spiking
   activity of GABAergic interneurons may enhance excitation processes in
   neuronal circuits and provoke the generation of ictal discharges. As a
   result, anticonvulsants acting on the GABAergic system may be
   ineffective or even increase seizure activity. This paradoxical effect
   of the inhibitory system is due to ionic imbalances in nervous tissue.
   This review addresses the mechanisms of ictal discharge initiation in
   neuronal networks due to the imbalance of chloride and potassium ions,
   as well as possible ways to regulate ionic concentrations. Both the
   enhancement (or attenuation) of the activity of certain neuronal ion
   transporters and ion pumps and their additional expression via gene
   therapy can be effective in suppressing seizure activity caused by ionic
   imbalances. The Na+-K+-pump, NKCC1 and KCC2 cotransporters are important
   for maintaining proper K+ and Cl- concentrations in nervous tissue,
   having been repeatedly considered as pharmacological targets for
   antiepileptic exposures. Further progress in this direction is hampered
   by the lack of sufficiently selective pharmacological tools and methods
   for providing effective drug delivery to the epileptic focus. The use of
   the gene therapy techniques, such as overexpressing of the KCC2
   transporter in the epileptic focus, seems to be a more promising
   approach. Another possible direction could be the use of optogenetic
   tools, namely specially designed light-activated ion pumps or ion
   channels. In this case, photon energy can be used to create the required
   gradients of chloride and potassium ions, although these methods also
   have significant limitations which complicate their rapid introduction
   into medicine.},

Abstract = {During the period of use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) in medical
   treatment and in scuba diving, extensive knowledge has been accumulated
   about the mechanisms of its biological action. In the present work, we
   analyze the experimental data of recent years related to the cellular
   and molecular mechanisms of the physiological and neurotoxic effects of
   hyperbaric oxygen. New data on the physiological action of HBO2 concern
   the mechanisms of hyperoxic vasoconstriction and baroreflex activation
   in hyperoxia. The toxic effect of hyperbaric oxygen is realized through
   the intensive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which
   cause post-translational modification of proteins responsible for
   neuronal electrogenesis and synaptic transmission in the GABAergic
   system of the brain.},

Title = {Comparative Study of the Behavior of Wistar Rats, Dopamine Transporter
   Heterozygous Rats and Rats after Long-Term Ethanol Consumption in the

Abstract = {Dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are the basis of many
   neuropsychiatric diseases. A promising model for research is a model of
   moderate increase in DA system activity: DAT-HET rats heterozygous for
   the dopamine transporter gene knockout. They are characterized by higher
   motor activity and cognitive impairments, which allow them to be
   considered as a possible model of pathologies such as attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder. It is known that chronic ethanol consumption
   leads to dopamine depletion, particularly in the striatum. We suggest
   that chronically ethanol-consuming rats may serve as a model of moderate
   hypodopaminergic state, as opposed to DAT-HET rats. The aim of this
   study was to explore the effect of such modulations of the dopaminergic
   system on learning and spatial navigation in the Morris water maze. A
   decrease in dopamine levels compared to DAT-HET rats was found only in
   rats with a higher level of ethanol preference. In the Morris water
   maze, the DAT-HET rats showed an unproductive strategy of thigmotaxis
   significantly more than the ethanol-consuming rats, which led to slower
   learning. It is possible that the observed impairments in the learning
   of the spatial task are related to their stress vulnerability,
   manifested, in particular, by a high level of defecation in the pool.
   Rats after the chronic ethanol exposure demonstrated a delayed
   purposeful search for a platform in comparison with the control group,
   which was expressed in less time spent in the target sector at the
   beginning of each learning session. The study allows us to conclude that
   the moderate multidirectional modulation of the activity of the
   dopaminergic system does not lead to the pronounced impairment in
   spatial navigation in the Morris water maze, but reduces cognitive
   flexibility evidenced by longer periods of using unproductive
   strategies.},

Title = {Predator-permanence hypothesis in time: Community dynamics in a
   seasonally flooded wetland},
Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 1},
Abstract = {The predator-permanence hypothesis predicts that as hydroperiod
   increases in lentic ecosystems, biotic interactions-mainly
   predation-replace physical factors like drying as the main determinant
   of community structure and population dynamics. We propose that the same
   transition occurs over time in seasonally flooded ecosystems that are
   connected to permanent water bodies. To test for evidence of
   successional changes that are similar to spatial changes in the relative
   importance of drying and predation, we used a 12-y time series of snail
   density, predator density, and water depth at 4 sites arranged along a
   nutrient gradient in a subtropical, seasonally flooded wetland, the
   Florida Everglades, USA. The rate of change in snail population size was
   negatively correlated with their density at all 4 sites, suggesting that
   density-dependent factors such as resource limitation regulate snail
   dynamics. The strength of the relationship varied among sites such that
   when water depth changes were less important, snail population size was
   more important in predicting changes in snail population size. At the
   site that consistently had the greatest snail density, crayfish density
   negatively affected the rate of snail population change, suggesting that
   crayfish predation may limit snail population growth in areas with more
   or higher-quality resources that support larger snail populations.
   Tethering studies were also conducted, which revealed higher snail
   mortality in the wet season, primarily because crushing predators (e.g.,
   molluscivorous fishes) were more common at that time and added to the
   chronic mortality by entry-based predators (e.g., crayfish, which access
   snails through their aperture). In summary, 3 of the sites resembled
   temporary or permanent fishless ponds where snail populations were
   primarily structured by abiotic factors, intraspecific competition, and
   invertebrate predators (e.g., crayfish) during the wet season, whereas 1
   site showed evidence that snail populations were also influenced by
   molluscivorous fish. This temporal change in importance of water
   permanence factors to fish that affected population dynamics supports
   the spatial pattern proposed by the predator-permanence hypothesis.},

Title = {When and where to count? Implications of migratory connectivity and

   population},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Migratory connectivity is a metric of the co-occurrence of migratory
   animals originating from different breeding sites, and like their
   spatial dispersion, can vary substantially during the annual cycle.
   Together, both these properties affect the optimal times and sites of
   population censusing. We tracked taiga bean geese (Anser fabalis
   fabalis) during 2014-2021 to study their migratory connectivity and
   nonbreeding movements and determine optimal periods to assess the size
   of their main flyway population. We also compared available census data
   with tracking data, to examine how well two existing censuses covered
   the population. Daily Mantel's correlation between breeding and
   nonbreeding sites lay between 0 and 0.5 during most of the nonbreeding
   season, implying birds from different breeding areas were not strongly
   separated at other times in the annual cycle. However, the connectivity
   was higher among birds from the westernmost breeding areas compared to
   the birds breeding elsewhere. Daily Minimum Convex Polygons showed
   tracked birds were highly aggregated at census times, confirming their
   utility. The number of tracked birds absent at count sites during the
   censuses however exceeded numbers double-counted at several sites,
   indicating that censuses might have underestimated the true population
   size. Our results show that connectivity can vary in different times
   during the nonbreeding period, and should be studied throughout the
   annual cycle. Our results also confirm previous studies, which have
   found that estimates using marked individuals usually produce higher
   population size estimates than total counts. This should be considered
   when using total counts to assess population sizes in the future.},

Title = {How extreme drought events, introduced species, and disease interact to

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {680-694},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Over the past century, native amphibian species in California, USA, have
   declined in geographic range and population size, including precipitous
   declines of the California Red-legged Frog Rana draytonii Baird and
   Girard, 1852 and the California Tiger Salamander Ambystoma californiense
   Gray, 1853. Habitat loss, infectious disease (e.g., chytridiomycosis),
   and the introduction of invasive species are potential contributors to
   this decline, but it is unclear how these variables interact with
   extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought to affect amphibian
   population dynamics. We used a 7-y dataset (2013-2019) on amphibian
   breeding activity that encompassed a recent extreme drought event to
   assess 1) how breeding activities of these taxa differed during and
   after drought conditions and 2) the additive and interactive
   relationships of drought, chytrid fungal infection (Bd), and invasive
   species with the presence and abundance of larval amphibians. Based on
   650 surveys of 110 lentic habitats in California, both amphibian species
   were highly sensitive to drought severity, such that the proportion of
   occupied sites during peak drought conditions decreased by 36\% for R.
   draytonii and 87\% for A. californiense relative to the initial year of
   the study. However, both taxa showed strong recovery, with increases in
   breeding occurrence as drought conditions eased in the following years
   (2016-2019). Invasive fishes and American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana
   Shaw, 1802) also negatively predicted the occurrence and density of the
   2 native taxa. Finally, we found that the relationship between Bd and R.
   draytonii larval density was influenced by drought conditions,
   suggesting that Bd's transmission rates or effects on host persistence
   are sensitive to climate. These findings illustrate the ability of
   native taxa to recover from recent drought conditions and reinforce the
   importance of controlling invasive species for improving breeding
   activities of threatened amphibians.},

   (DO) can be affected by increased ash inputs from fire or reduced
   primary production under lower light conditions. Because collecting data
   as the event occurs is challenging, most research exploring fire effects
   on streams has focused on responses months to years after the event as
   opposed to during and immediately after the fire. We sought to
   understand how physical stream parameters change as wildfire burns near
   streams, how stream temperature responses vary through a stream reach,
   how parameters respond to shading from pervasive smoke during and
   shortly after the fire, and how fire severity correlates with observed
   changes. In this study, we report measurements of light, air
   temperature, stream temperature, and DO across eleven 2(nd)- to
   4(th)-order streams in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA, 1
   wk before, during, and 1 wk after an extensive wildfire in 2020. Burning
   near streams resulted in a brief increase in daily maximum stream
   temperature of 4.5 degrees C at the most severely burned site but small
   increases or decreases at less affected sites. Longitudinal replication
   revealed that temperature responses can be patchy at relatively small
   scales (similar to 50 m). DO daily minima decreased by 1.3 to 16.9\%
   saturation on the day of the fire, with the magnitude of effect
   corresponding to burn severity. Across all 11 sites, riparian and
   watershed estimates of Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after
   Wildfire and soil burn severity were better correlated with stream
   temperature responses to fire than percentage of watershed burned. Smoke
   effects were pervasive, both spatially and temporally, resulting in
   decreased light, stream temperature maxima, and diurnal variation in DO.
   Our results suggest that acute changes to physical stream parameters
   caused minimal harm to aquatic biota at our sites, and the effects of
   smoke on physical stream parameters will likely impose larger immediate
   effects on headwater streams than heating from the fire itself.},

Abstract = {The terrestrial floodplain ecosystems of the Lower Don are still poorly
   studied, although almost the entire lower reaches of the Don are
   regulated by reservoirs and low-head hydroelectric systems, which
   significantly change ecosystems and landscapes. The research was carried
   out according to our own methodology. Field studies were carried out on
   five model ecological profiles with a detailed analysis of vegetation
   and the position of surface groundwater at model points. Desk studies
   included analysis of statistical hydrological materials and satellite
   images from Landsat 2, 3, and 5 and Sentinel-2, as well as the
   determination of the state of the ecosystems and landscapes using a
   two-stage methodology for assessing disturbances in terrestrial
   ecosystems and landscapes as a result of changes in the water level in
   the study area. It has been revealed that the main factor influencing
   the change in the biotic components of ecosystems in the Lower Don
   reaches is the reduction in the amplitude of fluctuations in water
   discharges (and levels) in the annual cycle as a result of the river
   control and climate changes. The decrease in the frequency of flooding
   of the floodplain and delta areas by almost 4 times along with a 3.5
   times decrease in spring flood discharges and a 2.2 to 2.3 times
   increase in low-water discharges (both winter and summer-autumn flows)
   has led not only to a rise of the Don channel level by more than 2.5 m,
   but also to a rise and stabilization of the groundwater level (GWL) in
   the floodplain and delta of the Lower Don, which has involved a
   succession of communities of the upper and middle floodplains by
   nontypical invasive species. On the upper floodplain, native oak and elm
   forests have been almost completely replaced by green ash (Fraxinus
   pennsylvanica) and boxelder maple (Acer negundo) forests. Typical willow
   (Salix alba) forests on the middle floodplain are replaced by indigobush
   (Amorpha fruticosa) forests in the near-channel floodplain and oleaster
   (Elaeagnus angustifolia) forests in the central parts of the floodplain.
   The forb meadows of the middle floodplain are replaced by almost
   monodominant reed-grass (Calamagrostis epigeios) meadows with thorny
   weeds of thistle (Cirsium) and cocklebur (Xanthium) species. Newly
   formed nontypical floodplain communities are better resistant to a
   year-round steadily high GWL. Assessment of the disturbance of the water
   level in the ecosystems and landscapes on a 5-point scale according to
   our own methodology has shown that the least disturbed (two of the five
   possible points) areas are the areas that are most distant from the
   hydraulic structures, namely, areas in the new and old Don deltas. The
   other profiles (3-5), located in the impact zone of the hydraulic
   structures, have a moderate degree of disturbance (three points), which
   currently requires only local hydraulic and forest engineering drainage
   measures, rather than changes in the hydrological regime of the river.},

Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Long-term studies allowed the author to assign the arid areas of
   traditional livestock farming in Central Asia to regions of agriculture
   extensively developed in the past. It is well known that in Central
   Mongolia there are multiple traces of sedentary agricultural people, for
   instance, the settlement cities of the Early Medieval Period. The Uvs
   Nuur Basin area covered by bare shifting sands and the valley of its
   main stream known as the Tes-Khem River, located in Northwest Mongolia,
   were not previously regarded as regions recognized for ancient
   agriculture. Nevertheless, the author's surveys found the traces of an
   authentic ancient civilization based on agriculture within the indicated
   area. A wide range of irrigation systems, traces of ancient settlements
   and cities, and the specific character of ancient agricultural
   landscapes would clearly suggest conducting a comprehensive study of the
   ancient history and the anthropogenic impact on the environments in this
   region. Certain agriculture-related objects, whose properties are of
   great interest for understanding the history of human civilization in
   the Uvs Nuur basin, the Tes-Khem River valley, and Central Asia, are
   considered in this article. The study is based on the decryption of
   satellite images (Google.Earth, Infokart, and Syssoft), landscape
   observations, the geological, geographical, archeological, and
   historical methods, toponymy, and complex soil surveys. Palegeographic
   features are shown based on the analyses of carpological remains. The
   objects of the complex system research are the agricultural settlements
   and the irrigation systems across the upper Tes-Khem River valley
   (Mongolia) confined to young tectonic-surface rupture zones and Cenozoic
   basaltoid evolution areas at the absolute elevation of approximately
   1700 m and the settlement in its lower-course landscape, consisting of
   clay-wall structures unaffected by later aonthropogenic impacts
   (Mongolia). The survey of land sites in the Lake Shara-Nuur area (the
   Uvs Nuur Basin, Tyva) confined to the lowland peatlands and the peat
   soils is quite informative. Wheat caryopses in similar peat soils on the
   territory of neighboring Mongolia were previously found within a survey.
   A strong anthropogenic impact on the environment (deforestation and uses
   of agricultural and irrigated landscapes as pastures were followed by
   overgrazing) caused soil degradation, a groundwater level decline,
   landscape desertification, and terminal agricultural decline. The
   complex system of research into the ancient agriculture developed by the
   author lays the foundations for landscape archaeology of arid regions in
   Central Asia.},

Abstract = {Climate indices are important tools to better understand the effects of
   climate change in future time periods. We collected the daily mean
   temperature and precipitation for the years 1961-1990 from Gorgan
   meteorological stations. Then, climate change scenarios were simulated
   for three future time intervals (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under RCP 26,
   RCP 45 and RCP 85 emission scenarios using CANESM2 model. The De
   Martonne Aridity Index and Emberger Index change were calculated for the
   future time periods. Ouran alysis showed that based on the monthly De
   Martonne Aridity Index value range, April to October are arid months
   while the remaining months are semi-arid for RCP 26, RCP 45 and RCP 85
   emission scenarios of CANESM2. This may be partly due to a decrease of
   precipitation with increasing temperature in April to October.
   Therefore, agricultural areas require irrigation during these times.
   During summer, humidity will decrease in all the three future time
   periods for RCP 26 and RCP 45 scenarios. The same is also true for RCP
   85 scenario except June of 2020s during which humidity is expected to be
   constant. Overall, humidity is projected to increase in most of the
   months in the three future time periods for RCP 26, RCP 45 and RCP 85
   emission scenarios. The projected Aridity index of Emberger values shows
   a trend similar to the De Martonne Aridity Index. The R (2) indicate a
   high correlation between De Martonne and Emberger indices proving
   similar trend of the two indices for changes in all the three future
   time periods.},

Abstract = {Assessment of the Finnish wolf population relies on multiple sources of

   the information contained in different data sets (point observations,
   non-invasive genetics, known mortalities) for the estimation of the
   number of territories occupied by family packs and pairs. The output of
   the assessment model is a joint probability distribution, which
   describes current knowledge about the number of wolves within each
   territory. The joint distribution can be used to derive probability
   distributions for the total number of wolves in all territories and for
   the pack status within each territory. Most of the data set comprises of
   both voluntary-provided point observations and DNA samples provided by
   volunteers and research personnel. The new method reduces the role of
   expert judgement in the assessment process, providing increased
   transparency and repeatability.},

Abstract = {Seasonal changes in mRNA levels of the giant sarcomeric cytoskeletal
   proteins titin and obscurin were studied in the skeletal m. longissimus
   dorsi and the cardiac (left ventricular) muscle in the long-tailed
   ground squirrel Urocitellus undulatus using real-time RT-PCR. The
   animals were divided into the following experimental groups: ``summer
   activity{''}, ``fall activity{''}, ``hypothermia{''} (hibernation),
   ``winter activity{''} (n = 5 per group). In the cardiac muscle of
   ``hypothermia{''} animals, titin mRNA levels decreased by 28\% (p <=
   0.01); in the other three groups, no statistically significant
   differences in this parameter were found. In m. longissimus dorsi of
   ``hypothermia{''} and ``winter activity{''} animals, titin mRNA levels
   increased by 2.9 (p <= 0.01) and 3.6 (p <= 0.01) times, respectively,
   with no statistically significant differences in this parameter in
   ``summer activity{''} and ``fall activity{''} animals. Obscurin mRNA
   levels increased by 3.4-3.6 times (p <= 0.01) in the cardiac muscle of
   ``fall activity{''}, ``hypothermia{''} and ``winter activity{''}
   animals, and by 3.0 and 3.6 times (p <= 0.01) in the skeletal muscle of
   ``hypothermia{''} and ``winter activity{''} animals, respectively. Thus,
   we report here for the first time the data on the differential
   expression of titin and obscurin mRNAs, indicating concerted changes in
   the giant cytoskeletal proteins in muscles of the long-tailed ground
   squirrel during hibernation. The results are discussed in the context of
   striated muscle adaptation to hibernation in this rodent species.},

Title = {Mechanisms of Testosterone Effects on the Transport Protein
   P-Glycoprotein},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1514-1522},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an efflux membrane transport protein that plays
   an important role in the protection of tumor cells from cytostatics and
   drug pharmacokinetics. Testosterone is known to be able to reduce Pgp
   activity and expression, but the mechanisms of its action remain
   unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanism
   underlying the effect of testosterone on Pgp functioning, specifically,
   the role of androgen (AR), pregnane X (PXR), and constitutive androstane
   (CAR) receptors in this mechanism both in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro
   experiments on Caco-2 cell line, testosterone (1 and 10 mu M, 24 h)
   reduced the Pgp level (Western blotting) compared to the control. The
   PXR inhibitor ketoconazole (1 and 10 mu M, 24 h) did not affect the Pgp
   level, while the CAR inhibitor CINPA (10 mu M) reduced it. The
   combination of CINPA (10 mu M) and testosterone (10 mu M) also reduced
   the Pgp level, however, the latter was not significantly different from
   the values obtained with CINPA and testosterone applied individually. In
   in vivo experiments on male Chinchilla rabbits, single intramuscular
   injection of testosterone undecanoate (24 mg/kg b.w.) increased the
   serum testosterone level on day 21 compared to the control, whereas
   after orchiectomy, its content decreased on postoperative day 21.
   Relative Pgp and CAR levels in the rabbit jejunum decreased after
   testosterone injection and increased with orchiectomy. PXR and AR levels
   in the rabbit jejunum did not change significantly. Thus, both in vitro
   and in vivo experiments demonstrated that testosterone inhibits the CAR
   and thus reduces the level of the transport protein Pgp.},

Abstract = {In order to assist the implementation of the European policies on
   Invasive Alien Species (IAS Regulation) and mitigate the impact of alien
   species that threaten the marine ecosystem services and biodiversity,
   accurate lists of alien species per European Member State are required.
   Although inventories of marine alien species and relevant information
   about them have been reported for the Black Sea marine region of Romania
   and Bulgaria, a validated list of alien species for the two countries is
   still lacking. In this paper we (i) propose a validated list of the
   marine alien species occurring in the Romanian and Bulgarian Black Sea
   regions, and (ii) address errors, gaps and uncertainties associated with
   listing alien species from the marine waters of the two countries. The
   list of alien species includes 37 species for Romania and 26 for
   Bulgaria, with the highest number of alien species belonging to the
   phylum Arthopoda for both countries. The majority of alien species have
   been classified as successfully established in the marine waters of both
   countries. Thirteen alien species were classified as invasive in Romania
   whilst eight alien species were classed as invasive in Bulgaria. The
   historical overview indicates that the number of alien species has
   steadily increased over the last 50 years both in Romania and Bulgaria.
   The results of our study provide the baseline list and information for
   addressing marine alien species at a national level and a starting point
   for selecting the invasive alien species for risk assessment towards an
   effective implementation of the IAS Regulation. In conclusion, this
   study provides supporting information for implementing measures to
   tackle the introduction of alien species in the western region of the
   Black Sea. These measures are needed to build an early warning,
   prevention, and control of invasive alien species in the Black Sea, a
   unique and fragile ecosystem.},

Title = {A Comparative Assessment of Hematological Indicators of Paddlefish

   and Fish-Breeding Purposes},
Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study was aimed at assessing the state of reproductive function
   according to the fish-breeding, hematological, and morphophysiological
   parameters of the female paddlefish Polyodonspathula (Walbaum, 1792),
   which have repeatedly matured and spawned for food and fish breeding
   purposes. The work was carried out in 2019-2020 at the BIOS experimental
   aquaculture complex in the Astrakhan region. It has been shown that the
   age of the fish, the number of maturations, and the interspawning
   periods are the most important factors that made it possible to compare
   the fish-breeding and biological parameters of paddlefish females that
   matured and spawned in 2020. The stability of the coefficient of fatness
   explains the degree of activity of the reproductive function of female
   paddlefish. Significant differences in morphophysiological parameters
   between age groups, as well as between females from which caviar for
   various purposes was obtained, have not been shown. The leukocyte
   formula of the blood of the studied paddlefish females showed a lymphoid
   character and viscoelastic properties of leukocytes, as well as the cell
   agglutination noted during the separation of individual blood
   components. The distribution of leukocyte types differed slightly
   depending on the age composition (CV = 35.55 and 35.23\%, P < 0.05; CV =
   23.96 and 30.92\%, P < 0.05, 23, and 18 years, respectively). The
   results of hematological studies showed that the younger generation (18
   years old) of female paddlefish, from which caviar was obtained for food
   purposes, is better adapted than the older generation (23 years old),
   and the development of reproductive function is less susceptible to
   stress factors during maturation. A different picture is observed for
   fish that have spawned for fish breeding purposes.},

Volume = {41},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Invasive species are the 2(nd)-greatest threat to global freshwater
   biodiversity. Crayfish are especially robust invaders due to their
   omnivorous nature and ability to compete both directly (resource
   procurement) and indirectly (habitat occupation and modification) with
   native species. The Northern Crayfish (Faxonius virilis Hagen, 1870) was
   introduced to the North Saskatchewan River basin (Alberta, western
   Canada) and has persisted there since the early 1990s. Faxonius virilis'
   impacts on native fish assemblages in the North Saskatchewan River have
   yet to be assessed, even though the watershed is ecologically,
   economically, and culturally valuable and home to multiple sensitive and
   at-risk fish species. We aimed to identify the instream environmental
   characteristics associated with F. virilis occupancy in the North
   Saskatchewan River basin and to determine which currently unoccupied
   tributaries are most vulnerable to F. virilis invasion. We used
   occupancy modeling to meet these objectives. We deployed 24-h baited
   crayfish traps and measured water temperature, turbidity, flow velocity,
   and physical complexity at 37 sites along the Alberta portion of the
   North Saskatchewan River basin. We detected F. virilis at 13/37 sites
   with no occurrences detected in the upper basin. Occupancy model
   selection and averaging revealed that water temperature alone was
   associated with occupancy of F. virilis in the North Saskatchewan River
   basin. Streams with mean summer water temperatures >similar to 19
   degrees C were >= 50\% more likely to be occupied by F. virilis than
   cooler streams and are at highest risk of invasion. Further, we found
   that streams with mean summer water temperatures F. virilis than warmer
   streams. Coldwater streams may thus have some natural protection against
   F. virilis invasion. The results from this study provide practical
   guidelines for watershed management of invasive F. virilis populations
   in western Canadian river basins. Managing F. virilis is particularly
   important and time sensitive because F. virilis' range will likely
   expand when water temperatures in the basin rise because of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Neuroendocrine control mediated by glucocorticoids is important for
   maintaining the normal functioning of the brain and the balance between
   the excitation and inhibition systems. Glucocorticoids regulate the
   state of the brain glutamatergic system both directly, through receptors
   on glutamatergic synapses, and indirectly. The dysfunction of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its inability to optimally
   regulate glutamatergic synaptic plasticity leads to the development of
   neuropsychiatric diseases, while hyperglutamatergic conditions can play

Title = {Effects of Nephrectomy on the Electrical Field Stimulation-Evoked
   Changes in Tone of Arteries from the Normotensive and Spontaneously
   Hypertensive Rats},

Abstract = {The effects of nephrectomy on the electrical field stimulation-evoked
   changes in tone of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat
   (SHR) superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and internal carotid artery (ICA)
   segments were studied. The hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   leads to an increase in neurogenic vascular tone in both normal and
   hypertensive animals was tested. 5/6 nephrectomy in the rats was used as
   a model of CKD. Neurogenic constriction of the segments was induced by
   the electrical field stimulation of the perivascular nerves in the
   absence and presence of potassium channels blockers (tetraethylammonium,
   glibenclamide) or methylene blue, a guanylyl-cyclase inhibitor. In the
   absence of blockers, nephrectomy was found to increase neurogenic
   contraction only in SMA from WKY. In addition, in SMA, this effect of
   nephrectomy was manifested in the presence of glibenclamide. In the
   presence of blockers, the neurogenic response of the SMA from SHR did
   not depend on nephrectomy, while in ICA from nephrectomized rats under
   these conditions, neurogenic constriction in WKY and dilatation in SHR
   was more significant than in control animals. Nephrectomy-related
   increase in artery constriction in WKY was also evoked by phenylephrine
   in SMA and tetraethylammonium in ICA, while in SHR, nephrectomy led to a
   decrease in ICA constriction evoked by phenylephrine and
   tetraethylammonium. The data obtained suggest that CKD may lead to an
   increase in neurogenic and chemical-induced vascular tone in
   normotensive animals and to its decrease in initially hypertensive
   animals. To the greatest extent, these changes can be expressed in the
   ICA and are associated with an increase in the activity of potassium
   channels and guanylyl-cyclase in this artery in CKD in initially
   normotensive animals and with a decrease in this activity in initially
   hypertensive animals.},

Title = {Does predation risk affect spatial use in an introduced ungulate
   species? The case of a Mediterranean mouflon alpine colony},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Predation risk is known to affect the spatial use of prey species,
   imposing a trade-off between feeding requirements and predation
   avoidance. As a result, prey species can leave high-quality forage areas
   to use sub-optimal, but safer, habitat patches, defined as ``refuge
   areas.{''} In this study, we describe changes in the spatial use of an
   introduced ungulate species, the Mediterranean mouflon Ovis aries
   musimon, following the recolonization (in 1996) of wolves Canis lupus
   into the Albergian Hunting Estate (Italian Western Alps). Since 1988, we
   monitored the mouflon population by spring counts from vantage points.
   We georeferenced all observations and recorded the size and structure of
   the spotted groups. Finally, we identified available refuges by
   selecting patches characterized by (i) the presence of rocks and (ii)
   high values of steepness and ruggedness. We found that mouflons
   significantly reduced the average distance from refuge areas over the
   years, with the yearly average distance from refuges being 56\% lower
   after wolves recolonized the area (i.e., 93.8 +/- 32.1 vs. 213.1 +/-
   40.9 m). The analysis of orographic parameters showed that mouflons used
   patches with higher values in elevation, slope, ruggedness, and a
   significant difference in all three parameters when comparing years pre
   and post wolf return. Both sexes were significantly affected, but ewes
   were particularly sensitive and selected patches closer to refuge areas
   (75.8 +/- 30.3 m) than males (131.0 +/- 53.6 m). Our results suggest
   that the presence of new predators can alter the distribution of an
   introduced species such as the Mediterranean mouflon, triggering the
   resurgence of anti-predation behavior.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The organization of species metacommunities can be controlled by local
   factors, such as habitat quality, landscape factors, such as land use,
   and spatial factors, such as stream network distances. Species within a
   metacommunity have different traits that may be used to understand the
   determinants of community structure. This study aimed to understand how
   changes in environmental and spatial factors affected stream fish
   assemblages delineated based on their dispersal-related traits, such as
   preferential habitat use (i.e., benthic, nektobenthic, nektonic,
   marginal, and surface), preference for water velocity (i.e., fast,
   intermediate, and slow), and body size (i.e., small, medium, and large).
   We sampled 18 stream reaches in a dendritic network in the Upper Parana
   River basin, located in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used variation
   partitioning techniques to test the relative effects of local
   environmental, landscape, and spatial variables on different species
   groups defined according to dispersal-related traits. Environmental and
   spatial variables weakly explained the variation in total assemblage
   taxonomic composition. However, based on different functional trait
   groups, we found that the environment had a strong relationship with
   assemblage composition of nektobenthic and small fish, whereas spatial
   variables were most strongly associated with marginal and surface fish.
   Large-scale spatial variables were associated with large fish and those
   that prefer slow water, whereas fine-scale variables were associated
   with small and surface-dwelling fish. These findings help improve
   understanding of how functional composition of stream fish assemblages
   may be affected by urban development, riparian conversion, and resulting
   changes in local environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Determination of national goals for achieving a land degradation
   neutrality (LDN) and the creation of systems of indicators for
   monitoring is an important strategic task for combating desertification
   and preventing land degradation in Turkmenistan, due to the
   implementation of target 15.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals
   for the period up to 2030. This paper analyzes the possibility of
   integrating global indicators of the LDN into the National System for
   Land Monitoring of Turkmenistan, which is currently being developed, and
   provides statistical and geoinformation data for the entire territory of
   the country. It has been found that, despite the new important data
   obtained using global approaches, reliable monitoring of the LDN based
   on national data is not fully feasible at present due to the fact that
   global indicators are not sufficiently confirmed by the available
   national data and do not correspond to global proxy indicators of
   dynamics of land cover, productivity, and stocks of soil organic carbon.
   This article proposes a working list of national analogue indicators and
   ways to validate them, as well as options for using lists of land use
   types to compile a matrix of negative and positive transitions with
   changes in land cover. It is recommended to use cartographic and fund
   data collected and processed in the late 1980s-90s as a ``baseline{''}
   for monitoring land degradation, as well as materials on the assessment
   of the state of specially protected natural areas. Additional and
   alternative indicators of the LDN, which are of particular importance
   for Turkmenistan: salinization of soils and lands, soil deflation,
   climate aridity, and dust storms, are proposed.},

Abstract = {Significant degradation of the Agrakhan Bay on the eastern coast of the
   Terek River delta has occurred in the course of the 20th century as a
   result of the combined action of natural and anthropogenic factors.
   Comprehensive studies conducted by the authors in 2018-2020 have made it
   possible to describe the main causes of this degradation, characterize
   the current state of the reservoir, and establish scientific bases under
   recommendations for its improvement. It has been demonstrated that as a
   result of partial drying and reduction of water surface area the bay has
   lost its former importance as a spawning and rearing water body
   providing the West Caspian region with the younglings of valuable
   commercial fish species. By 2018, the catches decreased by ten times
   compared to the early 20th century with sturgeons having almost totally
   disappeared. The state of the northern part of the bay, which has
   transformed into a group of shallow water bodies almost entirely
   separated from each other and from the sea is particularly unfavourable.
   The study of hydrological and morphological, hydrobiological,
   fishery-related and hydrochemical parameters has shown that the
   improvement of the wetlands at the former bay site is possible. Detailed
   analysis of the water balance using multivariate limnological
   calculations has shown that there is enough water for watering and
   partial restoration of the water bodies of the Agrakhan Bay hydrographic
   system. Clearing of silted and overgrown canals, deepening and berming
   of the remaining water bodies, and directing the necessary amounts of
   river water into Northern and Southern Agrakhan Bay (in accordance with
   the calculated delivery schedule) will allow reduction of the
   overgrowing and siltation of water bodies, restore the water exchange
   between them, improve water quality, revive the fishery industry in the
   region, improve the habitats of many rare and protected animal species,
   and increase the recreational attractiveness of the region.},

Abstract = {Remote assessment of soil salinity in natural solonetzic complexes,
   which are characterized by subsurface salinization of soils, is a
   difficult task. However, research in this area is promising, since
   salinity is a clear limiting factor that influences vegetation growth;
   thus, it affects the spectral characteristics of vegetation. This study
   carried out an analysis of multi-temporal high-resolution space images,
   which consisted of comparison with detailed ground-based data on soil
   salinity using the principal component method and multiple linear
   regression. Images from the QuickBird (2007) and SuperView-1 (2021)
   spacecraft with a spatial resolution of 2 m were used as remote sensing
   data. Ground studies were carried out in 2011 and 2021. Soil salinity
   was estimated from the specific electrical conductivity (EC) in an
   aqueous suspension of 1 : 5. It was found that there were no significant
   changes in soil salinity in the key area over the 10-year period;
   however, there were changes in the state of vegetation, which are
   reflected on the maps of the NDVI vegetation index. Multi-temporal
   high-resolution satellite images were used as a basis to calculate the
   principal components; it was concluded that the first three components
   explained almost 97\% of the entire image variance. Models built using
   multiple linear regression analysis describe soil salinity well (R (2)
   of the model is 0.68, 0.77, 0.83 for the 0-30, 0-50, 0-100 cm layers,
   respectively). When tested on a control sample, the constructed models
   based on remote data showed good convergence (R (2) between the
   predicted and real values of EC is 0.70, 0.87, 0.83 for the 0-30, 0-50,
   0-100 cm layers, respectively). The proposed models will be useful for
   assessing the salinization of soils in the solonetzic complex in the
   south of the steppe zone according to high-resolution satellite imagery.},

Title = {Regional Climate Changes in Arid Steppes and their Connection with

Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Pages = {353-360},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based on the long-term time series of data from weather stations located
   on chestnut soils in dry steppes of the Volgograd region, the regional
   climate changes in relation to the precipitation during active
   vegetation seasons (spring and summer) have been revealed for these
   territories. The performed regression analysis has shown an increase in
   precipitation in spring and their decrease in summer. Additionally, an
   increase in the number of droughts during the summer period with the
   simultaneous decrease in aridity has been revealed; this fact is
   associated with an increased intensity of this phenomenon described by
   the Ped index and reaching a three-unit value. An insignificant inverse
   correlation between the amount of precipitation and the number of
   drought events in the summer period in the Volgogradskiy, Surovikinskiy,
   Ilovlinskiy, and Kamyshinskiy districts or aridity events in the
   Surovikinskiy district has been observed, as well as a moderate direct
   dependence on the aridity events in the Kamyshinskiy district during a
   summer period. The areas with the maximum number of drought events and,
   therefore, with the maximum risks for agricultural production have been
   identified. These areas include the Kamyshinskiy (21 and 115 drought
   events in spring and summer, respectively) and Surovikinskiy (4 and 70
   drought events in spring and summer, respectively) districts. Taking
   into account the results we obtained for all studied territories,
   especially for those that are most affected by droughts, it is necessary
   to correct the existing crop rotation schemes and the range of
   cultivated crops as well as to shift the main emphasis towards
   reclamation farming to exclude agrarian risks during efficient use of
   local land resources.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Incorporating sex ratios of nestlings into population viability studies
   increases knowledge of overall health of endangered populations.
   Currently, a reliable non-invasive method to identify the sex of golden
   eagle nestlings is not available; however, claims are commonly made
   based on morphology. Ten biometric measurements from 43 Scottish golden
   eagles aged 2-7.5 weeks were assessed to see if sex could actually be
   determined using this non-invasive methodology. Sex was confirmed via
   molecular analysis of blood samples. Discrete and principal component
   analyses of the different biometrics could not correctly determine
   individual nestling sex. Therefore, despite being more invasive,
   molecular sexing remains the recommended tool of choice for accurate sex
   identification of Scottish golden eagle nestlings younger than 7.5 weeks
   of age. This has important implications for golden eagle field studies
   where empirical morphological measurements are frequently and typically
   taken, but we have shown are not reliable in determining the sex of such
   young nestlings.},

Title = {Nutrient limitation of periphytic algal assemblages in agricultural

Abstract = {Land-use practices can deteriorate the health of aquatic ecosystems in
   lower-order streams by increasing the availability of nutrients to
   periphytic algae. The magnitude of eutrophication likely depends in part
   on the nature of nutrient limitation and other local environmental
   factors. We used nutrient diffusing substrates and assessments of
   taxonomically diagnostic pigments to experimentally identify the drivers
   of nutrient limitation of periphytic algal assemblages across 30 streams
   which collectively spanned a gradient of agricultural land-use intensity
   (cropland, pasture, and nutrients) across Boreal Forest, Grassland, and
   Parkland ecoregions in Alberta, Canada. We identified N as the primary
   limiting factor of total algal biomass accrual. Overall,
   bacillariophytes made up most of the total algal biomass response to N.
   Dissolved inorganic N to total P ratios in the water column were
   consistently low, and P amendment altered assemblage composition by
   stimulating chlorophytes over bacillariophytes. Differences in soil
   types, precipitation, runoff, and leaching potential within and across
   ecoregions did not alter the algal responses to the experimental
   nutrient amendments. The effect of N-limiting conditions observed across
   most streams had greater relative importance than other potential
   abiotic factors (e.g., light) on algal growth. Whereas a historical
   focus on P management remains important, our findings highlight the need
   to increase the attention and focus on N in watershed management plans
   during the summer months to mitigate eutrophication of agricultural
   streams.},

Abstract = {One of the key elements responsible for the thyroid response to
   thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the TSH receptor (TSHR), which
   belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Binding of TSH or
   stimulatory autoantibodies to the TSHR extracellular domain triggers
   multiple signaling pathways in target cells that are mediated through
   various types of G proteins and beta-arrestins. Inhibitory
   autoantibodies, in contrast, suppress TSHR activity, inducing
   hypothyroid states. Activating mutations lead to constitutively active
   TSHR forms and can trigger cancer. Therefore, the TSHR is one of the key
   targets for the regulation of thyroid function and thyroid status, as
   well as correction of diseases caused by changes in TSHR activity
   (autoimmune hyper- and hypothyroidism, Graves' ophthalmopathy, thyroid
   cancer). TSH preparations are extremely rarely used in medicine due to
   their immunogenicity and severe side effects. Most promising is the
   development of low-molecular allosteric TSHR regulators with an activity
   of full and inverse agonists and neutral antagonists, which are able to
   penetrate into the allosteric site located in the TSHR transmembrane
   domain and specifically bind to it, thus controlling the ability of the
   receptor to interact with G proteins and beta-arrestins. Allosteric
   regulators do not affect the binding of TSH and autoantibodies to the
   receptor, which enables mild and selective regulation of thyroid
   function, while avoiding critical changes in TSH and thyroid hormone
   levels. The present review addresses the current state of the problem of
   regulating TSHR activity, including the possibility of using ligands of
   its allosteric sites.},

Abstract = {The effect of the lowering of body temperature on the responses of
   cerebral arteries was studied in anesthetized (urethane, 1000 mg/kg)
   male Wistar rats in conditions of hemodynamic stability and after
   pre-induced acute massive blood loss. Changes in the diameter of the
   pial arteries (initial diameter 10-40 mu m) were evaluated via
   intravital microscopy in four experimental groups: without and with
   pre-induced blood loss (35\% of the circulating blood volume), and in
   each group, at room temperature (22-23 degrees C) and during gradually
   developing cold-water immersion hypothermia (12-13 degrees C) until
   respiratory arrest. In the groups with pre-induced blood loss,
   respiratory arrest came about at room temperature after an average of 3
   h with a decrease in body temperature to 32.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, while
   during immersion cooling, it occurred after 2.5 h at 15.1 +/- 0.8
   degrees C. In the groups without blood loss, respiratory arrest did not
   come about at room temperature for more than 3.5 h of observation,
   although rectal temperature decreased to 34.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; during
   immersion cooling, respiratory arrest was observed after 3 h at a body
   temperature of 13.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C. During the lowering of body
   temperature, the rats of all experimental groups showed
   vasoconstriction. In the groups with blood loss, the reduction in the
   diameter of the pial vessels accounted for 10-15\% of the initial
   immediately after blood withdrawal and more than 30\% of that during
   subsequent immersion cooling. In rats without blood loss, the
   constriction of pial arteries during immersion cooling was significantly
   less. Thus, systemic hypothermia aggravates microcirculatory dysfunction
   induced by acute massive blood loss, suggesting an additive effect of
   hypothermia and hemorrhage on vasoconstrictor responses of the pial
   arteries in rats.},

Abstract = {Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) is a widely distributed aquatic
   gastropod, primarily found in tropical regions, which has also invaded
   geothermally heated waters in temperate regions. The spread of M.
   tuberculata globally has primarily been in association with the aquarium
   trade and aquatic plants. In New Zealand, M. tuberculata is known from
   both the aquarium trade and from one non-indigenous population in a
   geothermal stream. To date, the origins of M. tuberculata in the
   aquarium trade in New Zealand-or elsewhere-has not been systematically
   examined genetically, and it has not been confirmed whether New
   Zealand's non -indigenous population is genetically similar to, or
   originated from, individuals sold in aquarium stores. We examined the
   origins of New Zealand M. tuberculata, in the aquarium trade, and in the
   established non-indigenous population using COI marker sequences.
   Representatives of M. tuberculata in New Zealand have not originated
   from a single source; two distinct genetic clades were identified for
   individuals, with the origins of each inferred to be from Asia and
   Africa. The non-indigenous population and individuals sourced from one
   private aquarium owner were found to originate in Asia, and are
   genetically similar to those collected from Singapore, one of the most
   significant countries globally for the culturing and distribution of
   aquarium species. The remaining collections, from a display aquarium and
   three online suppliers in various New Zealand locations, were most
   similar genetically to populations native to Lake Malawi and Tanganyika,
   and non-indigenous populations from Australia. Overall, as M.
   tuberculata is an obligate parthenogen, each independently introduced
   clone may be considered a distinct non-indigenous taxon. We recommend
   further systematic genetic analyses of individuals in the aquarium trade
   elsewhere, to assess more fully the diversity and origins of Melanoides
   being transported in the aquarium trade.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions have become a defining feature of marine
   Mediterranean ecosystems with significant impacts on biodiversity,
   ecosystem services, and human health. We systematically reviewed the
   current knowledge on the impacts of marine biological invasions in the
   Mediterranean Sea. We screened relevant literature and applied a
   standardised framework that classifies mechanisms and magnitude of
   impacts and type of evidence. Overall, 103 alien and cryptogenic species
   were analysed, 59 of which were associated with both negative and
   positive impacts, 17 to only negative, and 13 to only positive; no
   impacts were found for 14 species. Evidence for most reported impacts
   (52\%) was of medium strength, but for 32\% of impact reports evidence
   was weak, based solely on expert judgement. Only 16\% of the reported
   impacts were based on experimental studies. Our assessment allowed us to
   create an inventory of 88 alien and cryptogenic species from 16
   different phyla with reported moderate to high impacts. The ten worst
   invasive species in terms of reported negative impacts on biodiversity
   include six algae, two fishes, and two molluscs, with the green alga
   Caulerpa cylindracea ranking first. Negative impacts on biodiversity
   prevailed over positive ones. Competition for resources, the creation of
   novel habitat through ecosystem engineering, and predation were the
   primary reported mechanisms of negative effects. Most cases of combined
   negative and positive impacts on biodiversity referred to
   community-level modifications. Overall, more positive than negative
   impacts were reported on ecosystem services, but this varied depending
   on the service. For human health, only negative impacts were recorded.
   Substantial variation was found among Mediterranean ecoregions in terms
   of mechanisms of impact and the taxonomic identity of impacting species.
   There was no evidence that the magnitude of impact increases with
   residence time. Holistic approaches and experimental research constitute
   the way forward to better understanding and managing biological
   invasions.},

Abstract = {The monogenean freshwater parasite Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957
   is endemic to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) east of the Baltic Sea, but
   has spread outside this area via transport and stocking of fish. In
   Norway and Russia, infections with G. salaris have had catastrophic
   consequences for many salmon populations. The parasite is also common on
   farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) where it can persist in low
   numbers and without clinical signs. The transport and movement of
   infected rainbow trout is an important factor in the spreading of G.
   salaris in Europe. Due to increasing interest in establishing rainbow
   trout farms in White Sea drainages in Murmansky Oblast, Russia, and the
   potential subsequent unintentional spreading of G. salaris,
   parasitological examinations of salmonids were carried out. Farmed
   rainbow trout (n = 48) and Atlantic salmon (n = 375) from River Tuloma
   and farmed rainbow trout from Lake Imandra (n = 10), were examined in
   the period from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, environmental DNA monitoring
   was conducted for the detection of G. salaris in 2018. Gyrodactylus
   specimens were first detected in 2015 on Atlantic salmon from the
   tributary River Pak. Specimens obtained from Atlantic salmon in River
   Tuloma and from rainbow trout in River Tuloma and Lake Imandra the
   following years were confirmed to be G. salaris by sequencing of the
   nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA) and
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI). All specimens carried the same
   COI sequence, which was identical to a strain (GenBank Accession number
   AF479750) frequently found on farmed rainbow trout. The prevalence
   varied, but reached 100\% in some samples. Maximum intensity observed
   was 899, but intensities were generally lower than intensities expected
   to lead to mortalities. There was good correspondence between eDNA
   monitoring and conventional methods. The results indicate that G.
   salaris has spread to River Tuloma via transport of live rainbow trout.},

Abstract = {We examined the association between habitat parameters and gastropod
   communities across a number of freshwater ecosystems, whose biodiversity
   has been affected by increased mining activities over decades.
   Reservoirs inhabited by the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus
   antipodarum (Gray, 1843)) exhibited different abiotic conditions than
   waterbodies that were not, such as higher salinity indicators (max.
   conductivity 13400 mu S/cm, TDS 7700 mg/l and chlorides 7200 mg/l), and
   degraded water quality. In such water bodies P. antipodarum density was
   high (max. 23686/m(2)). Further, invaded waters were inhabited by less
   diverse gastropod communities than reservoirs without P. antipodarum.
   The invader has established reproducing populations and were the
   dominant species (D 87.53\%), or formed mono-specific assemblages, in
   the reservoirs. Our results indicate that P. antipodarum occurred in
   habitats whose conditions are unfavorable or less preferred by other
   species, such as those with high conductivity, and high concentrations
   of chlorides and calcium. Since this snail is known to inhabit water
   bodies with degraded water quality, we assumed that along with the
   progressing development of industries worldwide, this species will
   continue to spread to industrial areas and will inhabit increasing
   numbers of anthropogenically affected water environments. Our study
   contributes to the global understanding of the mechanisms involved in
   successful establishment in waters by P. antipodarum, and is especially
   novel in addressing its occurrence in anthropogenically created
   ecosystems. Our results showed that human impact is the cause of the
   trend in P. antipodarum populations, and compared habitats from the
   perspective of both abiotic parameters and community structure. Human
   activities can have a significant impact on water quality that can
   result in the permanent establishment of P. antipodarum populations,
   especially when the environment is not favorable for the native species.},

Title = {Wildlife conservation in Myanmar: trade in wild sheep and goats for
   meat, medicine, and trophies, with links to China, India, and Thailand},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},

Abstract = {In Myanmar, the hunting and trade of wildlife are increasingly
   recognised as a major threat to the persistence of species. We here
   focus on the trade and conservation of wild sheep and goats (Caprinae;
   Antilopinae) as these species are indeed hunted and traded for a variety
   of reasons. Seizure reports from 2000 to 2020 and 20 visits to four
   wildlife markets between 1998 and 2017 resulted in records of similar to
   2,000 body parts, the equivalent of similar to 1,200 wild sheep and
   goats. When combined with data from previous surveys conducted over the
   same period, the number of wild sheep and goats recorded in trade
   increase substantially, i.e. serow (the equivalent of 1,243 animals),
   goral (213 animals), takin (190 animals), blue sheep (37 animals), and
   Tibetan antelope (10 animals). With records from 10 out of 15 States,
   trade appears to be widespread and persistent over time. There was poor
   concordance between seizure data and trade observations, but data from
   various surveys are largely in agreement. The most prevalent body parts
   in trade were horns, followed by plates (the frontal portion of the
   skull with horns still attached) and heads of freshly killed animals.
   These parts are offered for sale both for decorations and for their
   purported medicinal properties. Meat, fat, and rendered oils were
   observed frequently but because of mixture with other wildlife, it was
   challenging to confirm species identify or to convert this to number of
   animal equivalents. Tongues and eyes were offered for sale as medicine.
   In order to better protect wild sheep and goats in Myanmar, it is
   imperative that the illegal trade in their parts is more effectively
   curbed than at present. This is the responsibility of both the Myanmar
   authorities and, given the high prevalence of trade in border towns,
   their international partners, including China and Thailand.},

   information on the distribution of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies along
   the Neckar River in Germany, a tributary of the Rhine River. The western
   tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris was first recorded on the Neckar
   River in 2007, followed by bighead goby Ponticola kessleri and round
   goby Neogobius melanostomus in 2009 and 2012, respectively. The current
   distribution boundary for Ponto-Caspian gobies coincides with the
   navigation limit for cargo ships at the river port of Plochingen (about
   200 km up-stream of the city of Mannheim). Marked differences in fish
   assemblages took place following invasion of the round goby, with
   average CPUE of native stone loach Barbatula barbatula and gudgeon Gobio
   gobio declining from 19.6 and 21.5 individuals per 100 m, respectively,
   to fewer than one. Bighead gobies failed to build up a stable stock
   after round goby invasion but have still been caught in small numbers at
   most sampling sections. The earlier-arriving western tubenose goby could
   not be detected any longer. The results indicate a strong impact of the
   round goby on native fish assemblages in the Neckar River which will
   hamper efforts to improve the ecological quality of the river. Further
   investigations are needed to assess long term effects of round goby
   invasion and find solutions for achieving the mandatory European Water
   Framework Directive (WFD) target of ``good ecological status `` of the
   river.},

Abstract = {Artificial food subsidies like landfills generate very strong impacts on
   animal ecology and spatial behavior. Landfills indeed have been
   considered to be one of the most influential factors explaining the very
   fast recovery of many colonial waterbird populations worldwide, as
   documented for the white stork Ciconia ciconia. More recently, the
   increase of rice fields in some regions have also been argued to be part
   of an influencial process underlying the spatio-temporal distribution
   patterns of this species over many areas in southern Europe. It remains
   unknown whether these two habitat factors play an important role at
   explaining the spatial distribution pattern of the white stork and, more
   particularly, whether colony funding or colony size is dependent on
   them. Using data from a census conducted in 2018, we aimed to assess the
   effect of distance to a landfill or to rice fields, among other habitat
   factors, on the breeding colony size of a white stork population in
   northern Spain. Larger colonies were more likely to appear in trees or
   cliff, but less likely in buildings or other artificial substrates. They
   were also significantly more likely with decreasing distance to
   landfill, and when the habitat was dominated by dry cropland and meadows
   close to water bodies. Rice fields did not seem to have any significant
   effect. Our findings fit with those from other regions in Europe, and
   highlight the effect landfills have on population dynamics and spatial
   ecology for those species which are able to feed on this type of food
   subsidy. Our results also show that the main habitat cover over large
   geographic scales still plays a role independently of landfills. The
   European agricultural policies associated with the type and management
   of crops, and the Common Agricultural Policy in particular, will still
   have a decisive role for the species.},

Title = {Potential for significant precipitation cycling by forest-floor litter
   and deadwood},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The forest-floor litter layer can retain substantial volumes of water,
   thus affecting evaporation and soil-moisture dynamics. However, litter
   layer wetting/drying dynamics are often overlooked when estimating
   forest water budgets. Here, we present field and laboratory experiments
   characterizing water cycling in the forest-floor litter layer and
   outline its implications for subcanopy microclimatic conditions and for
   estimates of transpiration and recharge. Storage capacities of spruce
   needle litter and beech broadleaf litter averaged 3.1 and 1.9 mm,
   respectively, with drainage/evaporation timescales exceeding 2 days.
   Litter-removal experiments showed that litter reduced soil water
   recharge, reduced soil evaporation rates, and insulated against ground
   heat fluxes that impacted snowmelt. Deadwood stored similar to 0.7 mm of
   water, increasing with more advanced states of decomposition, and
   retained water for >7 days. Observed daily cycles in deadwood weight
   revealed decreasing water storage during daytime as evaporation
   progressed and increasing storage at night from condensation or
   absorption. Water evaporating from the forest-floor litter layer
   modulates the subcanopy microclimate by increasing humidity, decreasing
   temperature, and reducing VPD. Despite the relatively small litter
   storage capacity (<3.1 mm in comparison to similar to 10(2) mm for
   typical forest soil rooting zones), the litter layer alone retained and
   cycled 18\% of annual precipitation, or 1/3 of annual
   evapotranspiration. These results suggest that overlooking litter
   interception may lead to substantial overestimates of recharge and
   transpiration in many forest ecosystems.},

Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The interception by the lower (abaxial) side of needle leaves not only
   contributes to the forest evapotranspiration but will also cause a
   diffusion barrier of CO2 over the stomata and depresses the plant gas
   exchange. This study combined the eddy covariance (EC) technique and
   leaf wetness measurement with a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer
   (SVAT) multilayer model to examine the occurrence of interception
   evaporation from both sides of leaves at a Japanese cypress forest
   canopy relating to rainfall intensity and different wetting periods. We
   compared the measured latent heat flux (lambda E) with the simulated wet
   canopy lambda E with two models that interception evaporation only
   happens from the upper (adaxial) side of leaves and both sides of
   leaves. Both models showed a low lambda E during the rainfall as the EC
   data did. The simulated lambda E at the wet period after rainfall
   indicates that the interception evaporation from both sides of leaves is
   more likely to happen after heavy rainfall (>15 mm/12 h). However, for
   the most frequent small rainfall events (0-5 mm/12 h) at this site,
   interception evaporation is more likely to occur only from the adaxial
   side than both sides, which helps the wet leaves to maintain stomata
   opening and process CO2 uptake after rainfall.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Citizen science networks have the potential to record data that can be
   used to diagnose the causes of wildlife mortality events and enable
   action to prevent recurrence. From 2012 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019,
   volunteers recorded the occurrence of grounded Common Pipistrelle bats
   in association with seasonal swarming that takes place during late
   summer and early autumn at Durham Cathedral cloister, involving up to
   197 recorded groundings and 64 confirmed deaths in a single year.
   Post-mortem examinations were also carried out on a sample of bats that
   died in the cloister each year from 2017 to 2019. Groundings involved
   juvenile bats showing a near-typical weight distribution for the time of
   year, and weight had no influence on the survival of bats undergoing
   rehabilitation. Grounding frequency generally peaked in August, but
   varied from year to year in parallel with variation in the timing of
   swarming. Variation in the daily frequency of groundings was influenced
   by weather conditions during the previous night and showed a strong
   positive association with concurrent daytime temperature. Post-mortems
   revealed no evidence of injury, infectious disease or chemical
   contamination, but disclosed a range of evidence consistent with acute
   heatstroke. In aggregate, the results suggest that groundings and deaths
   occur among juvenile bats that elect to roost within the roof of the
   cloister walkways during swarming visits, and then suffer heatstroke
   resulting from direct insolation of the roof and its surrounds during
   daylight.},

Title = {Effect of lipid levels and size in invasive carp overwinter survival},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {300-307},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most important dynamic rate functions (i.e.,
   recruitment, growth, and mortality). Often, recruitment can be heavily
   dependent on overwinter survival. Wintertime presents thermal and
   metabolic challenges to fish. Studies have suggested that overwinter
   survival and mortality is correlated to lipid content before entering
   winter. Inadequate lipid reserves are related to poor condition and may
   lead to overwinter mortality. Young fish need to accumulate adequate
   lipid reserves before entering winter. In the Mississippi River, where
   silver carp Hypophthalmichthys moltrix Valenciennes, 1844 are hyper
   abundant, silver carp are not experiencing recruitment issues. As such,
   we evaluated lipid levels and size as potential silver carp recruitment
   regulators. Silver carp were collected by the Long Term Resource
   Monitoring element in 2015 on the middle Mississippi River using mini
   fyke nets; total lengths ranged from 34-177 mm. Lipid levels of whole
   carp were determined using the phosphovanillin assay. No difference in
   lipid levels (mg/g) was observed between spring and fall fishes.
   Additionally, we observed no relation between total length and lipid
   levels. Size structure did not significantly differ between fall age-0
   and spring age-1 silver carp. Our results suggest there may not be a
   size dependent overwinter mortality/survival in silver carp in the
   middle Mississippi River. Additionally, lipids may not be a driving
   factor in overwinter mortality/survival. Our research suggests silver
   carp in the Mississippi River basin do not follow most early life
   history paradigms and may explain the successful nature of the silver
   carp invasion.},

Abstract = {Atractolytocestus huronensis Anthony, 1958 has been co-introduced with
   its cyprinid host Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, common carp, to
   several continents. This cestode was only recently (2012) detected in
   South Africa and occur in two major river systems. In Africa, A.
   huronensis has only been reported from C. carpio. During routine
   parasitological surveys in the Vaal River system in central South
   Africa, unidentified cestodes were recorded from common carp at several
   localities. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, alongside
   genetic characterisation, they were identified as A. huronensis, greatly
   expanding the distribution of this parasite in the upper reaches of the
   Vaal River system and indicating rapid spread in the system. Thereafter,
   in November 2020, more caryophyllidean cestodes were detected infecting
   native smallmouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus aeneus (Burchell, 1822) just
   below the Vaal Dam wall. They were also morphologically and genetically
   identified as A. huronensis, indicating a possible new definitive host
   and spillover from carp. However, only juvenile worms (up to late stage
   4) were detected in L. aeneus, suggesting a paradefinitive or accidental
   infection. Their pathological effect on the intestine of L. aeneus
   mimicked that described in acute infections in common carp, with damage
   limited to the intestinal epithelium and no prominent ulcerations. This
   apparent mild infection of an indigenous host needs to be monitored. The
   spillover to L. aeneus appears to be recent as no caryophyllidean
   cestodes were collected from this host species at the same locality and
   season the previous year, nor at any of the other well studied sites in
   the Vaal River system. Chronic infection of L. aeneus may still develop
   and indicate that the near threatened largemouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus
   kimberleyensis (Gilchrist \& Thompson, 1913), may be at risk as well.},

Abstract = {The newly established population of Perna perna surveyed at four sites
   along the Israeli Mediterranean coast averaged between 2155 and 8022
   specimens/m2 in June 2021. Three sites displayed unimodal size-frequency
   distributions, whereas the site adjacent to Haifa port - a bimodal
   distribution. The population suffered catastrophic mortality following a
   succession of heatwaves culminating in a prolonged heatwave in August
   (ambient temperature 36 to 38 ?, sea surface 32 ?), with diurnal low
   tides occurring midday. With the projected rise in both mean
   temperature, and prevalence, duration, and severity of extreme high
   temperature events, it is likely that even if a P. perna reoccurs, it
   will be of brief duration.},

Abstract = {Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have proven
   cardioprotective properties, which makes this class of drugs one of the
   priorities in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
   (DM2). Ischemic stroke and chronic cerebral dyscirculation occur with
   high frequency in DM2, thus actualizing a study of SGLT2i neurotropic
   properties. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the
   neuroprotective effects of the highly selective SGLT2i empagliflozin
   (EMPA) and low-selective SGLT2i canagliflozin (CANA) on the rat model of
   acute cerebral ischemia, as well as investigate the probable mechanism
   of these effects on the brain. At the first stage, EMPA and CANA were
   administered to Wistar rats without DM2 for 7 days prior to transient
   focal 30-min cerebral ischemia modeling. After 48 h of reperfusion,
   neurological deficit was assessed by Garcia scores, and brain sections
   were then incubated in a triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution to
   evaluate the brain damage volume. The latter did not differ in EMPA and
   CANA groups and was significantly smaller compared to the control group
   of untreated rats. At the same time, neither EMPA nor CANA had a
   significant effect on neurological deficit. At the second stage, we
   modeled DM2 (high-fat diet and streptozotocin + nicotinamide), and 4
   weeks later, 8-week EMPA and CANA therapy was initiated. After the end
   of therapy, brain tissue was studied immunohistochemically. DM2
   development was accompanied by an increase in the number of
   microgliocytes in the hippocampal CA1 area; the therapy with EMPA, but
   not CANA, led to a decrease in the number of activated microgliocytes.
   Thus, the highly selective SGLT-2i EMPA and low-selective SGLT-2i CANA
   exert a similar infarct-limiting effect when applied for 7 days prior to
   ischemia modeling in Wistar rats without DM2. The neuroprotective effect
   of EMPA in DM2 may in part be due to a decrease in microglial
   activation.},

Abstract = {Brown bears (Ursus arctos) usually mate in spring throughout their
   global range, although a few cases of breeding activity are known in
   late summer and autumn. In this note, we describe four observations of
   courtship and copulations of brown bears in the wild in late August and
   September 2011, 2019, and 2021 in the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern
   Spain). These cases extend the published dates on copulations in Europe
   and the length of the mating season. These couples showed the same
   behaviour as those recorded in spring. Two females interacted with three
   different males, but we only saw them copulating with one male. Three of
   the four courtship cases occurred around a concentrated and seasonal
   source of food that congregated a large number of bears in restricted
   areas for a few weeks. We discuss the advantages that these late
   copulations can have and the uncertainties that still exist about the
   late reproduction in brown bears.},

Title = {Wild boar visits to commercial pig farms in southwest England:
   implications for disease transmission},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Contact between wild animals and farmed livestock may result in disease
   transmission with huge financial, welfare and ethical consequences.
   Conflicts between people and wildlife can also arise when species such
   as wild boar (Sus scrofa) consume crops or dig up pasture. This is a
   relatively recent problem in England where wild boar populations have
   become re-established in the last 20 years following a 500-year absence.
   The aim of this pilot study was to determine if and how often
   free-living wild boar visited two commercial pig farms near the Forest
   of Dean in southwest England. We placed 20 motion-sensitive camera traps
   at potential entry points to, and trails surrounding, the perimeter of
   two farmyards housing domestic pigs between August 2019 and February
   2021, covering a total of 6030 trap nights. Forty wild boar detections
   were recorded on one farm spread across 27 nights, with a median (range)
   of 1 (0 to 7) night of wild boar activity per calendar month. Most of
   these wild boar detections occurred between ten and twenty metres of
   housed domestic pigs. No wild boar was detected at the other farm. These
   results confirm wild boar do visit commercial pig farms, and therefore,
   there is potential for contact and pathogen exchange between wild boar
   and domestic pigs. The visitation rates derived from this study could be
   used to parameterise disease transmission models of pathogens common to
   domestic pigs and wild boars, such as the African swine fever virus, and
   subsequently to develop mitigation strategies to reduce unwanted
   contacts.},

Title = {Tracking wildlife diseases using community science: an example through
   toad myiasis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parasite and pathogen surveillance is crucial for understanding trends
   in their distributions and host spectra, as well as to document changes
   in their population dynamics. Nevertheless, continuous surveillance is
   time-consuming, underfunded due to the non-charismatic nature of
   parasites/pathogens, and research infrastructure is usually limited to
   short-term surveillance efforts. Species observation data provided by
   the public can contribute to long-term surveillance of parasites using
   photographic evidence of infections shared on community science
   platforms. Here, we used public photo repositories to document the
   occurrence across space and time of Lucilia spp. (Diptera:
   Calliphoridae), a parasite inducing nasal toad myiasis in the European
   toad Bufo bufo (Anura: Bufonidae). We found a total of 262 toad myiasis
   observations on iNaturalist (n = 132), on GBIF (n = 86), on Flickr (n =
   41), and on observation.org (n = 3). Our results indicate that the
   distribution of toad myiasis is regionally limited, despite its host
   being widely distributed and abundant across a wide region in Europe.
   Observations were found in 12 countries with relatively low prevalence,
   including Belgium (3.90\%, CI 2.44-6.18), Denmark (1.26\%, CI
   0.89-1.80), France (0.45\%, CI 0.14-1.38), Germany (1.27\%, CI
   0.92-1.75), Lithuania (0.50\%, CI 0.13-1.98), Luxembourg (1.30\%, CI
   0.42-3.95), the Netherlands (2.71\%, CI 1.61-4.52), Poland (0.89\%, CI
   0.34-2.35), Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) (4.76\%, CI 0.67-27.14),
   Switzerland (NA), Ukraine (0.87\%, CI 0.12-5.91), and in the UK (0.45\%,
   CI 0.28-0.72). Nevertheless, the number of uploaded observations of both
   parasite infection and host presence indicates a stable increase likely
   due to the growing popularity of community science websites. Overall,
   community science is a useful tool to detect and monitor certain
   wildlife diseases and to recognize potential changes in disease dynamics
   through time and space.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Eurasian beavers Castor fiber are important ecosystem engineers, able to
   modify freshwater environments and influence local biodiversity. Beaver
   activity affects not only aquatic ecosystems but also terrestrial
   habitats and organisms. In recent times, beaver populations have been
   detected in Central Italy. In this work, we determined the use of beaver
   lodges and dams by native animal species in Central Italy through
   intensive camera trapping between March 2021 and May 2022. Saproxylic
   beetles were searched by sight in spring and summer on lodges, dams, and
   gnawed trunks on river shorelines. We collected 132 records belonging to
   at least 17 species on beaver dams and lodges, several of them of
   conservation concern (e.g. the European bittern Botaurus stellaris and
   the endemic water vole Arvicola italicus). The most detected species
   within beaver structure was the yellow-necked field mouse Apodemus
   flavicollis, with 67 independent videos. Despite being confirmed as a
   nocturnal species, in our study area, A. flavicollis showed an activity
   peak on bright moonlight nights. The lodge may thus be used as a
   protection site from predation risk for small rodents, which may benefit
   from the beaver presence. By building dams and lodges, Eurasian beavers
   can increase habitat heterogeneity, thus promoting biodiversity increase
   and improvement. The potential expansion of beaver populations into
   these ecosystems may serve as a biotic restoration strategy.},

Title = {Trematode parasites have minimal effect on the behavior of invasive
   green crabs},
Journal = {AQUATIC INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {238-258},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Trophically-transmitted endoparasites can manipulate the behavior of
   intermediate hosts to increase transmission to definitive hosts. Less
   clear, however, is whether these relationships exist when parasites and
   hosts have limited coevolutionary history, e.g., a native parasite
   infecting an invasive host. We investigated infection by the
   northeastern North American trematode Microphallus similis in non-native
   green crabs (Carcinus maenas) to assess whether infection by M. similis
   influenced feeding behaviors in C. maenas and if this changed with time
   post-infection. We manipulated infection by randomly assigning crabs to
   parasite exposure and control groups. We then measured individual crab
   behavior at five time points (pre-infection, 72 h, 1 week, 2 week, and 3
   week post-infection) with an established ethogram that recorded multiple
   behavioral types. We also conducted righting response trials at each
   time point and additionally at 4 and 5 weeks post-exposure. Compared to
   controls, infected crabs showed little difference in recorded behaviors,
   and burden of infection (i.e., number of trematode cysts) was not
   correlated to any behavioral metric. This lack of behavioral impact
   occurred at all stages of infection. Active parasite
   penetration/establishment early in the infection process did not provoke
   greater behavioral response than later stages, when the encysted
   parasite becomes relatively dormant. Although M. similis is capable of
   infecting non-native C. maenas, our results suggest that it does not
   manipulate host behavior, possibly because of limited coevolutionary
   history with C. maenas in the region, or because host manipulation is
   unnecessary for successful completion of its life cycle. In nature, this
   may have implications for the crab's invasion success in the western
   Atlantic, where it has escaped much of its native parasite diversity.},

Title = {Population structure and demography of non-indigenous Japanese mystery
   snails in freshwater habitats of Virginia and Washington, DC, USA},

Volume = {17},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Non-indigenous species may drive declines in global freshwater
   biodiversity. Japanese mystery snails, Heterogen japonica (previously
   Cipangopaludina / Bellamya / Viviparus japonica), have invaded numerous
   freshwater systems in North America. To resolve questions about its
   population demography and genetics, we surveyed ponds and rivers from
   six Mid-Atlantic USA locations (Richmond, Virginia to Washington, D.C.)
   in 2018 and 2019 for mystery snails and co-occurring indigenous snails.
   A random subset of each snail species (max N = 80) per location was
   assessed for population demographics (size, sex), and brooding embryos
   were counted in mystery snails. Because morphological identification can
   be difficult to discern from its congener, the Chinese mystery snail
   (Cipangopaludina chinensis), we used a mitochondrial barcoding gene
   (COI) to confirm identity of H. japonica and also serve as a population
   genetics marker. Our barcoding confirmed that the mystery snails
   detected in our surveys were H. japonica, and that, compared to the
   indigenous range, its populations have low genetic diversity and limited
   genetic structure. Even so, H. japonica had the highest overall
   catch-per-unit-effort among all snails and sites. In demographic
   analyses, H. japonica populations skewed towards females, and females
   brooding live young were the largest across all sites. The number of
   live young ranged from 14 to 101/female (average: 52 live young/female).
   Further, a linear relationship existed between brooding female shell
   length and the number of live young for all sites, except one. Possible
   explanations could include site-level differences in abiotic or biotic
   parameters, but this requires further research. Altogether, the snail's
   reproductive capacity documented here suggests that H. japonica has the
   potential to undergo additional population growth, especially if large
   females spread to new locations. Moreover, it highlights another example
   of an invasive species with high population abundance, demographic
   performance, and distributional range even with depauperate genetic
   diversity.},

Title = {Do porcupines self-medicate? The seasonal consumption of plants with
   antiparasitic properties coincides with that of parasite infections in
   Hystrix cristata of Central Italy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Dietary selection is an important process for the maintenance of health
   homeostasis. From the potential food items available in one's
   environment, choices must be made to assure a proper balance of
   nutrients for energy, growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Sometimes,
   animals select plants also for their medicinal properties. This
   behaviour constitutes what is called the medicinal diet, and it consists
   of items with beneficial bioactive properties. In primates and other
   species investigated so far, it has been found that 15-25\% of the plant
   items consumed have antiparasitic properties. We investigated the
   dietary habits of three non-overlapping populations of crested porcupine
   (Hystrix cristata) in Central Italy and identified medicinal food
   species, their potential antiparasitic benefits, and the seasonality of
   parasite infections in relation to their ingestion. The three study
   areas were characterised by contrasting degrees of ``natural{''} and
   agricultural landscapes. In total, 44 food items were recorded from 43
   plant species based on macro- and microscopic faecal analyses (N = 22,
   24 spp., respectively) or stomach contents from necropsied roadkill
   specimens (N = 11 spp.). The dietary variation between groups could be
   attributed to differences in human land use patterns, affecting the
   relative accessibility to cultivars and wild growing plants. The
   relative proportion of plants in the diet with antiparasitic properties
   varied between study areas 1, 2, and 3, accounting for 72\%, 48\%, and
   27\%, respectively. Porcupines were found to be infected by 7 species of
   ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) and 7 species of endoparasites
   (strongyle nematode, protozoa, and bacteria) in the cold and rainy
   months. The consumption of medicinal foods in all three groups coincided
   with the highest detected prevalence of I. ricinus, P. irritans, P.
   melis, G. duodenalis, and A. italicus in autumn and winter. This study
   adds to our general understanding of factors influencing dietary
   selection and presents the first evidence for a link between medicinal
   food consumption and parasite infection seasonality in crested
   porcupines of Europe. Future research is required to ascertain the
   impact of these parasites on infected hosts, potential modes of action
   of these medicinal foods on them and the gut microbiota, and host health
   and nutritional status.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Several taxa forming a species complex within the bryozoan genus
   Watersipora are successful global marine invaders that are common in
   marine fouling communities in bays and harbors. This species complex has
   recently been recorded spreading to natural intertidal and subtidal
   habitats on the central California outer coast near the San Francisco
   Bay, suggesting that its invasive potential is greater than previously
   believed. To determine the species and clades present in these outer
   coast populations, and their relationship to populations in nearby bays
   and harbors, we produced COI sequences for a set of new Watersipora
   specimens sampled from four rocky intertidal sites, for which there is
   currently no published genetic data. Watersipora subtorquata and
   Watersipora new species were both identified at rocky intertidal sites.
   All haplotypes identified in this analysis have previously been reported
   in California harbors and marinas, suggesting that intertidal
   populations may be sourced from existing populations in harbors, rather
   than representing independent invasions. Field observations of
   intertidal populations support Watersipora's year-round persistence at
   rocky intertidal sites, which has significant implications for invasion
   dynamics and invasion management strategies. Continued sequencing of
   outer coast Watersipora samples will be crucial to further characterize
   the genetic diversity and structure of these coastal populations and
   describe the dynamics of Watersipora's outer coast spread.},

Abstract = {New Chinese mitten crab sequence data were obtained from eight European
   localities spanning France, The Netherlands, England and Wales. The
   Netherlands and Wales samples were taken from two areas where mitten
   crab populations had never before been sequenced. DNA results uncovered
   the presence of a second Eriocheir species coexisting sympatrically with
   E. sinensis H. Milne Edwards, 1853 in the Dee Estuary, Wales and at two
   sites sampled in The Netherlands. Molecular results and comparative
   morphology analyses suggest that the second species in European waters
   is likely to be an undescribed cryptic species. Additional evidence for
   the presence of a second European invasive mitten crab species is
   provided by confocal laser scanning microscopy of the male first
   gonopod. The origins of the Welsh introduction may date back to the
   early 2000s, when several Dutch dredging operators were active in the
   Dee Estuary. Despite several localities being sampled, the Eriocheir
   cryptic species was not found in England, which suggests that English
   and Welsh mitten crab populations originate from independent
   introductions. These results radically challenge current assessments of
   Eriocheir invasion in Europe and should be considered by stakeholders as
   a new baseline to implement efficient management strategies against
   invasive mitten crabs.},

Title = {Fascioloides magna and other liver parasites in cloven-hoofed game from
   northeastern Bavaria, Germany: occurrence and pathological findings with
   special emphasis on red deer (Cervus elaphus)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The first detection of Fascioloides (F.) magna in northeastern Bavaria
   in 2011 was presumably correlated to natural migration movements of free
   ranging wild ruminants originating from the neighboring Czech Republic,
   where high infection rates have been reported frequently. To gain more
   data on the continuing spreading and current occurrence of the giant
   liver fluke in surrounding regions, 700 livers of cloven-hoofed game
   originating from eleven different northeastern Bavarian counties were
   investigated for the presence of F. magna and accompanying liver
   parasites in the hunting season 2019-2020. Macroscopically altered liver
   tissue was further investigated by pathohistological and parasitological
   examination. F. magna was detected in 5.9\% (38/640) of livers from red
   deer (0.7\% < 1 year, 9.8\% > 1 year; p < 0.05) whereas none of the
   investigated livers of wild boar, roe, and fallow deer was infected
   (n=60). Mild pathological alterations of the liver tissue were
   documented in 15, moderate in 14, and major in 9 of all F.
   magna-positive cases. Histologically, the fluke-specific pigment
   haematin, large trematode eggs, and periportal fibrosis were detected in
   the liver tissue of infected animals. In 9\% of all investigated livers,
   parasitic stages of other parasites, i.e., Dicrocoelium dendriticum
   (6.0\%), Fasciola hepatica (0.3\%), Taenia spp. (1.7\%), and
   Echinococcus multilocularis (1.0\%), were found. According to the
   results of this study, F. magna is not restricted to formerly known
   affected regions of Upper Franconia, but is also present in the military
   training ground Grafenwohr, Upper Palatinate, and the Bavarian Forest
   National Park, Lower Bavaria, with estimated prevalences of 3.6 and
   16.4\%, respectively, and thus seems to spread in suitable habitats in
   northeastern Bavaria.},

Title = {Palatability of mangrove leaves to invasive apple snails: the relation
   between feeding electivity and multiple plant characteristics},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests worldwide have been subjected to biological invasion.
   Invasive apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) have established
   populations in some mangrove forests. The feeding behavior of P.
   canaliculata in mangroves has been unclear until now. The feeding
   electivity of P. canaliculata to mangrove leaves, including leaves from
   Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Kandelia candel, Aegiceras
   corniculatum, and Sonneratia apetala, was studied through a selective
   test, a nonselective test, and a T-tube test. The growth indicators, the
   feeding ratio, the feeding rate, the feeding amount, the electivity
   indicator, and the electivity frequency were determined. The weight
   increase ratios of P. canaliculata that consumed leaves of A.
   ilicifolius and A. aureum were higher than those that consumed leaves of
   K. candel, S. apetala, and A. corniculatum. The electivity indicator
   showed that P. canaliculata preferred A. ilicifolius leaves and fed
   little on A. corniculatum leaves. Acrostichum aureum leaves were the
   second most preferred food for the apple snails. The feeding electivity
   of P. canaliculata to leaves from five species of mangrove trees was
   significantly differentiated by cluster analysis, redundancy analysis,
   and principal component analysis. Eight feeding indicators of the apple
   snails were positively correlated with the leaf characteristics of
   nitrogen content, protein content, leaf area, moisture content, and
   aspect ratio and negatively correlated with the lignin, phenolic, and
   tannin contents. Pomacea canaliculata could discriminate mangrove leaves
   through physical and chemical characteristics and shift feeding
   electivity among mangrove leaves under intraspecific competition.
   Mangrove forests composed mainly of A. ilicifolius and A. aureum might
   be at risk of invasion by P. canaliculata. A detailed survey on benthic
   animals is necessary to monitor and prevent P. canaliculata invasion in
   mangroves.},

Abstract = {The dreissenids, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and zebra mussel D.
   polymorpha, are invasive freshwater mussels in Europe and North America.
   These species strongly impact aquatic ecosystems, such as the food web
   through their high abundance and filtration rate. They spread quickly
   within and between waterbodies, and have the ability to colonize various
   substrates and depths. The zebra mussel invaded and established in Swiss
   lakes in the 1960s, whereas the quagga mussel was not detected until
   2014. We collected all available data from cantonal as well as local
   authorities and other institutions to describe the colonization pattern
   of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps. We also
   collected data regarding the distribution of larval stages of the
   mussels, the so-called veliger larvae. We observed that in lakes
   colonized by the quagga mussel, veligers are present the whole year
   round, whereas they are absent in winter in lakes with only zebra
   mussels. Additionally, we present detailed information about the
   invasion and colonization pattern of quagga mussels in Lake Constance.
   Quagga mussels colonized the lakeshore within a few years (similar to
   2016-2018), outcompeted zebra mussels, and have reached densities > 5000
   ind.m(-2) in the littoral zone, even at 80 m densities above 1000
   ind.m(-2) were found at some locations. At the end of the article, we
   discussed possibilities on how the spread of quagga mussels within and
   among northern perialpine lakes should be monitored and prevented in the
   future.},

Abstract = {For risk assessment and prevention of further invasion of the alien
   apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, into new habitats in Japan, we
   estimated the snail's potential overwintering areas on the basis of
   climate data and a field census. Presence or absence was examined at 38
   sites in six regions of Kyushu Island, where the snail has invaded most
   areas in which it can overwinter. The effects of cumulative low
   temperature during winter on the presence/absence data were examined by
   using a logistic regression analysis. As a result, a model using
   cumulative low temperature below 10 degrees C (CLT10) was adopted as the
   best determinant of snail overwintering success, with the risk
   evaluation formula y = 1 / {[}1 + exp(-4.7931474 + 0.007574x)], where x
   is CLT10 (5-year average) and y is the probability of overwintering
   success. To verify the model, y was calculated for 1348 sites on Honshu,
   Shikoku, and Kyushu islands where P. canaliculata was confirmed to be
   present by recent field censuses. Of these sites, 1344 (> 99.7\%) had y
   values exceeding 0.4; the remaining four had y values ranging from > 0.2
   to 0.4, with a minimum of 0.377. These results indicate that the model
   can be used to predict the overwintering success and subsequent
   localization of P. canaliculata. A potential invasion map that we drew
   by using the model will help to prevent further expansion of this
   invasive snail into new areas.},

Abstract = {Recent invasions of the North and Baltic Seas by three Marenzelleria
   species have extensively altered benthic communities in the region.
   Despite several studies on the morphology and biology of the worms,
   their morphological identifications are often challenging. Here we
   summarize and map the available records of Marenzelleria from Eurasia,
   distinguishing those based on morphology versus molecular data. Based
   upon the genetic similarity (p = 0.08\% for COI) between individuals
   from the Baltic Sea and individuals from the Barents and White Seas we
   propose, for the first time, a possible route for the invasion of the
   Baltic Sea by M. arctia from the White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic
   Sea Canal. At the same time, our analysis of the sequences of COI
   fragments showed a significant genetic distance (p = 4.28- 4.29\%)
   between individuals identified as M. arctia from the Baltic, Barents and
   White Seas and those from the Kara Sea. This genetic distance, as well
   as the isolated estuarine habitats of these Arctic worms, and the large
   geographic distance between the type locality of M. arctia in the
   Beaufort Sea (Alaska) and northern Europe, raise doubts about the
   conspecificity of North American, North European and Northwest Pacific
   populations. We report M. neglecta for the first time for the British
   Isles (River Thames). We also review the evidence for the role of the
   Baltic Sea-Volga Canal and the Volga-Don Canal in facilitating the
   dispersal of M. neglecta to the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov,
   respectively. We further provide new insight on the phylogeny of
   Marenzelleria, an updated diagnosis of the genus and a key for
   morphological identification of Marenzelleria adults greater than 1.2 mm
   wide.},

Title = {Seedling establishment and early growth in Calobota sericea subjected to
   moisture stress},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {The South African perennial legume Calobota sericea (Thunb.) Boatwr. \&
   B-E van Wyk has been shown to be drought tolerant as mature plants, but
   information on drought tolerance of seedlings is lacking. This study
   evaluated the impact of moisture stress on seedling emergence, survival
   and growth in C. sericea. In the first trial, pre-germinated seeds were
   planted at 100, 70, 50 and 40\% of soil moisture holding capacity
   without additional watering. Seedling emergence and mortality was
   recorded daily for 14 days. In the second trial, seeds were allowed to
   grow under well-watered conditions for one month, after which moisture
   stress was imposed for 15 and 30 days. Thereafter, the seedlings were
   uprooted, for shoot and root measurements. Results from these trials
   show that C. sericea seedlings will establish even at severely reduced
   water-availabilities, but without subsequent watering, significant
   seedling mortality will occur. Calobota sericea seedlings displayed a
   range of morphological adaptive strategies to moisture stress including
   the minimisation of water loss and optimisation of water uptake. Further
   research into the impacts of regular cycles of moisture stress is needed
   to determine if changes in morphology due to prior moisture stress will
   result in improved adaptation to subsequent moisture stress.},

Title = {Ecologically relevant moisture and temperature metrics for assessing
   dryland ecosystem dynamics},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In drylands, water-limited regions that cover similar to 40\% of the
   global land surface, ecosystems are primarily controlled by access to
   soil moisture and exposure to simultaneously hot and dry conditions.
   Quantifying ecologically relevant environmental metrics is difficult in
   drylands because the response of vegetation to moisture and temperature
   conditions is not easily explained solely by climate-based metrics. To
   address this knowledge gap, we developed and examined 27 climate and
   ecological drought metrics across dryland areas of the western United
   States. Included in the 27 metrics is a suite of 19 largely new
   ``ecological drought metrics{''} that are designed to quantify multiple
   aspects of environmental limitation in drylands, including overall
   growing conditions, seasonal fluctuations, seasonal moisture timing,
   exposure to extreme drought and recruitment potential for perennial
   plants. To quantify these metrics, we simulated water balance pools and
   fluxes of daily soil moisture at multiple depths with historical weather
   from 1970 to 2010 using the SOILWAT2 ecosystem water balance model. We
   assessed the relationships among these metrics and their spatial and
   temporal patterns. We found that the inclusion of ecological drought
   metrics substantially increased the dimensionality of the climate
   metrics dataset; the number of independent variables needed to explain
   90\% of the variance in the dataset increased with the addition of
   ecological drought metrics. Spatial patterns in overall growing
   conditions represented well-known differences among ecoregions, for
   example, high temperatures and low precipitation in the southwest and
   cool temperatures and greater precipitation in the northeast. Seasonal
   fluctuation in soil water availability (SWA) was greatest in the
   southwest (Mojave Desert), whereas fluctuation in climatic water deficit
   (CWD) was greatest in the northwest (northern Great Basin and Columbia
   Plateau). Seasonal timing of moisture also differed among metrics; the
   timing of wet degree days (WDD), the timing of SWA and the timing of CWD
   were only weakly related to seasonal timing of precipitation. Plant
   recruitment metrics varied strongly across western drylands. In the
   Great Plains, recruitment events occurred more frequently and lasted
   longer than in the intermountain regions, where recruitment events were
   comparatively rare and short. These ecological drought metrics provide
   new insight into patterns of soil moisture and temperature that shape
   the structure and function of dryland ecosystems. The metrics will be
   useful for assessing the potential impact of climate change on dryland
   ecosystems and developing adaptive resource management strategies to
   sustain dryland ecosystem services in a changing world.},

Title = {Effect of botanical composition calibration on the accuracy of

   herbage mass estimation in tropical heterogeneous pastures},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the influence of botanical composition
   calibration on the accuracy of undisturbed sward height and comparative
   yield method (CYM) techniques for herbage mass estimation in tropical
   heterogeneous pastures. Two studies were conducted using two grazing
   systems based on heterogeneous pastures. Herbage mass was estimated
   using CYM and undisturbed sward height techniques within quadrats (SHQ)
   or at a set of standard points in the paddocks (SHP). SHQ had a higher
   adjusted R-2 when calibrated with the Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (U.
   brizantha) proportion compared to the simple SHQ model (0.75 vs 0.68),
   while RSE was lower (0.18 vs 0.21). The R-2 increased (0.63 to 0.68),
   while both residual means and RSE decreased (-2.30 to -0.05 and 0.22 to
   0.20, respectively) when SHP was calibrated with U. brizantha. It also
   resulted in a reduction of mean squared prediction error (MSPE) to CYM,
   SHQ, and SHP, respectively. The CYM allows for higher accuracy of
   herbage mass estimation in tropical heterogeneous pastures than
   undisturbed sward height, irrespective of botanical calibration.
   However, the botanical composition calibration had positive effects on
   the models from undisturbed sward height, and the calibration with U.
   brizantha increased the accuracy of herbage mass prediction.},

Title = {A Nearctic cat in the Neotropics: spatial biases in the existing
   knowledge of bobcats in Mexico (1988-2019)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Spatial biases commonly occur in biodiversity conservation efforts, and
   bobcats in Mexico exemplify this issue. Bobcats are one of the most
   well-studied felids worldwide. However, in Mexico bobcat studies are
   limited despite a wide distributional range. The objective of our study
   was to review the scientific literature published on bobcats in Mexico
   from 1988 to 2019 and to identify potential sampling biases. For each
   study, we identified the year, location, taxonomic focus, topic studied,
   and georeferenced each research location that included data collection
   in Mexico. We compared the spatial distribution of bobcat studies to
   random locations with a generalized linear model with binomial error
   structure using three variables and their interactions (degree of biome
   transformation, distance to protected lands, and distance to capital
   cities). We reviewed 210 publications (including research articles and
   undergraduate and postgraduate theses). Only in 37 publications were
   bobcats the single species studied. Bobcat studies have increased in
   Mexico since 2004 with most (78.57\%) published within the 2004-2019
   period. The main topic studied was diet, followed by species
   interactions. All but three states within the bobcat distribution in
   Mexico have at least one research study. We found that study locations
   are biased towards the less transformed biomes and protected lands.
   Bobcats can persist in urbanized landscapes although a threshold of
   disturbance for the species in Mexico remains unknown. Thus, we suggest
   bobcat research efforts to be strategically directed to fill knowledge
   gaps and with greater emphasis on highly transformed landscapes where
   the species may be at risk.},

Abstract = {Feed scarcity is a major challenge facing free-range beef farming in
   semi-arid areas. Specifically, low quality and quantity of forage in
   rangelands and higher feeding costs are the main constraints limiting
   smallholder free-range beef farmers' participation in mainstream beef
   markets. Using farmers' participatory approaches, this study identified
   major locally available forage resources (LAFRs) and evaluated their
   nutritional value. A total of 40 free-ranging commercially orientated
   smallholder beef farmers were interviewed using semi-structured
   questionnaires and tasked to identify LAFRs in the Cradock and
   Middelburg areas of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Chemical analysis
   was conducted for the most cited forages such as African sheepbush
   (Pentzia incana), sweet thorn (Vachellia karroo) leaves and pods, reed
   (Phragmites australis), lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay, natural pasture
   grasses (NPGs) and barbary fig, or prickly pear cactus, (Opuntia
   ficus-indica) cladodes collected from twelve participants' farms. Feed
   shortage was ranked by more than 53\% respondents as the main constraint
   to smallholder beef production. Regardless of the farming area, crude
   protein content of V. karroo leaves and pods averaging 18.8 and 19.5\%,
   respectively, was higher than other LAFRs. However, V. karoo pods had
   relatively low ash content than other forages in both farming areas.
   Opuntia ficus-indica attained high in vitro neutral detergent fibre
   digestibility at 12, 24 and 48 hr incubation periods, due to low neutral
   detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin.
   Integration of participatory inventory and chemical analysis proved to
   be reliable in identifying LAFRs, with V. karroo leaves and O.
   ficus-indica cladodes being the main potential forage resources for
   inclusion in beef cattle diets. Further research is recommended to
   substantiate their supplementary nutritive value and level of inclusion
   in beef cattle finishing diets.},

Title = {The detected effects of driptips and leaf wettability on the kinetic

Abstract = {Driptips play important roles in controlling soil erosion and in the
   water cycle. The driptips size distribution and the morphology of water
   droplets on the leaves among rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and
   intercropping species (Camellia sinensis, Citrus reticulata, Flemingia
   macrophylla and Theobroma cacao) were measured. Driptip-producing
   experiments were conducted indoors on stabilized leaves of five species
   with artificially mist spray. In all five foliage species, the diameter
   of the driptips from rubber leaves was the lowest. Furthermore, the
   relationship between driptips size and the mean leaf width at 3 mm from
   the rubber leaf tip was significantly positively correlated. Leaf
   wettability as measured by water droplets height linearly increase with
   the total volume of water which dropped on the leaves of all five
   species. The contact angle of the water droplets and the total volume of
   the droplet were significantly negatively correlated. Based on physical
   theory, the kinetic energy of the driptips was calculated by estimating
   the diameters of the driptip from all five species. The results
   indicated that it was important to consider the kinetic energy of
   driptips in selection of intercropping species when constructing
   rubber-based agroforestry plantations. Understanding the relationship
   between driptips size and the development of leaf tips (leaf width at 3
   mm from the leaf tip) will require more experiments with different leaf
   inclinations, and the results also confirmed that using the contact
   angle of water droplets to assess leaf wettability. This study can help
   to predict canopy water processes, such as canopy water storage and
   drainage.},

Title = {Tradeoff in the supply and demand for CO2 dominates the divergence of
   net photosynthesis rates of functional plants in alpine ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The responses of photosynthesis to change of temperature and CO2
   concentration are divergent among various alpine plant species at high
   altitude regions; however, very few direct in situ measurements have
   been conducted to compare photosynthetic capacity among different
   functional plants along altitude gradients in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
   (QTP). This study measured the net photosynthetic assimilation rate
   (An), maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), maximum electron transport
   rate (J(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance
   (g(m)) for CO2 of three plant functional types (PFTs, sedge, grass and
   shrub) and functional traits at different altitudes in the Qinghai Lake
   watershed during growing season. Meanwhile we simulated An of the PFTs
   under potential future scenario. Results indicate that grass maintain a
   relatively stable An by decreasing V-cmax, J(max), ratio of J(max) to
   V-cmax (J/V) and g(s), while slightly increasing g(m) with increasing
   altitudes. In contrast, the An of sedge and shrubs increased with rising
   V-cmax, J(max), g(s) and g(m) values, resulting in a large increment in
   the An at low altitudes. Grass was less sensitive to temperature by
   reducing the supply of CO2, while sedge and shrub increased. C-a was a
   more dominant factor than T-a in affecting the An of grass. The order of
   rising An in PFTs was shrub > sedge > grass, and the An of alpine meadow
   was found to increase more under the Representative Concentration
   Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Our results indicate that grass
   may be more resistant to future warming and suggested that considering
   PFTs is of great significance for improving the simulating of the
   response of vegetation physiological and ecological processes to future
   climate change in alpine regions.},

Abstract = {The chemical composition and seasonal dynamics of the water in Murmansk
   urban lakes (Murmansk region, Russia) under the anthropogenic load of
   varying intensity was analysed. The studies were conducted in the period
   from 2018 to 2020. The chemical composition of the water in the studied
   lakes differed significantly from that of the lakes located in the
   background territories of the region. High values of pH and
   mineralization, increased concentrations of major ions and elevated
   content of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were recorded in the
   surface waters. The nutrient concentrations were subject to noticeable
   seasonal fluctuations, mainly due to their consumption by phytoplankton,
   as well as to the changes in the ratios of surface and underground
   runoff. Lake Ledovoe (the central part of Murmansk) was the most
   polluted among the studied lakes, and Lake Bolshoe (used for drinking
   supply of the city) was the least polluted. Assessing the trophic status
   of the Murmansk lakes showed that the studied lakes are mostly
   mesotrophic, except for Lake Bolshoe (oligotrophic) and Lake Ledovoe
   (hypertrophic). In most of the lakes, phosphorus was the limiting factor
   for the growth and development of phytoplankton. The data obtained can
   be useful for understanding the fundamental processes of water
   composition transformation in the urbanized territories of the Arctic
   regions of the world and for making managerial (practical) decisions to
   create a comfortable urban environment in the North of Russia.},

Title = {Chemical fragmentation of stream systems and fish species richness: The

Journal = {FRESHWATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {615-625},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The loading of chemical pollutants into stream systems can result in
   isolation of aquatic communities upstream of the discharge. Ecological
   theory suggests that isolation will result in species richness losses,
   but this potential indirect effect of stream pollution is not widely
   studied. Here, I present a study of fish assemblage structure in
   watersheds that have been longitudinally fragmented by abandoned mine
   drainage. A number of headwater streams in the Clarion River watershed
   of the upper Ohio River Basin, Pennsylvania, USA, have escaped any
   direct effects of abandoned mine drainage but have been isolated by
   severe pollution lower in the watershed. I evaluated the effects of
   watershed fragmentation on fish species richness, composition, and
   abundance by comparing the fish assemblages of 22 headwater streams
   embedded in watersheds receiving mine effluent with the assemblages of
   34 reference streams with no apparent blockages to dispersal. I used a
   general linear model to evaluate the effect of isolation on species
   richness while accounting for stream size and water quality. I also used
   non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of
   variance to evaluate differences in fish species composition between
   isolated and reference streams. Controlling for the effect of stream
   size, reference streams had a mean richness of 3.63 species (+/- 0.27
   SE), but isolated streams had a mean species richness of just 1.02 (+/-
   0.33), a 3.5x difference. Species occupying isolated stream systems were
   a nested subset of fish species in reference streams. Species
   composition also differed between isolated and reference streams, with
   higher relative abundance of Creek Chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus
   {[}Mitchill, 1818]) and lower relative abundances of Mottled Sculpin
   (Cottus bairdii Girard, 1850) and Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis
   {[}Mitchill, 1814]) in isolated streams. These results illustrate an
   important indirect effect of water pollution in dendritic watersheds and
   provide evidence for the importance of connectivity in maintaining
   aquatic biodiversity.},

Title = {Quantifying evapotranspiration from dominant Arctic vegetation types
   using lysimeters},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The thermal and hydraulic properties of the moss and organic layer
   regulate energy fluxes, permafrost stability, and hydrologic function in
   Arctic tundra. Our goal was to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) from
   dominant vegetation types in Arctic tundra. We designed and deployed a
   network of electronic automated weighing micro-lysimeters (n = 58, area
   = 0.06 m(2)). We selectively clipped groups of plants from a subset of
   lysimeters to isolate ET from moss, tussocks, and mixed vascular plants.
   High rates of evaporation (E) recorded during the study period in the
   moss E lysimeters (64 mm) and high ET in the tussock ET lysimeters (60
   mm) show that mosses and sedge tussocks (Eriophorum vaginatum) are the
   major constituents of local tundra ET. Moss E was consistently higher
   than ET from mixed vascular species with moss understory indicating that
   moss E dominates tundra water efflux at sites with moss understory. The
   ET partitioning presented here will allow for improved prediction of
   changes in water flux associated with observed and future vegetation
   change. Future changes in the composition and cover of mosses and
   vascular plants will not only alter partitioning of tundra ET but may
   also affect the significant role plants play in the moisture regime and
   thermodynamics of Arctic permafrost soils.},

Title = {Herbicide trials on Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Asteraceae) during
   adverse conditions reveal incompatibility with biocontrol and a narrow
   window of opportunity for chemical control},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 23},
Abstract = {Herbicide trials on pompom weed Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC.
   (Asteraceae) were carried out in grasslands with xeric and hydric soils,
   at sites in Gauteng, South Africa, from 2005 to 2008. The rust fungus
   Puccinia eupatorii Dietel, an established self-perpetuating biocontrol
   agent on C. macrocephalum, caused significant damage to shoots in late
   summer and autumn. Herbicide efficacy was significantly better on
   foliage that did not already present symptoms and that was sprayed in
   early summer compared with on infected plants treated in autumn, at both
   the xeric (F = 36.71, p < 0.001) and hydric (F = 3.59, p = 0.031) sites.
   This pathogen has reduced the time available for effective chemical weed
   control from six months to three months. However, none of the herbicide
   treatments achieved commercially acceptable mortality rates of >= 80\%,
   and after three annual applications none succeeded in extirpating C.
   macrocephalum from the plots. Regression analyses of count data showed
   that metsulfuron-methyl at 45 g ha(-1) (USD 20.05 ha(-1)), picloram at
   252 g ha(-1) (USD 25.47 ha(-1)) and 2,4-D/dicamba/MCPA at 540/360/474 g
   ha(-1) (USD 45.41 ha(-1)) required five annual treatments in summer to
   eradicate C. macrocephalum, whereas 2,4-D amine at 1 440 g ha(-1) (USD
   13.65 ha(-1)) and MCPA at 1 200 g ha(-1) (USD 14.46 ha(-1)) required six
   treatments. Hence, there is a trade-off between the use of slightly more
   effective herbicides against the lower costs of other selective
   herbicides.},

Title = {Ecological responses of spawning habitat suitability to changes in flow
   and thermal regimes influenced by hydropower operation},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large reservoirs and dams can fundamentally alter downstream flow and
   thermal regimes by resetting the flow and water temperature release
   boundary conditions, resulting in significant impacts on fish habitat
   suitability. Therefore, it is critically important to understand how the
   volume and temperature of dam releases to influence downstream hydraulic
   and temperature dynamics and predict the ecological responses of fish
   habitat suitability to these changes. In this study, a physically based
   coupled model framework was developed to identify the temporal and
   spatial variations of hydraulic and water temperature regimes and the
   spawning habitat suitability of four major Chinese carps (FMCC) in the
   middle reach of the Yangtze River below Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR)
   responded to different upstream boundary conditions established by dam
   operation. The results showed that the dam discharge volume from TGR
   mainly affected the downstream hydraulic regime, while dam discharge
   temperature would have most impact on downstream water temperature. The
   spawning habitat suitability of FMCC obviously decreased due to TGR
   operation, and the declined water temperature suitability and the
   delayed and narrowed window of suitable water temperature were the main
   influencing factors. For the purpose of maximizing the spawning habitat
   suitability of FMCC in the downstream reaches below TGR, dam discharge
   volume ranged from 10,000 to 22,500 m(3)/s, and dam discharge
   temperature varied from 22 to 23.5 degrees C would be recommended as the
   outflow conditions in the ecological operation of TGR.},

Title = {Associative nitrogen fixation could be common in South African mesic
   grassland},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 10},
Abstract = {Non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial diazotrophs closely associated
   with the roots of grasses probably contribute most of the new nitrogen
   acquired to sustain productive natural grasslands, yet their ecology is
   poorly understood, especially in southern Africa. We looked for genetic
   evidence, using qPCR and gel electrophoresis, for the presence of the
   bacterial nifH gene associated with the roots of four grass species (20
   plants each) in a mesic grassland in South Arica, which would indicate
   the potential for N fixation by diazotrophs. Grasses most tolerant of
   low N (Aristida junciformis) were predicted to harbour the most
   diazotrophs, especially compared to those most responsive to fertiliser
   N (Eragrostis curvula). However, the nifH gene was found in all 80 root
   samples and did not differ in copy number between species. Sequencing of
   a representative sample confirmed the identity of the nifH gene. The
   recently burned half of the grassland had 60\% more relative nifH gene
   copy numbers than the area burned 15 months previously, suggesting that
   grass growth stimulated by fire could recruit diazotrophs. Given their
   ubiquity and importance in the N economy of grasslands, research is
   required to characterise root-associated diazotroph communities,
   quantify their N fixation rates, and understand their environmental
   controls.},

Title = {The influence of grass competition and soil moisture on the growth and
   phenology of Karoo shrubs in the Eastern Upper Karoo},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Rainfall in the Nama-Karoo is sporadic and a plant's ability to access
   and utilise available soil moisture will determine its ability to
   persist in the system and to successfully recruit. When summer rainfall
   in the Eastern Karoo increases, grassiness increases at the expense of
   shrub canopy cover. This may drive a transition from shrubland toward
   grassland. The effect of grass-shrub competition on shrub growth and
   phenology in the Eastern Karoo is not adequately explained by the
   root-niche separation hypothesis or the succession hypothesis. In an
   experiment, we measured shrub growth and phenology in the absence
   (clipping treatment) and presence (control treatment) of grass over the
   2017/2018 rainfall season. Grass clipping changed grass species
   composition over this period, but grass clipping did not benefit shrubs.
   We found no competitive effect of grasses on shrubs. However, shrub
   canopy cover showed a strong linear response to soil moisture, as did
   canopy cover to temperature. Similarly, soil moisture and temperature
   were important for stem growth and shrub phenology. Patterns of shrub
   growth and phenology in response to summer and winter rainfall provide
   important insight for land managers for optimising production while
   enabling phenological processes that allow recruitment to take place.},

Title = {Variation of seasonal litterfall in subtropical montane cloud forests to
   typhoon severity and environmental factors},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {132-144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Forest litterfall is pivotal for biogeochemical cycles and for assessing
   the impacts of perturbations on ecosystems. Typhoon occurrence is the
   primary mechanism for producing litterfall; Taiwan is situated in one of
   the most frequently disturbed regions. However, no typhoons were
   recorded in 2018, only occurring three times since 1911. This rare
   occasion, along with the regular (2017) and extreme typhoon (2016)
   years, provides an opportunity to investigate the responses of
   typhoon-prone forest ecosystems to a future climate scenario: Elevated
   temperatures amplify the intensity but reduce the frequency of typhoons.
   We compared three years (2016-2018) of summer typhoon season
   (July-October) mean monthly litterfall (MML) in the subtropical montane
   cloud forests of northeastern Taiwan, and investigated the relationships
   between MML/typhoon-induced MML (Delta MML) and 17 biophysical,
   bioclimatic and topographic attributes. More MML was produced in 2016,
   caused by strong winds and heavy rainfall. However, there was no
   statistical difference between 2017 and 2018 since forests may also
   produce substantial amounts of litterfall in summer without typhoons.
   The relationship between Delta MML and 17 variables was relatively
   insensitive to typhoon severity. Variables associated with succession
   and forest management were crucial for modeling MML in the presence of
   typhoons, but none of them were pivotal for MML without typhoons. The
   mean air temperature and elevation (related to forest productivity) were
   crucial for MML without typhoons; surface curvature may form shelters to
   prevent extreme typhoon with reduced MML. These outcomes may shed light
   on future ecosystem dynamics in typhoon-prone forests under a changing
   climate. Abstract in Mandarin is available with online material.},

Title = {Genetic inference of orchid population dynamics on different-aged lava

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-105},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Colonization is a fundamental ecological process that is important for
   the persistence of species, particularly when a changing environment
   necessitates range shifts. Vacant habitats available for colonization
   often arise from landscape disturbance. Colonization and population
   expansion processes can be inferred by examining the levels and spatial
   distribution of genetic variation of plant populations with known
   disturbance histories. Samples (N = 690) of the terrestrial orchid,
   Epidendrum radicans, were collected from five lava flow sites on the
   slopes of Volcan Arenal in Costa Rica that last experienced major
   eruptions in 1968 and 1992. Individuals were also sampled (N = 188) from
   four regional populations. Samples were characterized using 15 nuclear
   genetic markers and analyzed using population genetics statistics.
   Genetic diversity within sites was moderate (H-e = 0.092-0.192).
   Contrary to expectation, diversity tended to be lower on the older lava
   flows (0.131 vs. 0.172) which may reflect their more sheltered
   topography that restricted pollen/seed immigration, and/or greater
   intra- and interspecific competition. Genetic diversity measures
   indicate that the lava flows were colonized by numerous individuals that
   likely originated from multiple sources while spatial genetic structure
   (SGS) statistics indicate that most recruitment in the study sites
   subsequent to colonization resulted from in situ reproduction and
   localized seed deposition. Younger sites had significantly greater SGS
   over larger distances which reflects fewer reproductive events, and less
   spatial and temporal overlap of seed shadows relative to the older
   sites. Clones were also generally smaller on the younger sites (<= 3 m
   vs. <= 8 m).},

Abstract = {Southeast Asian arthropod biodiversity is in rapid decline, but the
   variability of responses within taxa has received little attention.
   Using canopy fogging, we collected similar to 50,000 beetles
   (Coleoptera) in (1) lowland rainforest, (2) jungle rubber (rubber
   agroforest), and smallholder monoculture plantations of (3) rubber and
   (4) oil palm in Sumatra, across two landscapes and seasons. On average,
   beetle abundance was more than 50\%, and biomass over 75\%, lower in
   rubber and oil palm plantations than in rainforest and jungle rubber.
   This pattern was influenced by landscape and season. Abundance and
   biomass declines were similar in Chrysomelidae, Elateridae, and
   Staphylinidae, but differed in Curculionidae, which were most abundant
   in oil palm due to the introduced oil palm pollinator Elaeidobius
   kamerunicus. Across beetle families, species richness in monocultures
   was reduced by at least 70\% compared to rainforest, with beetle
   richness in jungle rubber being similar to rainforest. Community
   composition in oil palm plantations differed markedly from the other
   land-use systems for Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae, but less for
   Elateridae and Staphylinidae. Turnover contributed more to overall beta
   diversity than nestedness for all families and land-use systems. Likely
   undersampling of the beetle community in rainforest suggests that
   declines of beetle density and diversity are much more severe than
   reported here, especially for beetle families with many concealed
   species, such as Staphylinidae. This study provides first evidence that
   negative responses of beetles to tropical land-use change vary among
   families, and is the first report of its kind from heavily understudied
   Sumatra. Abstract in Indonesia is available with online material.},

   An additional water loss from infected forests},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Mistletoes have a global distribution and are the largest group of
   parasitic plants living within the canopies of woody plants. In European
   forests, Viscum album L. ssp. album (common mistletoe) is a common sight
   and, despite being considered a pest, can play beneficial roles in the
   ecosystem. However, mistletoe infections are becoming more severe and
   widespread throughout Europe, including recent reports of large-scale
   host tree mortality events. These mortality events are hypothesized to
   be a result of increased water stresses from severe mistletoe infections
   in tandem with drought. In this study, we estimate an additional water
   loss from mistletoe-infected forests that has not yet been described:
   interception, or the storage and evaporation of rainfall. Results from
   rainfall simulations on mistletoes sampled from Gostynin Forest District
   (central Poland) indicate mistletoes can store 0.16-1.32 mm of
   rainwater. Inputting this additional water storage capacity from
   mistletoes into a rainfall interception model suggests that, depending
   on the severity of the infection, mistletoes could reduce annual
   rainwater supply beneath the canopy by 2-11\%. In forests experiencing
   water stress from mistletoe infection and climate change, the rainfall
   interception by mistletoes represents an additional water loss of a
   magnitude worthy of future investigation.},

   of a drying climate},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs), such as wetlands,
   estuaries and mangrove forests, are globally important habitats that
   promote biodiversity, provide climate regulation and serve as refugia
   for plant and animal communities. However, global warming, coastal
   development and over-abstraction threaten the availability and quality
   of groundwater in coastal aquifers and, by extension, the
   ecohydrological function of dependent ecosystems. Because
   ecohydrological knowledge of coastal groundwater is disparate across
   disciplines and habitat types, we begin by summarising the
   physiochemical, biological and hydrological processes supported by
   groundwater across coastal watersheds. Groundwater makes a significant
   but poorly recognised contribution to the function and resilience of
   coastal ecosystems and will play an essential role in climate change
   mitigation and adaptation. This review then explores how critical
   ecosystem processes supported by groundwater will be affected in areas
   of the humid subtropics that are expected to be impacted by climatic
   drying. Where rainfall is predicted to decrease, reduced groundwater
   recharge will interrupt the hydrology of coastal GDEs, while
   anthropogenic pressures, such as land-use intensification and pollution,
   will diminish the quality of remaining groundwater. The challenges of
   managing groundwater for multiple purposes under climate change
   predictions are highlighted. To improve the management of coastal GDEs,
   research should be aimed at developing robust conceptual models of
   coastal groundwater systems that quantify biophysical linkages with
   ecological communities across relevant spatiotemporal scales.},

Abstract = {In the context of global warming, the soil water retention (SWR)
   functions of river basins in river source areas dominating alpine-cold
   ecosystems are changing. Quantifying spatiotemporal dynamics of SWR in
   the area is fundamental for better understanding the climatic and
   underlying regulation on water formation and benefitting the reasonable
   management of basin resources. In this study, the Hei River basin (HRB)
   and the Bai River basin (BRB), located in the upper reaches of the
   China's Yellow River, were employed as the study area. SWR across the
   two basins was estimated by using the water yield module of the InVEST
   model; the sensitive responses of SWR to changes of climate and
   underlying conditions were quantitatively assessed during the time
   period from 1981 to 2015. The total SWR was quantified into multiyearly
   averaged annual values of 1.61 x 108 m3 in the HRB and 1.75 x 108 m3 in
   the BRB. SWR in the two river basins had decreased consistently during
   the statistic period, especially in the midstream regions of the two
   basins in the 1980s. The positive effects of air temperature,
   precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   were evidenced in the study area, while the negative effect of potential
   evapotranspiration (PET) was found. Comparatively, precipitation and PET
   had more significant influences on SWR than the other two factors. The
   study could be considered as a case example for better understanding
   regional SWR dynamics together with its responses to environmental
   changes in the alpine-cold river source areas.},

Title = {Functional traits of riparian trees in the lower Fitzroy River, Western
   Australia},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Riparian trees are critically important for maintaining the ecological
   function of freshwater ecosystems. Globally, anthropogenic changes to
   water regimes are impacting the health and distribution of riparian
   trees. Understanding the physiological constraints on the distribution
   of riparian tree species in relation to the water regime is essential
   for informed water resource management that seeks to limit impacts on
   riparian trees. To fill an identified knowledge gap for the Fitzroy
   River, a significant river in the wet-dry tropics of north-western
   Australia, we used a trait-based approach to characterise nine common
   riparian tree species in relation to their distribution along a
   hydrological gradient. We assessed key functional traits related to
   drought and flood flows. Leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf dry matter
   content (LDMC), foliar carbon content (\% C) and the ratio of carbon to
   nitrogen (C:N) are broadly related to plant productivity and durability
   and may reflect resistance to fluvial stress. Traits related to water
   availability were stem specific density (SSD), mean xylem vessel
   diameter and xylem vessel density, as well as foliar delta C-13 which is
   related to water use efficiency, and leaf osmotic potential at full
   hydration (pi(100)) as a measure of drought tolerance. We found that
   pi(100), delta C-13 and SSD values reflected species hydrological
   habitat preferences, with higher delta C-13 values and lower pi(100) for
   species distributed in the drier floodplain habitats, compared with
   species constrained to the riverbank. Low SSD values for species close
   to the riverbank may be indicative of aerenchyma tissue in response to
   flooding. Differences in leaf trait values were primarily attributed to
   differences between evergreen Myrtaceous and deciduous non-Myrtaceous
   species, rather than hydrological habitat preferences. LMA was greatest
   for the Myrtaceous study species, with deciduous non-Myrtaceous species
   associated with wetter habitats having the lowest values. The physiology
   of riparian trees in northern Australia is not well described for the
   majority of species. Our study provides insight into plant functional
   strategies in response to both flooding and drought and is a critical
   step in understanding plant responses to future water-take scenarios to
   support evidence-based decision making.},

Abstract = {Warming and grazing, and litter quality jointly determine litter
   decomposition and nutrient releases in grazing ecosystems. However,
   their effects have previously been studied in isolation. We conducted a
   two factorial experiment with asymmetric warming using infrared heaters
   and moderate grazing in an alpine meadow. Litter samples were collected
   from all plots in each treatment, among which some subsamples were
   placed in their original plots and other samples were translocated to
   other treatment plots to test the relative effects of each treatment on
   litter decomposition and nutrient releases. We found that warming rather
   than grazing alone significantly increased total losses of litter mass,
   total organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) per
   unit area due to increases in both mass loss rates and litter biomass.
   However, grazing with warming did not affect their total mass losses
   because increased mass loss was offset by decreased litter biomass
   compared with the control. Seasonal mean soil temperature better
   predicted litter decomposition than litter lignin content or carbon to
   nitrogen ratio. There were interactions between warming and grazing, but
   there were no interactions between them and litter quality on litter
   decomposition. The temperature sensitivity of TN loss was higher than
   that of TP loss per unit area. Our results suggest that increased
   temperature has a greater effect on litter decomposition and nutrient
   release than change in litter quality, and that more N release from
   litter could result in greater P deficiency in the alpine meadow.},

Title = {Exploring factors driving macrophytes in rivers-A case study in Middle
   Atlas Morocco},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Macrophytes represent a functional compartment that plays multiple and
   fundamental ecological roles in aquatic environments. They are linked
   with the other compartments of hydrosystems, both abiotic and biotic,
   which gives them the ability to integrate environmental conditions and
   reflect the trophic state of watercourses. Nevertheless, macrophytes in
   Moroccan rivers have been rarely studied. Thus, the main objective of
   the present work is to study these plants by determining the
   environmental factors that control their presence and distribution in
   the watercourses of the upper Oum Er-rbia basin (Middle Atlas Morocco).
   From June 2018 to June 2019, 14 sites spread over five rivers were
   monitored monthly to describe macrophytic communities and investigate
   their ecological determinism. We used a principal component analysis to
   establish each river's typology and a detrended correspondence analysis
   to explore macrophyte assemblages. Canonical correspondence analysis was
   used to determine the hydrochemical parameters of water that govern the
   development and distribution of macrophyte species in the upper Oum
   Er-rbia basin. The Amengous river stands out from the other surveyed
   rivers for its exceptional richness of macrophytic species. This
   richness is often associated with the enrichment of the aquatic
   environment by nitrogen and phosphate inputs. Furthermore, in some
   rivers, such as Oum Er-rbia, nutrient enrichment plays a secondary
   function in comparison to the hydromorphological descriptors that tend
   to be more important for macrophyte composition and distribution.},

Title = {Effects of plant communities on the emission of soil greenhouse gases in
   riparian wetlands during spring thaw},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Spring thawing can affect the soil carbon and nitrogen cycling processes
   and lead to changes in the emissions of greenhouse gases. The temporal
   variations and impact factors of soil GHGs fluxes were measured in
   Phragmites australis and Carex appendiculata with the static chamber
   from the end of March to the end of May in 2018 in riparian wetlands of
   Xilin River, which is typical inland river meandering through steppe
   region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that soil CH4 and
   N2O emissions of the P. australis were significantly higher than those
   of the Carex appendiculata, whereas CO2 emissions were no significant
   difference. The responses of soil GHG fluxes to soil environmental
   factors in P. australis and Carex appendiculata differed. In the P.
   australis community, soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were influenced jointly
   by mainly the soil temperature and microbial biomass nitrogen, whereas
   soil N2O emission was mainly affected by the soil temperature. The
   dominant controlling factor for CO2 and N2O was soil temperature in the
   Carex appendiculata, whereas CH4 was mainly regulated by soil water
   content. The global warming potential of P. australis was significantly
   higher than that of Carex appendiculata. Those findings highlight the
   difference in soil greenhouse gas fluxes in different plant communities
   and the importance of CH4 and N2O emissions during the spring thaw,
   which contributes to predicting the riparian wetland soil greenhouse
   gases and their global warming potential under global climate changes.},

Title = {Regional-scale partitioning of transmission losses and groundwater
   recharge using satellite estimates of actual evapotranspiration in an
   arid environment},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rivers in arid regions often rely on flow generated from wetter regions
   upstream, leading to high transmission losses of downstream flows. These
   transmission losses support a range of ecosystems, but partitioning the
   volume of the transmission losses across the floodplain, riparian zone
   and in-channel is difficult. This study presents a methodology relying
   primarily on multi-decade satellite remotely sensed actual
   evapotranspiration estimates to partition these losses. The method was
   applied to the similar to 40,000 km(2) floodplain of Cooper Creek in the
   central Australian arid zone, where first, the alluvial landscape was
   classified based on actual evapotranspiration rates, and second, both
   regional- (i.e., for the entire floodplain) and local-scale (i.e., for
   each waterhole) water balances were calculated to partition these
   losses. Regional-scale results estimated that 82\% of transmission
   losses occurred on the floodplain, 13\% in the riparian zone and 5\%
   from open water in the river channel and waterholes. These results
   showed that a refinement of the conceptual model of recharge from the
   waterholes is necessary as vast areas of the riparian zone are likely to
   be accessing a shallow freshwater lens rather than a discrete freshwater
   lens below the permanent waterholes. This method can be used in other
   data-poor arid river systems as it uses globally accessible data
   sources.},

Title = {Histological arrangements of plant tissue of different elephant grasses

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Elephant grass genotypes display a variety of morphological differences,
   influencing the nutritive value of the forage. This study evaluated the
   histological arrangements of the leaves and stems of different
   elephant-grass genotypes, two tall-sized (Elephant B and IRI-381) and
   two dwarfs (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37), during a two-year trial. The
   grasses were harvested at 60-day intervals for two years. Biometric
   analyses of the stems and leaves were performed based on histological
   measurements. An in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) assay of the
   forage was performed. Among the elephant grass genotypes, the lignified
   cells and vascular bundles of the stems had higher variation than the
   leaves. Tall-sized genotypes displayed more lignified tissues in stems
   than the dwarfs. The transversal area occupied by vascular bundles and
   lignified cells were higher in Elephant B (44 911 mu m(2) and 35 895 mu
   m(2)) (p < 0.05), compared to the dwarfs. Forage IVDMD was higher in
   leaves (699 g kg(-1) of dry matter {[}DM]) than in the stems (678 g
   kg(-1) of DM), considering all genotypes (p < 0.05). We did not observe
   any direct influence of genotype on forage digestibility, despite some
   differences in the histological arrangements.},

Abstract = {Construction activities often involve topsoil disturbance, leading to
   substantial soil erosion and offsite sedimentation. Dozens of sediment
   perimeter barrier products (SPBs) designed to prevent offsite
   sedimentation due to sheet erosion have been developed over the past few
   decades. However, many of the SPBs have yet to be tested under
   standardized, field -scale conditions. A standardized testing protocol
   was utilized at the Erosion Control Research and Training Center (ECRTC)
   at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to evaluate SPBs. The
   testing protocol simulated sheet flow erosion from the construction
   sites in Illinois during a 10-year, 6-hour storm event. The silt fence
   was tested as a standard. The four SPBs evaluated during the study were
   (1) Filtrexx Siltsoxx, (2) ERTEC ProWattle, (3) Curlex sed-iment log,
   and (4) coconut coir log. Product effectiveness was evaluated based on
   structural performance, downstream water quality, and sediment retention
   efficiency.Water quality data for each product were statistically
   compared to results of the silt fence by Welch's t-test. Filtrexx
   Siltsoxx and ERTEC ProWattle were the most effective in retaining
   sediment upstream of the product and improving downstream water quality.
   Sediment log and coconut coir log exhibited similar results to that of
   the silt fence. This study demonstrates that several novel technologies
   for sediment perimeter barriers are equal to, or exceed, the relative
   effectiveness of the industry standard at retaining sediment in
   standardized sheet flow conditions. These newer products have the
   potential to reduce sediment-related infractions and violations, and to
   prevent further sediment-related pollution in waterways downstream.},
