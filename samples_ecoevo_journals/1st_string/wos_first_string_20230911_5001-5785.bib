Title = {The role of evolutionary modes for trait-based cascades in mutualistic
   networks},

Abstract = {The erosion of functional diversity may foster the collapse of
   ecological systems. Functional diversity is ultimately determined by the
   distribution of species traits. As species traits are a legacy of
   species evolutionary history, one might expect that the mode of trait
   evolution influences community resistance under the loss of functional
   diversity. In this paper, we investigate the role of trait evolutionary
   dynamics on the robustness of mutualistic networks undergoing the
   following scenarios of species loss: (i) random extinctions, (ii) loss
   of functional distinctiveness and (iii) extinctions biased towards
   larger sizes. We simulated networks defined by models of single trait
   complementary and evolutionary modes where traits can arise in recent
   diversification events with weak phylogenetic signal, in early
   diversification events with strong phylogenetic signal, or as a random
   walk through evolutionary time. Our simulations show that mutualistic
   networks are especially vulnerable to extinctions based on trait
   distinctiveness and more robust to random extinction dynamics. The
   networks show an intermediate level of robustness against size-based
   extinctions. Despite the small range of variation in network robustness,
   our results show that the mode of trait evolution matters for network
   robustness in all three scenarios. Networks with low phylogenetic signal
   are more robust than networks with high phylogenetic signal across all
   scenarios. As a consequence, our results predict that mutualistic
   networks based upon current adaptations are more likely to cope with
   extinction dynamics than those networks that are based upon conserved
   traits.},

Title = {Sensitivity analysis of a crop metapopulation model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {CropMetaPop is a new simulation tool to model the genetic evolution of
   crop diversity under on-farm dynamic management. Under this type of
   conservation and use of varieties, seeds are resown and exchanged
   between farmers and the set of connected populations is described as a
   crop metapopulation. CropMetaPop is therefore at the interface of
   genetic and social processes. We used sensitivity analyses to check the
   behaviour of the model and to identify which parameters and range of
   values for them induce the most variability in the outputs. CropMetaPop
   was found to behave as expected. Depending on the type of locus studied
   (neutral or selected), the parameters related to drift or selection were
   those that induced the most variability in the outputs. Colonisation,
   migration, and network topology parameters were less influential.
   Looking at the detailed results will help setting the parameters to
   relevant values in the future utilisation of the model.},

Title = {Improved gross primary productivity estimation using semi empirical
   (PRELES) model for moist Indian sal forest},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The significant role that forests play in regulating the carbon and
   water exchange is critical to mitigate climate change. The remote
   sensing data and models provide good means for estimating gross primary
   productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), although they seldom
   face issues when implemented without proper cali-bration. The study
   compares the performance of empirical (TG model) and semi-empirical
   (PRELES) model in estimation of GPP and ET of Indian moist sal forest.
   PRELES-PREdict Light use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil water
   predicted the GPP and ET adequately; GPP ranged from 1.09 to 19.73 gC m-
   2 day- 1 with RMSE of 1.64 gC m- 2 day -1 and ET from 0.25 to 5.31 mm
   day -1 with RMSE of 0.65 mm day -1. It was found that PRELES estimated
   GPP with higher accuracy compared to TG model (a reduced RMSE of 0.68 gC
   m- 2 day -1). The study reveals, with site-specific parametrization,
   semi empirical model can better predict GPP and ET than empirical model.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the pollution level in the central part of
   the Buyuk Menderes River (in both the main tributary and curuksu stream)
   in Denizli (Turkey) using water physicochemical parameters and biomarker
   responses in Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae). In
   physicochemical parameter evaluations, Sigma, Korucuk, and Guzelkoy
   stations were determined to have higher mean temperature, pH, salinity,
   conductivity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) values and lower
   dissolved oxygen (dO(2)) and saturated oxygen (sO(2)) values than
   Bekilli, Mahmutlu, and Saraykoy stations. In biomarker response
   evaluations, C. riparius larvae from Saraykoy, Sigma, Korucuk, and
   Guzelkoy stations were found to exhibit inhibited acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE) activities (55\%-68\%) and elevated 7-ethoxyresorufin
   O-deethylase (EROD) activities (191\%-281\%), glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) activities (138\%-187\%), and metallothionein (MT) contents
   (155\%-231\%) when compared with the control values. This study proves
   that different stations are exposed to different pollution sources, the
   pollution level of a station varies depending on the season, and the
   stations on curuksu stream, among which Guzelkoy appears to be the most
   contaminated, are exposed to more pollutants than those on the main
   tributary of the river.},

Title = {Exploring and forecasting spatial and temporal patterns of fire hazard
   risk in Nepal's tiger conservation zones},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {476},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Forest fires are the leading cause of deforestation. In March, April,
   and May, which are the three driest months of the year, 89\% of all
   forest fires in Nepal are caused by humans. Due to its diverse
   topography, climate, and sociodemographic interactions, the region is
   extremely vulnerable. The study aimed to investigate and forecast the
   spatiotemporal pattern of forest fires using space-time cube forecasting
   models and develop a tiger habitat suitability model based on space-time
   hotspots, trends, environmental, geomorphological, and human
   compo-nents. MODIS fire hazards data in vector point format from NASA's
   Terra and Aqua satellites between the years 2000 and 2020 were utilized
   as the primary dataset for this investigation. Fire hazards from 2000 to
   2013 were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal hot-cold spots trend,
   hotspot zone in 2D and 3D. Then fire hazards from 2014 to 2020 were
   forecasted and validated with raw datasets using the space-time
   exponential-smoothing and forest-based forecasting models. Results
   indicate that almost 52.77\% and 69.05\% of the total tiger habitat area
   were respectively in hotspot and uptrend zones. Only 0.3\% of the entire
   tiger habitat area was identified in a cold-spot zone. Multi-Criteria
   Evaluation (MCE) suitability analysis estimated that the areas of
   Mahakal and Seti in the west and the top of Mechi in the east were found
   to be moderately suitable for tiger habitat. When compared to the
   exponential smoothing method (8.40\%), the forest-based method produced
   a lower average inaccuracy of 8.29\%, with mean RMSEs of 0.43 and 0.31,
   respectively. Overall, the study revealed a new era of technological
   spatiotemporal data utilization for fire hazard incidents, which could
   be used to identify suitable or vulnerable locations through space-time
   analysis and forecasting techniques.},

Title = {Migration and energetics model predicts delayed migration and likely
   starvation in oiled waterbirds},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Oil spills can inflict mortality and injury on bird populations; many of
   these deaths involve starvation resulting from thermoregulatory costs
   incurred by oiling of birds' feathers. However, the fates and responses
   of sublethally oiled birds are poorly known. Due to this knowledge gap
   and the potential for birds to die far from the spill site, resource
   risk and injury assessors need tools to make informed estimates for
   delayed deaths and lost reproductive capacity in these birds. Focusing
   on the thermoregulatory cost of oiled feathers, we present a model
   addressing one facet of the effects of sublethal oiling on birds. Using
   mallard-like ducks as a model organism, we combined values from previous
   laboratory studies of oiled birds with a modified version of an existing
   temperature-influenced avian migration energetics model. Using this
   model, we examined the potential effects of oiling on general migration
   patterns, changes in energetic gains required to compensate for oiling,
   and starvation. We assessed all metrics across multiple oiling
   severities; we assessed starvation across both oiling severity and body
   condition. Median estimates for delays in spring migration were one to
   two months for trace and lightly oiled birds, and we predicted arrested
   spring migration in moderately oiled birds. Median estimates of required
   in-creases in energetic gains to offset costs of increased
   thermoregulation ranged from 20.3\% to 88.6\% depending on severity of
   oiling. We predicted starvation within four weeks for most combinations
   of oiling severity and body condition at the median predicted minimum
   wintering temperature of unoiled birds (-4.9 degrees C). However, at the
   average winter temperature of the southernmost model latitude (10.8
   degrees C), we predicted only moderately oiled birds in
   less-than-excellent body condition had the potential to starve within a
   four-week time frame. Due to the potential for even trace oiling to
   delay spring migration and decrease body condition, the thermoregulatory
   costs of sublethal oiling during spring migration could reduce a bird's
   reproductive capacity. Future research inte -grating this initial
   energetics-based model into a spatially explicit, population scale
   migration model could provide additional insight into the potential
   effects of sublethal oiling on reproduction and survival. Such an
   integrated model could strengthen risk predictions and injury
   assessments for birds subjected to sublethal oiling.},

Title = {Quantitative evaluation of the effects of bycatch on native species
   using mathematical models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Traps and poison bait are used to control invasive species and protect
   native species. However, the traps can kill native species and the
   poison bait may increase their mortality. As it interferes with
   conservation efforts, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of such
   bycatch. However, there are few theoretical methods for quantification
   of these effects.This paper presents a method for quantitatively
   evaluating the effects of bycatch on native populations, using a
   mathematical model that represents the population dynamics of native and
   invasive species. The mathematical model suggested the conditions under
   which only invasive species will be eliminated even if bycatch occurs.
   We also present the concept of the ``bycatch curve{''}, which shows the
   population density according to the killing rate. In addition, a
   mathematical simulation is presented using parameters estimated for the
   Amami-Oshima system.These theoretical results allowed us to determine
   the parameters that should be prioritized for estimation in actual
   control programs.},

Title = {Managed culls mean extinction for a marine mammal population when
   combined with extreme climate impacts},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Human actions led to the worldwide decline of marine mammal populations
   in the 18th-19th centuries. Global adoption of protective legislation
   during the 20th century has recently allowed many marine mammal
   pop-ulations to recover. This positive trend is particularly true of
   pinnipeds (e.g., seals and sea lions), whose recovering populations are
   increasingly in conflict with fisheries. Fisheries organisations have
   called for managed culls of sea lion populations to reduce competition
   for target fish species as well as damage to catch and fishing gear
   through operational interactions. However, despite widespread
   perceptions that sea lion populations are generally increasing, to-date,
   culls have often been considered or implemented without quantitative
   evidence of their impacts on seal lion population viability. This
   knowledge gap is particularly concerning given the expected increase in
   extreme climate conditions, such as extreme El Nin \& SIM;o events,
   which together with culls could push sea lion populations in some parts
   of the world into the extinction vortex. Here, I develop stochastic
   matrix popu-lation models of the South American sea lion (Otaria
   flavescens) parameterised through a combination of species -specific
   field data and phylogenetic imputation using data from related species
   in the COMADRE animal matrix database. Using these models, I project the
   impact of (1) three cull scenarios with different intensity and
   tem-poral frequency targeting adult females, (2) extreme El Nin \& SIM;o
   events whose frequency is modelled using a Markovian transition matrix,
   and (3) the interaction of culls and extreme climate events on
   population dynamics. I focus on the Chilean population of O. flavescens,
   where recent increases in sea lion numbers have triggered widespread
   conflict with small-scale fisheries, and where sea lion populations will
   increasingly be affected by extreme El Nin \& SIM;o conditions. I find
   that sea lion populations decline below minimum viable population sizes
   within 16-28 years under all scenarios involving culls and extreme
   climate events. This research explicitly in-corporates parameter
   uncertainty into population projections-in so doing, it illustrates the
   need for future research to collect stage-specific, annual population
   data to reduce uncertainty regarding marine mammal vital rates.},

Title = {Field observation and numerical modelling of supersaturated dissolved
   gas at river confluence},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {471},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Confluences are common habitats of ecological significance given their
   complicated hydraulic structures and mass transportation. In hydropower
   cascades, dissolved gas supersaturation downstream of a dam becomes a
   negative environmental impact caused by dam spilling, which may cause
   fish to suffer from gas bubble disease and even death. A difference in
   the supersaturation level of dissolved gas is consistently noted between
   the mainstream and tributaries mainly due to their different cascade
   developments and dam scales, resulting in a significant nonuniform
   distribution of dissolved gas at a confluence. This study focused on
   describing the hy-drodynamics and dissolved gas distributions under
   unsteady inflows at an actual confluence of the Min River and Jinsha
   River in China. A long period of prototype observations on dissolved
   oxygen (DO) were conducted to demonstrate DO variation at the confluence
   and calibrate the DO dissipation coefficient. A depth-averaged
   two-dimensional numerical model was developed that reflects the
   nonconstant characteristics of flow and super-saturated DO at the
   confluence and was verified to be in good agreement with the measured
   data series. The supersaturated DO level at the confluence increases as
   the inflow DO level of the mainstream Jinsha River in -creases and
   decreases as the flow ratio of the branch Min River and Jinsha River
   increases, representing two aspects influencing the distribution of DO
   at the confluence. A comparison was performed to evaluate the DO
   saturation calculation method when DO was laterally mixed downstream of
   the confluence. The accuracy of the flow weighted average calculation
   based on the data of the mainstream and a tributary upstream of the
   confluence was acceptable, but the simulation method was recommended to
   obtain a refined distribution and spatial utilization of supersaturated
   DO at the confluence when it was necessary to pay more attention to the
   ecological function in this region. A two-dimensional unsteady numerical
   model based on valuable prototype observations was proposed, which
   provides technical tools for characterizing the hydrodynamics and
   dissolved gas variations and distributions at confluences and better
   evaluating the risk for fish in regions of great ecological
   significance.},

Title = {Identifying territories using presence-only citizen science data: An
   application to the Finnish wolf population},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {472},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Citizens, community groups and local institutions participate in
   voluntary biological monitoring of population status and trends by
   providing species data e.g. for regulations and conservation.
   Sophisticated statistical methods are required to unlock the potential
   of such data in the assessment of wildlife populations.We develop a
   statistical modelling framework for identifying territories based on
   presence-only citizen science data. The framework can be used to jointly
   estimate the number of active animal territories and their locations in
   time. Our approach is based on a data generating model which consists of
   a dynamic submodel for the appearance/removal of territories and an
   observation submodel that accounts for the varying observation intensity
   and links the data to the territories. We first estimate the observation
   intensity using past presence -only observations made by citizens,
   conditioning on previously known territories. We then infer the
   territories using a state-of-the-art sequential Monte Carlo method,
   which extends earlier approaches by allowing for spatial inhomogeneity
   in the observation process.We verify our data generating model and
   inference method successfully in synthetic scenarios. We apply our
   framework for estimating the locations and number of wolf territories in
   March 2020 in Finland using one year of confirmed citizen-made wolf
   observations.The observation intensity is estimated using wolf
   observation data collected in 2011-2019, conditioning on official
   territory estimates and data from GPS-collared wolves. Our experiments
   with synthetic data suggest that the estimation of territories can be
   feasible with presence -only data. Our location and territory count
   inferences for March 2020 based on past data are comparable to the
   official wolf population assessment of March 2020 by the Natural
   Resources Institute Finland. The results suggest that the framework can
   provide useful information for assessing populations of territorial
   animals. Furthermore, our methods and findings, such as the developed
   data generating model and the estimation of the spatio-temporal
   observation intensity can be relevant also beyond the strictly
   territorial setting.},

Title = {Self-healing time of population under dynamic disturbance},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {470},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The stability of ecological system is inseparable from the self-healing
   ability of population. Therefore, exploring the self-healing of
   population after disturbance is of great significance to deeply
   understand the ecological stability. By constructing a pair
   approximation model, the special explicit dynamics of one population on
   disturbance is studied in this paper. In which, dynamic disturbance
   (which can be gradually restored) is used, and the self-healing time of
   the population is investigated. Through a mass of simulations, some
   interesting results are obtained. At a lower disturbance restoration
   rate, the population self-healing time will not be affected by the
   spatial correlation of disturbance, regardless of the dispersal mode of
   population and the existence of competition. Compared with local
   dispersal, global dispersal has more obvious advantages at medium
   disturbance restoration rate. The increase of disturbance restoration
   rate is not always conducive to the self-healing of population, and a
   higher disturbance restoration rate will increase the self-healing time.
   The results can give us some insights on ecological conservation.},

Title = {An integrated modeling approach to predict trophic state changes in a
   large Brazilian reservoir},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {476},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Process-based ecological models have been used to study freshwater
   ecosystems and water quality on a broad scale. However, it is also of
   pivotal importance to incorporate watershed dynamics and nutrient
   releases in the downstream freshwaters. Integrated modeling approaches
   have been used to understand the combined effect of climate warming and
   land use and land cover (LULC) changes in lake ecosystems. Moreover,
   most basin-scale water quality models require many datasets and
   parameters to perform reliable simulations which contributes to reduce
   studies in poorly monitored basins, most of them located in the Global
   South. In this study, we developed a coupled
   hydrological-biogeochemical-ecological modeling framework forced by two
   regionalized climate models and three LULC change scenarios to forecast
   trophic state changes in a subtropical multipurpose reservoir for the
   decade 2050-2060. The projections indicated an average air temperature
   increase between 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C and a downward trend of the
   average rainfall and longwave radiation for the 2050s in comparison to
   the last decade. We found a pattern of 28\% increase in total phosphorus
   (TP) and total chlorophyll-a (TChla) con-centrations in the reservoir
   compared with the historical baseline. The climate warming projections
   along the 2059 projected LULC and basin's increased economic development
   scenarios have predicted trophic state index (TSI) shifts between
   mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions (53.3<TSI<57.7). On the other hand,
   one of the climate projections along the reduced deforestation scenario
   indicated a trend towards oligotrophication be-tween 2054 and 2056,
   however higher phosphorus availability (60 mu g.l- 1<TP<100 mu g.l-1)
   and phytoplankton biomass (50 mu g.l- 1<TChla<97 mu g.l-1) would be
   expected for the entire decade compared to recent years. The proposed
   coupled modeling framework demonstrated the potential of open-source
   tools in water quality man-agement studies, especially for poorly
   monitored basins, based on climate change trends and human pressure.},

   environment. Utilizing the statistical regression neural network (SRNN),
   greenhouse gas emissions have been predicted, and the deep neural
   network's (DNN) energy efficiency has increased. The SRNN\_DNN intensity
   method out predicts evaluated MLR (multiple linear regression) and
   second- and third-order non-linear MPR (multiple polynomial regression)
   techniques according to MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results.
   Furthermore, presented methods are considered suitable for computing GHG
   emissions due to the high accuracy of the SRNN DNN model. The
   anticipated greenhouse gas emissions related to energy were remarkably
   similar to the actual emissions of EU (European Union) nations.},

Title = {Grasshoppers exhibit asynchrony and spatial non-stationarity in response
   to the El Nino/Southern and Pacific Decadal Oscillations},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {471},

Abstract = {Grasshoppers are preeminent herbivores and perhaps the most significant
   rangeland pests in the United States (US). Despite the important
   ecosystem functions they provide, grasshopper populations often obtain
   densities that cause significant economic harm to grazing operations and
   agricultural production. Although numerous studies conducted at the
   level of individual field sites have examined potential mechanisms
   contributing to grasshopper population ``boom and bust'' cycles, there
   has yet to be a large, regional scaled analysis that quantified
   grasshopper variation across the Western US as a whole. While taking
   steps to account for data collection biases, mediating effects, and
   variable confounding, we assessed the influence of Pacific Ocean sea
   surface temperature oscillations on a 40-year record of grasshopper
   density in the Western US. Central to our analysis was employing
   spatially varying coefficients to model time and location-specific
   variation in grasshopper response to climate. Our results quantitatively
   demonstrated interannual changes in grasshopper density to be indirectly
   effected by seasonal El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO) variability and to exhibit spatial asynchrony
   and non-stationarity such that the relative influence of climate on
   grasshopper density varied through time and across geographic space. Our
   model is the first to incorporate climate indices as spatially varying
   coefficients for assessment of a terrestrial species and represents a
   critical step towards understanding causal drivers of regional
   grasshopper density.},

Abstract = {Progress in eupulmonate gastropod taxonomy is limited by absence of
   single- or low-copy nuclear DNA markers that provide species-scale
   insights. We detail here the single-copy intron 8 of the embryonic
   lethality and abnormal visual system gene (ELAVI8). High sequence
   conservation within flanking exons 8 and 9 allowed design of
   non-redundant primers that enable PCR amplification across a broad
   phylogenetic extent. Across the Eupulmonata and Hygrophila ELAVI8
   product ranged from 602 to 802 base pairs in length. A multiple sequence
   alignment across 62 taxa, representing 36 genera and 12 major clades,
   showed 1296 sites with 865 variable positions. Typically, 2-10 base pair
   differences were noted between closely related species within a genus,
   with 74-200 bases differing between major infra-order clades. ELAVI8
   maximum-likelihood trees showed essentially identical topologies at high
   levels of support compared to those created from concatenated ITS1 + 2
   (within a genus) or 28S (across Eupulmonata and Hygrophila). ELAVI8 is
   superior to these two phylogenetic marker regions, however, because it
   (1) resolves phylogenetic pattern from species- to sub-cohort scales in
   a single amplicon, (2) was better able to resolve family- and
   deeper-clades at high support, (3) allows for outgroup rooting between
   genera, and (4) possesses no intercopy haplotype variability.},

Title = {Error propagation in an integrated spatially-explicit individual-based
   model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Error propagation is an important consideration in individual-based
   modeling, but it has been considered insufficiently studied. We
   investigated the propagation of error due to uncertainty in initial
   conditions using a previously published spatially-explicit
   individual-based model that simulates infestation of sorghum by an
   invasive pest aphid, Melanaphis sorghi (Theobald) {[}sorghum aphid;
   previously published as sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari
   (Zehntner)]. We initialized the model with aphids in three alternative
   initial infestation locations using one of three neighboring cells and
   analyzed the resulting model outputs in three pairwise sce-nario
   comparisons. The spatio-temporal patterns of aphid infestation, as
   estimated by timing and probability of first infestation, were
   statistically significantly different between the scenarios, but the
   differences were locally restricted and scenario-dependent. In
   particular, the two pairwise differences between scenarios originating
   from neighboring cells indicated that error propagation through the
   studied system depends not only on the physical distance between the
   alternative initialization cells (i.e., the extent of the initial
   spatial uncertainty), but also on the actual location of the model
   initialization cells, likely reflecting differences in the environmental
   charac-teristics of those locations. Despite the statistical
   significance, the differences were small from the perspective of
   practical application with few highly localized exceptions. The
   spatio-temporal trajectories of the propagating error indicate that,
   within the examined range, the spatial uncertainty in model
   initialization has a low effect on the timing and probability of first
   infestation, and the propagation of the error in the observed variables
   is limited by the system itself.},

Title = {Use of remote sensing and bio-geochemical models to estimate the net
   carbon fluxes of managed mountain grasslands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The current paper presents a methodology which can simulate the net
   carbon fluxes of semi-natural grasslands based on the combination of a
   parametric and a bio-geochemical model. The first model (modified C-Fix)
   esti-mates grassland gross primary production (GPP) by driving the light
   use efficiency approach with remotely sensed normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) data. The latter model (BIOME-BGC) simulates all
   main ecosystem processes based on meteorological and ancillary data. The
   outputs of the two models are finally combined and corrected for the
   effects of human-induced biomass changes (i.e. mowing, grazing, etc.).
   The modelling strategy, fed with ancillary and MODIS NDVI data, is
   tested in two semi-natural grasslands, the first (Amplero) on the
   Apennines and the second (Monte Bondone) on the Alps (Central and
   Northern Italy, respectively). The two sites, which show diversified
   eco-climatic conditions and are managed differently (i.e. Amplero by
   spring mowing plus cattle grazing and Monte Bondone by summer mowing),
   were selected for the availability of eddy covariance observations of
   GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) collected during several years
   (from 2003 to 2012). These observations were used to assess the
   estimates of the modelling strategy, obtaining promising results for
   both study sites. The greatest estimation errors are found in the Alpine
   site and are mostly induced by the inaccurate detection of local
   grassland NDVI values, which is due to the insufficient spatial and
   temporal resolutions of the used MODIS NDVI imagery. The results of the
   study highlight the importance of information on the local management
   practices applied, which is decisive for quantifying medium -term
   changes in net carbon fluxes.},

Title = {A review of models for simulating the soil-plant interface for different

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Impacts due to climate change, population growth and intensive
   agriculture continue to be a major concern worldwide. Sustainable
   agriculture with coherent land management strategies is essential to
   mitigate against adverse environmental impacts. For the Chinese Loess
   Plateau (CLP), much research has focused on implementing
   soil-plant-atmosphere models to inform mitigation initiatives such as
   large-scale vegetation restoration programs. However, model choice
   typically depends on measurement availability and specific research
   questions, where many modeling approaches are established according to
   site specific data and parameterized via local information, making their
   generalization elsewhere difficult. Furthermore, in most studies only
   one modeling approach is selected, and thus its merit is difficult to
   assess relative to alternatives. Given these challenges, this review
   examines the capability of models with different level of complexity to
   simulate water fluxes and nutrient transformations for the CLP. Reviewed
   models were typically employed under different climate conditions (e.g.,
   snowmelt, soil freezing and thawing) and across different land-uses
   (e.g., revegetated areas) which reflects the robustness of some models
   (e.g., for description of vegetation grow), but at the same time
   illustrates model weaknesses that should be addressed (e.g., water
   simulations under thawing conditions). On conducting this review, a
   general framework for choosing or developing the most appropriate
   modeling approach is established given a study site's climatic and
   ecological conditions and research aims.},

Title = {Higher-order interactions on disease transmission can reverse the
   dilution effect or weaken the amplification effect to unimodal pattern},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Determining whether species richness protects host species against
   infectious diseases transmission (i.e., dilution effect) within
   established communities is a core concern of disease ecology. Previous
   modeling studies have focused on pairwise transmission between hosts,
   largely ignoring the impact of neighboring species on pathogen
   transmission. Here, we modified the multi-host
   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to investigate the effects of
   higher-order interactions on the dilution effect. We found that compared
   with direct transmission, higher-order interactions that impede pathogen
   transmission can disproportionately decrease disease risk at high
   species richness levels under additive community assembly and thereby
   enhance a dilution effect or neutralizing an amplification effect into a
   unimodal species richness-disease relationship. Conversely, higher-order
   in-teractions that promote infection among host neighbors can enlarge an
   amplification effect and diminish a dilution effect or even reverse it.
   Higher-order interactions did not affect the emergence of the dilution
   effect for substitutive community assembly. Our results provide a
   unified framework for understanding the dilution and amplification
   effects and emphasize the importance of taking higher-order interactions
   into account for under-standing mechanisms underlying the dilution
   effect.},

Title = {A new species abundance distribution model including the hydrological
   niche differentiation in water-limited ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {470},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The formation and maintenance mechanism of biodiversity is a key
   research topic in community ecology. Establishing a model that can be
   used to explain and predict the changes of community biodiversity is of
   great significance in facilitating the analysis and protection of
   biodiversity. How hydrological niche differentiation determines species
   abundance distribution requires further exploration. In this paper, by
   analyzing the characteristics of evolutionary stability of plant
   communities, the evolutionary stability theory of community water
   resource allocation is studied in water-limited environments. The water
   consumption of an individual biomass growth is used to quantify the
   hydrological niche of the species. The arithmetic mean and harmonic mean
   ratio of the hydrological niche of a species in the community as a new
   diversity index is used to measure community hydrological niche
   differentiation. A new hydrological niche plant diversity model is
   established, and the species abundance curve and species area curve,
   including the community hydrological niche differentiation factor, are
   obtained. It was discovered that the distribution model of species
   abundance was close to the Fisher log series distribution, which unifies
   and expands the classical diversity theories. The quantitative
   relationship between the hydrological niche and plant diversity is
   given. It is proposed that the plant diversity of a community is
   determined by regionally available water resources and changes in the
   species abundance that are filtered by the local biological and abiotic
   environment and driven by the full utilization of water resources.},

Title = {A new model formulation for host depletion in parasitoids},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A new model of host depletion in the functional response of parasitoids
   is presented. Most existing models describe the dynamics of prey
   consumption as a sequential-memoryless/Markovian process of searching
   for, handling, and consuming prey, but the feeding interaction between a
   parasitoid and its host is different. One of the most important
   characteristics is that the host is not consumed, and remains in the
   arena. On the other hand, functional response models of solitary
   parasitoids assume that each host can accommodate an infinite number of
   oviposition events without being killed or becoming unsuitable as a host
   without the parasitoid noticing it. As a consequence, host depletion is
   never considered in parasitoid functional response models. To solve that
   issue, we extended the traditional random predator and random parasitoid
   functional response models of Rogers into a compartmental model
   formulated with ordinary differential equations, to group hosts with a
   different number of attacks to simulate how the parasitoid spreads the
   attacks between already parasitized and non-parasitized hosts. This
   model was further modified to simulate non-sequential memoryless search,
   handling and oviposition. We studied the behaviour of these models to
   understand how a variation of their parameters led to different shapes
   of functional response curves and statistical distributions of the
   number of parasitoid eggs laid per host. The results showed that the
   expected curves differ from those predicted by the simpler Holling's
   disk equation (type II functional response), random parasitoid models
   (no depletion), and the random predator model (proportional depletion).
   Finally, the non-sequential-memoryless models predict straight curves
   resembling a type I functional response at low host densities.},

Title = {A quantitative application of diffusion of innovations for modeling the
   spread of conservation behaviors},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of community-based conservation is challenged by a large
   number of important variables and nonlinear dynamics. This complexity
   has made quantitative and comparative analyses notoriously difficult.
   Here, we argue that analyzing the emergence and persistence of
   community-based conservation institutions as an emergent phenomenon of
   individual decision-making can yield important quantitative insights. We
   first review diffusion of innovations theory (DOI) and the broader field
   of cultural evolution. We then simulate data on community adoption of a
   conservation institution, contingent on feedbacks between individual
   behavior and environmental processes. We demonstrate that fitting these
   data to differential models of disease transmission, on which DOI is
   founded, can produce reliable estimates of the rates of adoption,
   dropout, and long-term uptake of an institution. Overall, we explore a
   new quantitative approach for modeling the spread of conservation
   behaviors using probabilistic differential equations and argue for
   further incorporation of cultural evolutionary theory into the field.},

Abstract = {The nylon shrimp Heterocarpus reedi is the most important commercial
   demersal crustacean species along the central coast of Chile in the
   southeast Pacific, with an intense fishery since the 1950s. It inhabits
   between 155 and 800 m of depth and is harvested along most of its
   distributional range (21 degrees S to 39 degrees S) by bottom trawling.
   Current management policy considers a single population unit on the
   lower continental shelf margin and upper slope along the exploitation
   area. The goal of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and
   differentiation of H. reedi along the geographic area of exploitation,
   representing the first insights into population genetics of a demersal
   crustacean from Chile. We analyzed 446 partial sequences of the
   mitochondrial COI gene from individuals captured using bottom trawls
   from 14 sites separated by 1 degrees of latitude, covering the
   exploitation area and bathymetric range of the benthic adults. Data
   showed high genetic diversity despite an extensive fishing pressure and
   absence of genetic differentiation among sites. Haplotype diversity
   showed a negative correlation with depth of the trawling, consistent
   with lower abundance of individuals at depths greater than 400 m. Also,
   a high effective population size and a post-LGM demographic expansion
   was detected. Lack of spatial and bathymetrical genetic differentiation
   and extensive gene flow reflect that the species is composed of a single
   panmictic unit. Phylogeographic structure suggests considering latitude,
   depth, and temporal variation in future assessments of the species.},

Title = {Chaos does not drive lower synchrony for intrinsically-induced
   population fluctuations},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Amphibians naturally occur in metapopulations characterized by spatially
   separated breeding habitats connected by dispersing individuals. The
   rate at which individuals grow to maturity, size of the metapopulation,
   and movement behavior varies widely across amphibian species, and their
   compounding interactions play a large role in population dynamics and
   viability. When populations in a connected network exhibit cyclic
   behavior the level of synchrony between populations is important for
   assessing extinction risk. In addition, the qualitative behavior of
   fluctuations provides insight into the patterns of the population cycles
   and can be used to predict forward trajectories in time. Chaotic
   oscillations, characterized by aperiodic cycles and sensitivity to
   initial conditions, are known to amplify noise, thus lowering population
   synchrony; however, other oscillation types (invariant cycles, k-cycles)
   have not been explicitly explored in relation to synchrony. In this
   paper, we inves-tigate the relationship between synchrony and
   oscillation type for a two-patch system of a species with 1, 2, and 3
   life-history stages. Using dynamical systems analysis, we determine the
   mechanisms that induce the different oscillation types and relate them
   with dispersal rates and synchrony. We find that dispersal has a greater
   effect on population dynamics of a species with 1 life-history stage
   compared to the subtle changes in dynamics found for species with 2 and
   3 life-history stages. For low levels of dispersal, oscillating
   populations are driven to equi-librium as synchrony increases. Under
   medium to high levels of dispersal, oscillations may be created from
   equilibrium with low levels of synchrony. In general, chaos does not
   have noticeably lower synchrony than other oscillation types but has
   synchrony levels comparable to the oscillation types surrounding chaos.
   In this study, we cover a broad range of dispersal probabilities and
   life histories intended for general amphibian systems. The variety of
   results found in our analysis emphasizes the importance of determining
   model parameters and life history assumptions when studying specific
   amphibian species to ensure that the resulting dynamics accurately
   reflect the system.},

Title = {Testing MaxEnt model performance in a novel geographic region using an
   intentionally introduced insect},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM's), such as the popular MaxEnt
   software, are frequently used to guide conservation programmes, predict
   the potential distribution of invasive species, forecast the impacts of
   climate change and develop applied ecological research (e.g., biological
   control). Many applications of these models require that SDM's be
   transferred in either space and/or time. However, few studies to date
   have tested the transferability, and thus usefulness, of MaxEnt models
   using fully independent data. Moreover, numerous authors have raised
   concerns over how model complexity (controlled primarily by feature
   class and regularisation multiplier settings) may affect MaxEnt model
   transferability. In this paper, we evaluated the usefulness of MaxEnt
   models when transferred in space using the native Australian insect
   Dasineura rubiformis Kolesik (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) which has been
   intentionally introduced as a biological control agent of the invasive
   plant Acacia mearnsii De Wild (Fabaceae) in South Africa. MaxEnt's
   models were developed using native-range records only (Australia) and
   projected over South Africa to identify the potential climatic
   suitability for the insect, using a range of model parameter
   configurations. Model transferability was assessed using independent
   post-release data from South Africa. Our results demonstrated that
   MaxEnt scores were positively correlated with increased probabilities of
   recording D. rubiformis at field sites in South Africa. However, the
   accuracy of the MaxEnt models and their climatic suitability projections
   depended on the parameter configurations (i.e. features classes and
   regularisation multipliers) used to calibrate the models. Taken
   together, MaxEnt models can be useful in predicting where a species may
   establish, even when projected into a novel geographic area, but users
   need to be aware of how model parameter configurations and model
   extrapolation can influence model outputs and uncertainty. We
   demonstrate how statistical validation of the D. rubiformis MaxEnt
   models can be used to develop an environmental management programme
   towards improving the biological control of A. mearnsii using D.
   rubiformis by selecting optimal release sites.},

Title = {An analytical solution for optimising detections when accounting for
   site establishment costs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Indirect surveillance methods, such as remote cameras and acoustic
   monitoring, are increasingly used in ecological surveys. The time to
   deploy these devices includes initial setup, possible maintenance,
   retrieval and then a potentially large investment in the processing of
   the collected data. Thus, costs will increase with both the number of
   sites at which devices are deployed and the time they remain in the
   field, creating a trade-off between these factors when aiming to
   maximise the number of sites with detections. Here we examine a scenario
   in which a target species occupies a proportion of the possible survey
   sites (4,), establishing a new site has a fixed cost (c), each survey of
   a site entails a cost per unit of survey effort (t), there is imperfect
   detection of the species during each survey such that the probability of
   failing to detect the species with a unit of survey effort is q when the
   species is present, and there is a total budget that can be allocated to
   establishing and surveying sites (B). We show that the expected number
   of sites with detections is maximised by surveying each site with a
   particular amount of survey effort (o) that depends only on q and c.
   This analytical result can be used by researchers to optimise their
   survey effort prior to field work and provide opportunities for optimal
   allocation of their survey budget. We illustrate the method with an
   application to surveys of the threatened Leadbeater's Possum
   (Gymnobelidus leadbeateri).},

Title = {Identification and analysis of areas prone to conflict with wild boar
   (Sus scrofa) in the vineyards of Malayer County, western Iran},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {471},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Boars with high reproduction, wide distribution, and adaptability have
   great potential to conflict with human interests. Malayer County, in
   Hamedan Province, is one of the economic hubs of grape production and
   related products in Iran. Considering that the county's economic growth
   is based on this horticultural product, this study was conducted to
   detect conflict-prone areas in different land use/cover (LULC) types and
   landforms. The ensemble model of attack risk was developed using single
   tree and regression models and 10 topographic, vegetation, and human
   variables. The significant difference between conflict/non-conflict
   points in the LULC and landform maps was checked using the Chi-square
   test. The results showed a significant difference in the occurrence of
   conflict in different LULC classes (P < 0.05). The NDVI, the distance
   from spring, and the distance from vineyards were the three variables
   with the greatest effect in all models. The widest niche-breadth
   conflict in the LULC and landform types belonged to gardens and u-shaped
   valleys (B1 = 0.60, B2 = 0.95; B1 = 0.35, B2 = 0.91, respectively Those
   gardens in deeply incised streams and u-shaped valleys have the highest
   potential for conflict (65.68\%). Based on the findings, in the event of
   a conflict, those arrangements of structural elements of the land
   landscape are effective, which increase the species' accessibility to
   the vineyards while providing security. In this study, long and
   permanent vegetation such as groves can increase the vulnerability of
   marginal orchards and agricultural lands. Programs to reduce the
   conflict with wild boars should be based on local adaptations, prey
   relations, the improvement of traditional cultivation, and securing the
   vineyards in Malayer County.},

Title = {Small mammals (Insectivora, Rodentia, Lagomorpha) from the Early
   Pleistocene hominin-bearing site of Dmanisi (Georgia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Small mammals (insectivores, rodents, and lagomorphs) from Dmanisi are
   here reviewed for the first time and used as a tool for
   paleoenvironmental proxies. The small mammal faunal list is composed of
   shrews (Beremendia fissidens, cf. Beremendia minor, Crocidura
   kornfeldi), hamsters (Cricetulus sp., Allocricetus bursae), gerbils
   (Parameriones aff. obeidiyensis), murids (Apodemus cf. atavus),
   arvicolids (Mimomys pliocaenicus, Mimomys aff. pusillus), and pikas
   (Ochotona sp.). A paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on the habitat
   weighting method has been applied to the rodent assemblage. According to
   this method, the most common elements indicate an open-dry habitat
   (36.5\%), followed by water edge (25.7\%) and rocky (21.0\%) elements.
   Open-wet (15.5\%) and woodland elements (1.3\%) are rare. Therefore, the
   habitat occupied by the hominids of Dmanisi was characterized by the
   prevalence of arid conditions, from steppe or semi-desert to open
   Mediterranean forest, with stony or rocky substrate and bushy areas. The
   presence of permanent aquatic environments is also documented. From a
   biogeographic point of view, the small mammal community from Dmanisi is
   composed mainly by Western or Central Asian elements, with a poor
   representation of European elements (Mimomys, Apodemus). It is concluded
   that Dmanisi hominins most possibly had ecological requirements which
   were different from those of the Early Pleistocene hominins from Western
   Europe, which settled on wetter habitats. It could be also possible that
   Dmanisi hominins entered Southern Caucasus at an interglacial phase
   before the deposition of the Dmanisi site. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Using individual-based modelling to investigate a pluralistic
   explanation for the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animal species},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Attempts to resolve the paradox of sexual reproduction in animal species
   have typically involved single factor explanations, including but not
   limited to sexual species being better able to cope with fluctuating
   resources, being better able to evade pathogens and predators and sex
   facilitating the elimination of deleterious alleles. Only a handful of
   studies have investigated two potentially interacting factors, which
   most commonly involve the ability to evade pathogens and predators and
   mutation load; only two simulation studies by the same authors have
   examined the potential interaction of 3 factors.. Our study is the first
   three-factor study to examine the potential interaction between
   purifying selection, the ability to avoid predators and the ability to
   cope with fluctuating resources. Therefore, we addressed a number of
   open eco-evolutionary questions in our study: First, what is the effect
   of these three factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction in
   animals? Second, do these factors act integratively, antagonistically or
   independently in determining the prevalence of sexual reproduction The
   `controls' were our three prior studies where we investigated each of
   these factors individually. Our aim was to determine if the effect sizes
   in our individual studies were integratively enhanced by the interaction
   with the remaining two factors. What we found is that purifying
   selection purging deleterious alleles in sexual species was
   integratively enhanced by the two additional factors of increased
   predation and fluctuating resources. On the other hand, the effect of
   purifying selection and increased predation had an antagonistic effect
   on the levels of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction in
   facultative species where there were fluctuating resources. Finally, the
   presence of an intermediate intensity deleterious allele and fluctuating
   resources had no discernable effect on the extinction levels of sexual
   and asexual species where there is increased predation. These results
   are not surprising, as there is no a priori reason to assume that
   multiple factors will have a greater impact on mode of reproduction than
   any of these factors acting independently. Our results suggest that
   multiple factors can act intergratively, antagonistically and
   non-reductively all at the same time, which is a significant
   contribution to the open question in the biological literature regarding
   the effect of multiple factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction.},

Title = {A spatially implicit model fails to predict the structure of spatially
   explicit metacommunities under high dispersal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Metacommunities are the product of species dispersal and topology.
   Metacommunity studies often use spatially implicit models, implemented
   by fully connected topologies, in which the precise spatial arrangement
   of habitat patches is not specified. Few studies use spatially explicit
   models, even though real-world metacommunities are likely structured by
   topology. Here, we test whether a spatially implicit resource
   consumption model based on a fully connected topology could predict the
   structure of spatially explicit metacommunities. Having controlled for
   environmental heterogeneity, we focus specifically on the effects of
   species dispersal and topology on metacommunity structure. We classified
   the topologies according to the shortest path between the most distant
   nodes (i.e. the graph diameter). Topologies with small diameters are
   tightly connected, whereas large diameter graphs are loosely connected.
   Some general trends emerged with increasing dispersal rate, such as a
   hump-shaped pattern in alpha-diversity, and a plateau followed by a
   decline in gamma- diversity. However, the importance of topology was
   also apparent: alpha-diversity peaked at low dispersal rates in small
   diameter topologies, but at high dispersal rates in large diameter
   topologies. At low dispersal rates, alpha-diversity was higher in
   spatially implicit than in spatially explicit metacommunities. At medium
   dispersal we detected stronger species sorting in the small diameter
   than in the large diameter topologies. Increasing dispersal caused
   alpha-diversity to decline more dramatically in small diameter
   topologies. Smaller metacommunities were dominated by regional
   competitors, whereas larger communities exhibited patterns of species
   biomass distribution leading to emergent niche structures. Increasing
   dispersal caused the mean productivity of each patch to undergo partial
   declines in spatially implicit metacommunities but continue to decline
   sharply in spatially explicit metacommunities. We conclude that
   spatially implicit models should be used cautiously when predicting the
   biodiversity, community composition or ecosystem functions of spatially
   explicit metacommunities at medium, and especially at high dispersal
   rates.},

   and Emergy Analysis (EA) are appropriate tools to achieve the principles
   of sus-tainability in different ecosystems. This study aimed to compare
   the indicators and determine the ecological sustainability of two
   cropping systems of irrigated wheat and grain maize using ecological
   footprint evaluation and emergy analysis in the catchment area of Dez in
   Iran in the crop year 2019-2020. For this purpose, a total of 400
   questionnaires from wheat and maize farmers were collected based on a
   simple random sampling method. The results of evaluating the ecological
   footprint method of wheat and maize cultivation in the study area at the
   level of one hectare were 3.50 and 4.66 global hectares, respectively.
   Also, the results of total emergy inputs for the ecological system of
   wheat and maize production were 1.60E+16 and 2.55E+16 sej ha-1 per year,
   respec-tively. This study showed that the two methods EF and EA are
   complementary. The evaluation results of both sustainability indices
   were very close to each other so both cultivation systems were
   environmentally unsus-tainable. We also found that the ecosystem of the
   irrigated wheat production system is more desirable than the ecosystem
   of the maize production system in terms of yield, renewability, and
   environmental sustainability. Since both cropping systems are strongly
   affected by the purchased inputs (more than 95\%), as a result, they
   create a high environmental pressure, which shows the apprehensive
   condition of the current agricultural pro-duction systems in Iran. This
   study is the first study from Iran that uses these two tools
   simultaneously to determine the sustainability assessment of two
   strategic products of the region.},

Title = {Trophic model closure influences ecosystem response to enrichment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There exists considerable uncertainty about the most appropriate
   functional form to describe mortality at the highest trophic level (the
   closure problem). Although linear and quadratic formulations predict
   strongly different dynamics, it is unclear which of these formulations
   is more realistic. We introduce an implicit predator population feeding
   on the highest trophic level, parameterized through a Holling Type II
   functional response and empirically observed predator-prey scaling
   relations. Thus, we arrive at a hyperbolic mortality formulation that is
   a hybrid between the linear and quadratic forms. Subsequently, we
   investigate the impact of this formulation on the modeled population
   dynamics. In particular, we compare the stability properties of simple
   food-chain models with a hyperbolic mortality and a linear mortality.
   Contrary to classical theory, the model with a hyperbolic mortality does
   not exhibit destabilization due to nutrient enrichment. For this model,
   we find that limit cycles are rather associated with a top-heavy
   ecosystem structure (high predator, low prey densities). The weak
   response to enrichment emerges because populations of both the predator
   and prey increase with nutrient supply, consistent with observations. We
   discuss the mechanism behind the relationship between top-heaviness and
   instability from an ecological and a mathematical perspective.},

Title = {Development of models for sustainable green mussel cultivation under
   climate change events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research developed a green mussel cultivation model to assist
   sustainable production for farmers under climate change events. The
   model consists of 4 sub-models: mussel growth, phytoplankton population,
   the effect of seawater quality on mussel density, and the influence of
   atmospheric parameters on seawater quality. The integrated model was
   constructed by STELLA software and was calibrated with field observation
   data. The model was employed to simulate the impact of climate change on
   mussels based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: The
   Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) projection. Results demonstrated that
   mussel production varied due to differences in the available
   phytoplankton, the initial mussel weight, the cultivation period, the
   air temperature, and the rainfall pattern. The model simulations showed
   that under the greater radiative forcing scenario (Representative
   Concentration Pathways: RCPs), higher rainfall and air temperatures
   resulted in salinity reduction and thermal stress on green mussels.
   Consequently, mussel production was forecasted to decline over time. The
   simulations also revealed that during extreme weather events, low mussel
   density, high aeration, and being far from freshwater discharge could
   avoid mass mussel mortality. Using the results of the developed model,
   an appropriate cultivation period can be forecasted. However, it depends
   on the site-specific climate pattern in each cultivation area. Results
   can be employed as a climate change adaptation tool for mussel farmers.
   Finally, the information can assist other researchers interested in
   sustainable mussel cultivation under extreme events.},

Title = {Keeping up with the math: Advancing the ecological foundation of the
   Great Lakes Cladophora Model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The nearshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes have historically
   suffered from beach fouling and clogged water intakes due to
   proliferation of the native, filamentous green alga Cladophora. A
   resurgence in nuisance growth of the alga has led to a demand for an
   improved model platform to better guide management. The Great Lakes
   Cladophora model (GLCM v3) predicts algal biomass (g dry matter m-2) and
   stored phosphorus content (P as \% of dry matter) based on simulations
   forced by time series of incident light (I), water temperature (T) and
   water column soluble reactive phosphorus concentration (SRP, mu gP L-1).
   A particular strength of the GLCM v3 is its foundation in ecologically
   sound biokinetic mechanisms, supported by field and laboratory
   measurements. These measurements, advancing the credibility and
   reliability of the biokinetic framework, include improved
   characterization of the growth and respiration responses to light and
   temperature, addition of a self-shading algorithm replacing an overly
   deterministic carrying capacity term, a new treatment of phosphorus
   uptake based on radioisotope experiments, additional observational
   support for Droop-based simulation of growth as a function of stored P,
   and implementation of a new physiologically and physically driven
   sloughing function. Uncertainty associated with processes collectively
   termed ``environmental friction{''} (the I, T, and P growth forcing
   functions) is reduced, leaving the model sensitive to the maximum
   specific growth rate and the coefficient for extinction of
   photosynthetically active radiation through the algal mat. The model was
   performance tested by multi-lake (Erie, Huron, Ontario, and Michigan)
   calibration employing a common set of biophysical coefficients. This
   common set of calibration coefficients provides enhanced corroboration
   that GLCM v3 is suitable for examining the phosphorus-Cladophora dynamic
   across the Great Lakes. In particular, it greatly strengthens the
   model's efficacy for establishing a phosphorus standard to maintain
   levels of algal biomass below those constituting a nuisance condition,
   as per the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 2012. In addition, the
   model structure can be applied to other lakes experiencing problems with
   attached filamentous algae.},

Title = {Choice of climate data affects the performance and interpretation of
   species distribution models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {471},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate is a core aspect of a species' niche that is frequently
   incorporated into species distribution models (SDMs). The proliferation
   of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of
   climate-based species distribution models (CSDMs) in conservation
   planning and management. However, it is uncertain how sensitive CSDMs
   are to the choice of climate data used. We compared the performance of
   maximum entropy-based CSDMs calibrated with seven different climate data
   sets (WorldClim, Chelsa, TerraClimate, Climate Research Unit Time-Series
   {[}CRU-TS], PRISM, StreamCat, and EarthEnv). For each species (four
   amphibians and two reptiles in California), we used a standardized,
   objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set. We
   then assessed performance with standard metrics, calculated variable
   importance scores, and compared predicted distributions to historical
   range maps of the target species. The climate data set used affected
   CSDM performance, with models based on some data sets overpredicting and
   others underpredicting distribu-tions compared with historical range
   maps of each of the species. Critically, for the six species we tested,
   no one climate data set always performed worst or best. These results
   indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be
   incorporated into model evaluation when developing, applying, and
   interpreting climate-based SDMs.},

Title = {Simulation of N2O emissions from greenhouse vegetable production under
   different management systems in North China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {470},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from greenhouse vegetable
   production systems (GVPS) is helpful to direct carbon sequestration and
   greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The objectives of this study were to
   (i) evaluate the performance of the improved WHCNS-Veg model (soil Water
   Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulation for Vegetable) in simulating nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emissions under different GVPS and (ii) analyze the impact
   of different management systems on N2O emissions from the GVPS.
   Greenhouse vegetable experiments were carried out under different
   management systems, including conventional (CON), integrated (INT) and
   organic (ORG), in Quzhou County, Hebei province from 2013 to 2015. Field
   observations of soil water content, soil nitrate concentration and N2O
   emissions were used to calibrate and validate the WHCNS-Veg model. The
   sensitivity analysis results showed that the effects of soil hydraulic
   parameters on N2O emissions were higher than those of N transformation
   and vegetable genetic parameters. The improved WHCNS-Veg model simulated
   soil water content, soil nitrate concentration and N2O emissions well
   under different GVPS. The average N2O emissions in the spring-summer
   season (16.3 kg N ha(-1)) were about 2.5 times higher than the
   autumn-winter season (6.4 kg N ha(-1)). Among the four seasons, the
   average N2O emissions of CON, ORG and INT were 13.5, 11.3 and 9.3 kg N
   ha(-1), respectively, accounting for 1.4-1.7\% of the total fertilizer
   input. The N2O emissions of the INT and ORG systems were 31.1\% and
   16.3\% lower than the CON treatment, respectively. The results indicated
   that the improved WHCNS-Veg model can be used to simulate and analyze
   N2O emissions under different management systems and substituting
   organic manure for chemical fertilizer could effectively reduce the N2O
   emissions in the GVPS.},

Title = {Two Late Pleistocene human femora from Trinil, Indonesia: Implications
   for body size and behavior in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Late Pleistocene hominin postcranial specimens from Southeast Asia are
   relatively rare. Here we describe and place into temporal and geographic
   context two partial femora from the site of Trinil, Indonesia, which are
   dated stratigraphically and via Uranium-series direct dating to ca.
   37-32 Ica. The specimens, designated Trinil 9 and 10, include most of
   the diaphysis, with Trinil 9 being much better preserved. Microcomputed
   tomography is used to determine cross-sectional diaphyseal properties,
   with an emphasis on midshaft anteroposterior to mediolateral bending
   rigidity (I-x/I-y), which has been shown to relate to both body shape
   and activity level in modern humans. The body mass of Trinil 9 is
   estimated from cortical area and reconstructed length using new
   equations based on a Pleistocene reference sample. Comparisons are
   carried out with a large sample of Pleistocene and Holocene East Asian,
   African, and European/West Asian femora. Our results show that Trinil 9
   has a high I-x/I-y ratio, most consistent with a relatively
   narrow-bodied male from a mobile hunting-gathering population. It has an
   estimated body mass of 55.4 kg and a stature of 156 cm, which are small
   relative to Late Pleistocene males worldwide, but larger than the
   penecontemporaneous Deep Skull femur from Niah Cave, Malaysia, which is
   very likely female. This suggests the presence of small-bodied active
   huntergatherers in Southeast Asia during the later Late Pleistocene.
   Trinil 9 also contrasts strongly in morphology with earlier partial
   femora from Trinil dating to the late Early-early Middle Pleistocene
   (Femora II-V), and to a lesser extent with the well-known complete Femur
   I, most likely dating to the terminal Middle-early Late Pleistocene.
   Temporal changes in morphology among femoral specimens from Trinil
   parallel those observed in Homo throughout the Old World during the
   Pleistocene and document these differences within a single site. (C)

Title = {A revised (earliest Vallesian) age for the hominoid-bearing locality of
   Can Mata 1 based on new magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data
   from Abocador de Can Mata (Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Abocador de Can Mata (ACM) composite stratigraphic sequence (els
   Hostalets de Pierola, Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula) has
   yielded a diverse primate assemblage from the late Aragonian (Middle to
   Late Miocene). Detailed litho-, bio-, and magnetostratigraphic control
   has enabled an accurate dating of these fossil remains. Comparable data,
   however, were lacking for the nearby locality of Can Mata 1 (CM1), which
   yielded a dryopithecine canine of a female individual. Given the lack of
   hipparionin equids and giraffids, CM1 has been correlated to the latest
   Aragonian (Mammal Neogene {[}MN] zone MN7+8). Here we revise the age of
   CM1 based on fieldwork and associated paleomagnetic samplings undertaken
   in 2018-2021. Our results extend the ACM composite sequence upward and
   indicate that CM1 correlates to the earliest Vallesian (MN9). The
   updated ACM sequence has a thickness of similar to 300 m and comprises
   12 magnetozones correlated to subchrons C5Ar.1r to C5n.2n (similar to
   12.6-11.1 Ma; latest MN6 to earliest MN9, late Aragonian to earliest
   Vallesian). CM1 is correlated to C5r.1r (11.146-11.056 Ma), with an
   interpolated age of 11.11 Ma, thus postdating the dispersal of
   hipparionin horses into the Valles-Penedes Basin-which is correlated to
   the previous subchron C5r.1n, with an interpolated age of 11.18 Ma, and
   by definition marks the beginning of the Vallesian. CM1 also minimally
   postdates the earliest record of giraffids at ACM-representing their
   earliest well-dated occurrence in the basin-being correlated to C5r.1n
   with an interpolated age of 11.11 Ma. We conclude that CM1 has an
   earliest Vallesian (MN9) age of similar to 11.1 Ma, intermediate between
   the Aragonian dryopithecins and the Vallesian hispanopithecins. Ongoing
   paleontological surveillance at ACM thus offers the prospect to yield
   additional earliest Vallesian ape remains, which are essential to
   clarify their taxonomic allocation as well as to confirm whether
   hispanopithecins evolved locally from dryopithecins rather than
   immigrating from elsewhere during MN9. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Comparing walking and running in persistence hunting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It has been proposed that humans' exceptional locomotor endurance
   evolved partly with foraging in hot open habitats and subsequently about
   2 million years ago with persistence hunting, for which endurance
   running was instrumental. However, persistence hunting by walking, if
   successful, could select for locomotor endurance even before the
   emergence of any running-related traits in human evolution. Using a heat
   exchange model validated here in 73 humans and 55 ungulates, we
   simulated persistence hunts for prey of three sizes (100, 250, and 400
   kg) and three sweating capacities (nonsweating, low, high) at 6237
   combinations of hunter's velocity (1-5 m s(-1), intermittent), air
   temperature (25-45 degrees C), relative humidity (30-90\%), and start
   time (8:00-16:00). Our simulations predicted that walking would be
   successful in persistence hunting of low- and nonsweating prey,
   especially under hot and humid conditions. However, simulated
   persistence hunts by walking yielded a 30-74\% lower success rate than
   hunts by running or intermittent running. In addition, despite requiring
   10-30\% less energy, successful simulated persistence hunts by walking
   were twice as long and resulted in greater exhaustion of the hunter than
   hunts by running and intermittent running. These shortcomings of pursuit
   by walking compared to running identified in our simulations could
   explain why there is only a single direct description of persistence
   hunting by walking among modern hunter-gatherers. Nevertheless, walking
   down prey could be a viable option for hominins who did not possess the
   endurance-running phenotype of the proposed first persistence hunter,
   Homo erectus. Our simulation results suggest that persistence hunting
   could select for both long-distance walking and endurance running and
   contribute to the evolution of locomotor endurance seen in modern
   humans. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding as a tool for assessing
   prehistoric plant use at the Upper Paleolithic cave site Aghitu-3,
   Armenia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Current knowledge about Paleolithic human plant use is limited by the
   rare survival of identifiable plant remains as well as the availability
   of methods for plant detection and identification. By analyzing DNA
   preserved in cave sediments, we can identify organisms in the absence of
   any visible remains, opening up new ways to study details of past human
   behavior, including plant use. Aghitu-3 Cave contains a 15,000-yearlong
   record (from similar to 39,000 to 24,000 cal BP) of Upper Paleolithic
   human settlement and environmental variability in the Armenian
   Highlands. Finds from this cave include stone artifacts, faunal remains,
   bone tools, shell beads, charcoal, and pollen, among others. We applied
   sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding to the Aghitu-3
   sedimentary sequence and combined this with pollen data to obtain a
   temporal reconstruction of plant assemblages. Our results reveal a
   stratification of plant abundance and diversity where sedaDNA reflects
   periods of human occupation, showing higher diversity in layers with
   increased human activity. Low pollen concentrations combined with high
   sedaDNA abundance indicate plant remains may have been brought into the
   cave by animals or humans during the deposition of the lower two
   archaeological horizons. Most of the recovered plants are reported to be
   useful for food, flavor, medicine, and/or technical purposes,
   demonstrating the potential of the environment around Aghitu-3 Cave to
   support humans during the Upper Paleolithic. Moreover, we identified
   several specific plant taxa that strengthen previous findings about
   Upper Paleolithic plant use in this region (i.e., for medicine and the
   manufacturing and dyeing of textiles). This study represents the first
   application of plant sedaDNA analysis of cave sediments for the
   investigation of potential plant use by prehistoric humans. (C) 2022 The

Title = {The influence of climate and population structure on East Asian skeletal
   morphology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that global variation in body proportions is
   more complex than previously thought as some traits formerly associated
   with climate adaptation are better explained by geographic proximity and
   neutral evolutionary forces. While the recent incorporation of
   quantitative genetic methodologies has improved understanding of
   patterns related to climate in Africa, Europe, and the Americas, Asia
   remains underrepresented in recent and historic studies of body form. As
   ecogeographic studies tend to focus on male morphology, potential sex
   differences in features influenced by climate remain largely unexplored.
   Skeletal measurements encompassing the dimensions of the skull, pelvis,
   limbs, hands, and feet were collected from male (n = 459) and female (n
   = 442) remains curated in 13 collections across seven countries in East
   Asia (n = 901). Osteological data were analyzed with sex and minimum
   temperature as covariates adjusted by autosomal single-nucleotide
   polymorphism population genetic distance using univariate Bayesian
   linear mixed models, and credible intervals were calculated for each
   trait. Analysis supports a relationship between specific traits and
   climate as well as providing the magnitude of response in both sexes.
   After accounting for genetic distance between populations, greater
   association between climate and morphology was found in postcranial
   traits, with the relationship between climate and the skull limited
   primarily to breadth measurements. Larger body size is associated with
   colder climates with most measurements increasing with decreased
   temperature. The same traits were not always associated with climate for
   males and females nor correlated with the same intensity for both sexes.
   The varied directional association with climate for different regions of
   the skeleton and between the sexes underscores the necessity of future
   ecogeographic research to holistically evaluate body form and to look
   for sex-specific patterns to better understand population responses to
   environmental stresses. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Morphological integration in the hominid midfoot},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The calculation of morphological integration across living apes and
   humans may provide important insights into the potential influence of
   integration on evolutionary trajectories in the hominid lineage. Here,
   we quantify magnitudes of morphological integration among and within
   elements of the midfoot in great apes and humans to examine the link
   between locomotor differences and trait covariance. We test the
   hypothesis that the medial elements of the great ape foot are less
   morphologically integrated with one another compared to humans based on
   their abducted halluces, and aim to determine how adaptations for
   midfoot mobility/stiffness and locomotor specialization influence
   magnitudes of morphological integration. The study sample is composed of
   all cuneiforms, the navicular, the cuboid, and metatarsals 1-5 of Homo
   sapiens (n = 80), Pan troglodytes (n = 63), Gorilla gorilla (n = 39),
   and Pongo sp. (n = 41). Morphological integration was quantified using
   the integration coefficient of variation of interlandmark distances
   organized into sets of a priori-defined modules. Magnitudes of
   integration across these modules were then compared against sets of
   random traits from the whole midfoot. Results show that all nonhuman
   apes have less integrated medial elements, whereas humans have highly
   integrated medial elements, suggesting a link between hallucal abduction
   and reduced levels of morphological integration. However, we find
   considerable variation in magnitudes of morphological integration across
   metatarsals 2-5, the intermediate and lateral cuneiform, the cuboid, and
   navicular, emphasizing the influence of functional and nonfunctional
   factors in magnitudes of integration. Lastly, we find that humans and
   orangutans show the lowest overall magnitudes of integration in the
   midfoot, which may be related to their highly specialized functions, and
   suggest a link between strong diversifying selection and reduced
   magnitudes of morphological integration. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Development of a process-based eco-hydrology model for evaluating the
   spatio-temporal dynamics of macro- and micro-plastics for the whole of
   Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {476},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plastic contamination has been receiving considerable attention during
   the last few decades. Although some models could simulate transport and
   fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems, complete model for the
   whole picture of plastic dynamics on basin scale has yet to be
   established. In the present study, the authors extended process-based
   eco-hydrology models, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based
   Eco-hydrology) and NICE-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycle), to link them with
   plastic debris model, and applied to all of the 109 first-class (class
   A) river basins throughout Japan. New model included advection,
   dispersion, diffusion, settling, dissolution and deterioration due to
   light and temperature. These processes could help to evaluate effect of
   mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) and point sources (tyres, personal care
   products, dust, and laundry) on spatio-temporal dynamics of macro-and
   micro-plastics there. The model showed simulated hydrologic cycle was
   generally in good agreement with observed one. In contrast, simulated
   value of annual-averaged nutrient transports was over-estimated in
   comparison with observed value averaged over non-flood periods.
   Sensitivity analysis of micro -plastic transport to various factors also
   implied effects of degradation would not be negligible under some
   conditions. Generally, large amounts of plastic flowed out of some
   limited rivers (Tone, Kiso, Yodo, and Ara Rivers) with a large
   proportion of macro-plastic flux in comparison with micro-plastic flux.
   Further, scenario analysis quantified the total plastic flux varied
   according to efficiency of micro-plastic removal in wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTP) and density of plastic, and was estimated as within the
   range 1,100 - 3,500 ton/yr, relatively similar to that of existing
   values. It was also clarified only a limited proportion of plastics
   discharged onto land flow out into the ocean intensively during rainfall
   seasons. These results help to quantify impacts of plastic waste on
   biosphere, and may aid development of solutions and measures to reduce
   plastic input to the ocean.},

Title = {Revisiting wild boar spatial models based on hunting yields to assess
   their predictive performance on interpolation and extrapolation areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {471},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While reliable estimates of species abundance distribution are required
   for wildlife management and are greatly needed at broad spatial scales,
   such information is scarce. In this context, the usefulness of spatial
   modelling as a tool for predicting game species relative abundance and
   distribution from hunting yield data was studied. Hunting yield data is
   affected by several factors related to species management, hunting
   regulations, and hunting efficacy and some doubts have been raised about
   the use or reliability of this data for large-scale modelling. Some
   years ago, Acevedo et al. (2014) calibrated five spatially explicit
   models (one per bioregion) by using hunting yield data for wild boar Sus
   scrofa (from hunting seasons 2006 to 2009) for approximately 60\% of
   mainland Spain. After internal validation, the models were extrapolated
   to produce predictions of species relative abundance for the whole
   mainland country. Here, we reviewed these previous models to evaluate
   their predictive performance on new data (from hunting seasons 2014 to
   2018) in areas where the models had been calibrated (interpolation
   areas) and also when projected into new ones (extrapolation areas). Our
   results showed that the previous models were able to forecast current
   general patterns of wild boar relative abundance with population growth
   rates equivalent to those reported by other authors, although
   differences between bioregions were observed. Performance on
   interpolation areas was higher than that obtained on extrapolation
   areas. Accuracy of model predictions decreased when fine resolution
   assessment at hunting ground level was carried out. Our results suggest
   that spatial models calibrated on hunting yields could be a good option
   to predict general wild boar relative abundance distribution patterns,
   although critical assessment is needed, since models can fail when they
   are extrapolated to areas for which no information is available and at
   fine scale resolution. These results represent a step forward in the use
   of hunting yields for describing ranges of species relative abundance at
   large spatial scales.},

Title = {The effect of landscape, transmission mode and social behavior on

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},

Abstract = {We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM),
   DeerLandscapeDisease (DLD), to investigate the effects of landscape
   structure, disease transmission, and management alternatives on dynamics
   of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus). We fitted biased random walk models to data from
   GPS-collared deer to simulate movements of individual deer and deer
   groups in an agricultural landscape with fragmented forest patches and a
   forest-dominated landscape. We estimated behavioral and demographic
   parameters from field data and published literature of deer ecology. We
   considered both direct and indirect transmission routes and assumed that
   bioavailability of infectious pathogens deposited in the environment
   decreased exponentially over time. We tuned transmission parameters to
   match observed trajectories of CWD prevalence in Wisconsin, and assumed
   that infection probability during an encounter was equal for all age
   classes. Thus, infection prevalence varied with sex-and age-specific
   behavior.DLD simulations demonstrated significant effects of landscape
   structure, social behavior and transmission mode on temporal changes in
   prevalence. Prevalence rose faster and reached higher levels in
   fragmented forest landscapes due to aggregation of deer within small
   forest patches. Furthermore, simulation results suggested that CWD might
   be driven through a mix of frequency-and density-dependent processes,
   potentially facilitating coexistence of CWD and deer populations. These
   results demonstrate the utility of ABMs and the importance of including
   spatial and behavioral heterogeneity when modeling disease transmission.},

Title = {A mathematical model for the impact of noise on population dynamics of a
   single species experiencing Lombard effect},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {470},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Noise is a form of pollution resulting from the undeniable increase in
   industrialization worldwide. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly
   important to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential effects
   of noise on ecosystems. In this study, we propose a deterministic
   mathematical model that uses a system of nonlinear, non-autonomous
   differential equations to describe the population dynamics of a single
   species exposed to noise. The Lombard effect is a phenomenon that
   involves increasing the intensity of acoustic signals in response to
   noise, which can mask and degrade acoustic signals and prevent them from
   being recognized or discriminated by their target receivers. However,
   when the anthropogenic noise is chronic and critical (i.e., that by its
   long duration and high intensity positively affects the mortality rate),
   the increase in the intensity of acoustic signals (due to the Lombard
   effect) only increases the chronic critical anthropogenic noise and also
   increase energetic, behavioral and predation costs. Therefore, the
   critical noise generated by the use of higher intensity acoustic signals
   (due to the Lombard effect) together with the chronic critical
   anthropogenic noise, negatively affect population survival. We analyzed
   the persistence of the population and found that our results are
   consistent with the observed ecological data as they suggest that, the
   maximum intensity level of critical chronic anthropogenic noise,
   consequently, by the Lombard effect, the maximum intensity of self
   generated acoustic signals, must decrease to ensure population
   persistence. However, when the maximum intensity level of critical
   chronic anthropogenic noise is uncontrollable, it is sufficient to
   reduce its mean intensity level to ensure persistence in the population
   mean. Furthermore, decreasing the degree to which noise affects the
   population favors the survival of the species. Finally, to validate our
   results, we performed numerical simulations.},

Title = {Post-LGM environments and foragers on the move: New data from the lower
   Altmuhl Valley (Franconian Jura, SE Germany)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {After the Last Glacial Maximum, the Swabian and Franconian Jura (in SW
   and SE Germany, respectively) were repopulated by Magdalenian
   hunter-gatherers within the same communication network. However, while
   the Magdalenian settlement of the Swabian Jura dates to 17-14 ka cal BP,
   permanent Magdalenian occupations in the Franconian Jura date to 15-14
   ka cal BP. In comparison with its western counterpart, the Franconian
   Jura was mostly excavated in the early days of archaeological research.
   Does this different chronology reflect the different history of
   research? Why did Magdalenian foragers establish permanent occupation in
   the Franconian Jura nearly 2 millennia after settling in Swabia, despite
   the fact these regions are only 150 km apart? To address these
   questions, we reinvestigated two sites in the Altmithl Valley with
   micromorphology and luminescence dating, namely Felsenhausl-Kellerhohle
   and Klausennische. Our data show that both sites have intact Pleistocene
   deposits. Among these, we identified sediments dating between 17 and 15
   ka that show only rare lithic artifacts and microfeatures indicative of
   cold and arid conditions. Our work and published data suggest that the
   steady settlement of Magdalenian foragers in the Altmithl Valley
   starting 15 ka cal BP coincides with the end of this harsh period and
   the onset of cool and wetter environments. Data from the Swabian Jura
   demonstrated that in the Lone Valley, similar environments and
   Magdalenian occupations commenced earlier, starting 17 ka cal BR.
   Therefore, we propose that regional environments acted as a barrier
   against the dispersal of foragers in the Franconian Jura and determined
   its later Magdalenian occupation. Our research highlighted that
   different environments, taphonomic processes, and site uses probably
   coexisted across the German Jura. Therefore, it remains fundamental to
   expand the multisite data set proposed in this article to further test
   hypotheses about human/environment interaction in this region. (C) 2022

Title = {Early Pleistocene stratigraphy, sedimentary environments, and formation
   contexts at Dmanisi in the Georgian Caucasus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Early Pleistocene site of Dmanisi is now well known for its large
   number of fossils of early Homo erectus as well as associated artifacts
   and faunal remains, recovered mainly in pipe-related geologic features.
   Testing in the M5 unit 100 m to the west of the main excavations
   revealed a thick stratigraphy with no evidence of pipes or gullies,
   indicating that the geologic record at Dmanisi included spatially
   distinct sedimentary environments that needed further investigation.
   Here we report the results of a geoarchaeological program to collect
   data bearing on contexts and formation processes over a large area of
   the promontory. That work has defined over 40,000 m(2) of in situ
   deposits with artifacts and faunas. Stratum A ashes bury the uppermost
   Mashavera Basalt, which we have dated to 1.8 Ma in the M5 block. The
   Stratum A deposits contain stratified occupations that accumulated
   quickly and offer good potential for recovery of in situ materials.
   Stratum B1 deposits above the A/B unconformity include all of the pipe
   and gully facies at Dmanisi, reflecting a brief but very intense phase
   of geomorphic change. Those deposits contain the majority of faunas and
   all of the hominin fossils. B1 slope facies offer excellent formation
   contexts away from the piped area, and all B1 deposits are sealed by
   Stratum B2 over the whole promontory. Strata B2 to B5 register a return
   to slope facies, with no further evidence of pipes or gullies. Those
   deposits also present excellent contexts for recovery of in situ
   occupations. Overall, Dmanisi's geologic history preserves an
   exceptional record of the activities and environmental context of
   occupations during the first colonization of Eurasia. (C) 2022 Elsevier

Title = {Comparing the Boxgrove and Atapuerca (Sima de los Huesos) human fossils:
   Do they represent distinct paleodemes?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The early Middle Pleistocene human material from Boxgrove (West Sussex,
   UK) consists of a partial left tibia and two lower incisors from a
   separate adult individual. These remains derive from deposits assigned
   to the MIS 13 interglacial at about 480 ka and have been referred to as
   Homo cf. heidelbergensis. The much larger skeletal sample from the Sima
   de los Huesos (Atapuerca, Spain) is dated to the succeeding MIS 12, at
   about 430 ka. This fossil material has previously been assigned to Homo
   heidelbergensis but is now placed within the Neanderthal Glade. Because
   of the scarcity of human remains from the Middle Pleistocene and their
   morphological variability, this study assessed whether the Boxgrove
   specimens fit within the morphological variability of the homogeneous
   Sima de los Huesos population. Based on morphometric analyses performed
   against 22 lower incisors from Sima de los Huesos and published
   material, the data from the Boxgrove incisors place them comfortably
   within the range of Sima de los Huesos. Both assemblages present robust
   incisors distinct from the overall small recent Homo sapiens incisors,
   and Boxgrove also aligns closely with Homo neanderthalensis and some
   other European Middle Pleistocene hominins. Following morphological and
   cross-sectional analyses of the Boxgrove tibia compared to seven adult
   Sima de los Huesos specimens and a set of comparative tibiae, Boxgrove
   is shown to be similar to Sima de los Huesos and Neanderthals in having
   thick cortices and bone walls, but in contrast resembles modern humans
   in having a straight anterior tibial crest and a suggestion of a lateral
   concavity. Based on the patterns observed, there is no justification for
   assigning the Boxgrove and Sima de los Huesos incisors to distinct
   paleodemes, but the tibial data show greater contrasts and suggest that
   all three of these samples are unlikely to represent the same paleodeme.

Title = {Thermal reaction norm for sexualization: The missing link between
   temperature and sex ratio for temperature-dependent sex determination},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {473},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) can
   experience biased sex ratios in natural conditions, which raises
   questions the vulnerability of populations in the face of climate
   change. Studies addressing the adaptive significance TSD have been
   hampered by the difficulty of accurately estimating sex ratios under
   natural incubation conditions. Here we introduce the thermal reaction
   norm for sexualization, a novel concept measuring the strength of
   masculinization or feminization of temperatures, to model the effect of
   temperature for sex determination in TSD species. We use hatchling sex
   ratio data and field incubation temperatures collected between 2002 and
   2018 at a globally important loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting
   rookery. The new parametrization makes possible the understanding of how
   temperature-sensitive sex determination works. We show that the
   temperature could influence the sexualization of the gonad earlier than
   what is currently recognized. Additionally, we explore the results of
   several easy to implement proxies that have been used in literature. Our
   approach greatly outperforms previous ones in sex ratio prediction. Our
   results should help further studies to refine population-wide primary
   sex ratio estimates of reptiles with TSD to adapt current conservation
   strategies and develop them in the future.},

Title = {The taxonomic attribution of African hominin postcrania from the Miocene
   through the Pleistocene: Associations and assumptions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Postcranial bones may provide valuable information about fossil taxa
   relating to their locomotor habits, manipulative abilities and body
   sizes. Distinctive features of the postcranial skeleton are sometimes
   noted in species diagnoses. Although numerous isolated postcranial
   fossils have become accepted by many workers as belonging to a
   particular species, it is worthwhile revisiting the evidence for each
   attribution before including them in comparative samples in relation to
   the descriptions of new fossils, functional analyses in relation to
   particular taxa, or in evolutionary contexts. Although some workers
   eschew the taxonomic attribution of postcranial fossils as being less
   important (or interesting) than interpreting their functional
   morphology, it is impossible to consider the evolution of functional
   anatomy in a taxonomic and phylogenetic vacuum. There are 21 widely
   recognized hominin taxa that have been described from sites in Africa
   dated from the Late Miocene to the Middle Pleistocene; postcranial
   elements have been attributed to 17 of these. The bones that have been
   thus assigned range from many parts of a skeleton to isolated elements.
   However, the extent to which postcranial material can be reliably
   attributed to a specific taxon varies considerably from site to site and
   species to species, and is often the subject of considerable debate.
   Here, we review the postcranial remains attributed to African hominin
   taxa from the Late Miocene to the Middle and Late Pleistocene and place
   these assignations into categories of reliability. The catalog of
   attributions presented here may serve as a guide for making taxonomic
   decisions in the future. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evolutionary rates and shape variation along the anuran vertebral column
   with attention to phylogeny, body size, and ecology},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2724-2738},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The vertebral column is critical to a vertebrate species' flexibility
   and skeletal support, making vertebrae a clear target for selection.
   Anurans (frogs and toads) have a unique, truncated vertebral column that
   appears constrained to provide axial rigidity for efficient jumping.
   However, no study has examined how presacral vertebrae shape varies
   among anuran species at the macroevolutionary scale nor how intrinsic
   (developmental and phylogenetic) and extrinsic (ecological) factors may
   have influenced vertebrae shape evolution. We used microCT scans and
   phylogenetic comparative methods to examine the vertebrae of hundreds of
   anuran species that vary in body size as well as adult and larval
   ecology. We found variation in shape and evolutionary rates among anuran
   vertebrae, dispelling any notion that trunk vertebrae evolve uniformly.
   We discovered the highest evolutionary rates in the cervical vertebrae
   and in the more caudal trunk vertebrae. We found little evidence for
   selection pressures related to adult or larval ecology affecting
   vertebrae evolution, but we did find body size was highly associated
   with vertebrae shape and microhabitat (mainly burrowing) affected those
   allometric relationships. Our results provide an interesting comparison
   to vertebrae evolution in other clades and a jumping-off point for
   studies of anuran vertebrae evolution and development.},

Title = {Domestic spaces as crucibles of Paleolithic culture: An archaeological
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The places in which people live, sleep, prepare food, and undertake
   other activities-known variably as homes, residential sites, living
   sites, and domestic spaces-play a key role in the emergence and
   evolution of modern human culture. The dynamic influence of domestic
   spaces began early in human evolutionary history, during the
   Paleolithic/Stone Age. Drawing on examples from Africa and western
   Eurasia, this article explores aspects of the changing social and
   cultural significance of domestic spaces throughout this time using
   several lines of evidence: repeated site visitation, behavioral
   structuring of living spaces, and information gained by dissecting
   palimpsest records. With the development of pyrotechnology, living sites
   become hearth-centered domestic spaces that provided a common hub for
   activities. Through time the activities around hearths increased in
   their complexity and diversity. The parsing of palimpsest records by
   archaeologists also reveals changes in the nature, variety, and
   intensity of on-site activities through time, indicating shifts in site
   function and the spatial expression of cultural norms. Archaeological
   evidence shows that the entwined development of domestic spaces and
   human cultural activities was gradual, albeit nonlinear from the Lower
   Paleolithic through the Upper Paleolithic/later Middle Stone Age. In
   this process, domestic spaces emerged as common arenas of opportunity
   for social interaction and knowledge transmission, qualities that may
   have contributed to and enhanced the development of cumulative culture
   in Paleolithic society. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparative description and taxonomic affinity of 3.7-million-year-old
   hominin mandibles from Woranso-Mille (Ethiopia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fossil discoveries of early Australopithecus species from Woranso-Mille
   have played a significant role in improving our understanding of
   mid-Pliocene hominin evolution and diversity. Here, we describe two
   mandibles with dentitions, recovered from sediments immediately above a
   tuff radiometrically dated to 3.76 +/- 0.02 Ma, and assess their
   taxonomic affinity. The two mandibles (MSD-VP-5/16 and MSD-VP-5/50) show
   morphological similarities with both Australopithecus anamensis and
   Australopithecus afarensis. Some of the unique features that distinguish
   Au. anamensis from Au. afarensis are present in the mandibles, which
   also share a few derived features with Au. afarensis. Their retention of
   more Kanapoi Au. anamensis-like traits, compared to the fewer derived
   features they share with Au. afarensis, and the presence of Au.
   anamensis at Woranso-Mille in 3.8-million-year-old deposits, lends
   support to their assignment to Au. anamensis. However, it is equally
   arguable that the few derived dentognathic features they share with Au.
   afarensis could be taxonomically more significant, making it difficult
   to conclusively assign these specimens to either species. Regardless of
   which species they are assigned to, the mosaic nature of the
   dentognathic morphology and geological age of the two mandibles lends
   further support to the hypothesized ancestor-descendant relationship
   between Au. anamensis and Au. afarensis. However, there is now limited
   fossil evidence indicating that these two species may have overlapped in
   time. Hence, the last appearance of Au. anamensis and first appearance
   of Au. afarensis are currently unknown. Recovery of Australopithecus
   fossils from 4.1 to 3.8 Ma is critical to further address the timing of
   these events. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Morphological modularity in the anthropoid axial skeleton},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous research has found that hominoids have stronger modularity
   between limb elements than other anthropoids, suggesting that there is
   less constraint on morphological diversification (e.g., limb
   proportions) in hominoids in terms of evolutionary independence.
   However, degrees of modularity in the axial skeleton have not been
   investigated across a broad range of anthropoid taxa. Thus, it is
   unknown whether hominoids also have stronger modularity in the axial
   skeleton than other anthropoids, which has implications for the
   evolution of diverse torso morphologies in Miocene apes as well as the
   evolution of novel characteristics in the skull and vertebrae of fossil
   hominins. In this study, 12 anthropoid genera were sampled to examine
   degrees of modularity between axial skeletal elements (i.e., cranium,
   mandible, vertebrae, and sacrum). Covariance ratio coefficients were
   calculated using variance/covariance matrices of interlandmark distances
   for each axial skeletal element to evaluate degrees of modularity. The
   results showed that Alouatta, Hylobates, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo showed
   generally stronger modularity than other anthropoid taxa when
   considering all axial skeletal elements. When only considering the
   vertebral elements (i.e., vertebrae and sacrum), Alouatta, Hylobates,
   Gorilla, and Pan showed generally stronger modularity than other
   anthropoid taxa. Humans showed stronger modularity between the skull and
   vertebrae than other hominoids. Thus, the evolution of novel
   characteristics in the skull and vertebral column may have been less
   constrained in fossil hominins due to the dissociation of trait
   covariation between axial skeletal elements in hominoid ancestors, thus
   fostering more evolutionary independence between the skull and vertebral
   column. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   species},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2553-2565},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Among avian species, the differential cost entailed by either sex in
   competition for mates has been regarded as the main evolutionary
   influence on sex differences in mortality rates. However, empirical
   evidence suggests that sex-biased adult mortality is mainly related to
   differential energy investment in gamete production, with a greater
   annual mass devoted to egg production leading to higher female
   mortality. We explicitly tested the generality of this pattern in a
   comparative framework. Annual egg production can be relatively large in
   some species (up to 200\% of female body mass) and annual mortality is
   generally biased toward females. We showed that greater annual egg
   productivity resulted in higher mortality rates of females relative to
   males. Mating system was secondarily important, with species in which
   males were more involved in mating competition having more equal
   mortality rates between the sexes. However, both traits explained only a
   limited fraction of the interspecific variation in female-biased
   mortality. Other traits, such as sexual size dimorphism and parental
   care, had much weaker influences on female-biased mortality. Our results
   suggest that both annual mass devoted to gamete production by females
   and mating system contribute to the evolution of the fundamental
   life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival in avian taxa.},

Abstract = {Avila-Cervantes et al. proposed that glacial-interglacial sea level
   changes played an important role in the evolutionary and demographic
   histories of the crocodile Crocodylus acutus on the Isthmus of Panama.
   However, the study used erroneous sea level proxy data that produced
   flawed paleogeographic reconstructions. We present new paleogeographic
   reconstructions and review the timing of, and proposed mechanisms
   behind, the demographic events estimated by Avila-Cervantes et al.. With
   the data currently available, we find little evidence to support the
   hypothesis that sea level changes drove population demographic events in
   crocodiles on the Isthmus. Alternative hypotheses, including changing
   climate and habitat suitability, are equally valid and should be
   considered along with well-supported sea level models.},

Abstract = {Understanding the basis of biological diversity remains a central
   problem in evolutionary biology. Using microbial systems, adaptive
   diversification has been studied in (a) spatially heterogeneous
   environments, (b) temporally segregated resources, and (c) resource
   specialization in a homogeneous environment. However, it is not well
   understood how adaptive diversification can take place in a homogeneous
   environment containing a single resource. Starting from an isogenic
   population of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report rapid adaptive
   diversification, when propagated in an environment containing melibiose
   as the carbon source. The diversification is driven due to a public good
   enzyme alpha-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes melibiose into glucose and
   galactose. The diversification is driven by mutations at a single locus,
   in the GAL3 gene in the S. cerevisiae GAL/MEL regulon. We show that

Title = {The effect of experimental hybridization on cognition and brain anatomy:
   Limited phenotypic variation and transgression in Poeciliidae},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},

Pages = {2864-2878},

Abstract = {Hybridization can promote phenotypic variation and often produces trait
   combinations distinct from the parental species. This increase in
   available variation can lead to the manifestation of functional novelty
   when new phenotypes bear adaptive value under the environmental
   conditions in which they occur. Although the role of hybridization as a
   driver of variation and novelty in traits linked to fitness is well
   recognized, it remains largely unknown whether hybridization can fuel
   behavioral novelty by promoting phenotypic variation in brain morphology
   and/or cognitive traits. To address this question, we investigated the
   effect of hybridization on brain anatomy, learning ability, and
   cognitive flexibility in first- and second-generation hybrids of two
   closely related fish species (Poecilia reticulata and Poecilia wingei).
   Overall, we found that F1 and F2 hybrids showed intermediate brain
   morphology and cognitive traits compared to parental groups. Moreover,
   as phenotypic dispersion and transgression were low for both brain and
   cognitive traits, we suggest that hybridization is not a strong driver
   of brain anatomical and cognitive diversification in these Poeciliidae.
   To determine the generality of this conclusion, hybridization
   experiments with cognitive tests need to be repeated in other families.},

Pages = {3026-3040},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adaptations to habitats lacking light, such as the reduction or loss of
   eyes and pigmentation, have fascinated biologists for centuries, yet
   have rarely been studied in the deep sea, the earth's oldest and largest
   light-limited habitat. Here, we investigate the evolutionary loss of
   shell pigmentation, pattern, and eye structure across a family of
   deep-sea gastropods (Solariellidae). We show that within our
   phylogenetic framework, loss of these traits evolves without reversal,
   at different rates (faster for shell traits than eye structure), and
   over different depth ranges. Using a Bayesian approach, we find support
   for correlated evolution of trait loss with increasing depth within the
   dysphotic region. A transition to trait loss occurs for pattern and eye
   structure at 400-500 m and for pigmentation at 600-700 m. We also show
   that one of the sighted, shallow-water species, Ilanga navakaensis,
   which may represent the ``best-case{''} scenario for vision for the
   family, likely has poor spatial acuity and contrast sensitivity. We
   therefore propose that pigmentation and pattern are not used for
   intraspecific communication but are important for camouflage from visual
   predators, and that the low-resolution vision of solariellids is likely
   to require high light intensity for basic visual tasks, such as
   detecting predators.},

Title = {Secondary contact rather than coexistence-Erebia butterflies in the Alps},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2669-2686},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Secondary contact zones are ideal systems to study the processes that
   govern the evolution of reproductive barriers, especially at advanced
   stages of the speciation process. An increase in reproductive isolation
   resulting from selection against maladaptive hybrids is thought to
   contribute to reproductive barrier buildup in secondary contact zones.
   Although such processes have been invoked for many systems, it remains
   unclear to which extent they influence contact zone dynamics in nature.
   Here, we study a very narrow contact zone between the butterfly species
   Erebia cassioides and Erebia tyndarus in the Swiss Alps. We quantified
   phenotypic traits related to wing shape and reproduction as well as
   ecology to compare the degree of intra- and interspecific
   differentiation. Even though only very few first-generation hybrids
   occur, we find no strong indications for current reinforcing selection,
   suggesting that if reinforcement occurred in our system, it likely
   operated in the past. Additionally, we show that both species differ
   less in their ecological niche at the contact zone than elsewhere, which
   could explain why coexistence between these butterflies may currently
   not be possible.},

Number = {12},

Abstract = {Gene repertoire turnover is a characteristic of genome evolution.
   However, we lack well-replicated analyses of presence/absence patterns
   associated with different selection contexts. Here, we study similar to
   100 transcriptome assemblies across Macrostomum, a genus of
   simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworms exhibiting multiple convergent
   shifts in mating strategy and associated reproductive morphologies. Many
   species mate reciprocally, with partners donating and receiving sperm at
   the same time. Other species convergently evolved to mate by hypodermic
   injection of sperm into the partner. We find that for orthologous
   transcripts annotated as expressed in the body region containing the
   testes, sequences from hypodermically inseminating species diverge more
   rapidly from the model species, Macrostomum lignano, and have a lower
   probability of being observed in other species. For other annotation
   categories, simpler models with a constant rate of similarity decay with
   increasing genetic distance from M. lignano match the observed patterns
   well. Thus, faster rates of sequence evolution for hypodermically
   inseminating species in testis-region genes result in higher rates of
   homology detection failure, yielding a signal of rapid evolution in
   sequence presence/absence patterns. Our results highlight the utility of
   considering appropriate null models for unobserved genes, as well as
   associating patterns of gene presence/absence with replicated
   evolutionary events in a phylogenetic context.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {The occurrence of similar phenotypes in multiple independent populations
   derived from common ancestral conditions (viz. parallel evolution) is a
   testimony of evolution by natural selection. Parallel evolution implies
   that populations share a common phenotypic response to a common
   selection pressure associated with habitat similarity. Examples of
   parallel evolution at genetic and phenotypic levels are fairly common,
   but the driving selective agents often remain elusive. Similarly, the
   role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating early stages of parallel
   evolution is unclear. We investigated whether the relaxation of
   predation pressure associated with the colonization of freshwater ponds
   by nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) likely explains the
   divergence in complex behaviors between marine and pond populations, and
   whether this divergence is parallel. Using laboratory-raised individuals
   exposed to different levels of perceived predation risk, we calculated
   vectors of phenotypic divergence for four behavioral traits between
   habitats and predation risk treatments. We found a significant
   correlation between the directions of evolutionary divergence and
   phenotypic plasticity, suggesting that divergence in behavior between
   habitats is aligned with the response to relaxation of predation
   pressure. Finally, we show alignment across multiple pairs of
   populations, and that relaxation of predation pressure has likely driven
   parallel evolution of behavior in this species.},

Abstract = {How does plasticity evolve over relatively short timescales? Through a
   series of common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments, Walter et
   al. found distinct patterns of variation in the phenotype and gene
   expression for two closely related Sicilian daisy species of the genus
   Senecio across an elevational gradient. This suggests that adaptive
   divergence may produce interspecific differences in both the magnitude
   and direction of plasticity. The nonadaptive nature of the plasticity
   found in Senecio aethnensis has important implications for conservation
   efforts and evolutionary modeling.},

Title = {Meiotic drive is associated with sexual incompatibility in Neurospora},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Evolution of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities is
   thought to represent a key step in the formation of separate species.
   They are incompatible alleles that have evolved in separate populations
   and are exposed in hybrid offspring as hybrid sterility or lethality. In
   this study, we reveal a previously unconsidered mechanism promoting the
   formation of BDM incompatibilities, meiotic drive. Theoretical studies
   have evaluated the role that meiotic drive, the phenomenon whereby
   selfish elements bias their transmission to progeny at ratios above
   50:50, plays in speciation, and have mostly concluded that drive could
   not result in speciation on its own. Using the model fungus Neurospora,
   we demonstrate that the large meiotic drive haplotypes, Sk-2 and Sk-3,
   contain putative sexual incompatibilities. Our experiments revealed that
   although crosses between Neurospora intermedia and Neurospora
   metzenbergii produce viable progeny at appreciable rates, when strains
   of N. intermedia carry Sk-2 or Sk-3 the proportion of viable progeny
   drops substantially. Additionally, it appears that Sk-2 and Sk-3 have
   accumulated different incompatibility phenotypes, consistent with their
   independent evolutionary history. This research illustrates how meiotic
   drive can contribute to reproductive isolation between populations, and
   thereby speciation.},

Title = {Evolutionary consequences of pesticide exposure include
   transgenerational plasticity and potential terminal investment

Abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity, the influence of the environment
   experienced by parents on the phenotype and fitness of subsequent
   generations, is being increasingly recognized. Human-altered
   environments, such as those resulting from the increasing use of
   pesticides, may be major drivers of such cross-generational influences,
   which in turn may have profound evolutionary and ecological
   repercussions. Most of these consequences are, however, unknown. Whether
   transgenerational plasticity elicited by pesticide exposure is common,
   and the consequences of its potential carryover effects on fitness and
   population dynamics, remains to be determined. Here, we investigate
   whether exposure of parents to a common pesticide elicits intra-,
   inter-, and transgenerational responses (in F0, F1, and F2 generations)
   in life history (fecundity, longevity, and lifetime reproductive
   success), in an insect model system, the seed beetle Callosobruchus
   maculatus. We also assessed sex specificity of the effects. We found
   sex-specific and hormetic intergenerational and transgenerational
   effects on longevity and lifetime reproductive success, manifested both
   in the form of maternal and paternal effects. In addition, the
   transgenerational effects via mothers detected in this study are
   consistent with a new concept: terminal investment transgenerational
   effects. Such effects could underlie cross-generational responses to
   environmental perturbation. Our results indicate that pesticide exposure
   leads to unanticipated effects on population dynamics and have
   far-reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

Abstract = {Species interactions are a unifying theme in ecology and evolution. Both
   fields are currently moving beyond their historical focus on isolated
   pairwise relationships to understand how ecological communities affect
   focal interactions. Additional species can modify both the number of
   interactions and the fitness consequences of each interaction (i.e.,
   selection). Although only selection affects the evolution of the focal
   interaction, the two are often conflated, limiting our understanding of
   the evolution of multispecies interactions. We manipulated aboveground
   herbivory on the legume Medicago lupulina in the field and quantified
   its effect on number of symbionts and the per-symbiont impact on plant
   performance in two belowground symbioses: mutualistic rhizobia bacteria
   (Ensifer meliloti) and parasitic root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne
   hapla). We found that herbivores modified the number of rhizobia
   nodules, as well as the benefit per nodule. However, each effect was
   specific to a distinct herbivory regime: natural herbivory affected
   nodule number, whereas leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) weakened the per
   nodule benefit. We did not detect any effect of herbivory on nematode
   gall number or the cost of infection. Our data demonstrate that
   distinguishing between symbiont number from the fitness consequences of
   symbiosis is crucial to accurately infer how pairwise interactions will
   evolve in a community.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary processes take place in fluctuating environments, where
   carrying capacities and selective forces vary over time. The fate of a
   mutant type and the persistence time of polymorphic states were studied
   in some specific cases of varying environments, but a generic
   methodology is still lacking. Here, we present such a general analytic
   framework. We first identify a set of elementary building blocks, a few
   basic demographic processes like logistic or exponential growth,
   competition at equilibrium, sudden decline, and so on. For each of these
   elementary blocks, we evaluate the mean and the variance of the changes
   in the frequency of the mutant population. Finally, we show how to find
   the relevant terms of the diffusion equation for each arbitrary
   combination of these blocks. Armed with this technique one may calculate
   easily the quantities that govern the evolutionary dynamics, like the
   chance of ultimate fixation, the time to absorption, and the time to
   fixation.},

Abstract = {Cognition is an essential tool for animals to deal with environmental
   challenges. Nonetheless, the ecological forces driving the evolution of
   cognition throughout the animal kingdom remain enigmatic. Large-scale
   comparative studies on multiple species and cognitive traits have been
   advanced as the best way to facilitate our understanding of cognitive
   evolution, but such studies are rare. Here, we tested 13 species of
   lacertid lizards (Reptilia: Lacertidae) using a battery of cognitive
   tests measuring inhibitory control, problem-solving, and spatial and
   reversal learning. Next, we tested the relationship between species'
   performance and (a) resource availability (temperature and
   precipitation), habitat complexity (Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index), and habitat variability (seasonality) in their natural habitat
   and (b) their life history (size at hatching and maturity, clutch size,
   and frequency). Although species differed markedly in their cognitive
   abilities, such variation was mostly unrelated to their ecology and life
   history. Yet, species living in more variable environments exhibited
   lower behavioral flexibility, likely due to energetic constrains in such
   habitats. Our standardized protocols provide opportunities for
   collaborative research, allowing increased sample sizes and replication,
   essential for moving forward in the field of comparative cognition.
   Follow-up studies could include more detailed measures of habitat
   structure and look at other potential selective drivers such as
   predation.},

Abstract = {Hybrid zones provide valuable opportunities to understand the genomic
   mechanisms that promote speciation by providing insight into factors
   involved in intermediate stages of speciation. Here, we investigate
   introgression in a hybrid zone between two rattlesnake species (Crotalus
   viridis and Crotalus oreganus concolor) that have undergone historical
   allopatric divergence and recent range expansion and secondary contact.
   We use Bayesian genomic cline models to characterize genomic patterns of
   introgression between these lineages and identify loci potentially
   subject to selection in hybrids. We find evidence for a large number of
   genomic regions with biased ancestry that deviate from the genomic
   background in hybrids (i.e., excess ancestry loci), which tend to be
   associated with genomic regions with higher recombination rates. We also
   identify suites of excess ancestry loci that show highly correlated
   allele frequencies (including conspecific and heterospecific
   combinations) across physically unlinked genomic regions in hybrids. Our
   findings provide evidence for multiple multilocus evolutionary processes
   impacting hybrid fitness in this system.},

Title = {On the impermanence of species: The collapse of genetic
   incompatibilities in hybridizing populations},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Species pairs often become genetically incompatible during divergence,
   which is an important source of reproductive isolation. An idealized
   picture is often painted where incompatibility alleles accumulate and
   fix between diverging species. However, recent studies have shown both
   that incompatibilities can collapse with ongoing hybridization, and that
   incompatibility loci can be polymorphic within species. This paper
   suggests some general rules for the behavior of incompatibilities under
   hybridization. In particular, we argue that redundancy of genetic
   pathways can strongly affect the dynamics of intrinsic
   incompatibilities. Since fitness in genetically redundant systems is
   unaffected by introducing a few foreign alleles, higher redundancy
   decreases the stability of incompatibilities during hybridization, but
   also increases tolerance of incompatibility polymorphism within species.
   We use simulations and theories to show that this principle leads to two
   types of collapse: in redundant systems, exemplified by classical
   Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, collapse is continuous and
   approaches a quasi-neutral polymorphism between broadly sympatric
   species, often as a result of isolation-by-distance. In nonredundant
   systems, exemplified by co-evolution among genetic elements,
   incompatibilities are often stable, but can collapse abruptly with
   spatial traveling waves. As both types are common, the proposed
   principle may be useful in understanding the abundance of genetic
   incompatibilities in natural populations.},

Title = {Influence of microhabitat, fecundity, and parental care on the evolution
   of sexual size dimorphism in Caribbean Eleutherodactylus frogs},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3041-3053},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rensch's rule suggests that sexual size dimorphism (SSD) increases with
   species size when males are the larger sex, whereas it decreases when
   females are the larger sex. However, the process responsible for this
   pattern remains obscure. SSD can result from sexual selection, such as
   intrasexual competition for access to mates, or from natural selection,
   due to resource partitioning or fecundity selection. We studied SSD in
   Caribbean Eleutherodactylus frogs using phylogenetic comparative methods
   to investigate the influence of microhabitat, fecundity, and parental
   care. Our results show that in Caribbean Eleutherodactylus females tend
   to be larger and, contrary to Rensch's rule, dimorphism increases with
   species size. SSD was not related to microhabitat use. However, SSD was
   positively correlated with fecundity, mediated by a greater increase in
   female size. SSD was also influenced by parental care, suggesting that
   male care promotes larger male size and reduces the female bias in SSD.
   As suggested for other anurans, female-biased SSD in Caribbean
   Eleutherodactylus results from fecundity selection, although the
   magnitude is countered by increased male size in species with paternal
   care. Our results highlight the importance of considering various
   selective forces that may act in concert to influence the evolution of
   SSD.},

Title = {Why are animals conspicuously colored? Evolution of sexual versus

Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2879-2892},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conspicuous colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) have evolved numerous times
   across animals. But the function of this coloration can differ radically
   among species. Many species use this coloration as a sexual signal to
   conspecifics, whereas others use it as a warning signal to predators.
   Why do different species evolve conspicuous coloration in association
   with one function as opposed to the other? We address this question in
   terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) using phylogenetic approaches, and
   test whether day-night activities of species help determine these
   patterns. Using phylogenetic logistic regression, we found that
   conspicuous, sexually dimorphic coloration is significantly associated
   with diurnal lineages (e.g., many birds and lizards). By contrast, the
   evolution of warning signals was significantly associated with
   large-scale clades that were ancestrally nocturnal (e.g., snakes,
   amphibians), regardless of the current diel activity of species.
   Overall, we show that the evolution of conspicuous coloration as warning
   signals or sexual signals is influenced by the ecology of species, both
   recently and in the ancient past.},

Abstract = {The evolution and development of complex molars as a key innovation in
   mammals have long been of interest yet remain poorly understood. With
   reference to century-old theories and modern findings, we focused on the
   teeth of pinnipeds (Carnivora) and cetaceans (Cetartiodactyla), which
   are morphologically simple compared with those of other mammals, and
   thus can be considered a reversal toward the ancestral state of
   nonmammalian synapsids. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of
   tooth complexity for the phylogenies of Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla,
   we established that a secondary evolution of simple teeth from more
   complex molars has occurred independently multiple times. Our
   phylogenetic comparative analyses showed that a simplification in tooth
   morphology was correlated with a more anterior dentition position
   relative to the component bones of the upper jaw in both Carnivora and
   Cetartiodactyla. These results suggest that the anterior shift of tooth
   position relative to the morphogenetic fields present in the jaw
   contributed to the evolutionary simplification in molar morphology. Our
   findings provide insights into the developmental basis of complex
   mammalian dentition.},

Title = {Eco-evolutionary extinction and recolonization dynamics reduce genetic
   load and increase time to extinction in highly inbred populations},

Abstract = {Understanding how genetic and ecological effects can interact to shape
   genetic loads within and across local populations is key to
   understanding ongoing persistence of systems that should otherwise be
   susceptible to extinction through mutational meltdown. Classic theory
   predicts short persistence times for metapopulations comprising small
   local populations with low connectivity, due to accumulation of
   deleterious mutations. Yet, some such systems have persisted over
   evolutionary time, implying the existence of mechanisms that allow
   metapopulations to avoid mutational meltdown. We first hypothesize a
   mechanism by which the combination of stochasticity in the numbers and
   types of mutations arising locally (genetic stochasticity), resulting
   local extinction, and recolonization through evolving dispersal
   facilitates metapopulation persistence. We then test this mechanism
   using a spatially and genetically explicit individual-based model. We
   show that genetic stochasticity in highly structured metapopulations can
   result in local extinctions, which can favor increased dispersal, thus
   allowing recolonization of empty habitat patches. This causes
   fluctuations in metapopulation size and transient gene flow, which
   reduces genetic load and increases metapopulation persistence over
   evolutionary time. Our suggested mechanism and simulation results
   provide an explanation for the conundrum presented by the continued
   persistence of highly structured populations with inbreeding mating
   systems that occur in diverse taxa.},

Title = {The evolution of sex similarities in social signals: Climatic
   seasonality is associated with lower sexual dimorphism and greater
   elaboration of female and male signals in antbirds (Thamnophilidae)},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Selection on signals that mediate social competition varies with
   resource availability. Climate regulates resource availability, which
   may affect the strength of competition and selection on signals.
   Traditionally, this meant that more seasonal, colder, or dryer-overall
   harsher-environments should favor the elaboration of male signals under
   stronger male-male competition, increasing sexual dimorphism. However,
   females also use signals to compete; thus, harsher environments could
   strengthen competition and favor elaboration of signals in both sexes,
   decreasing sexual dimorphism. Alternatively, harsher environments could
   decrease sexual dimorphism due to scarcer resources to invest in signal
   elaboration in both sexes. We evaluated these contrasting hypotheses in
   antbirds, a family of Neotropical passerines that varies in female and
   male signals and occurs across diverse climatic regimes. We tested the
   association of sexual dimorphism of plumage coloration and songs with
   temperature, precipitation, and their seasonality. We found that greater
   seasonality is associated with lower sexual dimorphism in plumage
   coloration and greater elaboration of visual signals in both sexes, but
   not acoustic signals. Our results suggest that greater seasonality may
   be associated with convergent elaboration of female and male visual
   signals, highlighting the role of signals of both sexes in the evolution
   of sexual dimorphism.},

Title = {Novel host unmasks heritable variation in plant preference within an
   insect population},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2634-2648},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Introductions of novel plant species can disturb the historical resource
   environment of herbivorous insects, resulting in strong selection to
   either adopt or exclude the novel host. However, an adaptive response
   depends on heritable genetic variation for preference or performance
   within the targeted herbivore population, and it is unclear how
   heritability of host-use preference may differ between novel and
   historical hosts. Pieris macdunnoughii butterflies in the Rocky
   Mountains lay eggs on the nonnative mustard Thlaspi arvense, which is
   lethal to their offspring. Heritability analyses revealed considerable
   sex-linked additive genetic variation in host preference within a
   population of this butterfly. This was contrary to general predictions
   about the genetic basis of preference variation, which are hypothesized
   to be sex linked between populations but autosomal within populations.
   Evidence of sex linkage disappeared when butterflies were tested on
   methanol-based chemical extracts, suggesting these chemicals in
   isolation may not be the primary driver of female choice among available
   host plants. Although unexpected, evidence for within-population
   sex-linked genetic variation in preference for T. arvense over native
   hosts indicates that persistent maladaptive oviposition on this lethal
   plant must be maintained by alternative evolutionary dynamics such as
   migration- or drift-selection balance or pleiotropic constraints.},

Abstract = {Covarying suites of phenotypic traits, or modules, are increasingly
   recognized to promote morphological evolution. However, information on
   how modularity influences flower diversity is rare and lacking for
   Orchidaceae. Here, we combine high-resolution X-ray computed tomography
   scanning with three-dimensional geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic
   comparative methods to test various hypotheses about three-dimensional
   patterns of flower evolutionary modularity in Malagasy Bulbophyllum
   orchids and examine rates and modes of module evolution. Based on the
   four evolutionary modules identified (i.e., sepals, lateral petals,
   labellum + column-foot, and column-part), our data support the
   hypothesis that both genetic-developmental and functional adaptive
   factors shaped evolutionary flower trait covariation in these tropical
   orchids. In line with ``evo-devo{''} studies, we also find that the
   labellum evolved independently from the rest of the petal whorl.
   Finally, we show that modules evolved with different rates, and either
   in a neutral fashion (only column-part) or under selective constraints,
   as likely imposed by pollinators. Overall, this study supports current
   views that modular units can enhance the range and rate of morphological
   evolution.},

Title = {Co-evolution of dormancy and dispersal in spatially autocorrelated

Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2769-2777},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The evolution of dispersal can be driven by spatial processes, such as
   landscape structure, and temporal processes, such as disturbance.
   Dormancy, or dispersal in time, is generally thought to evolve in
   response to temporal processes. In spite of broad empirical and
   theoretical evidence of trade-offs between dispersal and dormancy, we
   lack evidence that spatial structure can drive the evolution of
   dormancy. Here, we develop a simulation-based model of the joint
   evolution of dispersal and dormancy in spatially heterogeneous
   landscapes. We show that dormancy and dispersal are each favored under
   different landscape conditions, but not simultaneously under any of the
   conditions we tested. We further show that, when dispersal distances are
   short, dormancy can evolve directly in response to landscape structure.
   In this case, selection is primarily driven by benefits associated with
   avoiding kin competition. Our results are similar in both highly
   simplified and realistically complex landscapes.},

Title = {Maternal effects do not resolve the paradox of stasis in birth weight in

Journal = {EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {In natural populations, quantitative traits seldom show short-term
   evolution at the rate predicted by evolutionary models. Resolving this
   ``paradox of stasis{''} is a key goal in evolutionary biology, as it
   directly challenges our capacity to predict evolutionary change. One
   particularly promising hypothesis to explain the lack of evolutionary
   responses in a key offspring trait, body weight, is that positive
   selection on juveniles is counterbalanced by selection against maternal
   investment in offspring growth, given that reproduction is costly for
   the mothers. Here, we used data from one of the longest individual-based
   studies of a wild mammal population to test this hypothesis. We first
   showed that despite positive directional selection on birth weight, and
   heritable variation for this trait, no genetic change has been observed
   for birth weight over the past 47 years in the study population.
   Contrarily to our expectation, we found no evidence of selection against
   maternal investment in birth weight-if anything, selection favors
   mothers that produce large calves. Accordingly, we show that genetic
   change in birth weight over the study period is actually lower than that
   predicted from models including selection on maternal performance;
   ultimately our analysis here only deepens rather than resolves the
   paradox of stasis.},

Abstract = {Multiple ant lineages have evolved a bizarre system called social
   hybridogenesis, involving multiple co-occurring genetic lineages, in
   which mating between lineages produces workers but mating within a
   lineage produces daughter queens. A new study reveals that this system
   evolved multiple times within harvester ants, each time from
   interspecific hybridization. A third finding, that the system likely
   evolves in small or isolated populations, could be explained either by
   exploitation of heterospecific males for their sperm, or simply by
   failure to avoid interspecific mating.},

Abstract = {Adulthood-only downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), an
   evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating resource allocation between
   somatic maintenance and reproduction, increases life span without
   fecundity cost in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. However,
   long-term multigenerational effects of reduced IIS remain unexplored and
   are proposed to carry costs for offspring quality. To test this
   hypothesis, we ran a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment and
   downregulated IIS in half of the 400 MA lines by silencing daf-2 gene
   expression using RNA interference (RNAi) across 40 generations. Contrary
   to the prediction, adulthood-only daf-2 RNAi reduced extinction of MA
   lines both under UV-induced and spontaneous MA. Fitness of the surviving
   UV-induced MA lines was higher under daf-2 RNAi. Reduced IIS increased
   intergenerational F1 offspring fitness under UV stress but had no
   quantifiable transgenerational effects. Functional hrde-1 was required
   for the benefits of multigenerational daf-2 RNAi. Overall, we found net
   benefit to fitness from multigenerational reduction of IIS and the
   benefits became more apparent under stress. Because reduced daf-2
   expression during development carries fitness costs, we suggest that our
   findings are best explained by the developmental theory of ageing, which
   maintains that the decline in the force of selection with age results in
   poorly regulated gene expression in adulthood.},

Abstract = {Most plants and many animals are hermaphroditic; whether the same forces
   are responsible for hermaphroditism in both groups is unclear. The
   well-established drivers of hermaphroditism in plants (e.g., seed
   dispersal potential, pollination mode) have analogues in animals (e.g.,
   larval dispersal potential, fertilization mode), allowing us to test the
   generality of the proposed drivers of hermaphroditism across both
   groups. Here, we test these theories for 1153 species of marine
   invertebrates, from three phyla. Species with either internal
   fertilization, restricted offspring dispersal, or small body sizes are
   more likely to be hermaphroditic than species that are external
   fertilizers, planktonic developers, or larger. Plants and animals show
   different biogeographical patterns, however: animals are less likely to
   be hermaphroditic at higher latitudes-the opposite to the trend in
   plants. Overall, our results suggest that similar forces, namely,
   competition among offspring or gametes, shape the evolution of
   hermaphroditism across plants and three invertebrate phyla.},

Abstract = {Hybridization outcomes vary geographically and can depend on the
   environment. Hybridization can also reshape biotic interactions, leading
   to ecological shifts. If hybrids function differently ecologically in
   ways that enhance or reduce fitness, and those ecological roles vary
   geographically, ecological factors might explain variation in
   hybridization outcomes. However, relatively few studies have focused on
   ecological traits of hybrids. We compared the feeding ecology of
   Catostomus fish species and hybrids by using stable isotopes (delta C-13
   and delta N-15) as a proxy for diet and habitat use, and compared two
   native species, an introduced species, and three interspecific hybrid
   crosses. We included hybrids and parental species from seven rivers
   where hybridization outcomes vary. Relative isotopic niches of native
   species varied geographically, but native species did not fully overlap
   in isotopic space in any river sampled, suggesting little overlap of
   resource use between historically sympatric species. The introduced
   species overlapped with one or both native species in every river,
   suggesting similar resource use and potential competition. Hybrids
   occupied intermediate, matching, or more transgressive isotopic niches,
   and varied within and among rivers. Ecological outcomes of hybridization
   varied across locations, implying that hybridization might have
   unpredictable, idiosyncratic ecological effects.},

Abstract = {Many organisms change their phenotype in response to the environment, a
   phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity. Although plasticity can
   dramatically change the phenotype of an organism, we hardly understand
   how this can affect biotic interactions and the resulting phenotypic
   selection. Here, we use fast cycling Brassica rapa plants in an
   experiment in the greenhouse to study the link between plasticity and
   selection. We detected strong plasticity in morphology, nectar, and
   floral scent in response to different soil types and aphid herbivory. We
   found positive selection on nectar and morphological traits in hand- and
   bumblebee-pollinated plants. Bumblebee-mediated selection on a principal
   component representing plant height, flower number, and flowering time
   (mPC3) differed depending on soil type and herbivory. For plants growing
   in richer soil, selection was stronger in the absence of herbivores,
   whereas for plants growing in poorer soil selection was stronger with
   herbivory. We showed that bumblebees visited tall plants with many
   flowers overproportionally in plants in poor soil with herbivory (i.e.,
   when tall plants were rare), thus causing stronger positive selection on
   this trait combination. We suggest that with strong plasticity under
   most stressful conditions, pollinator-mediated selection may promote
   adaptation to local environmental factors given sufficient heritability
   of the traits under selection.},

Title = {The diverse effects of phenotypic dominance on hybrid fitness},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2846-2863},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {When divergent populations interbreed, their alleles are brought
   together in hybrids. In the initial F1 cross, most divergent loci are
   heterozygous. Therefore, F1 fitness can be influenced by dominance
   effects that could not have been selected to function well together. We
   present a systematic study of these F1 dominance effects by introducing
   variable phenotypic dominance into Fisher's geometric model. We show
   that dominance often reduces hybrid fitness, which can generate optimal
   outbreeding followed by a steady decline in F1 fitness, as is often
   observed. We also show that ``lucky{''} beneficial effects sometimes
   arise by chance, which might be important when hybrids can access novel
   environments. We then show that dominance can lead to violations of
   Haldane's Rule (reduced fitness of the heterogametic F1) but strengthens
   Darwin's Corollary (F1 fitness differences between cross directions).
   Taken together, results show that the effects of dominance on hybrid
   fitness can be surprisingly difficult to isolate, because they often
   resemble the effects of uniparental inheritance or expression.
   Nevertheless, we identify a pattern of environment-dependent heterosis
   that only dominance can explain, and for which there is some suggestive
   evidence. Our results also show how existing data set upper bounds on
   the size of dominance effects. These bounds could explain why additive
   models often provide good predictions for later-generation recombinant
   hybrids, even when dominance qualitatively changes outcomes for the F1.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic convergence across distantly related taxa can be driven by
   similar selective pressures from the environment or intrinsic
   constraints. The roles of these processes on physiological strategies,
   such as homeothermy, are poorly understood. We studied the evolution of
   thermal properties of mammalian pelage in a diverse community of rodents
   inhabiting the Mojave Desert, USA. We used a heat flux device to measure
   the thermal insulation of museum specimens and determined whether
   thermal properties were associated with habitat preferences while
   assessing phylogenetic dependence. Species that prefer arid habitats
   exhibited lower conductivity and thinner pelage relative to species with
   other habitat preferences. Despite being thinner, the pelage of arid
   species exhibited comparable insulation to the pelage of the other
   species due to its lower conductivity. Thus, arid species have
   insulative pelage while simultaneously benefitting from thin pelage that
   promotes convective cooling. We found no evidence of intrinsic
   constraints or phylogenetic dependence, indicating pelage readily
   evolves to environmental pressures. Thermoregulatory simulations
   demonstrated that arid specialists reduced energetic costs required for
   homeothermy by 14.5\% by evolving lower conductivity, providing support
   for adaptive evolution of pelage. Our study indicates that selection for
   lower energetic requirements of homeothermy has shaped evolution of
   pelage thermal properties.},

Abstract = {Turtles have a highly modified body plan, including a rigid shell that
   constrains postcranial anatomy. Skull morphology and neck mobility may
   therefore be key to ecological specialization in turtles. However, the
   ecological signal of turtle skull morphologies has not been rigorously
   evaluated, leaving uncertainties about the roles of ecological
   adaptation and convergence. We evaluate turtle cranial ecomorphology
   using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic
   comparative methods. Skull shape correlates with allometry, neck
   retraction capability, and different aquatic feeding ecologies. We find
   that ecological variables influence skull shape only, whereas a key
   functional variable (the capacity for neck retraction) influences both
   shape and size. Ecology and functional predictions from
   three-dimensional shape are validated by high success rates for extant
   species, outperforming previous two-dimensional approaches. We use this
   to infer ecological and functional traits of extinct species. Neck
   retraction evolved among crownward stem-turtles by the Late Jurassic,
   signaling functional decoupling of the skull and neck from the shell,
   possibly linked to a major episode of ecomorphological diversification.
   We also find strong evidence for convergent ecological adaptations among
   marine groups. This includes parallel loss of neck retraction, evidence
   for active hunting, possible grazing, and suction feeding in extinct
   marine groups. Our large-scale assessment of dietary and functional
   adaptation throughout turtle evolution reveals the timing and origin of
   their distinct ecomorphologies, and highlights the potential for ecology
   and function to have distinct effects on skull form.},

Abstract = {Our ability to predict natural phenomena can be limited by incomplete
   information. This issue is exemplified by ``Laplace's demon,{''} an
   imaginary creature proposed in the 18th century, who knew everything
   about everything, and thus could predict the full nature of the universe
   forward or backward in time. Quantum mechanics, among other things, has
   cast doubt on the possibility of Laplace's demon in the full sense, but
   the idea still serves as a useful metaphor for thinking about the extent
   to which prediction is limited by incomplete information on
   deterministic processes versus random factors. Here, we use simple
   analytical models and computer simulations to illustrate how data limits
   can be captured in a Bayesian framework, and how they influence our
   ability to predict evolution. We show how uncertainty in measurements of
   natural selection, or low predictability of external environmental
   factors affecting selection, can greatly reduce predictive power, often
   swamping the influence of intrinsic randomness caused by genetic drift.
   Thus, more accurate knowledge concerning the causes and action of
   natural selection is key to improving prediction. Fortunately, our
   analyses and simulations show quantitatively that reasonable
   improvements in data quantity and quality can meaningfully increase
   predictability.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},

Abstract = {Crataegus and Berberis shrublands are natively distributed in Asia,
   Europe, North America and Africa. Despite the widespread distribution of
   these two species, the effect of pure and mixed canopy composition of
   these species on bioindicators of soil quality has received little
   attention. In the current research, the effect of pure {[}Crataegus (PC)
   and Berberis (PB)] and mixed {[}Crataegus and Berberis with almost equal
   canopy cover (50C:50B), Crataegusdominated stand (70C:30B) and
   Berberis-dominated stand (30C:70B)] canopy types on litter properties,
   soil fauna and flora communities in different depths (0-10, 10-20 and
   20-30 cm) was studied in the Mazandaran province, Iran. A total of 75
   litter and 225 soil samples were collected and analysed. The results of
   this research showed that soil micro-climate and fertility are the main
   drivers of the population, composition and diversity of soil biota under
   the studied canopy covers. Increased soil temperature commonly had
   adverse effects on the populations of soil biota in the study area.
   Accordingly, the 50C:50B canopy type with a more appropriate
   micro-climate (i.e., higher soil moisture and lower soil temperature)
   and fertile soils showed higher populations of soil organisms,
   especially in the topsoil (0-10 cm). It is expected that results can
   improve scientific approaches to better comprehend of soil functions
   mechanism in the different canopy covers and also help to optimize land
   cover structures and enhancing of ecosystem services in semi-arid
   regions.},

Title = {Grassland degradation by shrub encroachment: Mapping patterns and
   drivers of encroachment in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shrub encroachment is one of the major phenomena of grassland
   degradation throughout the world. One of the largest grassland areas is
   found in Central Asia. This area is playing an important role for
   biodiversity and food security, especially in a context of climate
   change. While sustainable land management is critical to avoid shrub
   encroachment, the dynamics of such encroachment are often unclear,
   especially in remote areas. We assessed the spatial and temporal
   dynamics of shrub encroachment in Suusamyr valley in Kyrgyzstan and
   analysed how these patterns relate to abiotic and social factors. To
   assess the extent of shrub encroachment we performed a random forest
   classification with Google Earth Engine to depict shrub encroachment
   between 2000 and 2019. By using a combination of vegetation indices and
   digital elevation derivatives in the classification model, the overall
   classification accuracy reaches above 90\%. The mapping of temporal
   changes revealed an increase in shrub encroachment of 48\% within the
   valley, adding up to an overall coverage of 2\% of the grassland area.
   The spatial patterns of shrub encroachment are more strongly associated
   with anthropogenic factors, such as locations of roads and settlements,
   than with variations in precipitation and amount of organic carbon in
   soils. Around 45\% of shrub encroachment occurs close to main roads and
   local paths, and within around 5 km distance from temporal settlements.
   This degradation is probably caused by overgrazing near settlements and
   the loss of grasslands in those areas puts additional pressure on local
   livestock farming, potentially leading to further degradation in
   neighboring areas. A shrub encroachment susceptibility map was created
   to identify areas vulnerable to further shrub expansion, affecting
   valuable grassland area. The identification of these areas at risk may
   inform sustainable grassland management by better allocating pastures
   according their capacity and reducing pressures on those places most
   susceptible to degradation.},

   sovereignty. With the present study, we aim at a first assessment of the
   potential of fog collection in the area by a 1-year experimental
   analysis made through 1-m2 fog collectors in 10 different locations.
   Starting from these data, we design under safe assumption (including
   sensitivity analysis) a fog water irrigation system providing water for
   a standard theoretical field with four local crops (maize, green beans,
   potato, and tomato) in the dry season. The present paper represents the
   first study on fog collection in Bolivia, showing that, on annual basis,
   an average of 6.01 l/m2/d can be obtained from most productive areas,
   with peaks up to 8.93 l/m2/d. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,
   the work represents one of the first consistent studies on the
   productive use of orographic fog, while a large part of the literature
   focuses on advection fog, mostly occurring on the Pacific Coast of South
   America.},

Title = {Ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange from semiarid mangroves in the Gulf of
   California},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mangrove wetlands play an essential role as blue carbon ecosystems.
   However, worldwide they also face imminent threats caused by
   anthropogenic activities and climate change. Mangroves in the semiarid
   region of the Gulf of California are highly vulnerable to both threats.
   In this study, we present eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem
   exchange of CO2 (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem
   respiration (Reco) at a preserved mangrove (Estero El Sargento) and a
   site influenced by anthropogenic activities (Bahia del Tobari) located
   in northwest Mexico. Both sites were net annual carbon sinks but had
   different dynamics. The net annual carbon gain for Estero El Sargento
   was-717 g C m- 2 y-1 while for Bahia deTobari was-247 g C m- 2 y-1. Over
   the studied year, Estero El Sargento had lower Reco(329 g C m- 2) during
   the winter-spring months and an overall lower annual Reco/GPP (0.42)
   than Bahia de Tobari. The Reco was notably high during the winter-spring
   period at Bahia de Tobari when agriculture drainage from the intensive
   food production activities at the Yaqui Valley reaches the bay. The
   contrasting NEE patterns and magnitude between both mangrove sites
   suggest that anthropogenic activities influencing coastal ecosystems
   exert an important control on the CO2 sink potential.},

Title = {Positive feedbacks between savanna tree size and the nutritional
   characteristics of ``Islands of fertility{''} are amplified by sociable
   weaver colonies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In arid environments, areas of high soil nutrient concentrations are
   common under woody plants due to ecosystem functions, including faunal
   deposition. Sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) are birds that build
   nests on camelthorn (Vachellia erioloba) and shepherd (Boscia
   albitrunca) trees and their faeces enrich the soil. Nevertheless, the
   soil under the nests is devoid of vegetation. We evaluated the
   hypotheses that the presence of trees and weaver nests alters soil
   properties, which vary with tree species and size as well as nest size,
   but that the area devoid of vegetation under nest trees is due to
   physiological drought, lack of viable seeds or nutrient toxicity. We
   sampled and analysed soil properties under trees with and without a
   sociable weaver nest and the grassland between them. Soils under trees
   were characterized by higher N (2.3-fold) and P (1.3-fold) compared to
   grassland areas. Furthermore, soils under nest-trees had higher N
   (3.5-fold), and P (4.1-fold) concentrations than soils under trees
   without nests. Some soil properties also varied with increasing tree and
   colony size. Soil water infiltration rate decreased under nest-trees
   with increased colony size, limiting seed germination, despite good seed
   banks and nutrient-rich soils. This combination of feedbacks establishes
   these trees as powerful ecosystem engineers.},

Abstract = {In temperate drylands, livestock grazing and irrigation agriculture
   alter biocrust cover and thereby soil nitrogen (N) dynamics. However,
   the influence of land use on biocrusts and soil N dynamics in tropical
   drylands is un-known. We evaluated the influence of rainfed agriculture
   and firewood extraction on biocrust functional groups and soil N
   dynamics in a tropical dryland. We collected biocrusts in abandoned
   croplands resulting from rainfed agriculture and mesquite shrublands
   resulting from firewood extraction to measure the cover of heterocystous
   cyanobacteria, non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, cyanolichens, and
   chlorolichens. We also collected soil below biocrusts to evaluate soil N
   dynamics (total and available N, N transformation rates, microbial
   biomass N), energy availability (total C), and microbial activity (C
   mineralization). We evaluated the correlation between biocrust
   functional group cover and soil N dynamics, and between microbial
   activity and soil N dynamics. In abandoned croplands, heterocystous
   cyanobacteria had high cover and were associated to altered soil N
   dy-namics. In mesquite shrublands, cyanolichens had high cover and were
   associated to unaltered soil N dynamics. In this tropical dryland, both
   activities have contrasting changes in biocrust functional group cover
   and soil N dynamics, probably due to differences in energy availability
   and soil microenvironments for microbial activity under biocrusts.},

Title = {Seasonality and interspecific temporal partitioning in a semiarid
   grassland bat assemblage of northwestern India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Arid and semiarid environments of the world are characterized by extreme
   environmental changes that affect the availability of scarce, patchily
   distributed resources such as water. In response to these changes,
   animals migrate or partition resources to minimize competition,
   resulting in temporal patterns within assemblages across multiple
   scales. Here, we demonstrate that the winter dry season bat assemblage
   in a semiarid grassland of northwestern India exhibits seasonal changes
   and temporal avoidance between coexisting species. Using a passive
   acoustic monitoring framework to quantify activity patterns at different
   points in the season, we show that members of this assemblage
   (Rhinolophus lepidus and Tadarida aegyptiaca) exhibit seasonal
   differences in activity, being more frequently detected in the early and
   late parts of the dry season, respectively. Other species (Pipistrellus
   tenths and Scotophilus heathii) do not exhibit seasonal changes in
   activity, but structure diel activity patterns, minimizing temporal
   overlap (and thus competition) at water bodies. These data, some of the
   first on bats from this region, demonstrate the complex temporal
   patterns structuring bat assemblages in arid and semiarid biomes. Our
   results hold promise both in understanding bat behavioral ecology and in
   long-term monitoring efforts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is expected to increase the richness and
   diversity of species. The aim of this study is to identify environmental
   elements that influence the richness and diversity of small, medium and
   large species of mammals. For the sampling of mammals, camera and
   Sherman traps were used at 18 sampling stations. For vegetation
   sampling, eight large-scale explanatory variables were selected in a
   1000 m(2) plot at each station. The diversity (H') of habitats
   (heterogeneity) and species were measured using the Shannon-Wiener
   diversity index. To relate the heterogeneity and environmental variables
   with species richness for small, medium and large mammals, a generalised
   linear model (GLM) was used while considering the Poisson probability
   distribution. A multiple linear regression model was used for data with
   normal distributions. The results suggested that environmental elements
   could favour rodent richness but may have a negative effect on community
   evenness and some environmental variables that are related to the
   diversity of rodent species and the species richness of medium and large
   mammals. It was concluded that the relationship between environmental
   heterogeneity and mammal richness is complex and that the response to
   the biotic elements of the landscape is diverse and different for each
   species.},

Title = {Engineering by cape ground squirrels affects biodiversity in semi-arid
   grasslands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Burrowing mammals that disproportionately affect their physical
   environment, creating habitat and providing resources for other
   organisms, are considered ecosystem engineers. Such modifications are
   particularly important in dry grassland environments, where low
   precipitation and soil nutrients limit plant growth. We tested 5
   hy-potheses about the impact of Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) on
   plants and animals in a semi-arid grassland of South Africa. At each
   burrow cluster and paired control site without burrows, we estimated
   plant cover, height, and richness using quadrats, and invertebrate and
   small mammal abundance and richness using pit-fall traps and
   mark-recapture, respectively. We determined nitrogen concentrations in
   grasses on and off burrows and measured carbon and nitrogen stable
   isotopes in plants and squirrel hair to determine squirrel diet. Burrows
   had greater plant cover and richness, particularly more shrubby
   vegetation, but plant height and nitrogen concentrations did not differ
   on and off burrows. Invertebrate and small mammal abundance and richness
   were greater on burrows. Squirrel disturbances in semi-arid grassland
   improved conditions for disturbance-dependent shrubs, which were rarely
   consumed by squirrels but are valuable forage for antelope and provide
   cover for invertebrates and small mammals. By altering habitat for
   plants reliant on disturbance, Cape ground squirrels enhance grassland
   biodiversity.},

Title = {The use of remote sensing for desertification studies: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study and assessment of desertification and/or the advance or
   retreat of arid areas as a function of natural and anthropogenic causes
   is necessary for the prediction of future risks from climate change, and
   to support policymaking, action plans, and mitigation measures that can
   be taken at local and global scales. Remote sensing enables modelling,
   monitoring, and prediction of the behaviour of several elements of
   desertification. There have been numerous approaches to study
   desertification using remote sensing over the years. This research
   explored the timeline and global distribution of studies using remote
   sensing in studying desertification. Additionally, the review evaluated
   the key methods and variables that have been used to study
   desertification from remote sensing data. The use of remote sensing for
   desertification studies can be trace back to 1991. From 2015 to 2020,
   more than 40 articles were published per year, showing that there has
   been a recent increase in the use of remote sensing techniques and its
   availability for monitoring desertification. Most regions of the world
   affected by desertifi-cation are being studied using remote sensing,
   however, there is a marked geographical variation between the number of
   studies in various regions, with Asia having disproportionately high
   number of studies compared to America or Africa. The country with most
   studies of desertification using remote sensing is China. In terms of
   satellite data, Landsat images provide the bulk of data used to study
   desertification, especially the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor.
   Classification and change detection are the most used methods to study
   desert-ification from remote sensing data. Additionally, land cover/land
   use change and vegetation and its attributes (e. g., Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI) are the most used variables to study
   desertification using remote sensing techniques. Finally, the review
   found major differences in terms of the ranges or thresholds applied to
   these variables when determining the presence or risk of
   desertification. Therefore, there is a need to develop thresholds and
   ranges of changes of key selected variables, which can be used to
   determine the presence of desertification.},

Title = {A photographic transect method for field measurement of vegetation cover
   along an ecotone gradient in a desert environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Vegetation cover is essential to the ecologic and biogeochemical
   functioning of drylands. These systems are marked by spatiotemporal
   variation in vegetation cover and biomass. Regular monitoring of
   vegetation cover in drylands is critical for their conservation and
   management. This study examines the effectiveness of photo-based grid
   point intercept field survey for quantifying vegetation characteristics
   in drylands. The field data provides ground truth data for space borne
   remote sensing to analyze changes in vegetation cover. The study
   integrates rapid field photo sampling, GPS, and GIS to maximize raw data
   collection in the field and allow for subsequent sampling in the
   laboratory setting. Paired T-tests and simple linear regression were
   employed to assess sample size. Quantification of vegetation cover using
   minimum distance (MD), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and support vector
   machine (SVM) automated classification were assessed using visual
   sampling as a reference. Fifty sampling points are sufficient for
   quantifying vegetation cover of steppe, but are less adequate for desert
   steppe. The assessment of automated classifications of photo plots
   revealed that SAM outperformed both MD and SVM. Photo-based Grid-point
   Intercept provides a cost-and time-effective technique for data
   collection to support satellite and air platform remote sensing analysis
   of vegetation dynamics.},

   western India: Insights from environmental isotopes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding the groundwater-surface water interactions and groundwater
   recharge mechanism is paramount in the arid and semi-arid region which
   covers nearly 1/3rd of the continental area globally and depends on
   groundwater to sustain the ecology and livelihood of the people. One
   such region is semi-arid western India. This study uses seasonal
   isotopic (618O and d-excess) differences to study groundwater dynamics
   in semi-arid western India, in conjunction with the isotopic composition
   of India Summer Monsoon (ISM) to understand the rainfall -groundwater
   relationship, variation in recharge characteristics and quantification
   of groundwater recharge by rain. Some of the Important results of this
   study are (1) Temporal variation in the isotopic composition of shallow
   groundwater reveals that only-47\% of the area is recharged by ISM
   rainfall; (2) Isotopic enrichment in post -monsoon season in certain
   regions (-25\%) indicates that deep static non-replenishable groundwater
   is extrac-ted for irrigation which finds its way into shallower
   aquifers; (3)-25\% (0.52 Billion Cubic Meters) of the available dynamic
   groundwater resource in South Gujarat is lost as submarine groundwater
   discharges into the Arabian Sea; (4) Groundwater in the coastal area
   near the Gulf of Kachchh is recharged by hypersaline waters from salt
   pan.},

Title = {Effects of landscape pattern evolution on plant species and functional
   trait diversity in Hunshandak Sandland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Landscape pattern is an important driver for the variation in plant
   species diversity (PSD) and functional di-versity (PFD). However, the
   role of historical and current landscape metrics is still not revealed.
   Hunshandak Sandland, one of desertification area where landscape pattern
   undergoing quickly evolution, is a desire area for revealing such
   mechanism. The remote-sensing images during 2008-2017 were processed,
   both PSD and PFD were field surveyed and analyzed, the Multiple Linear
   Stepwise Regression was employed to identify landscape pattern indexes
   contributing significantly to PSD and PFD. Structural equation model was
   used to model the multivariate relationships. The results show both PSD
   and PFD are influenced by historical landscape pattern. Shape index,
   area and edge index, and aggregation index have important effects on PSD
   in different timescales and land use types. PFD is mainly affected by
   shape index, Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI), and Clumpiness
   Index (CLUMPY). Therefore, landscape history and evolution must be
   considered in the process of landscape planning, management, and
   biodiversity conservation in arid and semi-arid lands in the world.},

Title = {Grazing behavior of Mongolian sheep under different climatic conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ongoing climatic changes are one of the most serious environmental
   problems in Mongolia. Although research on the effect of heat stress on
   livestock was carried out in a barn or laboratory, the grazing behavior
   of livestock in rangeland is not well investigated. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study was to determine the effects of climatic
   conditions on sheep grazing behavior in the Mongolian rangeland. We used
   climatic data on air temperature and precipitation and Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a vegetation factor. A bite
   counter and global positioning system were attached to the sheep to
   measure bite rate and moving distance as factors of sheep grazing
   behavior. To examine the effect of climatic conditions on the grazing
   behavior of sheep on a daily scale, we used generalized linear mixed
   models of daily bite rate, walking velocity, and bite rate/walking
   velocity with daily NDVI, temperature, precipitation, and the
   interaction of temperature and precipitation as fixed factors, and
   individual sheep as a random explanatory factor. We also conducted a
   regression analysis of each behavior with a mean temperature every 3 h
   for the within-day scale analysis. We observed a statistically
   insignificant effect of temperature on the bite rate of grazing sheep on
   a between-day scale and a positive effect on bite rate within a day
   scale, whereas temperature significantly decreased the walking velocity
   on both between-day and within-day scales. Precipitation did not affect
   mean bite rate or walking velocity values on either scale. The air
   temperature was the major climatic factor influencing the grazing
   behavior of sheep in semi-arid environments.},

Title = {Does water availability shift dietary preferences of coyotes in the west
   desert of Utah?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Water is one of the most essential resources on the planet and shapes
   entire ecosystems. Across the western United States, thousands of
   artificial water sources have been installed to assist wildlife
   populations in arid environments. It has been reported that kit foxes
   (Vulpes macrotis) can live independently of free-drinking water, but
   coyotes (Canis latrans) would have to more than triple their intake of
   prey biomass to meet energy re-quirements. However, previous researchers
   discovered no change in coyote space use, nor were survival rates of
   coyotes influenced by the removal of water sources. We predicted coyote
   diets in the treatment areas (i.e., water removed) would show an
   increase in leporids, as a source of preformed water after the water
   removal to compensate for the lack of free water. However, we found no
   evidence of a dietary shift by coyotes towards large -bodied prey (i.e.,
   leporids) after water sources were removed; occurrence of leporids in
   the coyote diet decreased after water removal in both the control and
   treatment areas. Based on this study and previous research in Utah's
   west desert, coyotes in the Great Basin ecosystem were not influenced by
   artificial water sources in a spatial, demographic, or dietary capacity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},

Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {North-African slender-horned gazelles are facing extensive poaching
   pressure. The main remaining population patch occurs in Saharan habitat
   between Tunisia and Algeria. Access to the species' distribution range
   in both countries is limited by difficult terrain and strict permitting
   requirements. We explored a mix of aerial (1365 km) and ground transects
   (351 km) to monitor the Grand Erg Oriental which covers the species'
   range in Tunisia. Only ungulate spoors but no gazelles were observed
   during the aerial survey over the southern part of the study area.
   Ground survey in the northern part revealed more conclusive results with
   evidence and observation of one couple, one group of three and another
   of four individuals. Our results confirm the presence of a
   slender-horned gazelle population in Tunisia yet support the need for
   immediate intervention to halt its decline. Ex-situ con-servation is
   essential to the species' future survival and continuous monitoring of
   the wild range is recommended.},

Title = {Contrasting seasonal abiotic stress and herbivory incidence in Cistus
   albidus L. plants growing in their natural habitat on a Mediterranean
   mountain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mediterranean climate mountain areas are characterized by stressful
   abiotic conditions for plants. Drought, high photosynthetically active
   photon flux density and extreme temperatures are the main abiotic
   factors that drive shrub biodiversity in these areas. However, little is
   known of the extent to which herbivory may additionally influence the
   physiology of these shrub communities. We studied the incidence of
   abiotic and biotic stresses in a representative Mediterranean shrub,
   Cistus albidus L., growing under natural conditions, with an emphasis on
   the seasonal occurrence of abiotic stress and herbivory, and the
   possible influence of mountain aspect and plant ageing on the stress
   response. Reductions in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII)
   occurred during early summer and coincided with a combination of
   drought, high light and high temperatures (above 35 degrees C in July).
   East-facing plants experienced greater reductions in PSII quantum yield
   during July and leaf water content during September than west-facing
   ones. However, east-facing plants also showed less herbivory-related
   damage during winter than west-facing plants, particularly from goats.
   Plant age did not influence herbivory pressure or the stress response to
   abiotic factors. It is concluded that C. albidus is a highly tolerant
   shrub to both abiotic and biotic stress factors in Mediterranean
   mountain areas. It only shows slight photoinhibition during early summer
   and mild symptoms of herbivory attack in winter.},

Title = {Disparate biomes within the Caatinga region are not part of the same
   evolutionary community: A reply to Araujo et al. (2022)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent attempts to estimate plant and bird species diversity in the
   Caatinga, the largest nucleus of the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest and
   Woodland biome in South America, we called into question a widely used
   delimitation of this region that includes areas of disparate biomes. We
   argued that the Caatinga is best delimited without rainforest and
   savanna enclaves that exist in the region, and that such enclaves should
   be treated as part of those other biomes rather than part of the
   Caatinga. In a response to our proposal, Araujo et al. (2022) advocated
   the continued adoption of that broader delimitation. Here we review
   Araujo et al.'s (2022) criticism and elaborate on this problem. We
   demonstrate that using a delimitation of the Caatinga that includes
   areas of disparate biomes precludes measures of biome-specific
   information, cross-biome comparisons, and large-scale syntheses, and we
   argue that such a delimitation is a poor framework for both studies of
   biological phenom-ena and regional conservation planning.},

Title = {Impact of substrate depth and irrigation regime on growth, flowering and
   physiological indices of Greek sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill.) grown on
   urban extensive green roof systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The broad application of extensive green roofs in the Mediterranean
   region is hindered by the stressful climatic conditions of the summer
   period, which is characterized by drought and heat extremes that
   challenge plant survival and growth. The use of native plants can
   provide a sustainable solution in overcoming these challenges. The aim
   of the present study was twofold: Firstly, to investigate the growth and
   flowering of the native Greek sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill.) when grown
   as part of an extensive green roof phytocommunity under two different
   substrate depths (either 8 cm or 15 cm) and two levels of irrigation
   (either high or low). Secondly, to determine several physiological
   indices in order to quantify the water stress tolerance response of
   Greek sage when grown under the above-mentioned green roof conditions
   with the imposition of three drought periods (20-25 July, 22-31 August,
   23 September-10 October 2014). The deeper substrate (15 cm) promoted
   growth regardless of the level of irrigation and the number of flowers
   was favored by the deeper substrate with the higher water regime
   treatment. Although the shallow substrate depth and the low irrigation
   regime reduced growth and flowering, all plants survived. The imposition
   of drought stress periods resulted in a gradual decrease of total
   soluble sugars, proline and electrolyte leakage. Chlorophyll
   fluorescence (Fv/Fm) fluctuated between the three drought periods and
   SPAD increased in the drought period that was imposed during fall.
   During the first drought period, plants subjected to the shallow depth
   (8 cm) and irrigated with the low water regime, accumulated more sugars
   and had a higher chlorophyll fluorescence. By contrast, plants growing
   in the deeper substrate depth of 15 cm provided moderate sugars, but the
   lowest chlorophyll fluorescence. In the second drought period, the only
   index that varied between treatments was proline, which was increased
   for the plants growing in the shallow substrate depth and irrigated with
   the high-water regime. The lowest proline concentration occurred in
   plants growing in the deeper substrate depth receiving low irrigation.
   SPAD increased on the third drought period for plants growing in the
   deeper substrate. It was concluded that Greek sage can be successfully
   grown in extensive green roof systems with minimal inputs of water
   resources even at substrate depths of 8 cm. Out of the tested
   physi-ological indices, none could be employed as a standalone indicator
   of the Greek sage water stress magnitude.},

Title = {Green walls as a novel wastewater treatment option for craft breweries},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The fermentation industry has experienced significant growth as craft
   breweries and small wineries and cideries are enjoying increased
   popularity. These beverage manufacturers are also facing increased
   regulatory pressure to treat wastewater (WW) prior to discharge to the
   environment and municipal sewer systems. This research as-sesses the
   performance of a green wall system in treating brewery WW by measuring
   reductions in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity, total solids
   and total nitrogen. The system includes a green wall column with a 35 L
   sump and a pump that continuously cycles wastewater at an average rate
   of 3 L/min through the green wall in a batch process. Experimental
   scenarios included a control with the pump cycling WW between the sump
   and an empty column and WW cycled through a media filled column, columns
   with media and biofilm, and the full system including media, plants and
   biofilm. After 24 h of treatment, the full system achieved 78\%, 97\%
   and 63\% reductions of BOD, turbidity and total nitrogen, respectively.
   The net hydraulic residence time within the green wall column was 40 min
   over the 24 h treatment period. Although, the WW resided in the green
   wall columns for only 2.8\% of the treatment period, the green wall
   accounted for 50\%, 84\%, and 94\% of the reduction of BOD, turbidity,
   and total nitrogen. This green wall system has the potential to provide
   adequate treatment of brewery wastewater prior to discharge to a
   municipal sewer system or an onsite treatment system.},

Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The goal of this study is to describe patterns of reproductive activity
   and associated characteristics in a lizard community from an arid
   environment in the southern Chihuahuan Desert region of Mexico. Results
   of this study showed variation in snout-vent length (SVL) in adults
   female and male among 18 species. A similar pattern occurred in body
   mass of males and females, which varied mainly among species and not
   substantially between sexes. Mean clutch/litter size and egg/embryo mass
   and volume varied among species, and egg/embryo mass and volume were
   positively correlated with female SVL. Oviparous species were larger in
   SVL than viviparous species; however, SVL in females, clutch/litter size
   and egg/embryo volume were similar between oviparous and viviparous
   species, but the oviductal mass of oviparous species was larger than in
   viviparous species. Clutch/ litter size and oviductal mass were
   correlated with female SVL in both oviparous and viviparous species.
   This relationship was similar for egg/embryo volume in oviparous
   species, but not in viviparous species. Seven species showed a prolonged
   reproductive period, and five had short reproductive periods. The
   results of this study provide evidence of high diversity in reproductive
   strategies that have evolved among organisms that live in this
   environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Playas are a valuable tool for studying the climate of the past. In
   recent years, several studies have been con-ducted on Iranian playas,
   but there is a lack for subsurface models of playas. The aim of this
   research was to model the subsurface of playa to reconstruct the past
   climate. We employed the drilling cores of wells drilled in the two
   large playas in central part of Iran and created 3D models from
   near-surface structures. We obtained 3 models: an eight-layer model and
   a 4-layer model and a 2-layer models in 3 different parts. Based on the
   models, we have proposed a scenario for the evolution of central Iran
   playas. The 3D models show that the overlaying of the layers not only
   follows the morphology of the bedrock, but also that the mud layers sit
   exactly in the wet basins. In other words, layers of mud have formed in
   wetter-than-present surfaces. The 8-layers model suggest at least four
   periods of severe climate change had occurred in central Iran. Our 3D
   models are consistent with the reality of the climate change during
   Quaternary time scale in arid environment of central Iran.},

Title = {Active management of urban fruit orchard meadows is important for insect
   diversity},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fruit orchards under different types of management represent the most
   common agroforestry practice in central Europe. Traditional fruit
   orchards with trees usually planted in meadows are at a surplus,
   providing suitable habitats for many plant and animal species. We
   examined the influence of different management and biotope types on
   three insect groups. This study was conducted in thirty orchards across
   the capital city of the Czech Republic - Prague (496 km2). We
   investigated the diversities of butterflies, hymenopterans and beetles.
   Their species richnesses mainly benefitted from orchard management and
   was partly higher at the xerothermic sites than at the mesic sites.
   Red-listed species did not show any clear patterns. Open-landscape
   specialists were influenced by management, while forest species were
   influenced by habitat type. Generally, orchard abandon-ment led to
   insect biodiversity loss. Therefore, active agricultural management
   appears to be essential for insect biodiversity conservation in
   orchards, and different management and biotope types provide suitable
   conditions for specific species. Mowing and maintaining orchards are two
   important biodiversity management actions in terms of maintaining
   large-scale and long-term species diversity.},

Title = {Blue carbon effects of mangrove restoration in subtropics where Spartina
   alterniflora invaded},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mangrove swamps and salt marshes are noted for their large carbon
   sequestration and storage capacity. In southeastern China, mangrove
   transplantation is conducted as ecological restoration where exotic
   Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina) is removed. This study aimed
   to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove trans-plantation on carbon
   sink potential. We analyzed chronological sediment accretion, soil
   carbon sequestration, and carbon storage of mangroves and Spartina on
   Maoyan and Ximen islands. Results showed that on both islands mangroves
   and invasive Spartina stored 12.7\%-31.4\% more carbon than bare
   mudflats over top meter soils, with Spartina outperforming restored
   mangroves. Both restored mangroves and invasive Spartina enhanced
   sediment accretion, but this enhancement was minimal in high sediment
   supply areas like Maoyan. Spartina invasion improved carbon
   sequestration capacity compared to bare mudflats in Maoyan, but mangrove
   restoration failed. In low sediment supply areas like Ximen, restored
   mangroves have outperformed Spartina invasion on carbon sequestration
   enhancement since >5 years of planting. Thus, carbon sink potential of
   mangrove restoration depended on sediment supply and time, with sediment
   supply being more important. We suggested that it was preferable to
   conduct mangrove restoration with Spartina eradication in low sediment
   supply areas in subtropics.},

Title = {Influence of the number of levels and system age on greywater treatment
   in a green wall},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The use of green walls for greywater treatment represents a great
   opportunity to reduce potable water consumption and achieve multiple
   benefits. This study aims to analyse the efficiency of a pilot scale
   open-air green wall and evaluate its durability over time. The green
   wall consists of two modular panels (P1 set up in 2020, and P2 in 2018),
   each including nine pots organised in three independent columns. Coconut
   coir (80\%) and perlite (20\%) were used as filter media for three
   ornamental plant species (Carex morrowi, Hedera helix, Lonicera nitida).
   Each column was individually fed in batch mode with 24 Lday(-1)
   (hydraulic loading rate - HLR 740.8 Lm(-2) day(-1)) of greywater from
   January to March 2021. 190 water samples were analysed for 13
   physical-chemical parameters. Both panels exhibited very good removal
   efficiencies for TSS (P1: 97.4 +/- 4.6\%, P2: 89.1 +/- 13.8\%), BOD5
   (P1: 98.8 +/- 2.4\%, P2: 94.5 +/- 9.2\%), COD (P1: 78.5 +/- 5.2\%, P2:
   80.1 +/- 4.2\%), TN (P1: 49.2 +/- 30.4\%, P2: 48.0 +/- 23.31\%), MBAS
   (P1: 92.7 +/- 3.8\%, P2: 75.3 +/- 8.0\%). P1 reached satisfying
   pollutants removal after two levels, while P2 showed higher variability
   and frequent clogging phenomena, needing three levels (e.g., cumulative
   BOD5 removal along the three levels in P1: 45.2 +/- 36.2\% vertical bar
   86.5 +/- 14.8\% vertical bar 98.8 +/- 2.4\%; in P2: 16.5 +/- 20.8\%
   vertical bar 51.8 +/- 32.3\% vertical bar 94.5 +/- 9.2\%). This
   highlighted that the third level of P2 was necessary to guarantee good
   performances after over 2 years of operation. This study confirmed that
   green walls have high potential in greywater treatment also in
   challenging conditions (i.e. winter climate, high HLR and operating
   times), opening to further studies devoted to extending their lifetime.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We monitored grazing behavior and habitat selection of Argentine Criollo
   (AC), South American heritage cattle breed, and Angus (AA) cows during
   summer and winter of 2016 (wetter year) and 2017 (drier year) at a site
   in La Rioja, Argentina. In each year and season, five AC and five AA
   cows were fitted with GPS collars configured to log animal position at
   10-min intervals for 40 days. Movement, activity, and vegetation use
   patterns of each breed were derived from the GPS data. In summer, AC
   cows traveled similar daily distances, explored smaller (wetter year) or
   slightly larger (drier year) areas of the pasture, tended to move along
   more sinuous path trajectories, and showed stronger selection of the
   vegetation unit with higher forage quality and lowest woody cover
   compared to AA counterparts. AC cows allocated similar (wetter year) or
   more time to graze (drier year), allocated roughly the same amount of
   time to travel, and spent similar (wetter year) or less time resting
   (drier year) than AA cows. In winter, foraging behavior differences
   between breeds were only observed in the drier year. AC cows traveled
   farther and spent less time resting than AA counterparts that year. When
   comparing summer vs. winter move-ment patterns of each breed, AC cows
   showed an apparent greater ability to adapt to changing forage
   conditions (foraging plasticity) compared to AA counterparts which
   appeared to exhibit more rigid foraging patterns. Criollo cattle could
   be a tool to increase the resilience of Arid Chaco beef systems in the
   face of climate change. The rangeland conservation implications of
   raising Criollo vs. British beef cattle require further investigation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dynamics between plants and soil control important processes such as
   community succession, nutrient cycling or resilience to environmental
   change. Until now, most research on plant-soil interactions has focused
   on unidirectional and species-specific effects of plants on soil and
   vice-versa, under controlled-conditions experiments, but little is known
   about the direct and indirect interactions between the plant community
   and the underlying soil under field conditions. We investigated these
   interactions in a semi-arid shrubland from NE Spain. We sampled plant
   biomass, nitrogen availability in soil, soil microbial biomass C, soil
   water infiltration capacity, soil bulk density and quality of plant
   tissue. These parameters were related to each other to build a
   statistical plant soil interaction model that was analyzed through
   regression and Structural Equation Modeling analyses. This statistical
   model was hypothesized to reveal important mechanisms for community
   regulation. Plant biomass was fundamentally dependent on water
   infiltration capacity and microbial biomass C was fundamentally
   dependent on nitrogen availability. Plant biomass interacted indirectly
   with microbial biomass C by directly affecting nitrogen stock and
   quality of plant tissue. Similarly, plant biomass modulated the soil
   bulk density. We demonstrated that vegetation has a preeminent role in
   the regulation of biological processes in this ecosystem through control
   on nutrient status, microbial biomass and mechanical soil conditions.
   Conclusions extracted from this study can be valuable in restoring and
   conserving similar ecosystems at risk of disappearing due to
   desertification.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Exotic pasture species are increasingly replacing native vegetation in
   subtropical areas because of their potential to increase forage yields.
   However, there is a scarce analysis of the relationship between forage
   yield and mean annual precipitation across regional gradients. We
   analyzed at a regional scale the temporal relationship between the
   aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and the precipitation for
   different sown grasses for several growing seasons across Dry Chaco,
   Argentina. We compiled biomass harvest data for seven cultivars of
   Megathyrsus maximus and Cenchrus ciliaris at eight different sites
   across a gradient of mean annual precipitation (MAP; 200 mm-1100 mm). We
   found positive relationships between ANPP and precipitation for most of
   the cultivars. The strong relationship between annual ANPP and MAP found
   implies that the high temporal variability in MAP translates into ANPP
   variability. The regional slope between annual ANPP and MAP was 11.12 kg
   DM.ha(-1). year(-1).mm(-1). The ratio between the temporal and the
   spatial models ranged from 0.26 to 1.35. Precipitation use efficiency
   ranged between 3.9 and 24.1 kg DM.ha(-1).year(-1).mm(-1). These models
   are robust enough to estimate the ANPP of specific pastures from MAP
   data. This represents a breakthrough, in grazing systems planning and
   defining conservation policies for natural resources.},

Title = {How does grazing affect soil water availability in the Patagonian
   steppe?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the Patagonian steppe, grazing may or may not reduce soil water
   availability: it may increase evaporative losses, because it reduces
   plant cover, but may decrease transpiration losses because it decreases
   plant biomass. Therefore, grazing could reduce soil water availability
   in the superficial layer, mostly affected by evaporation, but could
   increase it in the subsurface layers, mostly affected by transpiration.
   Our hypothesis is that such effects would be most evident in the bare
   soil spaces, with higher evaporative losses and lower root density than
   vegetated microsites. Therefore, we analyzed the proportion of four
   microsites (shrubs, bare soil, preferred- and unpreferred grasses), and
   their soil water availability at 0-5 and 5-15 cm depth in four sampling
   areas, each one with an ungrazed, a moderately- and an intensely-grazed
   site. Our results supported the initial hypothesis: bare soil microsites
   had the lowest surface, but the highest subsurface water availability.
   However, grazing did not cause any change in the mean soil water
   availability (net effect) because it did not affect soil water
   availability in any microsite and depth (direct effects), and only
   caused a replacement of preferred-by unpreferred grasses (indirect
   effects), two groups that induced small differences in water
   availability.},

Title = {Facilitating restoration of degraded biological soil crusts using mixed
   culture inoculation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In arid and semiarid ecosystems, the biological soil crust (biocrust)
   community is ecologically critical and it is advantageous to restore
   damaged biocrust. Coastal sage scrub (CSS) is a unique and imperiled
   valuable habitat. At present, studies of biocrust restoration in CSS
   habitat do not exist. This study examined the feasibility of isolating
   and culturing a mix of endemic CSS cyanobacteria and green algae to
   inoculate native CSS soil, thereby facilitating recovery of disturbed
   biocrust. To gauge whether inoculation increases soil function, we
   measured culture growth, chlorophyll a, extractable polysaccharides, and
   stability. Growth of biocrust organisms and in-creases in functionality
   were compared among three inoculation treatments (mixed culture, ground
   biocrust, and uninoculated control) with either autoclaved or
   non-autoclaved native soil to determine the extent that native crust
   organisms can regrow without inoculation. A novel genus and species of
   cyanobacteria was isolated and classified as Trichotorquatus maritimus.
   The mixed culture included a green alga, possibly Chlamydomonas
   cal-lunae. Mixed inoculum added to non-autoclaved native soil
   significantly improved the soil functions. After two months, the mixed
   inoculum increased chlorophyll levels, soil stability, and increased
   extractable poly-saccharides. It may be possible in the future to
   restore biocrust in CSS using mixed culture inoculation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},

Abstract = {In this research, the growth and distribution of Alhagi camelorum Medic.
   as a potential crop was monitored for producing forage in hypersaline
   and hyperarid regions. For this purpose, seven Alhagi-dominated
   rangelands were selected in its original homeland at the south of the
   Great Salt Desert. The soil salinity of selected regions is very
   variable, and ranged from 3.6 dS m-1 to 725 dS m-1 and from 0.4 dS m-1
   to 366 dS m-1 at 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm soil depths, respectively. The
   annual mean of maximum and minimum air temperature is around 30 and 6
   degrees C, respectively, and the mean annual precipitation is less than
   150 mm. The plant growth characteristics assessed by canopy cover,
   canopy height, shoot fresh weight (SFW), and dry weight (SDW) had a
   negative relationship with soil salinity and pH. The highest SFW (24.97
   t ha-1) and SDW (6.98 t ha-1) of Alhagi were obtained where soil
   salinity was 13 dS m-1 and soil pH was the lowest (7.1). Alhagi
   maintained the minimal growth and production of 20 cm canopy height and
   50\% canopy cover even in the saltiest conditions with a soil salinity
   of 395 dS m-1; hence it can serve as a potential crop for haloculture
   systems. In Aqda, the canopy cover increased with increase in the soil
   salinity up to 7-10 dS m-1 but decreased as the salinity levels
   increased further. The study revealed that A. camelorum not only has a
   very high tolerance to salinity but a moderate salinity up to 10 dS m-1
   can also stimulate the growth. However, soil pH had a greater effect on
   growth, and Alhagi does not have a high tolerance to soil alkalinity.
   Therefore, Alhagi species could not be a bio-indicator for soil
   salinity, while well-established plants with good canopy could be
   considered as a sign for low alkalinity in arid terrestrial ecosystems.},

Title = {Vegetation influences desert soil arthropods and their response to
   altered precipitation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Altered precipitation in the arid southwestern USA will influence both
   plant and soil communities, but relatively few studies explore its
   impact on soil arthropods who comprise an important component of soil
   food webs. Further, while vegetation has a well-documented influence on
   soil communities, it is unclear how the plant community might influence
   their response to altered precipitation. We altered both the size and
   frequency of monsoon season precipitation pulses in the Sonoran Desert
   and measured the resulting soil arthropod abundance, diversity, and
   composition. We manipulated the precipitation for two dominant shrubs
   representing distinctly different functional types compared to
   interplant spaces. Plant cover significantly influenced soil arthropods,
   with the deep-rooted evergreen Larrea tridentata increasing abundance
   and diversity over interplant spaces more strongly than the
   drought-deciduous Ambrosia deltoidea. Precipitation pattern altered
   arthropod diversity and evenness, particularly in interplant soils.
   While soil arthropod total abundance was resistant to altered
   precip-itation, vegetation buffered Shannon diversity from the impacts
   of altered precipitation. Thus, climate-induced changes in the plant
   community could indirectly influence soil arthropod diversity. However,
   these plant-soil interactions may not be equally important under all
   scenarios of altered precipitation.},

Title = {Mating system of a Mammillaria magnimamma (Cactaceae) population of the
   semi-arid central Mexican region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Knowledge on the reproductive biology of globose cacti in the genus
   Mammillaria is incipient, despite being one of the most diverse and
   threatened groups in Cactaceae. We studied a clonal population of
   Mammillaria magnimamma (Hawort) located in the Valle del Mezquital,
   Mexico in which sexual reproduction occurs, although neither seedlings
   nor juveniles were observed. Based on their short life cycle, globose
   life form, and melittophilous pollination syndrome, this species was
   expected to exhibit a mixed mating system and null seed recruitment. We
   examined the population structure, reproductive phenology, and the
   mating system by means of controlled-pollination experiments (autonomous
   self-pollination, manual self-pollination, manual outcross pollination
   and open pollination). We tested for differences between treatments in
   the number of seeds per fruit and estimated outcrossing rates. Most
   (88\%) of the M. magnimamma population consisted of clones (10.6 stems/
   ind) and no juvenile plants or seedlings were recorded. Seed were
   produced in all the experimental treatments. The average number of seeds
   per fruit was significantly higher (chi 2 = 29.52; d.f. = 3; P < 0.0001)
   in the outcross than the self-pollination treatments. Outcrossing rates
   estimated from fruits, te, fruits = 0.829, and seeds, te, seeds =
   0.8774, showed that M. magnimamma exhibits a mixed mating system.
   Despite the large number of seed produced, the persistence of these
   populations likely depends on clonal reproduction. The null recruitment
   and elevated anthropogenic pressure that this species undergoes across
   its distribution range threaten its populations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In north-central Namibia, pearl millet cultivation is critical for the
   subsistence of the local people. In recent years, pearl millet
   cultivation affected by Cynodon dactylon has been observed in the area.
   In this study, we examined the background and impact of C. dactylon on
   agriculture in this region. Our study showed that there would be almost
   no pearl millet harvest if C. dactylon dominated the fields. The
   distribution of C. dactylon was spatially skewed within the region, and
   the degree of weed damage varied between households. Analysis of the
   distribution of C. dactylon and the land characteristics of each
   household revealed that the indigenous land unit and the year in which
   the local people migrated were influential factors. The expansion of C.
   dactylon is an agronomic problem and is affected by several factors,
   including the human community structure, diversity of the natural
   environment, and recent social changes.},

Title = {Effect of traditional livestock grazing on abundance of small mammals
   and activity of mountain vizcacha in the high central semi-arid Andes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Livestock grazing is common and widespread in the high Andean region;
   however, few studies have evaluated the effects of traditional camelid
   grazing (llamas and alpacas) on small and medium sized mammals. We
   studied small mammals in Sajama National Park in Bolivia. We evaluated
   the association between livestock abundance and 1) the abundance of
   small mammals, and 2) small mammal activity patterns. In a grid of 36
   sampling stations, small mammals were divided into two study groups,
   according to their body size and the trophic group. We assessed small
   mammal abundances with grids of live capture traps and vizcacha with
   camera traps. We performed GLM and Basic Kernel Density estimation
   analyses for associations between livestock abundance and abundance of
   small mammals, and small mammal activity patterns, respectively. The
   presence of mountain vizcacha and rodents was less likely where
   livestock abundance was higher. Herbivores and granivores, but not
   omnivores, were also negatively affected by higher livestock abundance.
   The diurnal activity patterns of mountain vizcachas declined when
   livestock abundance was higher. We suggest some alternatives for
   livestock management plans to minimize the negative effects of
   traditional livestock on small mammals.},

Abstract = {A longitudinal study was conducted to determine the incidence of
   mortality and morbidity rates of camel calves (birth to 180 day) and
   associated risk factors. Results showed that diseases, parasite
   infections, feed shortage, inadequate veterinary services and recurrent
   drought were the major constraints. Out of 205 calves, 185 had
   manifested 256 disease symptoms and 34 of them were died. Thus, a calf
   had 74.7\% and 16.4\% likelihood of developing a disease and dying
   during the cohort period. The incidence of diarrhea, pneumonia, camel
   pox and septicemia were 59, 51, 38 and 17 cases per 100
   calves-six-months at risk, respectively. The risk of diarrhea (hazard
   ratio = 1.15) and pneumonia (HR = 1.48) were higher during the wet
   season and in calves kept on communal grazing than others. The hazard of
   camel pox incidence was higher during dry periods and in calves fed
   limited amount of colostrum. The mortality rate was found to be lower
   among calves above three months (HR = 0.31), calves with normal delivery
   (HR = 0.32) and those kept at homestead (HR = 0.45) compared to others.
   The hazards of mortality were 6.80 and 3.02 times higher during the dry
   season than wet period and in calves that consumed less colostrum than
   their counterparts.},

Title = {Effects of dietary supplementation on vegetation cover and its
   defoliation by sheep in extensive husbandry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dietary supplementation is one of the most used strategies to reduce the
   effect of environmental fluctuations in arid and semi-arid environments.
   We evaluated changes in vegetation and in patterns of animal defoliation
   as a result of incorporating supplementation on semi-arid grasslands of
   Patagonia. We selected three paddocks on a sheep ranch where winter
   supplementation was carried out, and a feed silo was identified in each
   one. Fixed transects (50 m) were placed at increasing distances from the
   silos (100, 250 and 500 m), and several measurements were taken along
   the transects: grasses defoliation intensity; height, flowering and
   vigor of the key species; vegetation cover; and forage availability.
   Measurements were made during 3 seasons at two periods of the year. The
   defoliation intensity of species of low preference decreased with
   increasing distance from the silo, reaching at 100 m the same
   defoliation intensity as the preferred species, which did not change
   with distance. Vegetation, grasses and standing dead cover increased
   with distance from the silo. The use of dietary supplementation alters
   the animals' pattern of species selection and this has consequences for
   plant cover. It is therefore important to consider the possible
   long-term effects of using this technology.},

Abstract = {Climate change and inappropriate management practices in semi-arid
   savannas often result in shrub encroachment. Chemical shrub control is a
   common rehabilitation measure to counter shrub encroachment. A recent
   development, particularly in southern Africa, is the conversion from
   cattle to wildlife farming. Cattle and wildlife exhibit different
   behaviours, and different management practices are used. How these
   differences affect the results of rehabilitation measures is not well
   known. Here, we compared how selective chemical shrub control in these
   two land uses affected herbaceous diversity, and composition along
   waterhole transects (proxy for grazing pressure). Shrub control
   increased Simpson diversity when both land uses were analysed together,
   while land use type did not affect any diversity measure. However, when
   land uses were analysed individually, spatial differences in diversity
   became apparent. Species richness in game farms was affected by shrub
   control only at distances greater than 300m from waterholes, and in
   cattle farms total abundance increased at 1000m distances. Eleven
   species contributed to compositional differences between land uses. Our
   results show that bush control can improve ecosystem functioning and
   habitat heterogeneity in both land use types, which is particu-larly
   important given the current transition from livestock to game farming in
   southern Africa.},

Title = {Organic matter pools in a fluvisol after 29 years under different land
   uses in an irrigation region in northeast Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical component of the soil system and
   a sensitive indicator of soil quality. We aimed to investigate the
   response of SOM pools to different land uses and management in irrigated
   croplands of the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil. Four sites
   irrigated under long-term (29 years) land uses were selected: banana (B1
   and B2); elephant grass (EG) -perennial systems; maize and cowpea
   succession (MCP) -annual system; B1 was cropped for 17 years +2 years of
   maize and cowpea +17 years banana, while B2 was continu-ously cropped. A
   native forest (NF) site was selected as reference of steady state. Soil
   samples were collected at four depths in the rows and inter-rows of each
   management system. The higher decline in SOM fractions was perceived at
   0-0.05 m depth and microbial indices (microbial biomass C and N, and
   basal respiration and metabolic quotient) were very sensitive indicators
   of soil quality. Perennial systems (B1 and EG) maintained the C and N
   stocks at higher levels equivalent to NF at the 0-0.40 m layer, while
   MCP and B2 had lower total organic carbon (TOC) (15 and 17\%,
   respectively) and total nitrogen stocks (4.27 and 8.67\%, respectively).
   Perennial cultivation with B1 and EG showed also the highest soil C and
   N microbial biomass and stratification ratio and, the lowest respiratory
   quotients, all indications of elevated soil C sequestration. In general,
   land use change from native forest to annual crops reduced plant residue
   input and increased soil disturbance, favoring higher SOM
   mineralization, while perennial crops and grasses were the most
   effective in increasing C and N stocks due to the maintenance of crop
   residues on the soil surface and the absence of soil tillage.},

Title = {Road impacts to sheetflow-dependent ecosystems in the Sonoran Desert},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Roads affect ecological functioning at local to landscape scales, but
   little is known about the indirect effects on hydrology and vegetation
   outside road corridors. These impacts are of particular concern in arid
   landscapes such as the southwestern US, where road networks have rapidly
   expanded in recent decades. This study quantified impacts to vegetation
   where roads eliminated downslope sheetflow runon and identified how road
   and landscape characteristics affect the probability of sheetflow
   disruptions at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, in the Sonoran
   Desert of southern Arizona, USA. The abundance of perennial grasses,
   drought-deciduous subshrubs, and trees were significantly reduced in
   downslope plant communities where entrenched graded roads and
   above-grade paved roads diverted or impounded sheetflow. The remaining
   vegetation was dominated by annual herbaceous plants and the drought
   -resistant evergreen shrub creosotebush (Larrea tridentata {[}de
   Candolle] Coville), resulting in lower species and functional group
   richness. Sheetflow runon reductions also significantly decreased the
   growth, vigor, and sur-vival of woody plants, particularly for the
   winter-deciduous tree velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina Wooten).
   Hydrologic alterations affected the density and extent of nearby
   vegetation at 25\% of 484 locations where roadways intersected sheetflow
   paths. Primitive roads such as off-highway vehicle routes produced the
   smallest topographic changes and were the least likely to disrupt runon,
   while graded roads had a 48\% cumulative probability of ecohydrological
   impacts due to their tendency to become entrenched below ground. Paved
   roads were most likely to alter hydrologic connectivity due to
   embankments and roadside ditches and berms. Geologic substrate and soil
   type affected the probability of sheetflow impacts, which were most
   frequent on Quaternary alluvium and young soils lacking restrictive
   horizons. These results were used to map landscape sensitivity to
   sheetflow path disruption by roadways throughout Organ Pipe Cactus
   National Monument and to provide rec-ommendations for sustainable
   management of existing and future roads.},

   dry forest phytophysiognomies in response to successional stage},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Water availability is the main limiting factor to plants growth in
   tropical dry forests, influencing vegetation ecophysiological responses
   throughout ecological succession. In this study, we analyzed the water
   potential and gas exchange in two phytophysiognomies of a Brazilian
   tropical dry forest, along a chronosequence and in moments of low and
   high VPD. We selected an area of Crystalline Caatinga (CC) and Arboreal
   Caatinga (AC), and in both sites delimited three plots at different
   successional stages (initial, intermediate, and late). At each
   collection site within areas at each successional stage, we sampled the
   four most abundant species. For CC plants, water potential and gas
   exchange were similar at all successional stages, regarding VPD, and
   higher than in AC site. Trees growing in the AC site showed more plastic
   responses than those in the CC area, mainly in gas ex-change, whereas CC
   plants (mainly herbs) showed a higher variation in water potential. We
   established that this differential response occurred due to the
   structure of the plant community and soil water availability. Trees'
   leaf traits tend to present long-term responses, and we observed that
   vegetation in the AC site showed most markedly differences among
   successional stages than plants in CC site.},

Title = {Comparison of the uncertainty of soil organic carbon stocks in different

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study was performed to compare the uncertainty spatial distribution
   of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in different land uses. To achieve
   this goal, 210 soil samples were collected in 1140 km(2) land areas, and
   soil carbon, pH, EC, soil texture, and mineralogy were determined. Then,
   SOC stocks and soil erodibility factor were calculated. This data set
   was combined with the environmental variables data for modeling and
   mapping of SOC stocks using the random forest model. Accordingly, the
   uncertainty https://ezproxy.ir/science/article/pii/S0016706114002006 of
   SOCof SOC stocks was calculated. The mean uncertainty of SOC stocks was
   compared in dry farming, riverbed, gardens, irrigated farming, and
   grasslands. Finally, the response surface methodology was utilized to
   analyze the effect of soil properties on the uncertainty of SOC stocks.
   The results showed that the R-2, RMSE, MAE, and concordance (Pc) for
   modeling SOC stocks by the random forest model were 0.81, 0.44 (kg.
   m(-2)), 0.34 (kg.m(-2)), and 0.83, respectively. The mean comparisons of
   uncertainty among the different land uses showed that the highest
   uncertainty was related to dry farming. The response surface methodology
   in dry farming showed that interactive effects between soil erodibility
   factor, sand, and EC were the most effective factors to address the
   uncertainty of SOC stocks.},

Abstract = {Mollusk shells are common substrates for several groups of marine
   invertebrates, which use them as housing or refuge, often producing
   traces in the form of bioerosion. In dead associations (current or
   fossil), it is difficult to determine if bioerosion was produced
   postmortem or not. The objective of this study was to describe anomalous
   internal growths in shells of the bivalve Mactra isabelleana, relating
   these occurrences to bioerosion on the external face, inferring if it
   was produced while the mollusk was still alive or not. To do so, 552
   valves of M. isabelleana from the Cassino, Hermenegildo and Concheiros
   do Albardao beaches, southern Brazil, were examined for external face
   bioerosion caused by spionid polychaetes-U-shaped horizontal perforation
   (Caulostrepsis isp.)-and internal shell alterations. The preferred
   location for bioerosion was analyzed based on a sectorization of valves
   into four quadrants (Q1 and Q3 posterior, and Q2 and Q4 anterior) and by
   counting external perforations and internal alterations in each. From
   the total M. isabelleana valves, 199 presented bioerosion Caulostrepsis
   on their external face. Inner face structures found were attached
   pearls, blisters and sheets. Sheets-type alterations are described
   herein for the first time. The most commonly affected quadrants by
   Caulostrepsis showed correspondence to internal alterations (Q1 and Q3)
   in the posterior region of the shell, indicating that the bivalve was
   alive when perforated. This is the first description of a parasite-host
   interaction in M. isabelleana shells for southern Brazil and the first
   time that parasitism is related to the ichnogenus Caulostrepsis.},

Title = {Performance and sustainability of a multi-stage free water surface
   constructed wetland under seasonal change and shock loading},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multi-stage constructed wetlands (CWs) are widely used for water quality
   improvement, especially in the treatment of wastewater. Many studies
   focus on their treatment efficiency under steady loading, but fewer
   studies consider their sustainability under variable conditions. This
   study examines the multi-stage CWs in the Hong Kong Wetland Park for
   their long-term performance and sustainability in terms of water quality
   under seasonal changes, storm events, and shock loadings of pollutants.
   The results show that the multistage design performs well and is stable
   under these changing conditions. In such multistage CWs, the type of
   units and some changing conditions (e.g., inflow concentrations,
   seasonal changes of vegetation, and water levels) also affect the
   performance of the whole system. Compared to individual CW, a
   multi-stage CW system could recover more quickly on dissolved oxygen
   (DO), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4), but slowly on biochemical oxygen
   demand (BOD) and total phosphorus (TP). A pre-processing and buffering
   area is necessary to handle the shock loadings of BOD and TP in such a
   multistage CW system. Although water levels recover quickly in both, it
   is difficult to return to original water levels in multi-stage CWs
   compared to single ones. Besides, for sustainable operation, attention
   should be paid to the DO of the inlet, and aeration measures might be
   taken.},

Title = {Process formulations and controlling factors of pesticide dissipation in
   artificial ponds: A critical review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Pesticides are a non-point source of pollution affecting the quality of
   drinking water supplies and aquatic en-vironments. Many facilities are
   set up to reduce the transfer of pesticides from agricultural parcels
   into the environment, thereby preventing their input into water bodies.
   Artificial ponds collecting runoff and erosion fluxes represent a
   complementary tool for mitigating pesticide transfer. Ponds are
   free-water surface constructed wetlands, rarely dry out, and do not
   exceed 2 m in depth. Their main compartments include a water column, a
   sediment layer, living organisms, and suspended particles. The
   dissipation potential of ponds is due to a com-bination of physical,
   chemical, and biological processes that pesticides undergo in an
   interplay between different pond compartments. Although many studies on
   the dissipation potential of ponds focus on nitrates and sus-pended
   sediments, very little is known about the behavior of pesticides. Also,
   most studies evaluate a process individually without emphasizing its
   eventual interaction with other processes. Few papers address and
   compare mathematical formulations of pesticide transfer and
   transformation processes for artificial pond modeling. In this review,
   we investigate the interactions and contribution of multiple processes
   to artificial pond dissipation function by comparing their rates
   evaluated at different scales. We also discuss the mathematical
   formulations of these processes and their relationship with pesticide
   properties. Our evaluation suggests that quantifying the contribution of
   each process to pesticide dissipation in artificial ponds is an
   important tool for the hierarchization of dissipation processes. We
   believe that quantification and hierarchization may improve the
   estimation of overall artificial pond efficiency. We anticipate this
   work to be the basis for developing a process-based model of pesticide
   fate in artificial ponds. The model will be particularly helpful in
   setting up the dimensioning criteria to design performant and efficient
   ponds in order to mitigate pesticide transfer into the environment.},

Title = {A year-assessment of the suitability of a green facade to improve
   thermal performance of an affordable housing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The urban green infrastructure has been increasingly used for
   sustainable design and resilient cities. Despite its many benefits, such
   as aesthetic enhancement, improvement of the physical and mental health
   of residents, especially for vulnerable youth and elderly people, or
   creating opportunities for social cohesion and climate regulation, green
   infrastructure has not been used in low-income housing in subtropical
   Brazil, where the temperature can reach over 40 degrees C along the
   summer. This study evaluated a full-scale, low-cost green facade over a
   year to assess its effect on the thermal performance of an eco-friendly
   affordable housing located in humid subtropical climate. Aiming to be
   eco-friendly and keep its cost low, the house was built with materials
   such as unplastered hollow soil-cement bricks, not having very good
   thermal performance. The Wisteria floribunda, a deciduous vine, was used
   in the green facade installed on a west-facing wall, adjacent to a bare
   wall, which was also evaluated enabling to establish the thermal
   difference between the shaded wall and the bare wall. In the winter, the
   shaded and bare walls' amplitudes were remarkably close, due to leaf
   shedding, a desirable feature to improve temperatures within the house.
   The benefits of the green facade were clearer during spring and summer
   when the external surface temperature of the shaded wall was reduced by
   up to 9 degrees C compared to the bare wall, and its thermal amplitude
   varied by 8.4 degrees C, while the amplitude of the bare wall was more
   than double this value. The plant layer diminished the heat flux through
   the external wall by up to 22.3 W/m2 during the summer, and 8 W/m2
   during the winter. These results show the potential of a low-cost green
   facade to improve the thermal comfort of green affordable housing

Title = {Use of reed stalk trap nests by insects within the reed beds and in
   nearby steppic habitats},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trap nests made from stalks or stems of eudominant plants, such as
   Phragmites australis (reed) and Solidago canadensis (goldenrod), have
   been frequently used in previous studies. Nevertheless, trap nest
   occupancy in large stands of source plants remains poorly understood. We
   deployed trap nests made from stems with and stalks without parenchyma
   to steppic grasslands and terrestrial reed bed margins (64 localities in
   Central Europe) and matched the data with those from Moericke traps and
   phytocenologic releve ` s. The reed stalk trap nests attracted a much
   more abundant assemblage of Aculeata than the goldenrod stem trap nests.
   However, a large part of the species nesting in goldenrod stem trap
   nests overlapped with the species that used (and preferred) reed stalk
   trap nests. Ten aculeate species, which were present in large amounts in
   trap nests, were completely absent from the Moericke traps, and others
   were present in limited quantities. In natural habitats, trap-nesting
   bees and wasps had lower dominance but similar Fisher alpha values as
   those in anthropogenic habitats. Cavities in stems with or stalks
   without parenchyma served as previously undervalued nesting resources
   and an important monitoring tool. Trap-nesting species readily adopted
   broken stems and stalks even within stands of the source plants, the
   common reed and the goldenrod. Therefore, the conservation of threatened
   bee and wasp species that are associated with these cavities and are
   limited to habitats of natural origin requires conservation management
   that allows the presence of broken stems and stalks of >= 1 year of age
   in the proximity of the potential feeding habitats.},

Title = {Taxonomic resolution of coral image classification with Convolutional
   Neural Network},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 25},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are the most complex, diverse, and sensitive marine
   ecosystems, which are globally undergoing drastic changes. Changes in
   coral coverage, abundance, and diversity are difficult to track at
   adequate taxonomic resolution in a fast and efficient way. Deep
   Learning-enabled image recognition can help to increase the accuracy and
   can add to automating the entire survey process. However, the extent to
   which coral phylogenetic relationships within the higher taxonomic ranks
   are reflected by shared visual traits of the constituent species is an
   unresolved research subject. As a consequence, it is even more
   questionable whether the taxonomy of coral reefs at these levels can be
   identified from images using Machine Learning techniques. In this study,
   we analyzed the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   through different taxonomic ranks to classify the underwater images. We
   have used 1,15,296 images from the CoralNet database comprising 104
   species. A classifier was developed by fine-tuning the pre-trained
   ResNet34. The developed CNN classified 87.5\% of 34,543 test images
   correctly to species level and 91.78\% to genus level. The average
   classification recall on species level was 83.99\%. The ability to
   classify coral photographs at the species level can significantly boost
   the amount of occurrence data collected from survey sites. Even
   anticipating a higher taxonomic level will be a great place to start for
   additional research on a completely unknown specimen. Hence, the new
   technique will be a very useful tool for forecasting and understanding
   ecological responses to the environmental changes.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Improved land stewardship is necessary for climate change mitigation. As
   such, actions are needed to increase carbon (C) sinks and reduce C
   emissions from land use activities. Residual materials with fertilizing
   capacity can be used to reconstruct severely degraded soils and recreate
   a sustainable vegetation cover, leading to reductions in atmospheric CO2
   levels. We studied the temporal dynamics of CO2 sequestration potential
   in soils recon-structed with 1200 Mg ha-1 biosolids along a young
   chronosequence ranging from 0 to 7 years after initiating reclamation of
   a decommissioned asbestos mine in southern Que acute accent bec, Canada.
   We measured in situ soil CO2 fluxes, soil C pools and soil
   physicochemical properties. Since bacterial communities are highly
   responsive to soil physicochemical properties, we also analyzed both
   their diversity and community structure. The age since soil reclamation
   did not have a clear effect on soil properties, but it exerted greater
   control over soil C fluxes and soil bacterial community diversity and
   structure. Our results suggest large C fluxes to the atmosphere within
   the first year following soil reconstruction, but soils constitute a
   stable C pool thereafter.},

Title = {Soil bacterial community responses to land-use change in Mollisol of
   Northeast China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An important sensitive indicator responding to land-use change is the
   microbial community, which has been recently shown to directly influence
   soil health and function. Here, we investigated the impact of different
   land use on the soil bacterial community composition. A field experiment
   was carried out to check the changes of bacterial communities in
   response to maize cropping and fallow using Illumina MiSeq sequencing
   method. Compared to the referred natural grassland, 8-and 100-year maize
   cropping led to significant changes in the relative abundances of 5 and
   15 genera, respectively, while 8-year fallow changed the relative
   abundances of 11 genera. These changed genera resulted in distinct
   clustering of soil bacterial communities across land-use change
   according to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The bacterial
   community was far away from referred natural grassland with extension of
   maize cropping, and which derived by fallow was close to natural
   grassland. Based on RDA analysis, the major contributors from soil
   chemical properties to grassland samples were pH, TC, TN, MBC and
   MBN.Conclusions: These differential responses of bacterial genera are
   illustrative of the susceptibility of bacterial community to land-use
   change and given recovery possibility of bacterial community structure
   via appropriate fallow management associated with improving soil
   chemical property.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in the phytoremediation by Pontederia crassipes
   (Mart) Solms (water hyacinth) and its associated microbiota},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eutrophication is a major cause of water quality loss. It is
   characterized by an enrichment in the concentration of inorganic
   nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) in water bodies. A promising
   way to mitigate eutrophication is the development of phytoremediation
   processes in which aquatic plants are used to assimilate nutrients from
   water bodies. Pontederia crassipes, also known as water hyacinth, is
   adapted to eutrophic environments and its high growth rate favors
   phytoremediation. Although this species has been widely studied for
   phytoremediation, few studies consider the role of the associated
   microbial community in this process. Our objective was to evaluate
   removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by P. crassipes and investigate the
   bacterial community associated with its roots comparing two seasons in a
   tropical reservoir in Brazil. A system was developed, consisting of five
   mesocosms of 3000 L each that simulated flow of water from input of
   nutrients to output of the reservoir. Each mesocosm started with 30 live
   plants to simulate natural mats of P crassipes. Physicochemical
   parameters, vegetation cover, and nutrient concentrations of the
   mesocosms were evaluated weekly. At the initiation and termination of
   the experiment (4 weeks), P and N concentrations in plant tissues were
   analyzed along with biomass measurements. The root associated bacterial
   community was analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed that the
   phytoremediation process was slower in the winter than in the summer. We
   relate this effect to the water temperature, which decreased by an
   average of 7 degrees C. Significant differences were identified in
   specific bacterial orders in root-associated communities, with
   Chroococcales being the most abundant in the summer and Bacillales in
   the winter. Thus, P. crassipes can act effectively for phytoremediation
   throughout the year, but in colder periods, it is necessary to increase
   the number of plants because their growth rate is compromised. Changes
   in the associated bacterial community can be related to the seasonal
   variation in phytoremediation efficiency.},

Title = {The energetic cost of facing cyanotoxins: a case study on Daphnia magna},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Under the effects of global change, toxic cyanobacterial proliferations
   increase and subsequently threaten freshwater ecosystems and the
   services they provide. Zooplankton consumers, a key trophic level of
   freshwater ecosystems, are particularly impaired by cyanotoxins, but
   populations regularly exposed to cyanobacteria can develop tolerance
   against toxins. While the physiological processes involved in this
   tolerance have been extensively studied, their consequences for
   consumers' energetics remain poorly explored, impeding predictions of
   energy flow from zooplankton up to higher trophic levels. Here, we
   explored the metabolic response of Daphnia magna exposed to toxic and
   non-toxic strains of cyanobacteria to define the energy dedicated to
   cyanotoxins resistance mechanisms. We showed that resting metabolic rate
   (RMR) of individuals exposed to toxins increased by up to 60\%,
   reflecting the energy requirement involved by cyanotoxin resistance
   processes. By quantifying the energy dedicated to resistance mechanisms,
   RMR constitutes an interesting metric to estimate overall capacity of
   individual zooplankters to actively handle cyanotoxins. Moreover, RMR
   responds more promptly to cyanotoxins than growth thus being adequate to
   assess short-term cyanotoxins constraints (< 72 h). Overall, we showed
   that cyanotoxins resistance constitutes an energy leak in freshwater
   ecosystems. Quantifying this leak of energy may help anticipate
   alterations of energy flow within food web in response to cyanobacterial
   proliferation and, ultimately, enhance our predictions of freshwater
   ecosystem structure and functions in a context of global change.},

Title = {Effects of land use on thermal enrichment of urban stormwater and
   potential mitigation of runoff temperature by watershed-scale stormwater
   control measures},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Stream temperature is critical to the survival and reproduction of fauna
   in cold-water ecosystems. Urbanization causes abrupt increases in
   ambient stream temperature via stormwater inputs while concurrently
   decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Relatively little
   is known about how various urban land uses affect thermal load
   discharged to streams or whether a network of green infrastructure
   retrofitted at the watershed scale can ameliorate these impacts. Runoff
   temperature and hydrology were monitored at 17 urban and two forested
   watershed outlets to assess 1) how urban land use affects stormwater
   thermal pollution and 2) if thermal pollution can be mitigated through
   infiltrating stormwater control measures (SCMs). Significantly and
   substan-tially larger runoff temperatures (i.e., event mean temperature,
   event maximum temperature) and thermal loads were observed from every
   urban land use (without SCMs) in comparison to forested (i.e., surrogate
   for pre-development) conditions. Event mean temperatures generally
   followed the land use trend of parking lot > light industrial >
   commercial > heavy industrial > multi-family residential, single family
   residential > low density residential > forest. Retrofitted bioretention
   cells and permeable pavements were not successful in mitigating runoff
   temperature in residential watersheds compared to (1) watersheds without
   SCMs or (2) restoring temperature to surrogate pre-development
   conditions. SCMs were seldomly able to mitigate enough runoff volume to
   have a significant thermal load reduction compared to watersheds without
   SCMs. These results suggest stormwater management and cold-water species
   management have not yet been successfully integrated. More work is
   needed to optimize green infrastructure SCMs design for sufficient
   treatment of runoff to protect cold-water ecosystems from urban
   development. Beyond SCM implementation, wholistic watershed management
   practices (e.g., riparian buffers, clustered imperviousness, underground
   storage/conveyance) are needed to stem thermal enrichment of streams and
   lakes by stormwater.},

Title = {Analysis of historical changes in planform geometry of a mountain river
   to inform design of erodible river corridor},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The analysis of changes in planform geometry of the Biala River during
   the last 130 years is used to diagnose hydromorphological river
   degradation and thus to verify the need of river restoration through
   establishing an erodible river corridor. Outcomes from the analysis are
   then used for delimiting the erodible corridor and predicting the
   potential for future river widening in the corridor. The study analyses
   presentations of the active river zone and the structure of river
   geomorphic units on topographic maps from 1878, 1935 and 1962, aerial
   photos from 1967, 1977 and 1987, and orthophotos from 1998 and 2009. As
   a result of river channelization followed by channel incision, during
   the study period the width of the Biala was reduced to 16\%-57\% of its
   width in 1878. The river narrowing was associated with a reduction in
   the proportion of channel bars in the total river width and nearly
   complete elimination of islands. All these changes demonstrated the
   degradation of hydromorphological integrity of the river and the need
   for its restoration by allowing free channel development in an erodible
   corridor. The belt of the river migration during the last 130 years
   identified on the basis of overlays of the river position from all dates
   was 5 times wider than the contemporary river. This justified delimiting
   the erodible river corridor on a substantially larger area of the valley
   floor than the area of the river in 2009. In 2009 the river was narrower
   than the largest river width recorded between 1878 and 1998 along nearly
   the whole length of the study river sections. This indicates that the
   concentration of flood flows in the narrow channel, increasing their
   unit stream power, is a factor increasing the potential for future bank
   retreat and channel widening in the erodible corridor of the river.},

Title = {Assessing the effect of mitigation efforts to improve vegetation
   recovery in powerline construction sites across Norway},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Land-use related to technical infrastructure puts great pressure on
   nature and landscapes globally. We used a screening approach to evaluate
   vegetation development in 295 construction sites related to upkeeping of
   the national power grid in Norway and assessed if and how active
   measures for vegetation recovery can contribute to mitigate negative
   impacts on biodiversity and natural carbon storage. Bayesian networks
   were developed to assess the effect of interventions on the vegetation
   cover, and an ensemble learning algorithm (Boruta) was used to assess
   variable importance. Multivariate analysis was run to investigate plant
   functional group composition. The screening approach uncovered some
   broad results; A large diversity of installation types are associated
   with gridline-systems, and the large variation of mitigation measures
   are hard to classify and evaluate. Years since restoration, region and
   site ID were important to explain the total vegetation cover, while
   restoration treatment, soil and installation type were not important.
   Graminoids dominate the total vegetation cover, in both seeded and
   non-seeded sites. More detailed studies will contribute to more accurate
   evaluation of different measures and vegetation recovery. Lack of
   documentation and well-designed monitoring hamper the development of
   reliable procedures of mitigation in construction projects, as the
   ecological outcome of the efforts can be questioned.},

Abstract = {In this study, seven different stormwater nature-based solution (NBS)
   was investigated to identify the relationship of bacterial community to
   the pollutant removal performance of stormwater NBS. Based on this
   study, Proteobacteria was found to be the most dominant bacteria for all
   stormwater NBS and IS followed by Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria.
   Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, WS3, and
   AF234118\_p were found to have high positive correlation to most
   pollutant removal efficiency of different stormwater NBS (r-value: 0.62
   to 0.68). Using Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria count in NBS, equations
   predicting pollutant removal performance were developed. The equations
   developed in this study is useful in minimizing the cost for stormevent
   monitoring to identify the pollutant removal performance of NBS.},

Title = {Rest grazing start from the critical period of soil thawing optimizes
   plant community characteristics and grassland grazing capacity in alpine
   meadows},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The grazing management of alpine meadows is very important for grassland
   health. In order to explore the optimal rest grazing period in cold
   season pasture of alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), the
   critical period of soil thawing-grass withering period (RP1), the later
   period of soil thawing-grass withering period (RP2), the initial period
   of grass regreening-grass withering period (RP3), the later period of
   grass regreening-grass withering period (RP4) and local traditional rest
   grazing (dominant plant height 5 cm-grass withering period) (RP5) was
   set in the Tianzhu alpine meadow on the eastern edge of the QTP. RP1
   improved Gramineae and Cyperaceae coverage 140\% and 37.80\%,
   respectively, Cyperaceae aboveground biomass 58.52\%, the total
   aboveground biomass 22.86\%, and poisonous plants aboveground biomass
   was lower 29.39\% than that in RP3. The Richness index and
   Shannon-Wiener index for the RP1 plant community were 12.12-24.72\% and
   2.46-19.75\% higher than those in other rest grazing periods,
   respectively. The Simpson diversity index was 1.10\% higher in RP1 than
   that in RP3, and the Pielou evenness index was 3.30\% higher in RP1 than
   that in RP5. The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber
   contents of the plant increased with advanced rest grazing periods,
   being the highest in RP2. Crude protein, crude fat, and crude ash
   contents were the highest in RP5. The amount and digestible protein
   grazing capacities in RP1 were higher by 1.67-4.49 and 3.61-8.36 sheep
   units.ha(-1), respectively, than those in other rest grazing periods.
   RP1 rest grazing optimized the plant community structure, improved
   grassland productivity and plant community diversity, with a more stable
   plant community structure and higher grazing capacity. Therefore, the
   cold season pastures should be managed with a rest grazing in RP1 for
   the sustainable utilization of grassland ecosystem.},

Volume = {56},

Pages = {1069-1097},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Approximately 15\% of the world's wetlands are rice fields, vital in
   providing food for 40\% of the human population. Due to farming
   practices-induced habitat disturbances, rice cultivation acts as a
   habitat filter that retains only taxa possessing specific traits to
   overcome the constraints. Being aquatic biota, benthic
   macroinvertebrates are also impacted by the intermittent presence of
   water in rice fields. The biological traits and trait combinations of
   benthic macroinvertebrates enabling their existence during the rice
   cultivation cycle in seasonal rice fields of Maranchery Kole (The Ramsar
   site Vembanad Kole wetland's part) were studied. Based on the
   literature, 63 categories of 11 biological traits assignable at the
   genus level were used to characterize benthic macroinvertebrates. The
   taxa by traits data matrix was subjected to Gower's distance-based
   hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to categorize faunal groups
   with similar trait assembly. According to the abundance weighted trait
   modality scores, the predominant traits were small body size, life
   duration of more than 1 year, multivoltine life cycle, aquatic larval
   stage, aquatic passive dispersal, cocoons as resistant form, locomotion
   by full water swimming, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction,
   detritus as food and deposit-feeding. Trait-based classification of taxa
   resulted in 5 clusters. Characteristic trait combinations in each
   cluster particularly those beneficial for survival in unstable lentic
   freshwaters enabled the existence of taxa. Cluster I, the most abundant
   group (oligochaetes), was benefited from trait combinations including
   resistance forms to survive the intermittent presence of water in rice
   fields. Asexual reproduction and early onset of reproduction ensured
   their higher abundance from the transplanting phase. Detrital feeding
   also facilitated their rapid buildup in newly flooded fields rich in
   decomposing detritus. Cluster groups II and III, actively flying
   colonists characterized by competitive traits like predation, were more
   in tillering and preharvest phases. Apart from resistant and resilient
   traits ensuring survival in the temporary and disturbed habitat,
   exclusive trait combinations favored the faunal groups through different
   phases.},

Title = {Substrate composition impacts long-term vegetation development on
   blue-green roofs: Insights from an experimental roof and greenhouse
   study},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Green roofs provide ecosystem services and can promote biodiversity in
   urban areas. Blue-green roofs have an additional water storage
   compartment under the substrate to reduce roof water runoff, thereby
   also reducing drought stress which is beneficial for green roof
   vegetation. In order to study which blue-green roof design supports the
   highest plant diversity, we assessed the effect of different substrates
   and seed mixtures on vegetation development in a short-term greenhouse
   experiment and long-term blue-green roof experiment. A ten-week full
   -factorial greenhouse experiment was performed for six substrate
   composition and four seed mixture treatments. On an experimental
   blue-green roof, we annually surveyed plants from 2013 to 2021 in nine
   different treatments (five replicates each), that varied in substrate
   composition, substrate depth and seed mixture that was initially
   applied. Two treatments resembled conventional non-green roofs (100\%
   gravel) and conventional extensive Sedum green roofs. The results of the
   greenhouse experiment showed that seed mixture is more important than
   substrate composition in shaping the initial species richness and
   species composition. However, on the experi-mental roof the substrate
   composition was an important determinant of species richness and species
   composition long-term. Plant species richness on the experimental roof
   was lowest in the gravel treatment (resembling conventional non-green
   roofs), and highest in treatments where locally collected soil was used,
   likely due to additional species that appeared from the seed bank
   present in the transplanted soil. Soil was never completely covered with
   vegetation on unfertilized substrates that contained 20\% or less dense
   and organic materials. Plant species richness on conventional Sedum roof
   substrate was higher on the experimental blue-green roof compared to an
   adjacent non-blue roof, highlighting that blue-green roofs can promote
   biodiversity more than conventional green roofs. For future construction
   of blue-green roofs in our region, we recommend the addition of 30\%
   locally collected soil to a 6 cm deep lightweight substrate to maximize
   long-term plant cover and plant species richness.},

Title = {Effects of watershed-scale green infrastructure retrofits on urban
   stormwater quality: A paired watershed study to quantify nutrient and
   sediment removal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urban stormwater represents a substantial source of nutrients and
   sediment to aquatic ecosystems. Green infrastructure (GI), including
   bioretention and permeable pavement, is an increasingly utilized method
   to treat stormwater pollutants. Using soil and plants as natural
   filters, these systems are effective at the site scale, but little
   evidence exists regarding their performance at the watershed-scale.
   Blueprint Columbus is an effort by the City of Columbus, Ohio, USA to
   retrofit GI to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows and remove 20\% of
   total suspended solids (TSS) from existing developed areas. Changes in
   water quality resulting from the combined effects of many GI practices
   installed in 11.5 and 47.8 ha treatment watersheds were quantified using
   a paired -watershed approach. Based on water quality data collected by
   automated samplers over a 3.5-year period, sig-nificant reductions in
   particulate and dissolved nutrients as well as sediment were observed
   following the installation of GI in both treatment watersheds compared
   to the control. Total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP), and TSS
   concentrations decreased by 13.7-24.1\%, 20.9-47.4\%, and 61.6-67.7\%,
   respectively. Runoff attenua-tion by GI contributed to pollutant load
   reductions of 24.0-25.4\% (TN), 27.8-32.6\% (TP), and 59.5-78.3\% (TSS).
   Orthophosphate concentrations and loads increased in the watershed with
   bioretention only but significantly decreased in the treatment watershed
   with bioretention and permeable pavement. Reductions in TSS
   concen-tration were similar (within a margin of 5\%) to the percent of
   the watershed imperviousness treated by GI. Results demonstrate that GI
   was effective in reducing runoff event mean concentrations and loads at
   the watershed-scale.},

Title = {Evaluation of the performance and cost-effectiveness of coral
   microfragments in covering artificial habitats},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Microfragmentation is a potentially more versatile method of increasing
   coral cover. While recent studies have evaluated the performance of
   microfragments of massive corals, data on other growth forms is still
   lacking. More research regarding the applications of microfragmentation
   is also needed. In this study, the feasibility of coral microfragments
   from three genera in covering three artificial habitat designs was
   examined empirically in western Luzon Island, The Philippines. Ceramic
   tiles containing nine microfragments each of Acropora, Porites, and
   Merulina were transplanted onto the cube, truncated pyramid, and
   jackstone concrete modules and monitored for growth and mortality over
   five months. The cost-effectiveness of microfragmentation of three coral
   genera was then compared using spreadsheet models. Microfragmentation,
   coral gardening, and larval enhancement were also compared using similar
   models. Acropora had the highest coral cover and mortality rates, with
   cover averaging 30.24 +/- 16.17 cm2, more than twice the cover achieved
   by Porites and Merulina. However, Porites and Merulina had lower
   mortality rates. Significant differences in coral performance were also
   observed, including high dislodgement for all three coral genera at
   particular sites and artificial habitat designs. Comparisons of models
   suggest larval enhancement is most cost-effective, requiring <1 \% of
   the number of coral colonies compared to coral gardening while only
   costing 2.2 times as much. Microfragment mortality and dislodgement must
   be addressed before the widespread use of microfragmentation is
   recommended. The study emphasizes the importance of carefully designing
   an intervention effort to the specific local environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Belowground plant parts play an important role in wetland functioning
   but their biomass and structural traits have remained out of focus in
   constructed wetlands. We studied the biomass and structural traits of
   rhizomes and roots of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Steud. in the inflow
   and outflow parts of a newly established constructed wetland with
   subsurface horizontal flow (Slavosovice, Czech Republic). The rhizome
   biomass of P. australis increased until the 6th year after planting and
   reached about 1.5 and 2.0 kg.m(-2) in the inflow and outflow parts of
   the bed, respectively. The average live root biomass was about 7\% of
   the total live belowground biomass. Analysis of the rhizome branching
   pattern showed that in the 8th year after planting, the rhizome life
   span was definitely two years and most probably up to four years. The
   root structural traits showed that thicker and shorter roots were formed
   in the inflow part. As a result, there were differences in total root
   length, which reached 2.4 km m(-2) in the inflow and 3.3 km m(-2) in the
   outflow parts. This probably reflects a higher nutrient availability at
   the inflow rather than the toxicity of the discharged wastewater. The
   results of this study support previous arguments that the belowground
   parts of P. australis are an important carbon source in constructed
   wetlands, tolerate the anaerobic environment in the treatment bed well
   and provide a large surface area for the attachment of microorganisms.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions in a sandy foreshore: A biological assessment of
   a longline mussel aquaculture technique to establish subtidal reefs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate-induced natural disasters such as floods and storms are expected
   to become more frequent and intense in the coming years. From 2017 till
   2020, a pilot project was set up where mussel reefs were established as
   a nature -based solution to mitigate coastal erosion off the Belgian
   Coast. These subtidal mussel reefs were created by applying a longline
   mussel aquaculture technique consisting of filamentous and
   non-filamentous dropper lines of different materials. In this study,
   several biological aspects of the Nature-based Solution (NbS) set-up
   were examined: the suitability of the set-up as a whole, the suitability
   of the seven dropper line types, distribution of biofouling organism on
   the dropper lines and the spatio-temporal evolution of the mussel reef
   and its impact on the underlying benthic communities. Only during the
   summer months, a mussel reef could be established under the dropper line
   structure. Filamentous and non-filamentous dropper lines harbored
   different mussel densities and sizes, leading to a possible different
   effect on the underlying mussel reef. The biofouling community on the
   dropper lines was also defined in this study with amphipod species such
   as Jassa sp. and Monocorophium sp. as the dominant species. The impact
   of the NbS set-up on the macrofaunal communities remained low for the
   study period. First indications of a shift towards a less diverse and
   oligochaete dominated community was observed, although longer time
   series and an optimized sampling protocol will be needed. This pilot
   study showed the application of using a mussel longline technique in
   order to establish a subtidal mussel reef in a soft-sediment
   environment.},

Title = {Cost-benefit of green infrastructures for water management: A
   sustainability assessment of full-scale constructed wetlands in Northern
   and Southern Italy},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sustainable water management has become an urgent challenge due to
   irregular water availability patterns and water quality issues. The
   effect of climate change exacerbates this phenomenon in water-scarce
   areas, such as the Mediterranean region, stimulating the implementation
   of solutions aiming to mitigate or improve environmental, social, and
   economic conditions. A novel solution inspired by nature,
   technology-oriented, explored in the past years, is constructed
   wetlands. Commonly applied for different types of wastewater due to its
   low cost and simple maintenance, they are considered a promising
   solution to remove pollutants while creating an improved ecosystem by
   increasing biodiversity around them. This research aims to assess the
   sustainability of two typologies of constructed wetlands in two Italian
   areas: Sicily, with a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland, and
   Emilia Romagna, with a surface flow constructed wetland. The assessment
   is performed by applying a costbenefit analysis combining primary and
   secondary data sources. The analysis considered the market and nonmarket
   values in both proposed scenarios to establish the feasibility of the
   two options and identify the most convenient one. Results show that both
   constructed wetlands bring more benefits (benefits-cost ratio, BCR) than
   costs (BCR > 0). In the case of Sicily, the BCR is lower (1) in the
   constructed wetland scenario, while in its absence it is almost double.
   If other ecosystem services are included the constructed wetland
   scenario reach a BCR of 4 and a ROI of 5, showing a better performance
   from a costing perspective than the absence one. In Emilia Romagna, the
   constructed wetland scenario shows a high BCR (10) and ROI (9), while
   the scenario in absence has obtained a negative present value indicating
   that the cost do not cover the benefits expected. Further research
   should be focused on improving ecosystem services monetary
   quantification from different context (i.e. rural vs urban).},

Abstract = {Ammonia oxidation microorganism (AOM) is a key aspect of nutrient
   recycling in aquaculture sediments. Recently, rice-fish co-culture
   (symbiosis) has been paid more and more attention to the restoration of
   water and sediment quality in intensive aquaculture. Nevertheless, there
   are few studies on the effect of rice-fish co-culture on AOM in the
   sediments. Here, a field experiment was used to determine differences in
   abundance, community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) along
   with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in surface sediments (0-10 cm) in
   the paddy field (with ridge of 80 cm high, similar to shallow pond) for
   co-culture of japonica rice and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (JR-C),
   co-culture of indica rice and crayfish (IR-C), and crayfish monoculture
   (CM). The results showed that AOA were higher abundance, and diversity
   than AOB in the three modes of crayfish farming; AOA and AOB communities
   were dominated by Nitrososphaera and Nitrosospira clusters,
   respectively, with an average relative abundance of 97.86\% and 93.77\%;
   among the three modes, IR-C remarkably lowered alpha-diversity of AOA
   and AOB. Compared to CM, relative abundance of the Nitrosospira cluster
   in IR-C and JR-C was significantly increased, and the abundance of amoA
   genes of AOA in JR-C was remarkably higher (P < 0.05). Redundancy
   analysis (RDA) and spearman's correlation analysis showed that AOB
   community structure and abundances of AOA were significantly correlated
   with sediment pH, which indicated that sediment pH dominantly controlled
   the AOM.},

Title = {Early sowing is more effective in the long-term for restoring sandy
   grassland than six years of mowing or carbon amendment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In order to find the best and most reliable practices for ecological
   restoration of degraded lands, longer time scales should be considered
   when evaluating restoration efforts. We assessed the long-term (16
   years) effects of different grassland restoration treatments - seeding,
   mowing, and carbon amendment - in the Pannonian sand grasslands. After
   re-plowing in 1 m x 1 m plots, treatments were carried out in two
   abandoned croplands. Seeding was applied only initially (2002) while
   mowing and carbon amendment were carried out for six years (2003-2008).
   Vegetation was surveyed yearly from 2003 to 2008 and re-sampled in 2019
   in each permanent treatment plot. We used principal coordinates analysis
   to describe the trajectories of vegetation development and linear
   mixed-effects models to test changes in the relative cover of native
   sand grassland (target) and invasive (neophyte) species with time and
   treatments. Relative cover of target species increased while neophyte
   species decreased with time in both sites. There was a higher relative
   cover of target species from the first or third year on and a lower
   relative cover of neophyte species from the third year on in one site in
   seeded plots compared to other treatments. Seeded species also spread
   into non-seeded plots by 2019, obscuring the differences between
   treatments 16 years after sowing. Carbon amendment proved to be
   beneficial in the early and mowing in the later phases of restoration.
   Based on the long-term results, initial seeding is the best method for
   restoring sand grasslands in old fields by favoring the establishment of
   target species and controlling non-native invasion. As a supplement to
   seeding, carbon amendment can be suggested in the initial phases and/or
   low-intensity mowing in the later phases of the restoration after land
   abandonment. Although the spread from seeded plots obscured the
   long-term differences between treatments, it optimized the restoration
   process, suggesting that the use of small seed introduction units can be
   enough to restore the whole degraded area.},

Title = {Coastal wetland area change for two freshwater diversions in the
   Mississippi River Delta},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal systems around the globe are being re-integrated with adjacent
   river systems to restore the natural hydrologic connection to riparian
   wetlands. The Mississippi River sediment diversions or river
   reconnections are one such tool to combat high rates of wetland loss in
   coastal Louisiana, USA by providing freshwater, sediment, and nutrients.
   There has been some disagreement in the published literature whether
   re-establishing river reconnection is slowing or contributing to coastal
   wetland loss. This issue is due to the difficulties in the application
   of remote sensing in low-relief environments where water level changes
   could indicate either land loss or simply temporary submergence. We
   analyzed land change at the receiving areas of two existing fresh-water
   river diversions, Davis Pond and Caernarvon, which have been
   intermittently receiving river water for up to 2+ decades. This study
   provides a robust analysis of wetland land change rates in proximity
   these river di-versions including years before river reconnection. Our
   analyses indicate a net land gain since river reconnection operations
   began at Davis Pond Diversion (+3.42 km2; range: +2.02-4.81 km2) and no
   statistically significant change at the Caernarvon Diversion. The Davis
   Pond wetland results are corroborated with data from a decadal field
   study documenting increased inorganic sedimentation in the soil. It is
   clear from this study and others, that river reconnection can increase
   or, in the case of Caernarvon, have no statistical effect on the land
   change in these systems due to differences in vegetation, hydroperiod,
   sediment delivery and external factors including hurricane impacts. Our
   remote sensing analysis was compared with a global water area change
   analysis mapping tool which also supported our findings.},

Title = {Negative effects of ghost nets on Mediterranean biodiversity},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets (i.e., ghost nets)
   strongly affect biodiversity in marine ecosystems of numerous localities
   around the world. Based on videos posted by different people in YouTube
   (TM), we accessed the negative effects of these gears in the
   Mediterranean Sea. We identified 86 species, from 12 groups, in 12
   countries within the Mediterranean region (including in the Africa,
   Europe, and Asia). Of the species entangled in ghost nets, 10 are
   considered threatened with extinction according to the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature. Fishes and macrocrustaceans were the
   most recorded groups entangled in ghost nets. We also identified algae,
   other invertebrates (i.e., cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs,
   poriferans, tunicates) and vertebrates (i.e., turtles and mammals). The
   larger number of ghost fishing events were recorded in Italy and Turkey.
   This is the most complete study showing the negative effects of ghost
   nets on marine biodiversity worldwide, based on data retrieved from
   digital media. With the available literature, our data are important to
   implement measures against ghost fishing nets in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Abstract = {Acropora palmata is colonized by encrusting sponges, such as Clathria
   venosa, in the lower zones of coral branches, especially in areas devoid
   of living tissue. To analyze the responses of tissues involved in the
   areas of interaction, we investigated the advancement rates and the
   sponge growth and recovery rates after the removal of sponge tissue. To
   assess the advance or retreat rates of the sponge and coral, steel
   screws were placed at the limits of the sponge/coral interaction area
   (treatment 1), and the response of the coral and sponge tissues was
   recorded. In treatment 2, the sponge was removed by scraping and
   cleaning the area. In treatment 3, the sponge was removed, and the area
   occupied by the sponge was filled with epoxy putty. We found that the
   interaction was a standoff (T1) in 64.2\% of cases, the sponge advanced
   in 7.1\% of cases, and regression was observed in 28.7\% of cases.
   Following its partial removal of the sponge (T2), C. venosa recovered
   the formerly occupied space in one month, whereas in T3, growth and
   recovery required 3 months. Clathria venosa is a colonizing species of
   the lower parts of the bases and branches of A. palmata, which despite
   presenting a rapid regeneration rate, no evidence was found that in
   contact with the coral, the sponge generates tissue deterioration.},

Abstract = {Repeated coral reef surveys conducted in 2016-2021 in the coastal area
   of Nui Chua National Park in Ninh Thuan Province (South-Central
   Vietnam), formerly one of the richest coral areas in the Vietnamese
   coastal waters of the South China Sea, revealed dramatic degradation of
   coral communities over a five-year period. Coral cover decreased by 93\%
   and coral diversity by six-fold. This phenomenon has resulted from a
   long-term outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster sp. (COTS)
   reinforced by sea surface temperature anomalies in June 2019. The last
   survey, conducted in the target monitoring site in May 2021, revealed
   that the outbreak of COTS had ceased together with the disappearance of
   food sources for this starfish. Predator removal caused by overfishing
   and to some degree, nutrient enrichment resulting from the local
   seasonal upwelling, apparently determined the extent of the COTS
   outbreak. Degraded upstream coral reefs in the adjacent districts do not
   suggest coral recovery in this area in the near future.},

Abstract = {Microcystis has been the dominant bloom-forming cyanobacterial
   population in Lake Taihu over the past two decades. To illustrate the
   temporal and spatial variation in the main colony characteristics for
   Microcystis and their key environmental factors in Lake Taihu, an annual
   investigation of the size, morphospecies and viability (the viable cell
   rate) of Microcystis colonies was performed in this study from 2020 to
   2021. The average colony diameter ranged from 81.12 to 499.54 mu m at
   all sites during this investigation. The average colony diameter of the
   whole lake in spring and in late autumn to early winter was higher than
   that in other times. Microcystis flos-quae, Microcystis aeruginosa,
   Microcystis novacekii and Microcystis wesenbergii were the main dominant
   morphotypes, which was mainly affected by pH, TDP and temperature.
   Although no significant correlation was found between colony viability
   and environmental factors, the temporal difference in colony viability
   was remarkable. Colony viability in autumn (mainly October and
   November), spring (March and April), and July was lower than that in
   other times.},

Title = {Limiting burrowing activity and overland dispersal of the invasive alien
   red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii by sophisticated design of
   watercourses},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Invasive alien crayfish species pose major ecological and hydrological
   risks globally. The red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is one of
   the most widespread crayfish species worldwide. Its impacts arise from
   burrowing activities and lead to mobilization of soil nutrients, water
   safety risks by instability of dikes and erosion of banks. Increased
   sediment load demands additional dredging of drainage ditches and canals
   to ensure their water discharge capacity. Sustainable methods for
   limiting burrowing in banks and dispersal behaviour of crayfish were not
   yet available. Therefore, a field study was performed to determine
   whether the number of burrows and overland movement of crayfish were
   related to a particular bank type. Burrows were counted in three
   water-courses during a water-level decline. The number of burrows was
   significantly lower in natural banks than in non-natural and
   semi-natural banks. The construction of natural-like banks along
   watercourses may significantly reduce sediment load, erosion and the
   collapse of banks by burrowing activities of crayfish. An inclination
   experiment mimicking various types of terrestrial dispersal barriers
   elucidated that steepness, soil type and vegetation structure of small
   embankments near watercourses were significant factors for manipulating
   overland movement of crayfish. Crayfish were taken out of the water for
   this purpose and placed on small experimental embankments varying in
   slope and types of vegetation. The lowest frequencies of upward movement
   were recorded at inclinations of 20 degrees and 30 degrees on bare sandy
   soil and short and species-poor grassland substrates. This implies that
   crayfish crawling out of the water will return to the watercourse when
   encountering such a dispersal barrier. Therefore, a sophisticated design
   of embankments along watercourses can be a tool to reduce coloni-zation
   risk of nearby located, hydrologically isolated water bodies with high
   nature values.},

Title = {Evaluating the suitability of neotropical trees and shrubs for soil and

   species},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soil and water bioengineering techniques are now increasingly adopted
   worldwide for controlling riverbank erosion but have not yet been
   implemented in the Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspot. The selection
   of suitable native plant species is critical for successful soil
   bioengineering designs on riverbanks, but few data are available
   regarding Caribbean species. This study aimed to characterize the
   performance and biotechnical traits of native Caribbean species
   potentially compatible with soil and water bioengineering. In a
   six-month shadehouse experiment, we measured the survival rate, biomass
   production and root growth of cuttings of ten native Caribbean shrub and
   tree species occurring naturally in a variety of riparian environments.
   All species appeared suitable for soil and water bioengineering but
   differed as to the specific bioengineering techniques they seemed
   particularly suited for, depending on their respective survival rates,
   growth performances and root system structures. Five tree species,
   Citharexylum spinosum, Cedrela odorata, Ficus citrifolia, Chimarrhis
   cymosa, Homalium racemosum, and three shrubs, Piper dussii, Piper
   dilatatum and Phyllanthus mimosoides, exhibited survival, growth and
   root characteristics compatible with a broad range of techniques,
   whereas Tabebuia heterophylla and Cordia sulcata may only be compatible
   with a few. We also propose using of the DEXi decision-support software
   for assessing species suitability to a series of widespread soil and
   water bioengineering techniques. Our results provide practical guidance

Title = {Sustained vegetation greening enhanced ecosystem water-use efficiency in
   the Loess Plateau of China in recent 20 years},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global vegetation greenness has already been confirmed to increase
   substantially since the early 1980s, and this phenomenon is extremely
   heterogeneous in both time and space. The Loess Plateau (LP) serves as
   an ecological barrier of northern China, where the ecological
   environment is characterized by exceptional fragility and sensitivity.
   However, the spatial pattern of vegetation dynamics in both greenness
   and productivity and their relationship with vegetation ecosystem
   water-use efficiency (WUE) are still poorly documented, especially in
   recent 20 years. In this study, the leaf area index (LAI) and gross
   primary productivity (GPP) were employed to characterize vegetation
   canopy leaf area and productivity, respectively. The time series data of
   ecosystem WUE in the LP were obtained by the ratio of GPP and ET during
   the period of 2000-2018, the dynamic trend of vegetation greenness and
   productivity in the LP was detected by using a linear fitting and
   nonlinear method, then, the extent to which the sustained greening in
   the LP revealed an increase of ecosystem WUE in recent 20 years was
   quantified. The results showed that sustained vegetation greening and
   increased GPP elucidated a great improvement in ecosystem WUE in the LP
   during 2000-2018, in which the sustained greening potentially reveals an
   increase of ecosystem WUE in > 69.33\% regions of the LP in recent 20
   years. > 93\% regions of the LP have been experiencing a vegetation
   greening progress derived by both the annually averaged LAI (LAI(AN))
   and growing season (April to October) maximum LAI (LAI(GS)).
   Furthermore, precipitation and soil moisture positively contributed to
   an interannual increase in ecosystem WUE; however, increasing
   temperature greatly resulted in a decrease in ecosystem WUE in the LP in
   recent 20 years. Importantly, this work also implied that ecological
   water is significantly consumed by the increasing vegetation
   photosynthesis derived from the significant growth of ET in the LP since
   the 2000s. These findings implied that the increasing ecological water
   consumption should be incorporated into indigenized ecosystem process
   models.},

Title = {Optimizing fish-friendly flow pattern in vertical slot fishway based on
   fish swimming capability validation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Vertical slot fishways are increasingly common structures for the
   passage of a wide variety of migratory fish species, which account for
   59.2\% of all fish passage facilities in China. The slot structures and
   redirected flow in the pools are of great importance to guide the fish
   to swim through the fishway. To optimize the design of vertical slot
   fishways, physical experiments and numerical simulations were used to
   study the hydraulic characteristics for 10 different geometric
   configurations (referred to as designs D1-D10), combining with the study
   of fish behavior in the model. A comparative study on vertical slot
   fishway with L-shaped baffle (D1) and with a new vertical baffle (D2)
   was conducted. Flow patterns, velocity fields and other key hydraulic
   parameters including the maximum velocities and turbulence kinetic
   energy in the pools were analyzed. No obvious differences in all key
   hydraulic between designs D1 and D2 present in the study, which suggests
   an upgrade of the L-shaped baffle to the new vertical baffle with the
   advantage of being more compact and economical. When modifying design D2
   in the baffle thickness and length (D3-D10), three typical flow patterns
   with the different area ratios of left recirculation region to right
   recirculation region (Scl/Scr) were observed in the pools, which were
   denoted as flow pattern 1 (FP1), flow pattern 2 (FP2) and flow pattern 3
   (FP3). An analysis of the behavior of grass carp (Cte-nopharyngodon
   Idella) in the scaled model clearly showed that the flow and structure
   in FP2, with the principal flow in the center position and suitable
   velocity gradient and recirculation area ratio, were more friendly to
   fish with better migrating efficiency, which present sufficient velocity
   gradient and area of cushion zone for migratory fish to pass with less
   energy consumption.},

Title = {Urban green corridor construction considering daily life circles: A case
   study of Wuhan city, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban green corridors are the vital link connecting urban blue-green
   space and provide ecosystem services. Although numerous studies have
   been carried out to identify urban green corridors, few studies have
   focused on the demand of both urban residents and species for blue-green
   space from the perspective of daily life circles, which are the basic
   unit of requirements in city area. In this study, we proposed an
   improved method that considered three types of daily life circles and
   further integrated the socioeconomic factors in daily life circles that
   affect the stability of green spaces into the construction of green
   corridors. We adopted the city central area of Wuhan as a case study to
   apply the evaluation method. The results indicated that the three types
   of daily life circles were close to the practical life. Socioeconomic
   factors in the daily life circles affected the stability of blue-green
   space; thus, it is necessary to integrate them into the green corridor
   construction. Accordingly, we improved a strategy to construct green
   corridors based on daily life circle theory. Our method extends the
   green corridor construction methodology, and the research results can
   provide a significant reference for urban planning to build more
   reasonable green corridors to move toward both biodiversity and satisfy
   the demand of residents and species for blue-green space.},

Title = {Denitrifying bioreactor woodchip sourcing guidance based on physical and
   hydraulic properties},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Denitrifying bioreactors using woodchips reduce nitrate loads in
   agricultural outflows, but there is a lack of practical guidance for
   woodchip selection from a hydraulic design perspective. The objectives
   of this study were to develop relationships between particle size,
   porosity, bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) for
   a range of commonly available woodchip types to improve woodchip
   selection guidance and default design model values. Twenty woodchip
   types from across the US Midwest had their sizes quantified using both
   sieve analysis and manual axis measurements. Bulk and particle densities
   and porosity of the twenty types were measured using relatively easy jar
   tests and a selected eight types had bulk density determined across four
   compaction levels in larger permeameters. Saturated hydraulic
   conductivity was determined for six types each at three compaction
   levels. Mean conductivities generally ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 to 0.51-1.8
   cm/s for uncompacted and highly compacted woodchips, respectively, and
   this work newly documented maximum limits of woodchip compaction
   occurred generally at bulk densities of 190 to 260 kg/m(3). Woodchip
   types with D-50 in the 13.5-16.8 mm range had predictable and relatively
   consistent drainable porosity and K-sat values across bulk densities,
   facilitating the development of predictive models (R-2 >= 0.51; p <
   0.0001). Even so, K-sat values were highly variable both within and
   between woodchip types, especially at the lowest compaction level, which
   creates challenges for precisely estimating this term for design models.
   Woodchip types with D-50 > 12 mm and D-90 > 26 mm with uniformity
   coefficients of 2-3.1 that were chip-shaped (length: width ratio <
   similar to 3.5) were recommended for standardized denitrifying
   bioreactor designs.},

Title = {Water flux and biomass production of native plants at different
   substrate compactions for landfill phytocaps in Southeast Queensland,
   Australia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Phytocaps for landfills and degraded sites have multiple benefits
   provided by the established vegetation, including reducing substrate
   moisture content and drainage through evapotranspiration. One of the
   factors affecting plant development measured by biomass production is
   substrate compaction. However, the relationship between drainage and
   biomass production related to substrate compaction is largely unknown.
   In an outdoor pot experiment, four native plant species: Eucalyptus
   terreticornis, Acacia concurrens, Allocasuarina littoralis, and Themeda
   triandra, grown in coal overburden at three different relative
   compactions (RC) levels (64\%, 77\% and 87\% of the maximum compaction)
   in Southeast Queensland, Australia, over seven months.
   Evapotranspiration rate was measured by change in pot weight. Drainage
   for each pot was collected in a container after every irrigation and
   rainfall. Biomass of plants were harvested for dry shoot and root weight
   measurement. Additionally, root length density was obtained by a root
   scanner. Our statistical model predicted that 69.8\% RC for maximum
   weekly ET. Overall, 77\% RC treatment resulted in higher total
   evapotranspiration (1.5\%), more significant shoot and root biomass
   production (17.2\% and 11.8\%, respectively), higher root length density
   (33.4\%) and lower total drainage (20\%) compared to 64\% and 87\% RC
   treatments. Native woody species had a higher rate of evapotranspiration
   and a lower rate of drainage than the native grass. Reduction in
   drainage was correlated with increase in evapotranspiration rate for all
   plant species, as the soil moisture content decreases through
   evapotranspiration. These findings support the notion of maximising
   evapotranspiration to minimise drainage, a key objective for phytocap
   design. From biomass production, root biomass closely correlates to a
   reduction in drainage. Multiple lines of evidence from this study
   indicate that 77\% RC treatment maximises evapotranspiration and plant
   development and minimises deep drainage for phytocap applications, even
   though harsh microclimate in this experiment may have constrained plant
   development and affected the water flux.},

Title = {Characteristics and effect factors of CH4 emissions in single-family
   treatment wetlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Single-family treatment wetland (SFTW) is increasingly used in
   developing countries to treat rural domestic sewage. But they can emit
   CH4, which will affect the global carbon balance. However, a detailed
   understanding of CH4 emissions in SFTW under long-term real operating
   conditions is still lacking. To understand the emission characteristics
   of CH4 from SFTW, a 50-month CH4 flux measurement was conducted in six
   SFTWs (namely ZHANG, HU, LUO, WEEC, WANG, GAO) of Anlong village,
   Chengdu, China. The results show that the monthly fluxes of CH4 ranged
   from-81.35 to 223.13 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1, with an average
   value of 37.41 +/- 60.97 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1. Generally,
   CH4 emissions were higher in spring and summer than other seasons (p <
   0.05). Besides, the mean annual CH4 flux of 2016 had a significant
   increase compared to 2014 and 2015 in SFTW (p < 0.05). On the other
   hand, the mean CH4 fluxes from HU (P < 0.05) and WEEC were lower in the
   influent tank than in the effluent tank. Moreover, precipitation, air
   temperature, and sunshine duration were three key factors of CH4
   emissions from SFTW. Illumina sequencing shows that Methanoregula and
   Methanobacterium were dominant methanogenic populations in SFTW
   (accounting for 96.97\%), and were both hydrogenotrophic archaea. A high
   level of CH4 global warming potential (GWP) was found in SFTW, with an
   average value of 9.63 kg center dot CO2-eq center dot m- 2 center dot
   year- 1. WANG wetland was the most environmentally friendly SFTW, acted
   as a ``carbon sink{''} of CH4 from 2013 to 2016. This study provides a
   foundational reference for future research on CH4 emission reduction in
   constructed wetlands (CWs).},

Title = {On predicting of some consequences of planned dam construction in a
   pristine sand-gravel river large catchment: Rio San Pedro, Nayarit,
   Northwest Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The pressure on water and energy resources is increasing globally,
   particularly in emerging countries. Some of them use their rivers for
   electric power generation, paying little or no attention to the
   hydromorphological changes generated in the rivers due to the
   infrastructure associated. One case is the St. Pedro River in the
   Northwest of Mexico (Rio San Pedro), where it is planned to build a
   hydroelectric dam. The importance is due to its flow discharges directly
   to a marsh system called Marismas Nacionales, considered a Biosphere
   Reserve that includes approximately 20\% of all mangroves in Mexico. The
   alteration of its natural conditions is a critical issue for the
   ecosystem. There are many studies about the effects of dams on rivers
   after their construction, but only a few related to the river
   characterization before intervention within its channel. In this work,
   we highlight the relevance of the latter. We conducted extensive
   fieldwork, including morphological survey, sediment transport
   measurement, hydrodynamics, and bathymetry over 80 km of the river. We
   establish a baseline with the hydromorphological parameters in the river
   and run a numerical simulation with 2-D HEC-RAS 6.1 model to compare
   natural and controlled runoff. The goal of our study was to discuss
   possible scenarios and some consequences that could be generated with
   the dam construction-alterations in the lower basin- and suggest actions
   that can help to minimize the detrimental consequences. The novelty of
   our work is the scope of fieldwork, the wide range of the data, careful
   modeling based on detailed field data, and finally, the possible way one
   might use our results in the future to minimize the adverse consequences
   of dam construction. The methodology presented can be used as a guide to
   other dam projects worldwide, which face all these issues and need to
   redesign the dam and consider modern techniques to preserve the riverine
   conditions close to the more natural possible.},

Title = {Optimization schemes to significantly improve the upstream migration of
   fish: A case study in the lower Yangtze River basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction of fish passage facilities is a promising approach to
   balance fish conservation and water resource development by improving
   river connectivity. To be successful, a fishway must efficiently attract
   fish to its entrance and have an interior flow field that meets the
   needs of migrating fish. In this paper, methods were explored to improve
   the efficiency of fishway passages by optimizing the flow field near the
   fishway entrance and the flow field inside the fishway in a case study
   at the Niuling Reservoir in the lower Yangtze River basin. The original
   engineering design was modified by designing a unique retaining wall
   with a notch to shape the appropriate flow pattern near the fishway
   entrance. The new wall optimized the flow field near the fish entrance
   to meet the hydraulic demands of target fishes under three operating
   scenarios, and the area of the suitable velocity zone increased by
   48.79\%, 12.71\%, and 4.06\% in scenarios 1 through 3, respectively. The
   original vertical slot fishway was modified with a sill to optimize the
   flow field inside the fishway. The optimized fishway design scheme
   reduced the main flow velocity inside the fishway to a large extent, and
   the maximum flow ve-locity in the upstream and downstream sections of
   the fishway decreased by 0.10 m/s and 0.09 m/s on average, respectively.
   The results of this study provide an important reference for the
   construction and optimization of fish passage facilities and have great
   significance for fish migration and biological diversity.},

Title = {The assessment of ecological restoration effects on Beijing-Tianjin
   Sandstorm Source Control Project area during 2000-2019},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To halt the trend of desertification and improve the ecological
   environment in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas, China establishes
   the ecological engineering of Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control
   Project. The assessment of ecological restoration after the
   implementation of ecological engineering is conducive to the ensuing
   management of ecological engineering. Based on a large number of remote
   sensing data and calculation models, this study selected land use/cover,
   vegetation ecological quality indicators such as vegetation coverage and
   NPP, and other ecological service indicators such as water retention
   calculated by the InVEST model, soil retention by the RUSLE model, and
   sand fixing services by RWEQ model to comprehensively assess the degree
   of restoration and trend of ecological engineering implementation. The
   contributions of climate change and human activities to NPP and soil
   retention services are also assessed. We found that from 2000 to 2019,
   the land cover pattern is optimized, with desert and farmland turning to
   grassland and forest. The vegetation ecological quality has been
   improved, sand-fixing service have been significantly improved, and
   water retention and soil retention service are degraded in some areas.
   The areas with a high-degree restoration are mainly located in the water
   source protection areas in the Yanshan mountainous region and in some
   areas in the south-eastern Horqin Sandy Land, while the areas with a
   low-degree restoration are mainly located in the desert grassland. The
   ecological improvement areas are mainly distributed in the mountains in
   norther Shanxi Province, the water source pro-tection area in the
   Yanshan mountainous region, the Southern Great Hinggnan Mountains and
   part of the agro-pastoral transitional grassland. The highly degraded
   areas are mainly concentrated in the middle of Horqin and Otindag Sandy
   Lands. Ecological engineering plays an important role in promoting
   ecological restoration by changing land use types. The contribution
   proportion of climate change to NPP and soil retention services are
   significantly higher than those of human activities. The degree of
   ecological restoration depends on the climax ecological background
   determined by the climate.},

Abstract = {In this study, adsorption and incubation experiments were conducted to
   assess the capacity of LMB to adsorb phosphorous (P) and tungsten (W).
   The results of the adsorption experiment indicated that the mechanisms
   of P adsorption by LMB was chemisorption mechanism and the mechanisms of
   W adsorption by LMB were the pre-cipitation and ligand exchange,
   respectively. The results of the incubation experiment showed that the
   decreasing rates of sediment SRP and soluble W were 91\% and 65\%,
   respectively. The analysis of P and W fractionation indicated that the
   LMB capping can promote the transformation of P and W into HCl-P and
   amorphous and poorly-crystalline(oxyhydr)oxides-bound W, respectively.
   Iron (Fe) absorbed by LMB plays an important role in controlling P and W
   release from sediment, in particular in W release, while manganese (Mn)
   plays a less important role than Fe in controlling internal P and W
   release from sediment treated by LMB. The results indicated that the use
   of LMB can simultaneously control P and W release from sediment.},

Title = {Exploring the impact of landscape changes on runoff under climate change
   and urban development: Implications for landscape ecological engineering
   in the Yangmei River Basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The increase in impervious surfaces caused by urbanization and the
   frequency of precipitation events resulting from climate change
   significantly impact the hydrological and geomorphological processes of
   urban watersheds. Landscape changes caused by urban development may
   affect surface/groundwater generation and circulation processes.
   In-depth research on the relationship between landscape changes and
   runoff is a precondition of urban watershed restoration and stormwater
   management. Taking the Yangmei River Basin as the study area, the storm
   water management model (SWMM), landscape index, correlation analysis,
   and the random forest importance measure were integrated to simulate the
   runoff process under urban development and climate change scenarios and
   analyze the direction and contribution of landscape composition and
   configuration to runoff changes. Results indicated that the runoff
   change rate relative to the reference period under the RCP 4.5 and RCP
   8.5 scenarios gradually decreased as the return period increased.
   Landscape composition and configuration were significantly correlated
   with runoff change. Specifically, woodland could reduce runoff, while
   farmland and water bodies positively impacted runoff changes. The higher
   fragmented landscape pattern was likely to have altered the runoff,
   while landscape patterns of a larger size, higher concentrations, and a
   declining richness typically reduced runoff. The random forest
   importance evaluation demonstrated the significant contributions of
   Patch Density, Shannon's Diversity Index, and Large Path Index to
   runoff. By exploring the potential relationship between landscape
   changes and runoff, urban planners can better understand the runoff
   process and find feasible ecological landscape optimization schemes,
   thus strengthening the sustainable management of water resources and
   enhancing the resilience of cities to climate change.},

Title = {Stream restoration and ecosystem functioning in lowland streams},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Restoration has been increasingly applied over the last decades as a way
   to improve the ecological conditions in stream ecosystems, but
   documentation of the impact of restoration on ecosystem functions is
   sparse. Here, we applied a space-for-time approach to explore effects of
   stream restoration on metabolism and organic matter decomposition in
   lowland agricultural streams. We included stream reaches that were
   restored >10 years ago and compared ecosystem functioning in these
   streams with those in channelized and naturally meandering stream
   reaches from the same geographical region. Specifically, we tested the
   following hypotheses: 1) rates of stream metabolism (gross primary
   production, GPP, and ecosystem respiration, ER) and organic matter
   decomposition in restored reaches resemble rates in naturally meandering
   reaches more than rates in channelized stream reaches and 2) higher
   resemblance in ecosystem metabolism and organic matter decomposition
   between restored reaches and meandering reaches can be attributed to the
   improved physical habitat conditions in the restored stream reaches.
   Overall, we did not find that stream metabolism or organic matter
   decomposition differed among restored, channelized and naturally
   meandering stream reaches even though habitat conditions differed among
   the three stream types. Instead, we found a large variation in ecosystem
   function characteristics across all sites. When analyzing all stream
   types combined, we found that GPP increased with increasing plant
   coverage and that ER increased with increasing stream size and with the
   coverage of coarse substratum on the stream bottom. Organic matter
   decomposition, on the other hand, only slightly increased with the
   number of plant species and declined with increasing concentrations of
   nutrients. Overall, our findings suggest that physical habitat
   improvements in restored stream reaches can affect ecosystem functions,
   but also that the restoration outcome is context-dependent since many of
   the physical characteristics playing a role for the measured functions
   were only to some extent affected by the restoration and/or clouded by
   interference with factors operating at a larger-scale.},

Abstract = {The effect of the anticyclonic eddy on the morphological structure,
   abundance (NB) and biomass of bacterioplankton (BB) in the deep
   phytoplankton maximum (DPM) was experimentally studied on natural
   phytoplankton in the Black Sea. Characteristic processes were simulated:
   the death of phytoplankton as a result of deepening DPM below the photic
   zone and a simultaneous increase in nutrient concentrations. In the
   experiment, primary production was terminated. Two cases were simulated:
   Regular and Deep DPM sinking with medium to high daily nutrient
   additions. Deep and Regular cases showed similar dynamics without
   significant differences. The NB increased during the first 4 days by 3.5
   times to the maximum of 1.12 x 10(6) ml(-1) cells. BB increased by 11.8
   times to 42.5 mg C m(-3). At the same time, the bacterial morphological
   structure changed towards the dominance of large rods in the BB (up to
   100\%), resembling copiotrophic bacteria. The sharp increase in BB
   cannot be explained by utilizing the organic matter released from dead
   eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass since it was low (4.0 mg C m(-3)). We
   assume that the enrichment of the environment with biogenic elements
   resulting from anticyclonic deepening can promote the development of
   large, fast-growing copiotrophic forms of bacteria. This growth can be
   achieved through a more complete use of the already available labile
   organic matter rather than the new one released from the dying DPM.},

Title = {Effect of carbon dosing on denitrification in an aerated horizontal
   subsurface flow constructed wetland used for effluent polishing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aerated wetlands (AW) are normally used for high oxygen demand
   situations and were proven optimal for nitrification. However,
   denitrification remains a concern in AWs especially due to unfavorable
   oxygen concen-trations and lack of biodegradable organic matter (OM). In
   this study, a 350 m2 aerated horizontal subsurface flow constructed
   wetland (HSSF CW) treating the effluent of a municipal wastewater
   treatment plant, was tested in a high hydraulic loading rate situation
   (0.69 m3.m- 2.d-1, 12 h hydraulic retention time), in combination with
   external carbon dosing to promote denitrification. Forced bed aeration
   (FBATM) allowed to independently aerate three equally sized zones along
   the flow direction, and was controlled by a Dissolved Oxygen (DO) sensor
   in each zone. Zone 1 was destined for nitrification (DO = 2-3
   mg.O2.L-1), zone 2 for denitrification (no aeration) with the addition
   of a carbon source (Brenntaplus VP-1), and zone 3 was again aerated (DO
   = 2-3 mg.O2.L-1) to degrade any residual OM. Four different carbon
   dosages (COD/N 0, 2.0, 3.5 and 4.0) were applied at the start of zone 2,
   based on online measured nitrate data. The results revealed that
   nitrification remained optimal (+/- 100\%) throughout the experiment
   despite the lower water temperature (10-15 degrees C). Total nitrogen
   (TN) removal increased from 23 to 59\% as the COD/N ratio increased from
   0 to 4. However, the COD removal efficiency remained moderate during
   initial dosing (21 and 18\% for COD/N = 0 and 2, respectively) and
   further decreased with higher carbon dosing (no removal for COD/N =
   4.0). The outcomes of this study can be helpful for implementing carbon
   dosing to enhance nitrate removal in full-scale AWs used for tertiary
   treatment.},

Title = {Functional diversity and redundancy of amphibians, ants, and dung
   beetles in passive and active cloud forest restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Forest restoration practices have increased globally, with positive
   consequences for biodiversity conservation. However, our understanding
   of the variation in ecosystem functioning recovery presented among
   different restoration strategies remains limited, and few studies have
   compared the functional diversity of contrasting faunal assemblages.
   Here, we assessed how the functional diversities and functional
   redundancies of amphibian, ant, and dung beetle assemblages vary among
   forests of the same age (23 years) under active (native mixed
   plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) restoration, cattle
   pasture (degraded ecosystem), and mature cloud forest (reference
   ecosystem). We also explored how environmental variables relate to the
   functional diversity of each animal assemblage. We found that functional
   diversity (measured as functional richness, functional evenness, and
   functional divergence) and functional redundancy in the three faunal
   assemblages were similar between the two restoration strategies.
   However, some attributes of functional diversity did not reach the
   values of the reference ecosystem, especially in the amphibians and dung
   beetles. Environmental variables related to functional diversity also
   depended on the taxonomic group and the metric of functional diversity,
   but the most important of these variables were vegetation condition,
   canopy cover and tree density. In our study system, passive and active
   restoration produced similar recovery rates of functional diversity of
   the faunal assemblages. Regardless of the restoration strategy
   implemented, long-term adaptive management strategies must be
   implemented to ensure full recovery of biodiversity and functionality in
   Neotropical cloud forest landscapes.},

Title = {Effect of aeration on nitrogen removal-associated microbial community in
   an innovative vertical cork-based constructed wetland for winery

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The wine industry produces large quantities of wastewater that often
   contains high levels of organic matter and nutrients, like nitrogen and
   phosphorous. In particular, nitrogen pollution can be harmful, even at
   low levels, since infants are vulnerable to nitrates in drinking water,
   and excess nitrogen can harm the health of soils and waterways. Herein,
   an innovative compact, modular, and mobile treatment wetland (TW) using
   cork by product as the only granular media was used to treat the final
   effluents from the Codorniu winery (Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, Spain). The TW
   was operated during two 5-month periods with or without intermittent
   induced aeration (40 min cycles, 90 L/min air flow rate). Nitrate
   (N-NO3) and total nitrogen (TN) removal were higher (52.8\% and 46.8\%,
   respectively, p < 0.05) during TW operation under aerated-condition.
   Additionally, qPCR analysis of 16S rRNA, nirS and nosZ genes revealed
   that intermittent induced aeration facilitates N-NO3 reduction by the
   stimulation of denitrifying bacteria in the TW biofilm (11.4\% increase
   in nirS copies number/g cork sample, p < 0.05) as well as increasing the
   number of heterotrophic bacteria adhered to cork (25.5\% increase in 16S
   rRNA copies number/g cork sample, p < 0.05). Moreover, SEM images
   demonstrated the suitability of cork as a resistant filter media for TW
   after long-term system operation (1.5 years). In conclusion, our results
   suggest that aeration improved ni-trogen compounds removal compared to
   the non-aerated period, without affecting phosphorous elimination.
   Additionally, residual cork is presented here in a circular bioeconomy
   view, as a suitable filling media to treat winery wastewater that can
   provide additional carbon source to increase C/N rate stimulating
   denitrification, as well as a reliable organic substrate for biomass
   growth.},

Abstract = {An assessment of the bioturbation potential of seven freshwater snail
   species was made in a laboratory microcosm study. Two non-operculate
   species, Indoplanorbis exustus, and Racesina luteola and five operculate
   species, namely Pila globosa, Filopaludina bengalensis, Gabbia orcula,
   Melanoides tuberculata, and Brotia costula were considered for the
   experiment extending for a period of 28-days. Grazing, burrowing and
   bulldozing activities of snails on sediments bed induced changes in
   physicochemical properties of substratum and modulated the organic
   mineralization process. All seven snail species increased NH4+-N and
   PO43--P flux from sediment to overlying water in comparison with the
   control. Moreover, in snail presence modulated NOX- (NO2- -N + NO3- -N)
   concentrations and other parameters (DO, pH, TDS, conductivity) to the
   column water. Snail activity induced changes in physicochemical
   properties (TN, AP, OC, porosity and WHC) of sediment and modulated the
   organic mineralization process based on the length of the snails. The
   sediment texture was changed, more prominently in presence of the
   operculate snails than the non-operculate snails. Apparently, the
   operculate benthic snail F. bengalensis induced greater changes in the
   sediment in comparison to other snails. Nonetheless, all the snails
   appear to be efficient engineers in the management and habitat
   manipulation of the freshwater ecosystems.},

Title = {Capability of HYDRUS wetland module to simulate flow and nitrogen
   removal processes in pilot-scale treatment peatlands under frost and
   no-frost conditions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The HYDRUS wetland module is widely used together with the biokinetic
   model CWM1 to simulate reactive transport of contaminants in constructed
   wetlands. However, this approach has not been used previously to
   simulate processes in peat-based wetlands operating in cold climates and
   treating mining-influenced water. In this study, the goal was to clarify
   changes in flow, transport, and nitrogen removal processes in cold
   climate treatment peatlands by assessing the performance of HYDRUS-CWM1.
   Flow and non-reactive transport of tracer, and reactive transport of
   ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, in two pilot wetlands operated under
   controlled conditions representing frozen (winter) and frost-free
   (summer) periods were simulated. Model simulation outputs were compared
   against data obtained from the pilot wetlands and from a full-scale
   treatment peatland treating mining-influenced water in an Arctic region.
   Initial peaks in tracer concentration were simulated satisfactorily, but
   transformation and transport of nitrogen species in treatment peatlands,
   especially under partially frozen conditions, were modeled with only
   limited success. Limitations of the model and the assumptions made for
   the simulations have been discussed to highlight the challenges in
   modeling of treatment peatlands.},

Title = {Challenges and avenues for acid mine drainage treatment, beneficiation,
   and valorisation in circular economy: A review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mining activities are notorious for their environmental impact, with
   acid mine drainage (AMD) being among the most significant issues.
   Specifically, AMD has recently been a topical issue of prime concern,
   primarily due to the magnitude of its environmental, ecotoxicological,
   and socioeconomic impacts. AMD originates from both active and abandoned
   mines (primarily gold and coal) and is encountered in Canada, China,
   Russia, South Africa, USA, and other countries with strong mining
   industry. Owing to its acidity, AMD contains elevated levels of
   dissolved (toxic) metals, metalloids, rare-earth elements,
   radionuclides, and sulfates. Practical and cost-effective solutions to
   prevent its formation are still pending, while for its treatment active
   (driven by frequent input of chemicals and energy) or passive (based on
   oxidation/reduction) technologies are typically employed with the first
   being more efficient in contaminants removal, however, at the expense of
   process complexity, cost, and materials and energy consumption. More
   recently, and under the circular economy concept, hybrid (combination of
   active and passive technologies) and particularly integrated (sequential
   or stepwise treatment) systems have been explored for AMD beneficiation
   and valorisation. These systems are costly to install and operate but
   are cleaner production systems since they can effectively prevent
   pollution and can be used for closed-loop and sustainable AMD management
   (e.g., zero liquid discharge (ZLD) systems). Herein, the body of
   knowledge on AMD treatment, beneficiation (metals/minerals recovery),
   valorisation (water reclamation), and life cycle assessment (LCA) is
   comprehensively reviewed and discussed, with focus placed on circular
   economy. Future research directions to introduce reuse, recycle, and
   resource recovery paradigms in wastewater treatment and to inspire
   innovation in valorising this toxic and hazardous effluent are also
   provided. Overall, AMD beneficiation and valorisation appears promising
   since the reclaimed water and the recovered minerals/metals could offset
   treatment costs and environmental impacts. However, the main challenges
   include high-cost, complexity, co-contamination in the recovered
   minerals, and the generation of a higly heterogeneous and mineralised
   sludge.},

Title = {Performance assessment of a soil and water bioengineering work on the
   basis of the flora development and its associated ecosystem processes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest of Brazil is one of the world's 25 biodiversity
   hotspots, but floodplains in this region are continuously converted into
   agricultural or urban areas, and riverine ecosystems are affected by
   anthropogenic interventions. Soil and water bioengineering techniques
   are a component of ecological engineering that can provide nature-based
   solutions as an alternative or as complementary measures to conventional
   hydraulic or civil engineering approaches. However, there is a lack of
   post-evaluation of interventions and there are still great difficulties
   in identifying valid evaluation criteria and measurement variables,
   especially in countries like Brazil where soil and water bioengineering
   measures have only been implemented in the last decade. Another
   limitation to the widespread application of the techniques is the lack
   of knowledge about their technical performance, their impact on
   ecological processes and the evolution of the species used. This study
   aims to investigate the development of species, evaluate the technical
   performance of the intervention and assess the ecological benefits and
   processes of one of the first soil and water bioengineering riparian
   restoration interventions in Brazil, which was carried out in 2010 on
   the Pardinho river. Parameters on bank stability, development of species
   used in different construction techniques and its ecological benefits
   and ecological processes (plant species and soil fauna richness and
   diversity, ecological group and recruitment species, invasive species,
   soil organic matter and soil temperature) were collected over a period
   of ten years. The study proved that soil and water bioengineering works
   can both stabilise and control erosion, and at the same time initiate
   ecological processes on degraded riverbanks. The active introduction of
   native species has promoted vegetation succession, increased the
   biodiversity of both plants and soil fauna on the site and improved the
   site conditions. The establishment of native vegetation led to sediment
   and organic material deposition, which changed the local ecological
   conditions (e.g., soil properties, light, flow conditions) and thus
   facilitated rapid establishment of other plants and re-established
   interactions between plants and soil fauna groups. This study provides a
   monitoring approach which examines the technical performance of the
   measures and species used, as well as their impact on the ecological
   process over time, which is essential for establishing soil and water
   bioengineering techniques as the standard in the field of river
   engineering in Brazil. Furthermore, the results obtained will help in
   planning and designing future works in the field of soil and water
   bioengineering in Brazil, adding to the knowledge of the techniques and
   species to be selected, as well as supporting the evaluation of the
   success of interventions.},

Title = {Performance and ecological impacts of benthic barriers for the control
   of an invasive plant in a small urban lake},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Yellow Floating Heart (YFH), Nymphoides peltata, is a rooted aquatic
   plant that is not native to North America, and can quickly establish
   nuisance populations in shallow lakes, rivers, and wetlands. There are
   few documented methods for effectively eradiating or controlling YFH.
   Little Albro Lake is a small (3 ha), shallow (< 5 m deep) meso-eutrophic
   lake in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada that experiences an annual YFH
   infestation covering > 50\% of the lake during the growing season. A
   pilot study was conducted during the 2021 growing season to: (i) assess
   the feasibility of using benthic barriers to control YFH growth, and
   (ii) investigate the potential impacts of benthic barriers on ecosystem
   components. Two commercially available benthic barriers (Aquascreen, a
   permeable barrier, and Lake Bottom Blanket, an impermeable barrier) were
   tested in shallow (1 m water depth) and deep (3 m water depth) areas of
   the lake. A total of 18 test plots (6 permeable, 6 impermeable, 6
   control), each measuring 3 m x 3 m, were established in early May 2021,
   and monitored throughout the growing season (May-September). Both types
   of barriers were effective in reducing YFH growth, with barriered plots
   possessing significantly less YFH coverage than control plots.
   Inspection of the permeable barriers after their removal from the lake,
   however, revealed that YFH had been able to grow through this type of
   barrier material. Several maintenance issues were also noted with both
   barriers including: (i) gas build-up under the barriers, which caused
   billowing, and (ii) an accumulation of sediment on top of the barriers
   and growth of YFH through these sediment layers. Both issues would need
   to be managed during a full-scale benthic barrier application program.
   An environmental effects monitoring program was also undertaken to
   understand the lake ecosystem and im-pacts of the barriers on the
   chemical and biological properties of the lakebed. The barriers had
   measurable impacts on the lakebed and generated lower oxidation
   reduction potential (ORP) in sediments, as compared to control plots
   with no barriers. Reduced ORP in lake sediments could facilitate the
   mobilization of redox-sensitive metals, such as arsenic and iron. There
   were only minor differences in benthic macroinvertebrate populations
   when comparing barriered and control plots. The bacterial
   alpha-diversity of the lakebed sediment was shown to differ by depth,
   with the shallow zone having higher observed ASVs and diversity levels.
   However, within the two depth zones, the barriers did not appear to have
   a large impact on bacterial community composition and potential
   functionality. In conclusion, benthic barriers can be used to prevent
   YFH growth, however barrier installations require maintenance and may
   reduce sediment ORP, potentially leading to release of redox-sensitive
   metals and nutrients.},

Title = {The effects of coastal marsh geometry and surge scales on water level
   attenuation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are an effective natural and nature-based feature to
   mitigate coastal flood hazards. While the sheltering and attenuation
   offered by wetlands are recognized, the protection level varies based on
   wetland and storm characteristics. Here we focus on the effects of the
   spatial scales of the coastal wetlands (i.e., channel geometry, marsh
   elevation-gradient) and the temporal scales of storm forcing (i.e.,
   storm surge amplitude and duration) on peak water level attenuation. The
   study was conducted by performing hydrodynamic simulations on an
   idealized marsh geometry. One hundred seventy-one hydrodynamic
   simulations were conducted by varying wetland features under variable
   hydrodynamic forcing. Increased tidal channel area enhances water flow
   across marshes by reducing the capacity of vegetated platforms to resist
   propagation of a storm surge. The level of surge attenuation and channel
   area shows a non-linear relationship. Storm scales also affect surge
   attenuation for a given channel geometry. Higher amplitudes and lower
   surge durations provide greater attenuation of peak water levels. The
   level of attenuation and surge scales also show a non-linear
   correlation. A multivariate scaling relationship was developed that
   successfully integrates the combined effects of channel geometry and
   surge scales on water level attenuation by salt marsh. This research
   provides guidance to engineers and coastal managers on salt marsh's
   flood hazard reduction benefits.},

Title = {Community and population impacts of an introduced meiofauna (Nippoleucon
   hinumensis) upon an intertidal infaunal community and its closest
   endemic analog (Cumella vulgaris)},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-97},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduced species may be one of the penultimate threats facing natural
   systems in the Anthropocene. Unfortunately, some taxa, such as meiofauna
   (organisms that pass through a 1 mm mesh but are retained by a 45 mu m
   mesh), are so challenging to study that the presence and impact of
   introduced meiofauna often goes undetected. Further, the impacts of
   introduced species are seldom placed into context with other structuring
   variables. Therefore, we used infaunal invertebrate communities of
   northern British Columbia, Canada, to quantify potential impacts of the
   introduced Cumacea Nippoleucon hinumensis upon the infaunal community
   and its closest endemic analog, Cumella vulgaris. We also compared the
   relative importance of this introduced species to other top-down
   (predation), bottom-up (competition), middle-out
   (predation/competition), and abiotic (tolerance) variables in
   structuring the infaunal community. We identified a significant negative
   correlation between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris, suggesting that when
   placed in context with other structuring factors, the introduced species
   may have a minor, but detectable impact upon C. vulgaris populations.
   However, no relationship was observed between N. hinumensis and the
   infaunal community. The lack of a community-wide effect is potentially
   the result of the similarity between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris life
   history strategies, enabling the introduced species to effectively
   replace C. vulgaris in the food web. As such, N. hinumensis may be best
   described as an invasive species, and not as merely non-native.
   Furthermore, the analytical techniques used here can be applied to other
   ecological systems to quantify and compare the impact of introduced
   species against other structuring forces.},

Abstract = {Thirst emerges from a range of cellular changes that ultimately motivate
   an animal to consume water. Although thirst-responsive neuronal signals
   have been reported, the full complement of brain responses is unclear.
   Here, we identify molecular and cellular adaptations in the brain using
   single-cell sequencing of wa-ter-deprived Drosophila. Water deficiency
   primarily altered the glial transcriptome. Screening the regulated genes
   revealed astrocytic expression of the astray-encoded phosphoserine
   phosphatase to bi-directionally regulate water consumption. Astray
   synthesizes the gliotransmitter D-serine, and vesicular release from
   as-trocytes is required for drinking. Moreover, dietary D-serine rescues
   aay-dependent drinking deficits while facilitating water consumption and
   expression of water-seeking memory. D-serine action requires binding to
   neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Fly astrocytes contribute
   processes to tripartite synapses, and the proportion of astrocytes that
   are themselves activated by glutamate increases with water depriva-tion.
   We propose that thirst elevates astrocytic D-serine release, which
   awakens quiescent glutamatergic circuits to enhance water procurement.},

Title = {Dredge-material created coastal marshes are more effective at improving
   water quality than natural marshes in early-stage development},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal regions around the globe are experiencing land loss due to
   rising sea level. Some of the largest rates can be found in deltaic
   Louisiana, USA. Beneficial reuse of dredged sediments to create coastal
   marshes is one major effort in helping to reverse this land loss. In
   2014, the Lake Hermitage Marsh Creation Project created 29 ha of marsh
   by dredging sand from the bed of the lower Mississippi River. The goal
   of this study was to determine the ability of these newly created
   mineral soil marshes to improve water quality. The natural marsh had 8.2
   times greater organic matter content than the created marsh, on average.
   Under aerobic water column conditions, the mean denitrification rate of
   the natural marsh was 24.5 +/- 3.53 mg NO3-N m2 d-1 while the mean
   denitrification rate of the two created marshes was significantly
   greater at 63.19 +/- 3.44 mg NO3-N m2 d-1. This difference in rates is a
   result of internal N loading from the highly organic natural marsh soil,
   which had 3.7 times more extractable ammonium than the created marsh. As
   organic matter increases in the created marsh soil, the N removal
   efficiency may decline over time. This difference in efficiency has
   important implications not only for coastal restoration projects but
   also for created wetlands, which accrete significant organic matter over
   time and may lead to reduced efficiency of N removal, driven by internal
   N loading from soil.},

Title = {Interactions of treated municipal wastewater with native plant species},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Potentially, the restoration of native ecosystems could be combined with
   the land application of treated municipal wastewater (TMW), reducing TMW
   discharge into waterbodies. High levels of nutrients, pathogens, and
   other contaminants from TMW can degrade water quality. The land
   application of TMW onto native vegetation reduces the nutrient load in
   water bodies and may create zones of ecological value. However,
   establishing native plants may be challenging if the species are not
   adapted to highly fertile environments, such as those resulting from TMW
   irrigation. There is a critical knowledge gap about the response of
   native plant species to irrigation with TMW. We aimed to determine the
   distribution and speciation of nutrients in the soil-plant system
   following application of TMW onto 11 species of native plants in a
   long-term field trial on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand (NZ). TMW was
   irrigated at a rate of 1000 mm per annum, equivalent to N, and P loading
   rates of 194 and 110 kg ha yr(-1), respectively. We determined
   physicochemical properties from soil profiles (0-65 cm) under selected
   species as well as the growth and chemical composition of the plants.
   Despite the site receiving 950 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of Na, there was no
   evidence of impaired soil structure following TMW irrigation. Nitrogen
   did not accumulate in the soil, and it is likely to have been taken up
   by plants or lost through denitrification and nitrate leaching. The
   accumulation rate of P indicated that soil P concentrations will remain
   within the range found in NZ agricultural soils for at least 50 years.
   TMW irrigation increased plant height by 10\% compared to the control
   after 3.5 years of growth. Plant species significantly affected the
   concentrations of total C, total N, nitrate (NO3-), and Na in the soil.
   TMW application had negligible effects on the elemental composition of
   plant foliage. NZ native vegetation can facilitate the land application
   of TMW. Future work should elucidate the maximum rates that can be
   applied as well as the effect of TMW on the soil microbiota.},

Title = {Multiphase processes of seed dispersals via masked palm civets as a
   non-native species in cool-temperate forests of northern Japan},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},

Abstract = {The disappearance of large seed dispersers such as primates increases
   the dependence of endozoochorous plants bearing large fruits on
   frugivorous mesocarnivores for seed dispersal. Ecosystems in northern
   Japan are typical examples wherein the distribution and abundance of
   large-sized dispersers (i.e., Macaca fuscata and Ursus thi-betanus) have
   been constrained mainly owing to past anthropogenic disturbances.
   Moreover, the distribution of several native mesocarnivores has been
   fragmented, although masked palm civet, Paguma larvata, a non-native
   frugivorous mesocarnivore, has expanded its distribution over the past
   quarter-century. Here, we evaluated the roles of this non-native species
   in defaunated cool-temperate forests by assessing primary and secondary
   seed dispersal via civets. To assess the primary dispersal process, we
   identified their possible latrines, where seeds were initially
   dispersed, by tracking radio-tagged civets. We then compiled an
   inventory of seeds transported by civets combining the results of the
   fecal analysis performed in this study and a literature survey for seeds
   known to be transported by civets. To explore secondary seed dispersals,
   we first determined the ability of civet feces to attract dung beetles
   using pitfall traps and then compared this ability of civet feces with
   that of the feces of raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, a native
   mesocarnivore. Our findings showed that (1) over 90\% of the civet
   latrines confirmed within forested areas with flat terrain, safe sites
   for germination and establishment of common plant seeds, and carried
   seeds of 20 plant species; (2) the civet feces were more strongly
   preferred by dung beetles than raccoon dog feces; and (3) the abundance
   of large tunneler beetles with superior seed burial ability using the
   civet feces was 3.7 times as high as that of raccoon dog feces. Thus,
   these findings suggest that this non-native mesocarnivore could recover
   functional redundancy by offsetting injured endozoochorous processes.},

Title = {Mushroom body input connections form independently of sensory activity

Abstract = {Associative brain centers, such as the insect mushroom body, need to
   represent sensory information in an efficient manner. In Drosophila
   melanogaster, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body integrate inputs
   from a random set of olfactory projection neurons, but some projection
   neurons-namely those activated by a few ethologically meaningful
   odors-connect to Kenyon cells more frequently than others. This biased
   and random connectivity pattern is conceivably advantageous, as it
   enables the mushroom body to repre-sent a large number of odors as
   unique activity patterns while prioritizing the representation of a few
   specific odors. How this connectivity pattern is established remains
   largely unknown. Here, we test whether the mechanisms patterning the
   connections between Kenyon cells and projection neurons depend on
   sensory activity or whether they are hardwired. We mapped a large number
   of mushroom body input connections in partially anosmic flies-flies
   lacking the obligate odorant co-receptor Orco-and in wild-type flies.
   Statis-tical analyses of these datasets reveal that the random and
   biased connectivity pattern observed between Kenyon cells and projection
   neurons forms normally in the absence of most olfactory sensory
   activity. This finding supports the idea that even comparatively subtle,
   population-level patterns of neuronal connec-tivity can be encoded by
   fixed genetic programs and are likely to be the result of evolved
   prioritization of ecologically and ethologically salient stimuli.},

Title = {Recording and manipulation of the maternal oxytocin neural activities in

Abstract = {Pulsatile release of the hormone oxytocin (OT) mediates uterine
   contraction during parturition and milk ejection during lactation.1-3
   These pulses are generated by the unique activity patterns of the
   central neuro-endocrine OT neurons located in the paraventricular and
   supraoptic hypothalamus. Classical studies have characterized putative
   OT neurons by in vivo extracellular recording techniques in rats and
   rabbits.1,4-10 Due to technical limitations, however, the identity of OT
   neurons in these previous studies was speculative based on their
   electrophysiological characteristics and axonal projection to the
   posterior pituitary, not on OT gene expression. To pinpoint OT neural
   activities among other hypothalamic neurons that project to the
   pituitary11,12 and make better use of cell-type-specific neuroscience
   toolkits,13 a mouse model needs to be developed for the studies of
   parturition and lactation. We herein introduce viral genetic approaches
   in mice to characterize the maternal activities of OT neurons by fiber
   photometry. A sharp photometric peak of OT neurons appeared at
   approximately 520 s following simultaneous suckling stimuli from three
   pups. The amplitude of the peaks increased as the mother mice
   experienced lactation, irrespective of the age of the pups, suggesting
   the intrinsic plasticity of maternal OT neurons. Based on a
   mono-synaptic input map to OT neurons, we pharmacogenetically activated
   the inhibitory neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and
   found the suppression of the activities of OT neurons. Collectively, our
   study illuminates tem-poral dynamics in the maternal neural activities
   of OT neurons and identifies one of its modulatory inputs.},

Abstract = {The mosquito proboscis is an efficient microelectromechanical system,
   which allows the insect to feed on vertebrate blood quickly and
   painlessly. Its efficiency is further enhanced by the insect saliva,
   although through unclear mechanisms. Here, we describe the initial
   trigger of an unprecedented feedback signaling pathway in Aedes
   mosquitoes affecting feeding behavior. We identified LIPS proteins in
   the saliva of Aedes mosquitoes that promote feeding in the vertebrate
   skin. LIPS show a new all-helical protein fold constituted by two
   domains. The N-terminal domain interacts with a cuticular protein (Cp19)
   located at the tip of the mosquito labrum. Upon interaction, the
   morphology of the labral cuticle changes, and this modification is most
   likely sensed by proprioceptive neurons. Our study identifies an
   additional role of mosquito saliva and underlines that the external
   cuticle is a possible site of key molecular interactions affecting the
   insect biology and its vector competence.},

Abstract = {Sweet and bitter compounds excite different sensory cells and drive
   opposing behaviors. However, it remains unclear how sweet and bitter
   tastes are represented by the neural circuits linking sensation to
   behavior. To investigate this question in Drosophila, we devised
   trans-Tango(activity), a strategy for calcium imaging of second-order
   gustatory projection neurons based on trans-Tango, a genetic
   transsynaptic tracing technique. We found spatial overlap between the
   projection neuron populations activated by sweet and bitter tastants.
   The spatial representation of bitter tastants in the projection neurons
   was consistent, while that of sweet tastants was heterogeneous.
   Furthermore, we discovered that bitter tastants evoke responses in the
   gustatory receptor neurons and projection neurons upon both stimulus
   onset and offset and that bitter offset and sweet onset excite
   overlapping second-order projections. These findings demonstrate an
   unexpected complexity in the representation of sweet and bitter tastants
   by second-order neurons of the gustatory circuit.},

Title = {The chirality of the mitotic spindle provides a mechanical response to
   forces and depends on microtubule motors and augmin},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2480+},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Forces produced by motor proteins and microtubule dynamics within the
   mitotic spindle are crucial for proper chromosome segregation. In
   addition to linear forces, rotational forces or torques are present in
   the spindle, which are reflected in the left-handed twisted shapes of
   microtubule bundles that make the spindle chiral. However, the
   biological role and molecular origins of spindle chirality are unknown.
   By developing methods for measuring the spindle twist, we show that
   spindles are most chiral near the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. To
   assess the role of chirality in spindle mechanics, we compressed the
   spindles along their axis. This resulted in a stronger left-handed
   twist, suggesting that the twisted shape allows for a mechanical
   response to forces. Inhibition or depletion of motor proteins that
   perform chiral stepping, Eg5/kinesin-5, Kif18A/kinesin-8,
   MKLP1/kinesin-6, and dynein, decreased the left-handed twist or led to
   right-handed twist, implying that these motors regulate the twist by
   rotating microtubules within their antiparallel overlaps or at the
   spindle pole. A right-handed twist was also observed after the depletion
   of the microtubule nucleator augmin, indicating its contribution to the
   twist through the nucleation of antiparallel bridging microtubules. The
   uncovered switch from left-handed to right-handed twist reveals the
   existence of competing mechanisms that promote twisting in opposite
   directions. As round spindles are more twisted than the elongated ones
   are, we infer that bending and twisting moments are generated by similar
   molecular mechanisms and propose a physiological role for spindle
   chirality in allowing the spindle to absorb mechanical load.},

Abstract = {Aims: Individual variation (IV) plays an important role in driving the
   structure and function of plant communities, especially when plants
   growing in heterogeneous soils. However, the joint effects of soil
   heterogeneity and species composition on IV are still unclear. Methods:
   A controlled experiment was done, where four soil heterogeneity levels
   were developed by filling resource-rich and resource-poor substrates in
   pots with different patch sizes (i.e. fine, small, medium and large),
   and seven types of species compositions were derived from all the
   possible combinations of three forage grasses (i.e. Festuca elata,
   Bromus inermis and Elymus breviaristatus). Coefficient of variation (CV)
   of plant height and chlorophyll content were applied to quantify IV.
   Results: CV first increased and then decreased with increasing patch
   size. Moreover, CV in monocultures was on average lower than mixtures.
   Furthermore, patch size and species composition jointly affected IV,
   where B. inermis growing together with E. breviaristatus had relatively
   higher CV of plant height than that in other compositions, while F.
   elata growing together with E. breviaristatus had relative higher CV of
   chlorophyll content than that in other compositions, and both of these
   patterns were found in pots with small patch size. Conclusions: Soil
   heterogeneity and species composition jointly affected individual
   variation of plants. More plant traits such as plant biomass should be
   considered to further explore the effects of soil heterogeneity on
   individual variation. Such results can be applied in the restoration of
   degraded grasslands.},

Title = {Does intraspecific trait variability affect understorey plant community
   assembly?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing evidence points to the major impact of intraspecific
   variability in species characteristics on com-munity assembly.
   Contrasting theories predict that high trait variability might either
   steepening dominance orders or promote diversity. Here, we try to test
   these predictions with understorey plants in a Polish mixed temperate
   forest. We focus on four important traits (leaf dry mass LDW, plant
   height SH, specific leaf area SLA, and number of flowers NF) of the
   small balsam Impatiens parviflora, the dominant species in this forest
   system. We relate trait variability to community species richness and
   abundances, as well as to soil characteristics. Trait variability was
   high irrespective of species richness. Contrary to theory, abundances of
   non -I. parviflora species significantly decreased with increasing
   variance in I. parviflora trait expression. Trait variability did not
   signif-icantly influence species composition and was not significantly
   correlated with soil characteristics. Our results emphasis the need to
   study trait variability in terms of appropriate statistical standards as
   provided by the allometric variance -mean relationship. We argue that an
   individual based study of local trait variability might return important
   insights into the composition and assembly of local communities.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of structural diversity across the boreal forest-tundra
   ecotone in Churchill, Canada},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Vegetation structural diversity, also called structural complexity, has
   great effects on biodiversity and ecological processes, with higher
   biodiversity often observed in areas with higher structural diversity.
   As for other ecological variables, structural diversity is spatially
   heterogeneous. Thus, quantifying its spatial heterogeneity may provide
   clues to the spatial variation in ecological processes. We studied the
   spatial patterns of structural diversity in two different environments,
   tundra and forest-tundra ecotone, near Churchill, MB, Canada. We sampled
   vegetation and quantified five types of structural diversity (ground
   cover, herbaceous plants, woody plants, all live plants, and deadwood)
   along five transects, with lengths of 81-227 m, and used wavelet
   analysis to assess the scales of spatial pattern. We also assessed the
   effects of soil pH, microtopography, elevation, and distance from lakes
   on structural diversity. In general, structural diversity was spatially
   structured on a variety of scales, from 2 to 55 m, with larger scales
   being observed in the tundra than in the ecotone transects. In addition,
   structural diversity in the tundra was generally higher near lakes and
   in areas with a higher pH, whereas in the ecotone it increased mostly
   with increasing pH and microtopographic variation. Spatial heterogeneity
   is an important characteristic of the forest-tundra ecotone and even
   tundra areas that appear homogeneous are structurally diverse at a
   variety of scales.},

Title = {Lateral axonal modulation is required for stimulus-specific olfactory

Abstract = {Effective and stimulus-specific learning is essential for animals'
   survival. Two major mechanisms are known to aid stimulus specificity of
   associative learning. One is accurate stimulus-specific representations
   in neu-rons. The second is a limited effective temporal window for the
   reinforcing signals to induce neuromodulation after sensory stimuli.
   However, these mechanisms are often imperfect in preventing unspecific
   associations; different sensory stimuli can be represented by
   overlapping populations of neurons, and more importantly, the
   reinforcing signals alone can induce neuromodulation even without
   coincident sensory-evoked neuronal activity. Here, we report a crucial
   neuromodulatory mechanism that counteracts both limitations and is
   thereby essential for stimulus specificity of learning. In Drosophila,
   olfactory signals are sparsely represented by cholinergic Kenyon cells
   (KCs), which receive dopaminergic reinforcing input. We find that KCs
   have numerous axo-axonic connections mediated by the muscarinic type-B
   receptor (mAChR-B). By using func-tional imaging and optogenetic
   approaches, we show that these axo-axonic connections suppress both
   odor-evoked calcium responses and dopamine-evoked cAMP signals in
   neighboring KCs. Strikingly, behavior experiments demonstrate that
   mAChR-B knockdown in KCs impairs olfactory learning by inducing
   undesired changes to the valence of an odor that was not associated with
   the reinforcer. Thus, this local neu-romodulation acts in concert with
   sparse sensory representations and global dopaminergic modulation to
   achieve effective and accurate memory formation.},

Title = {Divergent expression of paralogous genes by modification of shared

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3545+},

Abstract = {The duplication of genes and their associated cis-regulatory elements,
   or enhancers, is a key contributor to genome evolution and biological
   complexity. Moreover, many paralogs, particularly tandem duplicates, are
   fixed for long periods of time under the control of shared enhancers.
   However, in most cases, the mechanism by which gene expression and
   function diverge following duplication is not known. Here, we dissect
   the regu-lation and function of the paralogous nubbin/pdm2 genes during
   wing development in Drosophila mela-nogaster. We show that these
   paralogs play a redundant role in the wing and that their expression
   relies on a single shared wing enhancer. However, the two genes differ
   in their ability to respond to this enhancer, with nub responding in all
   wing progenitor cells and pdm2 only in a small subset. This divergence
   is a result of a pdm2-specific silencer element at the pdm2 promoter
   that receives repressive input from the transcription factor Rotund.
   Repression through this silencer also depends on nub, allowing pdm2 to
   fully respond to the wing enhancer when nub expression is perturbed and
   functional compensation to occur. Thus, expression divergence downstream
   of a shared enhancer arises as a consequence of silencing the promoter
   of one paralog.},

Title = {Developmental switch in the function of inhibitory commissural V0d
   interneurons in zebrafish},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3515+},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {During development, all animals undergo major adaptations to accommodate
   behavioral flexibility and diver-sity. How these adaptations are
   reflected in the changes in the motor circuits controlling our behaviors
   remains poorly understood. Here, we show, using a combination of
   techniques applied at larval and adult ze-brafish stages, that the
   pattern-generating V0d inhibitory interneurons within the locomotor
   circuit undergo a developmental switch in their role. In larvae, we show
   that V0d interneurons have a primary function in high-speed motor
   behavior yet are redundant for explorative swimming. By contrast, adult
   V0d interneurons have diversified into speed-dependent subclasses, with
   an overrepresentation of those active at the slowest speeds. The
   ablation of V0d interneurons in adults disrupts slow explorative
   swimming, which is associated with a loss of mid-cycle inhibition onto
   target motoneurons. Thus, we reveal a developmental switch in V0d
   interneuron function from a role in high-speed motor behavior to a
   function in timing and thus coordinating slow explorative locomotion.
   Our study suggests that early motor circuit composition is not
   predictive of the adult system but instead undergoes major functional
   transformations during development.},

Title = {A thermometer circuit for hot temperature behavior to heat},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {18},
Pages = {4079+},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Small poikilotherms such as the fruit fly Drosophila depend on absolute
   temperature measurements to iden-tify external conditions that are above
   (hot) or below (cold) their preferred range and to react accordingly.
   Hot and cold temperatures have a different impact on fly activity and
   sleep, but the circuits and mechanisms that adjust behavior to specific
   thermal conditions are not well understood. Here, we use patch-clamp
   electro-physiology to show that internal thermosensory neurons located
   within the fly head capsule (the AC neu-rons1) function as a thermometer
   active in the hot range. ACs exhibit sustained firing rates that scale
   with ab-solute temperature-but only for temperatures above the fly's
   preferred -25 degrees C (i.e., ``hot{''}temperature). We identify ACs in
   the fly brain connectome and demonstrate that they target a single class
   of circadian neurons, the LPNs.2 LPNs receive excitatory drive from ACs
   and respond robustly to hot stimuli, but their responses do not
   exclusively rely on ACs. Instead, LPNs receive independent drive from
   thermosensory neurons of the fly antenna via a new class of second-order
   projection neurons (TPN-IV). Finally, we show that silencing LPNs blocks
   the restructuring of daytime ``siesta{''}sleep, which normally occurs in
   response to persistent heat. Our previous work described a distinct
   thermometer circuit for cold temperature.3 Together, the results
   demon-strate that the fly nervous system separately encodes and relays
   absolute hot and cold temperature informa-tion, show how patterns of
   sleep and activity can be adapted to specific temperature conditions,
   and illus-trate how persistent drive from sensory pathways can impact
   behavior on extended temporal scales.},

Title = {Are mussels and oysters capable of reducing the abundances of
   Picochlorum sp., responsible for a massive green algae bloom in Thau
   lagoon, France?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {After an exceptional hydroclimatic year, a ``massive green algae bloom
   ``, dominated by the autotrophic picoeukaryote Picochlorum sp, was
   observed in 2018-2019 in the Thau lagoon. Oyster farmers informed
   decision-makers and scientists about an alarming halt to growth, loss of
   flesh weight and abnormal mortality in commercial size oysters, whereas
   mussel farmers observed no adverse effects. Two hypotheses were tested.
   First, Mediterranean mussels are capable of filtering Picochlorum spp.
   whereas Pacific and flat oysters are not. Second, picophytoplankton
   filtration rates vary with the size of the oyster, spats having greater
   ability than juveniles and commercial size oysters. A series of
   experiments was conducted in February 2019 using a series of beakers
   containing (i) three different types of solutions (1 L): water from the
   Thau lagoon containing Picochlorum at a rate of 45.2 million cells.L-1
   (P) or diluted to 20.7 million cells. L-1 (D) and a solution of
   Isochrysis galbana containing 9.4 million cells. L-1; (ii) in the
   absence or presence of five types of bivalves: Pacific oysters of three
   different sizes (spat, juvenile and commercial size), flat oysters, and
   Mediterranean mussels of commercial size. Four separate water samples
   were taken during a 40-min incubation period to measure fluctuations in
   picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton abundances using flow cytometry.
   Retention efficiency (\%) was compared according to species and size. In
   contrast to Pacific and flat oysters, mussels with an average weight of
   21.4 g, were able to drastically reduce the abundances of Picochlorum
   and depleted nearly one million Picochlorum cells per minute at 11.4 ?.
   These results suggest that the 1228 t of mussels that died in 2018
   before the Picochlorum bloom could have helped limit the Picochlorum
   bloom if they had survived the heat and anoxia.},

Abstract = {Whole-genome duplication, leading to polyploidy and endopolyploidy, is
   widespread throughout the tree of life.1-3 Both polyploidy and
   endopolyploidy can increase cell size via nucleotypic effects, but the
   phenotypic consequences of increased cell size at the tissue and
   whole-organism levels are less well understood.1-4 We quantified the
   consequences of autopolyploidy and endopolyploidy in nine diploid
   accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, representing a gradient in
   endopolyploidy, to their corresponding experimentally synthesized
   neo-tetraploid and neo-octoploid cytotypes. The increase in cell size
   following genome duplication increased plant storage capacity, which
   increased tolerance of resource limitation, but also incurred
   biomechanical costs because of a reduction in the amount of cell wall
   per unit tissue volume. Our findings also show that the functional
   consequences of autopolyploidy can vary with accession identity, and the
   presence of this variation suggests that there is potential for
   adaptation following whole-genome duplication.},

Title = {The Daphnia carapace and other novel structures evolved via the cryptic
   persistence of serial homologs},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3792+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Understanding how novel structures arise is a central question in
   evolution. Novel structures are often defined as structures that are not
   derived from (homologous to) any structure in the ancestor.(1) The
   carapace of the crustacean Daphnia magna is a bivalved ``cape `` of
   exoskeleton. Shiga et al.(2) proposed that the carapace of crustaceans
   like Daphnia and many other plate-like outgrowths in arthropods are
   novel structures that arose through the repeated co-option of genes like
   vestigial that also pattern insect wings.(2-4) To determine whether the
   Daphnia carapace is a novel structure, we compare previous functional
   work(2) with the expression of genes known to pattern the proximal leg
   region (pannier, araucan, and vestigial)(5,6) between Daphnia, Parhyale,
   and Tribolium. Our results suggest that the Daphnia carapace did not
   arise by co-option but instead derived from an exite (lateral leg lobe)
   that emerges from an ancestral proximal leg segment that was
   incorporated into the Daphnia body wall. The Daphnia carapace,
   therefore, appears to be homologous to the Parhyale tergal plate and the
   insect wing.(5) Remarkably, the vestigial-positive tissue that gives
   rise to the Daphnia carapace appears to be present in Parhyale(7) and
   Tribolium as a small, inconspicuous protrusion. Thus, rather than a
   novel structure resulting from gene co-option, the Daphnia carapace
   appears to have arisen from a shared, ancestral tissue (morphogenetic
   field) that persists in a cryptic state in other arthropod lineages.
   Cryptic persistence of unrecognized serial homologs may thus be a
   general solution for the origin of novel structures.},

Title = {Octopamine mediates sugar relief from a chronic- stress-induced
   depression-like state in Drosophila},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {18},
Pages = {4048+},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Chronic, uncontrollable stress can result in psychiatric syndromes,
   including anxiety and major depressive disorder, in humans and mammalian
   disease models.1,2 Similarly, several days of chronic stress can induce
   depression-associated behavioral alteration in Drosophila accompanied by
   changes in biogenic amine levels in the adult brain.3-6 In our chronic
   stress paradigm, flies are subjected to 3 days of repetitive phases of
   300 Hz vibrations combined with overcrowding and food deprivation. This
   treatment reduces voluntary behavioral activity, including the
   motivation to climb wide gaps (risk taking) and to stop for sweets
   (anhe-donia), suggesting a depression-like state (DLS). These behavioral
   changes correlate with decreased sero-tonin release to the mushroom body
   (MB), a major behavioral control center in the central brain of the
   fly.7,8 Stressed flies are relieved from the DLS by feeding the
   anti-depressant serotonin precursor 5-HTP or the selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Notably, feeding sucrose to stressed
   flies results in elevated serotonin levels in the brain and ameliorates
   the DLS.3 Here, we show that this sugar relief is medi-ated by the
   neurotransmitter octopamine signaled from ventral unpaired medial
   neurons located in the sub -esophageal ganglion. The octopamine
   signaling of sweet sensation is transmitted to the MB via the
   dopami-nergic PAM neurons. In addition, neuronal-silencing experiments
   reveal that the serotonergic dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons
   innervating the MB are essential for sugar relief. Conversely,
   thermogenetic or opto-genetic activation of DPMs can replace sweet
   sensation, elucidating that serotonergic signaling from DPMs takes part
   in positively modulating DLS-related behavioral changes.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3862+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Intracellular transport is essential for neuronal function and survival.
   The most effective plus-end-directed neuronal transporter is the
   kinesin-3 KIF1C, which transports large secretory vesicles and
   endosomes.(1-4) Mutations in KIF1C cause hereditary spastic paraplegia
   and cerebellar dysfunction in human patients.(5-8) In contrast to other
   kinesin-3s, KIF1C is a stable dimer and a highly processive motor in its
   native state.(9,10) Here, we establish a baseline for the
   single-molecule mechanics of Kif1C. We show that full-length KIF1C
   molecules can processively step against the load of an optical trap and
   reach average stall forces of 3.7 pN. Compared with kinesin-1, KIF1C has
   a higher propensity to slip backward under load, which results in a
   lower maximal single-molecule force. However, KIF1C remains attached to
   the microtubule while slipping backward and re-engages quickly,
   consistent with its super processivity. Two pathogenic mutations, P176L
   and R169W, that cause hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans(7,8)
   maintain fast, processive single-molecule motility in vitro but with
   decreased run length and slightly increased unloaded velocity compared
   with the wild-type motor. Under load in an optical trap, force
   generation by these mutants is severely reduced. In cells, the same
   mutants are impaired in producing sufficient force to efficiently
   relocate organelles. Our results show how its mechanics supports KIF1C's
   role as an intracellular transporter and explain how pathogenic
   mutations at the microtubule-binding interface of KIF1C impair the
   cellular function of these long-distance transporters and result in
   neuronal disease.},

Title = {Neuronal circuits integrating visual motion information in Drosophila

Abstract = {The detection of visual motion enables sophisticated animal navigation,
   and studies on flies have provided profound insights into the cellular
   and circuit bases of this neural computation. The fly's directionally
   selective T4 and T5 neurons encode ON and OFF motion, respectively.
   Their axons terminate in one of the four retinotopic layers in the
   lobula plate, where each layer encodes one of the four directions of
   motion. Although the input circuitry of the directionally selective
   neurons has been studied in detail, the synaptic connectivity of
   circuits integrating T4/T5 motion signals is largely unknown. Here, we
   report a 3D electron microscopy reconstruction, wherein we
   comprehensively identified T4/T5's synaptic partners in the lobula
   plate, revealing a diverse set of new cell types and attributing new
   connectivity patterns to the known cell types. Our reconstruction
   explains how the ON- and OFF-motion pathways converge. T4 and T5 cells
   that project to the same layer connect to common synaptic partners and
   comprise a core motif together with bilayer interneurons, detailing the
   circuit basis for computing motion opponency. We discovered pathways
   that likely encode new directions of motion by integrating vertical and
   horizontal motion signals from upstream T4/T5 neurons. Finally, we
   identify substantial projections into the lobula, extending the known
   motion pathways and suggesting that directionally selective signals
   shape feature detection there. The circuits we describe enrich the
   anatomical basis for experimental and computations analyses of motion
   vision and bring us closer to understanding complete sensory-motor
   pathways.},

Abstract = {Visual plasticity declines sharply after the critical period, yet we
   easily learn to recognize new faces and places, even as adults. Such
   learning is often characterized by a ``moment of insight,'' an abrupt
   and dramatic improvement in recognition. The mechanisms that support
   abrupt learning are unknown, but one hypothesis is that they involve
   changes in synchronization between brain regions. To test this
   hypothesis, we used a behavioral task in which non-human primates
   rapidly learned to recognize novel images and to associate them with
   specific responses. Simultaneous recordings from inferotemporal and
   prefrontal cortices revealed a transient synchronization of neural
   activity between these areas that peaked around the moment of insight.
   Synchronization was strongest between inferotemporal sites that encoded
   images and reward-sensitive prefrontal sites. Moreover, its magnitude
   intensified gradually over image exposures, suggesting that abrupt
   learning is the culmination of a search for informative signals within a
   circuit linking sensory information to task demands.},

Title = {Multi-locus phylogeny and species delimitations of the striped-back
   shrew group (Eulipotyphla: Soricidae): Implications for cryptic
   diversity, taxonomy and multiple speciation patterns},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The striped-back shrew group demonstrates remarkable variation in skull
   and body size, tail length, and brightness of the dorsal stripe; and
   karyotypic and DNA variation has been reported in recent years. In this
   study, we investigated the phylogenetic structure of the group, as well
   as speciation patterns and demographic history in Mountains of
   Southwestern China and adjacent mountains, including the southern
   Himalayas, Mts. Bashan, Wushan, and Qinling. We sequenced a total of 462
   specimens from 126 localities in the known range of the group, which
   were sequenced and analyzed based on 6.2 kb of sequence data from two
   mitochondrial, six nu-clear, and two Y chromosome markers. Phylogenetic
   analyses of the concatenated mtDNA data revealed 14 sympatric and
   independently evolving lineages within the striped-back shrew group,
   including Sorex bedfordiae, S. cylindricauda, S. excelsus, S. sinalis
   and several cryptic species. All concatenated data (ten genes) showed a
   consistent genetic structure compared to the mtDNA lineages for the
   group, whereas the nuclear and the Y chromosome data showed a discordant
   genetic structure compared to the mtDNA lineages for the striped-back
   shrew group. Species delimitation analyses and deep genetic distance
   clearly support the species status of the 14 evolving lineages. The
   divergence time estimation suggested that the striped-back shrew group
   began to diversify from the middle Pleistocene (2.34 Ma), then
   flourished at approximately 2.14 Ma, followed by a series of rapid
   diversifications through the Pleistocene. Our results also revealed
   multiple mechanisms of speciation in the Mountains of Southwestern China
   and Adjacent Mountains with complex landscapes and climate. The
   uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Quaternary climate
   oscillations, riverine barriers, ecological elevation gradients,
   topographical diversity, and their own low dispersal capacity may have
   driven the speciation, genetic structure, and phylogeographic patterns
   of the striped-back shrew group.},

Title = {EGFR signaling activates intestinal stem cells by promoting

Abstract = {EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling promotes growth and proliferation in many cell
   types, and genetic hyperactivation of RAS-ERK signaling drives many
   cancers. Yet, despite intensive study of upstream components in EGFR
   signal transduction, the identities and functions of downstream
   effectors in the pathway are poorly understood. In Drosophila intestinal
   stem cells (ISCs), the transcriptional repressor Capicua (Cic) and its
   targets, the ETS-type transcriptional activators Pointed (pnt) and
   Ets21C, are essential downstream effectors of mitogenic EGFR signaling.
   Here, we show that these factors promote EGFR-dependent metabolic
   changes that increase ISC mass, mitochondrial growth, and mitochondrial
   activity. Gene target analysis using RNA and DamID sequencing revealed
   that Pnt and Ets21C directly upregulate not only DNA replication and
   cell cycle genes but also genes for oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA
   cycle, and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Metabolite analysis substantiated
   these metabolic functions. The mitochondrial transcription factor B2
   (mtTFB2), a direct target of Pnt, was required and partially sufficient
   for EGFR-driven ISC growth, mitochondrial biogenesis, and proliferation.
   MEK-dependent EGF signaling stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis in human
   RPE-1 cells, indicating the conservation of these metabolic effects.
   This work illustrates how EGFR signaling alters metabolism to
   coordinately activate cell growth and cell division.},

Title = {Local translation provides the asymmetric distribution of CaMKII
   required for associative memory formation},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {2730+},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {How compartment-specific local proteomes are generated and maintained is
   inadequately understood, particularly in neurons, which display extreme
   asymmetries. Here we show that local enrichment of
   Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in axons of
   Drosophila mushroom body neurons is necessary for cellular plasticity
   and associative memory formation. Enrichment is achieved via enhanced
   axoplasmic translation of CaMKII mRNA, through a mechanism requiring the
   RNA-binding protein Mub and a 23-base Mub-recognition element in the
   CaMKII 30 UTR. Perturbation of either dramatically reduces axonal, but
   not somatic, CaMKII protein without altering the distribution or amount
   of mRNA in vivo, and both are necessary and sufficient to enhance axonal
   translation of reporter mRNA. Together, these data identify elevated
   levels of translation of an evenly distributed mRNA as a novel strategy
   for generating subcellular biochemical asymmetries. They further
   demonstrate the importance of distributional asymmetry in the
   computational and biological functions of neurons.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {2548+},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that stimulus history can be decoded via the
   use of broadband sensory impulses to reactivate mnemonic
   representations.(1-4). However, memories of previous stimuli can also be
   used to form sensory predictions about upcoming stimuli.(5,6) Predictive
   mechanisms allow the brain to create a probable model of the outside
   world, which can be updated when errors are detected between the model
   predictions and external inputs.(7-10) Direct recordings in the auditory
   cortex of awake mice established neural mechanisms for how encoding
   mechanisms might handle working memory and predictive processes without
   ``overwriting'' recent sensory events in instances where predictive
   mechanisms are triggered by oddballs within a sequence.(11) However, it
   remains unclear whether mnemonic and predictive information can be
   decoded from cortical activity simultaneously during passive, implicit
   sequence processing, even in anesthetized models. Here, we recorded
   neural activity elicited by repeated stimulus sequences using
   electrocorticography (ECoG) in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats,
   where events within the sequence (referred to henceforth as ``vowels,''
   for simplicity) were occasionally replaced with a broadband noise burst
   or omitted entirely. We show that both stimulus history and predicted
   stimuli can be decoded from neural responses to broadband impulses, at
   overlapping latencies but based on independent and uncorrelated data
   features. We also demonstrate that predictive representations are
   dynamically updated over the course of stimulation.},

Title = {Transient food insecurity during the juvenile-adolescent period affects
   adult weight, cognitive flexibility, and dopamine neurobiology},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {A major challenge for neuroscience, public health, and evolutionary
   biology is to understand the effects of scarcity and uncertainty on the
   developing brain. Currently, a significant fraction of children and
   adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of
   our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of
   insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent
   period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and
   the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in
   mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and
   found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different
   developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple
   metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult
   females with different developmental feeding history showed no
   differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant
   differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning
   models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in
   males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their
   behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task
   context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in
   males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant
   differences in the AMPAR/ NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on
   nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked
   dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show
   in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the
   juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight,
   learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.},

Abstract = {Although scales are a defining and conspicuous feature of moths and
   butterflies (Lepidoptera),(1-3 )their earliest evolution predates the
   group but is shrouded by a dearth of fossil evidence. Herein, we report
   two new species in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, representing lineages
   closely related to Lepidoptera: one represents the extinct Tarachoptera,
   with dense scales on the fore-and hindwings, while the other is an early
   lineage of caddisflies, with a hindwing covered by a single layer of
   angustifoliate scales. A novel phylogenetic analysis of 174
   morphological characters and 73 extant and fossil representatives of
   Mecopterida demonstrates a monophyletic origin of scales in the common
   ancestor of Tarachoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera; that
   Tarachoptera are monophyletic but their scale morphology is
   plesiomorphic for the whole group; and that scales were lost early in
   caddisfly evolution before reappearing multiple times within the clade.
   Collectively, these fossils provide clarity into the origin and early
   evolution of scales before their diversification among the moths and
   butterflies.},

Title = {Spatial representation by ramping activity of neurons in the
   retrohippocampal cortex},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4451+},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Neurons in the retrohippocampal cortices play crucial roles in spatial
   memory. Many retrohippocampal neu-rons have firing fields that are
   selectively active at specific locations, with memory for rewarded
   locations associated with reorganization of these firing fields. Whether
   this is the sole strategy for representing spatial memories is unclear.
   Here, we demonstrate that during a spatial memory task retrohippocampal
   neurons encode location through ramping activity that extends across
   segments of a linear track approaching and following a reward, with the
   rewarded location represented by offsets or switches in the slope of the
   ramping activity. Ramping representations could be maintained
   independently of trial outcome and cues marking the reward location,
   indicating that they result from recall of the track structure. When
   recorded in an open arena, neurons that generated ramping activity
   during the spatial memory task were more numerous than grid or border
   cells, with a majority showing spatial firing that did not meet criteria
   for classification as grid or border representations. Encoding of
   rewarded locations through offsets and switches in the slope of ramping
   activ-ity also emerged in recurrent neural network models trained to
   solve a similar spatial memory task. Impaired performance of model
   networks following disruption of outputs from ramping neurons is
   consistent with this coding strategy supporting navigation to recalled
   locations of behavioral significance. Our results suggest that encoding
   of learned spaces by retrohippocampal networks employs both discrete
   firing fields and continuous ramping representations. We hypothesize
   that retrohippocampal ramping activity mediates readout of learned
   models for goal-directed navigation.},

Title = {Rapid evolution of pollen and pistil traits as a response to sexual
   selection in the post-pollination phase of mating},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4465+},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Sexual selection is the basis of some of the most striking phenotypic
   variation in nature.1,2 In animals, sexual selection in males can act on
   traits that improve access to mates prior to copulation,3-8 but also on
   sperm traits filtered by sperm competition,9-14 or female choice
   expressed simply by the morphology and physi-ology of genital
   tracts.14-16 Although long overlooked as a mode of selection on plant
   traits, sexual selection should act on land plants too because they are
   anisogamous: males produce more, and smaller, gametes than females.17-19
   Numerical asymmetry in gamete production is thought to play a central
   role in selection on traits that affect pollen transfer to mates,20,21
   but very little is known about how pollen competition or cryptic female
   choice might affect the evolution of traits expressed after
   pollination.22,23 Here, we report the divergence of pollen and pistil
   traits of the dioecious wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua
   dur-ing evolution over three generations between populations at low
   versus high plant density, corresponding to low versus higher levels of
   polyandry;24 we expected selection under higher polyandry to strengthen
   compe-tition among pollen donors for fertilizing ovules. We found that
   populations at high density evolved faster -growing pollen tubes (an
   equivalent of greater sperm velocity), greater expression of pollen
   proteins involved in pollen growth, and larger stigmas (a trait likely
   enhancing the number of pollen donors and thus competi-tion for ovules).
   Our results identify the post-pollination phase of plant mating as an
   important arena for the action of sexual selection.},

Abstract = {Our conscious perceptual experience relies on a hierarchical process
   involving integration of low-level sen-sory encoding and higher-order
   sensory selection.1 This hierarchical process may scale at different
   levels of brain functioning, including integration of information
   between the hemispheres.2-5 Here, we test this hypoth-esis for the
   perception of visual motion stimuli. Across 3 experiments, we
   manipulated the connectivity be-tween the left and right visual motion
   complexes (V5/MT+) responsible for horizontal motion perception2,3 by
   means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).4,5 We found that
   enhancing the strength of connections from the left to the right V5/MT+,
   by inducing spike-timing-dependent plasticity6 in this pathway,
   increased sensitivity to horizontal motion. These changes were present
   immediately and lasted at least 90 min after intervention. Notably,
   little perceptual changes were observed when strengthening connections
   from the right to the left V5/MT+. Furthermore, we found that this
   asymmetric modulation was mirrored by an asym-metric perceptual bias in
   the direction of the horizontal motion. Overall, observers were biased
   toward left-ward relative to rightward motion direction. Crucially,
   following the strengthening of the connections from right to left
   V5/MT+, this bias could be momentarily reversed. These results suggest
   that the projections con-necting left and right V5/MT+ in the human
   visual cortex are asymmetrical, subtending a hierarchical role of
   hemispheric specialization7-10 favoring left-to-right hemisphere
   processing for integrating local sensory input into coherent global
   motion perception.},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Tool use is a fundamental feature of human evolution. Stone tools are in
   the archaeological record from 3.4 Ma, even before Homo,1 and the use of
   stone tools probably predated the split between hominins and pan-ins.2
   Using tools (hereafter, tooling cf Fragaszy and Mangalam3) is
   hypothesized to have improved hominins' foraging efficiency or access to
   high-quality foods.4-7 This hypothesis is supported if feeding with
   tools posi-tively contributes to diet quality in extant non-human
   primates or if foraging efficiency is increased by tooling. However, the
   contribution of tooling to non-human primates' foraging success has
   never been investigated through a direct analysis of nutritional
   ecology.8,9 We used multi-dimensional nutritional geometry to analyze
   energy and macronutrients (nonstructural carbohydrates, lipids, and
   protein) in the diets of wild capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinous) that
   routinely crack palm nuts with stone hammers.10,11 We show that eating
   nuts obtained through tooling helps monkeys to achieve more consistent
   dietary intakes. Tooling increased the net energy gain by 50\% and
   decreased the proportion of fiber ingested by 7\%. Tooling also
   increased the daily non-protein energy intake. By contrast, protein
   intake remained constant across foraging days, sug-gesting a pattern of
   macronutrient regulation called protein prioritization, which is also
   found in contempo-rary humans.8,9 In addition, tooling reduced
   dispersion in the ratio of protein to non-protein energy, suggest-ing a
   role in macronutrient balancing. Our findings suggest that tooling prior
   to tool making could have substantially increased the nutritional
   security of ancestral hominins, sowing the seeds for cultural
   develop-ment.5,7},

   Russia},

Abstract = {Insect pollination is one of the hallmarks of flowering plants.1 Bees,
   moths, flies, and some other pollinators evolved elongate siphonate
   mouthparts for sucking concealed nectar and occasionally other liquids.2
   How-ever, it is clear from the fossil record that insects with similar
   adaptations appeared long before the mid -Cretaceous radiation of
   angiosperms. These insects most probably used their proboscis to reach
   pollination drops and other sugary fluids that were hidden in the cones
   of extinct gymnosperms, pollinating them in the process.3-6 The vast
   majority of these gymnosperm-associated long-proboscid insects have been
   reported from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous, i.e., the
   time interval that immediately predated the advent of flowering plants.7
   By contrast, the Paleozoic stage of the co-evolution between
   long-proboscid insect pol-linators and plants has remained poorly
   understood. Here, we report a putative pollination mutualism involving
   long-proboscid holometabolous insects (Panorpida: Protomeropidae) from
   the Early Permian of Russia (ca. 283-273 Ma). Their elongate mouthparts
   have very similar morphology to those of some pre-sent-day nectarivorous
   Coleoptera and Hymenoptera and probably served to imbibe micropylar
   secretions from the semi-closed ovulate organs of the gymnosperms of a
   peltaspermalean affinity that have been found in the same locality. This
   is the earliest record of insects with siphonate-like mouthparts, which
   could indicate that the complex interactions between pollinators and
   gymnosperms predate the first flowering plants by over 100 Ma.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},
Number = {17},

Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {A key aim in biology is to identify which genetic changes contributed to
   the evolution of form through time. Apical dominance, the inhibitory
   effect exerted by shoot apices on the initiation or outgrowth of distant
   lateral buds, is a major regulatory mechanism of plant form.1 Nearly a
   century of studies in the sporophyte of flowering plants have
   established the phytohormone auxin as a front-runner in the search for
   key factors controlling apical dominance,2,3 identifying critical roles
   for long-range polar auxin transport and local auxin biosyn-thesis in
   modulating shoot branching.4-10 A capacity for lateral branching evolved
   by convergence in the gametophytic shoot of mosses and primed its
   diversification;11 however, polar auxin transport is relatively
   unimportant in this developmental process,12 the contribution of auxin
   biosynthesis genes has not been assessed, and more generally, the extent
   of conservation in apical dominance regulation within the land plants
   remains largely unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to
   identify genetic determinants of apical dominance in the moss
   Physcomitrium patens. Here, we show that leafy shoot apex decapitation
   releases apical dominance through massive and rapid transcriptional
   reprogramming of auxin-responsive genes and altering auxin biosynthesis
   gene activity. We pinpoint a subset of P. patens TRYPTOPHAN
   AMINO-TRANSFERASE (TAR) and YUCCA FLAVIN MONOOXYGENASE-LIKE (YUC) auxin
   biosynthesis genes ex-pressed in the main and lateral shoot apices and
   show that they are essential for coordinating branch initiation and
   outgrowth. Our results demonstrate that local auxin biosynthesis acts as
   a pivotal regulator of apical dominance in moss and constitutes a shared
   mechanism underpinning shoot architecture control in land plants.},

Abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) sustain nutrient recycling in most

   Madagascar (ca. 18 Ma), and the current Amazonian basin (ca. 45-36 Ma),
   the last two likely transoceanic. Later events originating in Southeast
   Asia involve Nearctic dispersal to North America (ca. 20-5 Ma), Oceania
   (Australia and New Zealand; ca. 15 Ma), and Europe (ca. 10-5 Ma).
   Subsequent dispersals were also inferred from Southeast Asia to East
   Asia (ca. 4 Ma); from North America to East Asia (ca. 11-8 Ma),
   Southeast Asia (ca. 19-2 Ma), Northern Andes (ca. 15 Ma), and Europe
   (ca. 15-2 Ma), respectively; and from the Amazon to the Caribbean region
   (ca. 25-20 Ma). Finally, we detected a significant increase in the net
   diversification rates in the branch leading to most northern temperate
   species in addition to higher state-dependent diversification rates in
   temperate lineages, consistent with previous findings. These results
   suggest that species of sect. Vaginatae likely have higher dispersal
   ability and higher adaptability to new environments, in particular
   compared to those of its sister clade, sect. Caesareae. Overall, the
   much wider distribution of A. sect. Vaginatae, from pan-tropical to
   pan-arctic, provides a unique window to understanding niche conservatism
   across a species-rich clade of ECM fungi.},

Title = {Conversion of anterograde into retrograde trains is an intrinsic

Abstract = {Cilia or eukaryotic flagella are microtubule-based organelles found
   across the eukaryotic tree of life. Their very high aspect ratio and
   crowded interior are unfavorable to diffusive transport of most
   components required for their assembly and maintenance. Instead, a
   system of intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains moves cargo rapidly up
   and down the cilium (Figure 1A).1-3 Anterograde IFT, from the cell body
   to the ciliary tip, is driven by kinesin-II motors, whereas retrograde
   IFT is powered by cytoplasmic dynein-1b motors.4 Both motors are
   associated with long chains of IFT protein complexes, known as IFT
   trains, and their cargoes.5-8 The conversion from anterograde to
   retrograde motility at the ciliary tip involves (1) the dissoci-ation of
   kinesin motors from trains,9 (2) a fundamental restructuring of the
   train from the anterograde to the retrograde architecture,8,10,11 (3)
   the unloading and reloading of cargo,2 and (4) the activation of the
   dynein motors.8,12 A prominent hypothesis is that there is dedicated
   calcium-dependent protein-based machinery at the ciliary tip to mediate
   these processes.4,13 However, the mechanisms of IFT turnaround have
   remained elusive. In this study, we use mechanical and chemical methods
   to block IFT at intermediate positions along the cilia of the green
   algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in normal and calcium-depleted
   conditions. We show that IFT turnaround, kinesin dissociation, and
   dynein-1b activation can consistently be induced at arbitrary distances
   from the ciliary tip, with no stationary tip machinery being required.
   Instead, we demonstrate that the anterograde-to-retrograde conversion is
   a calcium-independent intrinsic ability of IFT.},

Title = {Habitat suitability of drift macroalgae in two shallow coastal estuaries
   of the northern Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Drift macroalgae, often associated with seagrass habitats, may provide
   resources and habitat to seagrass asso-ciated fauna, increasing faunal
   abundance and diversity. Yet, excessive amounts of drift macroalgae can
   be harmful, reducing the abundance of both aquatic angiosperms and
   animals by causing localized hypoxia. To ascertain the effects of drift
   macroalgae at biomasses commonly found in the northern Gulf of Mexico,
   we quantified recruitment into drift macroalgae without the presence of
   seagrass and measured associated changes to temperature, dissolved
   oxygen, and flow in Redfish Bay, Texas and Big Lagoon, Florida, USA.
   These locations comprise different coastal ecosystems with different
   compositions of drift macroalgae. In both locations, the presence of
   macroalgae significantly increased recruitment of small nekton, with
   higher abundances and species richness found within macroalgae relative
   to adjacent artificial macroalgae. Flow velocity and dissolved oxygen
   levels were lower in macroalgae than in adjacent artificial or bare
   substrate, but still remained above hypoxic levels over daily
   fluctuations. Despite lower oxygen levels at night, and overall lower
   water flow, organisms readily recruited into drift macroalgae more so
   than the artificial habitats nearby. However, the reduction in oxygen
   reveals that in higher biomasses, macroalgae could adversely affect
   animals.},

Title = {Environmental constraints on the photosynthetic rate of the marine
   flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Symsagittifera roscoffensis, an Acoel flatworm that lives within the
   intertidal zone, was first discovered over a century ago as a ``plant
   animal{''} due to its symbiotic relationship with the alga Tetraselmis
   convolutae. Although commonly used as a model organism in biomedical
   research, there is little information regarding its life history or how
   environmental factors affect this organism. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of a range of abiotic factors on S.
   roscoffensis by measuring its photosynthetic oxygen production rate
   under different salinities, temperatures, light intensities,
   photoperiods, and nutrient concentrations over 6 days. Salinity (20, 30
   and 40) had little effect on photosynthetic rate, whereas a temperature
   of 14 degrees C yielded significantly higher final oxygen production
   than 0 and 30 degrees C. The lowest light intensity (21 mu mol m- 2 s-
   1), the shortest photoperiod (8 L:16 D) and the intermediate nutrient
   concentration (f/4) resulted in the highest final oxygen production
   rates. Our results showed that S. roscoffensis had the ability to
   tolerate and remain photosynthetically active under a wide range of
   conditions that it is likely to experience within the intertidal zone.
   Using our experimental data, we estimated that S. roscoffensis was able
   to produce 174\% body C d-1 via photosynthesis alone, which could
   explain the total absence of heterotrophic feeding in this organism. The
   organism appeared to be robust and easy to cultivate, which should open
   new opportunities for its wider applications.},

Abstract = {Females have two X chromosomes and males have only one in most mammals.
   X chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs in females to equalize X-dosage
   between sexes. Besides, mammals also balance the dosage between X
   chromosomes and autosomes via X chromosome upregulation (XCU) to
   fine-tune X-linked expression and thus maintain genomic homeostasis.
   Despite some studies highlighting the importance of XCU in somatic
   cells, little is known about how XCU is achieved and its developmental
   role during early embryogenesis. Herein, using mouse preimplantation
   embryos as the model, we reported that XCU initially occurs upon major
   zygotic genome activation and co-regulates X-linked expression in
   cooperation with im-printed XCI during preimplantation development. An
   in-depth analysis further indicated, unexpectedly, only a small
   proportion of, but not X chromosome-wide, X-linked genes contribute
   greatly to XCU. Furthermore, we identified that bromodomain containing 4
   (BRD4) plays a key role in the transcription activation of XCU during
   preimplantation development. BRD4 deficiency or inhibition caused an
   impaired XCU, thus leading to reduced developmental potential and
   mitochondrial dysfunctions of blastocysts. Our finding was also
   sup-ported by the tight association of BRD4 dysregulation and XCU
   disruption in the pathology of cholangiocar-cinoma. Thus, our results
   not only advanced the current knowledge of X-dosage compensation and
   provided a mechanism for understanding XCU initiation but also presented
   an important clue for understanding the developmental and pathological
   role of XCU.},

Abstract = {How the human auditory cortex represents spatially separated
   simultaneous talkers and how talkers' loca-tions and voices modulate the
   neural representations of attended and unattended speech are unclear.
   Here, we measured the neural responses from electrodes implanted in
   neurosurgical patients as they per-formed single-talker and multi-talker
   speech perception tasks. We found that spatial separation between
   talkers caused a preferential encoding of the contralateral speech in
   Heschl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), and superior temporal gyrus
   (STG). Location and spectrotemporal features were encoded in different
   aspects of the neural response. Specifically, the talker's location
   changed the mean response level, whereas the talker's spectrotemporal
   features altered the variation of response around response's baseline.
   These components were differentially modulated by the attended talker's
   voice or location, which improved the population decoding of attended
   speech features. Attentional modulation due to the talker's voice only
   ap-peared in the auditory areas with longer latencies, but attentional
   modulation due to location was present throughout. Our results show that
   spatial multi-talker speech perception relies upon a separable pre
   -atten-tive neural representation, which could be further tuned by
   top-down attention to the location and voice of the talker.},

Title = {Non-linear multimodal integration in a distributed premotor network
   controls proprioceptive reflex gain in the insect leg},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3847+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Producing context-appropriate motor acts requires integrating multiple
   sensory modalities. Presynaptic inhibition of proprioceptive afferent
   neurons(1-4) and afferents of different modalities targeting the same
   motor neurons (MNs)(5-7) underlies some of this integration. However, in
   most systems, an interneuronal network is interposed between sensory
   afferents and MNs. How these networks contribute to this integration,
   particularly at single-neuron resolution, is little understood.
   Context-specific integration of load and movement sensory inputs occurs
   in the stick insect locomotory system,(6,8-12) and both inputs feed into
   a network of premotor nonspiking interneurons (NSIs).(8) We analyzed how
   load altered movement signal processing in the stick insect femur-tibia
   (FTi) joint control system by tracing the interaction of FTi
   movement(13-15) (femoral chordotonal organ {[}fCO]) and load(13,15,16)
   (tibial campaniform sensilla {[}CS]) signals through the NSI network to
   the slow extensor tibiae (SETi) MN, the extensor MN primarily active in
   non-walking animals.(17-19) On the afferent level, load reduced movement
   signal gain by presynaptic inhibition. In the NSI network, graded
   responses to movement and load inputs summed nonlinearly, increasing the
   gain of NSIs opposing movement-induced reflexes and thus decreasing the
   SETi and extensor tibiae muscle movement reflex responses. Gain
   modulation was movement-parameter specific and required presynaptic
   inhibition. These data suggest that gain changes in distributed premotor
   networks, specifically the relative weighting of antagonistic pathways,
   could be a general mechanism by which multiple sensory modalities are
   integrated to generate context-appropriate motor activity.},

Title = {Foraging range scales with colony size in high-latitude seabirds},

Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Density-dependent prey depletion around breeding colonies has long been
   considered an important factor controlling the population dynamics of
   colonial animals.(1-4) Ashmole proposed that as seabird colony size
   increases, intraspecific competition leads to declines in reproductive
   success, as breeding adults must spend more time and energy to find prey
   farther from the colony.(1) Seabird colony size often varies over
   several orders of magnitude within the same species and can include
   millions of individuals per colony.(5,6) As such, colony size likely
   plays an important role in determining the individual behavior of its
   members and how the colony interacts with the surrounding
   environment.(6) Using tracking data from murres (Uria spp.), the world's
   most densely breeding seabirds, we show that the distribution of
   foraging-trip distances scales to colony size(0.33) during the
   chick-rearing stage, consistent with Ashmole's halo theory.(1,2) This
   pattern occurred across colonies varying in size over three orders of
   magnitude and distributed throughout the North Atlantic region. The
   strong relationship between colony size and foraging range means that
   the foraging areas of some colonial species can be estimated from colony
   sizes, which is more practical to measure over a large geographic scale.
   Two-thirds of the North Atlantic murre population breed at the 16
   largest colonies; by extrapolating the predicted foraging ranges to
   sites without tracking data, we show that only two of these large
   colonies have significant coverage as marine protected areas. Our
   results are an important example of how theoretical models, in this
   case, Ashmole's version of central-place-foraging theory, can be applied
   to inform conservation and management in colonial breeding species.},

Abstract = {Adaptive behavior requires flexible control over learning and
   exploitation of potentially viable options. Within a particular task,
   careful learning of strategies that differ from the initially learned
   rule is especially important as it sets an individual's strategy
   repertoire. However, whether and how such strategy updating is mediated
   by specific brain networks has remained unclear. Retrosplenial cortex
   (RSC), a cortical area exhibiting exten-sive connectivity to
   dorso-medial striatum (DMS) and the hippocampal formation, has been
   broadly impli-cated in flexible learning and might be involved in
   strategy updating. Here, we investigate the specific role of mouse RSC
   in flexible learning, map relevant RSC-anchored cortico-thalamo-basal
   ganglia circuits, and dissect their role in strategy updating. Activity
   in RSC was neither required for initial rule learning nor to switch
   between previously learned rules but was specifically required to
   explore and learn new alternative options when previous ones were
   available but no longer appropriate. Such strategy updating depended on
   activity in RSC c-Fos+ ensembles associated with the original rule and
   on their connections to DMS and thalamic par-afascicular nucleus (PF)
   neurons. At the circuit level, rule-related RSC projection neurons
   branched to inner-vate both DMS and PF neurons and mediated strategy
   updating through a RSC-DMS-substantia nigra retic-ulata (SNr)-PF
   network, coupling alternative exploration to outcome. In addition, a
   separate RSC-PF-RSC looped network promoted alternative exploration. Our
   results uncover cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo and cortico-thalamo
   networks involving subpopulations of neurons in RSC and PF that
   specifically control and implement strategy updating.},

Abstract = {The study of soil quality indicators can indicate the efficiency of
   forest restoration practices. Litter, soil chemical attributes, and soil
   fauna can be used for this purpose since these factors are linked to
   each other in nutrient cycling and respond to changes in land use
   management. The present study aimed to identify accumulated litter
   biomass on topsoil, its nutrient concentration, composition of the
   epigeal fauna community, and topsoil chemical attributes as possible
   soil quality indicators in restoration areas of Atlantic Forest (T1, T2,
   and T3) with different levels of native tree seedlings richness (29, 58,
   and 114 species, respectively), pasture (T4), and native forest (T5,
   control), by three plots (50 x 50 m) in each area, in the municipality
   of Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Samples of accumulated litter on
   topsoil, topsoil (0-5 cm), and community of epigeal fauna (by pitfall
   traps) were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Accumulated
   litter biomass on the topsoil, concentration of K and Mg in its biomass,
   abundance of Coleoptera and Pseudoscorpionida, total N and exchangeable
   K concentrations in the topsoil were the most relevant soil quality
   indicators, according to the principal component analysis. In both
   climatic seasons, T5 presented high dissimilarity in relation to the
   other areas and best soil quality due to its association to higher
   values of accumulated litter biomass, its nutrient concentration (N, K,
   Ca, Mg, S), relative frequency or abundance of Coleoptera,
   Pseudoscorpionida, and Others, concentrations of total organic carbon,
   total N, available P, exchangeable Ca, extractable acidity, sum of
   bases, and cation exchange capacity; T1, T2, and T3 were associated to
   higher values of relative frequency of Formicidae and presented low
   dissimilarity to each other; T4 was associated to higher values of pH.
   Therefore, the forest restoration areas have not yet contributed to the
   general quality of the soil approaching that observed in T5.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A recent paper published in Trends in Ecology and Evolution suggested a
   new alternative for the reporting of statistical results, using a
   language based on evidence against the null hypothesis. I agree that the
   reporting of null hypothesis statistical testing clearly needs
   improvement, but the proposal of an evidence-based language has several
   drawbacks: a) it goes back to the original Fisherian continuous
   interpretation of p-values, b) at the same time uses some loose
   categorizations and, c) most importantly, it may provide a wrong idea of
   what p-values actually are. By saying that there is very strong, strong,
   moderate, weak or little evidence of an effect, the reader gets the idea
   that p-values are providing Bayesian-type information on the probability
   of the null hypothesis given our data. However, p-values are only
   providing information on the probability of having obtained our data (or
   more extreme data), under the trueness of the null hypothesis. That is
   why I suggest reporting results using a data probability-based language,
   together with a previous and separate specification of the magnitude of
   the effects.},

Abstract = {The evolution of streptophytes had a profound impact on life on Earth.
   They brought forth those photosyn-thetic eukaryotes that today dominate
   the macroscopic flora: the land plants (Embryophyta).1 There is
   convincing evidence that the unicellular/filamentous
   Zygnematophyceae-and not the morphologically more elaborate
   Coleochaetophyceae or Charophyceae-are the closest algal relatives of
   land plants.2-6 Despite the species richness (>4,000), wide
   distribution, and key evolutionary position of the zygnemato-phytes,
   their internal phylogeny remains largely unresolved.7,8 There are also
   putative zygnematophytes with interesting body plan modifications (e.g.,
   filamentous growth) whose phylogenetic affiliations remain un-known.
   Here, we studied a filamentous green alga (strain MZCH580) from an
   Austrian peat bog with central or parietal chloroplasts that lack
   discernible pyrenoids. It represents Mougeotiopsis calospora PALLA, an
   enig-matic alga that was described more than 120 years ago9 but never
   subjected to molecular analyses. We generated transcriptomic data of M.
   calospora strain MZCH580 and conducted comprehensive phyloge-nomic
   analyses (326 nuclear loci) for 46 taxonomically diverse
   zygnematophytes. Strain MZCH580 falls in a deep-branching
   zygnematophycean clade together with some unicellular species and thus
   represents a formerly unknown zygnematophycean lineage with filamentous
   growth. Our well-supported phylogenomic tree lets us propose a new
   five-order system for the Zygnematophyceae and provides evidence for at
   least five independent origins of true filamentous growth in the closest
   algal relatives of land plants. This phylogeny provides a robust and
   comprehensive framework for performing comparative analyses and
   inferring the evo-lution of cellular traits and body plans in the
   closest relatives of land plants.},

Title = {The Astrin-SKAP complex reduces friction at the kinetochore-microtubule

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The kinetochore links chromosomes to spindle microtubules to drive
   chromosome segregation at cell division. While we know nearly all
   mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet
   dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly
   understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes
   to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation
   but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP
   depletion dampens the movement and decreases the coordination of
   metaphase sister kinetochores and increases the tension between them.
   Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing
   versus depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP,
   kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing
   microtubules and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to
   polymerize. Thus, in contrast to the previously described kinetochore
   proteins that increase the grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP
   reduces the grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force
   responsiveness and reducing friction. Together, our findings suggest a
   model where the Astrin-SKAP complex effectively ``lubricates'' correct,
   bioriented attachments to help preserve them.},

Abstract = {Carex meyeriana lowland meadow is one of the most important grassland
   compositions in Hulun Buir and Northeastern China, until now,
   substantial part of C. meyeriana meadow in Hulun Buir has been degraded
   due to overgrazing. In order to clarify the effects of overgrazing on
   plant communities, soil physicochemical properties and microorganisms of
   C. meyeriana meadow, long-term unused and overgrazing C. meyeriana
   meadow were selected as research objects. The important value of C.
   meyeriana and soil physicochemical properties were determined, and soil
   microbes were measured by high-throughput sequencing techniques. The
   results showed that long-term overgrazing would lead to increasing plant
   diversity, but the advantage of C. meyeriana, soil organic matter and
   total nitrogen content were significantly reduced. At the same time, the
   differences in community diversity of soil bacteria from 0 to 30 cm
   tended to decrease, while fungal tend to heterogeneity, and fungal
   communities occupied a dominant position in the change of
   microorganisms. In addition, metagenomics sequencing results showed that
   overgrazing mainly affected the functional genes of bacteria, most of
   the dif-ferential genes were related to the energy cycle and metabolism,
   but had no impact on the normal function of soil carbon and nitrogen
   cycles.},

   arachnoideum on topsoil permeability?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pteridium arachnoideum is a cosmopolitan, allelopathic, pervasive
   species which is expanding its occurrence in many regions of the
   tropics. Yet, the ecohydrological effects of such colonization is
   virtually unknown especially when it occurs in riparian zones which are
   expected to perform many important ecosystem services. The objective of
   the present study was to evaluate the influence of Pteridium
   colonization on topsoil permeability in riparian zones. To do that, we
   selected two similar riparian zones: (i) dominated by Pteridium
   arachnoideum and (ii) under tropical forest. We performed infiltration,
   water repellency (dry and wet season) and penetration resistance
   measurements to evaluate soil permeability. The infiltration capacity
   was significantly lower in Pteridium compared to riparian forest. We
   attribute this reduction to the significant increase in both water
   repellency in the dry season and soil penetration resistance in the soil
   under Pteridium. Water repellency, though still present in the wet
   season in both riparian zones, had no significant difference. Our
   results show that, despite the loss of biodiversity with Pteridium
   invasion, water repellency has a clear reduction in the wet season which
   likely benefits infiltration. Thus, basic hydrological ecosystem
   services can probably still be provided by such invaded riparian zones.},

Title = {Assessing the utility of mitochondrial gene markers in the family
   Suessiaceae (Dinophyta) with phylogenomic validation},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The dinoflagellate family Suessiaceae comprises cosmopolitan species
   distributed across polar and tropical waters in both marine and
   freshwater ecosystems, encompassing free-living forms, symbionts, and
   parasites. Recently, species diversity within the family has rapidly
   expanded, now including a few species reported to cause red tides.
   Despite their ecological and evolutionary importance, classifying them
   within Suessiaceae is difficult due to the limitations of the existing
   molecular markers-the highly conserved small subunit ribosomal gene (SSU
   rDNA) and the presence of two indel regions of sequence fragments of the
   large subunit ribosomal gene (LSU rDNA)-resulting in poorly resolved
   phylogenetic relationships. We assessed mitochondrial cytochrome b (cob)
   and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) genes to develop robust molecular
   markers that can reveal the genetic diversity of the family Suessiaceae.
   The divergences of cob and cox1 sequences among the species in the
   family were greater than the SSU rDNA but less than the LSU rDNA and the
   ITS region. Moreover, the distinctive topology inferred from the
   mitochondrial genes provided high resolution among the suessiacean
   species. We examined the validity of the genetic markers using
   phylogenomics based on 2,023 core proteins. The divergence of the cob
   phylogeny was most consistent with that of the phylogenomic results.
   Taken together, the cob gene can be a novel marker reflecting topology
   at the genome-scale within the family Suessiaceae.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships and the origin of New World soles (Teleostei:
   Pleuronectiformes: Achiridae): The role of estuarine habitats},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Even though the monophyletic status of Achiridae has been supported by
   morphological and molecular data, the interrelationships within the
   representatives of this family are poorly resolved. In the present
   study, we carried out the most complete molecular phylogenetic analysis
   of this group, encompassing all genera and employing both nuclear
   (Rhodopsin, Recombination activator {[}Rag 1], Mixed - lineage Leukemia
   {[}MLL] and Early Growth Response Protein 3 {[}EGR3]) and mitochondrial
   (Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit I {[}COI], Cytochrome B {[}CytB], ATPase
   6.8, 16S and 12S RNAr) genes. All topologies based on Maximum
   Likelihood, Bayesian inferences and Bayesian Inference of the
   Multispecies Coalescent confirmed the monophyletism of Achiridae, in
   spite of some incongruences in relation to Achirus mucuri, A. lineatus,
   Apionichthys finis and Trinectes microphthalmus. In fact, Achirus and
   Trinectes proved to be non-monophyletic genera while Hypoclinemus
   mentalis was closely related to A. achirus, suggesting this species
   should be reevaluated. We provided evidence that Achiridae has first
   arisen in estuaries (about 23.5 million years ago) and some lineages
   have evolved independently to either marine or freshwater habitats.
   Furthermore, we propose a diversification scenario of New World soles
   involving at least two events of marine incursions during Miocene and
   Pliocene - Pleistocene associated with natural geographic barriers
   (Victoria-Trindade chain), the width and exposure of continental shelf
   and headwater capture along the Amazon basin. Finally, the evolutionary
   dependence of Achirid soles on estuaries, characterized as highly
   dy-namic environments, has probably driven the recent divergence of many
   species of Achiridae.},

Title = {Too early for the ferry: The biogeographic history of the Assamiidae of
   southeast Asia (Chelicerata: Opiliones, Laniatores)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Opiliones (harvestmen) have come to be regarded as an abundant source of
   model groups for study of historical biogeography, due to their ancient
   age, poor dispersal capability, and high fidelity to biogeographic
   terranes. One of the least understood harvestman groups is the
   Paleotropical Assamiidae, one of the more diverse families of Opiliones.
   Due to a labyrinthine taxonomy, poorly established generic and
   subfamilial boundaries, and the lack of taxonomic keys for the group,
   few efforts have been undertaken to decipher relationships within this
   arachnid lineage. Neither the monophyly of the family, nor its exact
   placement in the harvestman phylogeny, have been established. Here, we
   assessed the internal phylogeny of Assamiidae using a ten-locus Sanger
   dataset, sampling key lineages putatively ascribed to this family for
   five of the ten markers. Our analyses recovered Assamiidae as a
   monophyletic group, in a clade with the primarily Afrotropical
   Pyramidopidae and the southeast Asian Beloniscidae. Internal
   relationships of assamiids disfavored the systematic validity of
   subfamilies, with biogeography reflecting much better phylogenetic
   structure than the existing higher-level taxonomy. To assess whether the
   Asian assamiids came to occupy Indo-Pacific terranes via rafting on the
   Indian subcontinent, we performed divergence dating to infer the age of
   the family. Our results show that Indo-Pacific clades are ancient,
   originating well before the Cretaceous and therefore predate a vicariant
   mechanism commonly encountered for Paleotropical taxa.},

Title = {A near-complete and time-calibrated phylogeny of the Old World
   flycatchers, robins and chats (Aves, Muscicapidae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Old World flycatchers, robins and chats (Aves, Muscicapidae) are a
   diverse songbird family with over three hundred species. Despite
   continuous efforts over the past two decades, there is still no
   comprehensive and wellresolved species-level phylogeny for Muscicapidae.
   Here we present a supermatrix phylogeny that includes all 50 currently
   recognized genera and ca. 92\% of all the species, built using data from
   up to 15 mitochondrial and 13 nuclear loci. In addition to assembling
   nucleotide sequences available in public databases, we also extracted
   sequences from the genome assemblies and raw sequencing reads from
   GenBank and included a few unpublished sequences. Our analyses resolved
   the phylogenetic position for several previously unsampled taxa, for
   example, the Grand Comoro Flycatcher Humblotia flavirostris, the
   Collared Palm Thrush Cichladusa arquata, and the Taiwan Whistling-Thrush
   Myophonus insularis, etc. We also provide taxonomic recommendations for
   genera that exhibit paraphyly or polyphyly. Our results suggest that
   Muscicapidae diverged from Turdidae (thrushes and allies) in the early
   Miocene, and the most recent common ancestors for the four subfamilies
   (Muscicapinae, Niltavinae, Cossyphinae and Saxicolinae) all arose around
   the middle Miocene.},

Title = {Comprehensive taxon sampling and vetted fossils help clarify the time
   tree of shorebirds (Aves, Charadriiformes)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shorebirds (Charadriiformes) are a globally distributed clade of modern
   birds and, due to their ecological and morphological disparity, a
   frequent subject of comparative studies. While molecular phylogenies
   have been key to establishing the suprafamilial backbone of the
   charadriiform tree, a number of relationships at both deep and shallow
   taxonomic levels remain poorly resolved. The timescale of shorebird
   evolution also remains uncertain as a result of extensive disagreements
   among the published divergence dating studies, stemming largely from
   different choices of fossil calibrations. Here, we present the most
   comprehensive non-supertree phylogeny of shorebirds to date, based on a
   total-evidence dataset comprising 353 ingroup taxa (90\% of all extant
   or recently extinct species), 27 loci (15 mitochondrial and 12 nuclear),
   and 69 morphological characters. We further clarify the timeline of
   charadriiform evolution by time-scaling this phylogeny using a set of 14
   up-to-date and thor-oughly vetted fossil calibrations. In addition, we
   assemble a taxonomically restricted 100-locus dataset specif-ically
   designed to resolve outstanding problems in higher-level charadriiform
   phylogeny. In terms of tree topology, our results are largely congruent
   with previous studies but indicate that some of the conflicts among
   earlier analyses reflect a genuine signal of pervasive gene tree
   discordance. Monophyly of the plovers (Chara-driidae), the position of
   the ibisbill (Ibidorhyncha), and the relationships among the five
   subfamilies of the gulls (Laridae) could not be resolved even with
   greatly increased locus and taxon sampling. Moreover, several localized
   regions of uncertainty persist in shallower parts of the tree, including
   the interrelationships of the true auks (Alcinae) and anarhynchine
   plovers. Our node-dating and macroevolutionary rate analyses find
   support for a Paleocene origin of crown-group shorebirds, as well as

Title = {Phylogenomics and body shape morphometrics reveal recent diversification
   in the goatfishes (Syngnatharia: Mullidae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Clades of marine fishes exhibit many patterns of diversification,
   ranging from relatively constant throughout time to rapid changes in the
   rates of speciation and extinction. The goatfishes (Syngnatharia:
   Mullidae) are a family of marine, reef associated fishes with a
   relatively recent origin, distributed globally in tropical and temperate
   waters. Despite their abundance and economic importance, the goatfishes
   remain one of the few coral reef families for which the species level
   relationships have not been examined using genomic techniques. Here we
   use phylogenomic analysis of ultra-conserved elements (UCE) and exon
   data to resolve a well-supported, time-calibrated phylogeny for 72
   species of goatfishes, supporting a recent crown age of the goatfishes
   at 21.9 million years ago. We used this framework to test hypotheses
   about the associations among body shape mor-phometrics, taxonomy, and
   phylogeny, as well as to explore relative diversification rates across
   the phylogeny. Body shape was strongly associated with generic-level
   taxonomy of goatfishes, with morphometric analyses showing evidence for
   high phylogenetic signal across all morphotypes. Rates of
   diversification in this clade reveal a recent sharp increase in lineage
   accumulation, with 92\% of the goatfish species sampled across all
   clades and major body plans having originated in just the past 5 million
   years. We suggest that habitat diversity in the early Pliocene oceans
   and the generalist ecology of goatfishes are key factors in the unusual
   evolutionary tempo of the family Mullidae.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},
Number = {18},
Pages = {4093+},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Cognitive models of interval timing can be formulated as an
   accumulation-to-bound process.1-5 However, the physiological
   manifestation of such processes has not yet been identified. We used
   electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the neural responses of
   participants while they performed a temporal bisection task in which
   they were requested to categorize the duration of visual stimuli as
   short or long.6 We found that the stimulus -offset and response-locked
   activity depends on both stimulus duration and the participants'
   decision. To relate this activity to the underlying cognitive processes,
   we used a drift-diffusion model.7 The model includes a noisy accumulator
   starting with the stimulus onset and a decision threshold. According to
   the model, a stimulus duration will be categorized as ``long{''}if the
   accumulator reaches the threshold during stimulus presentation.
   Otherwise, it will be categorized as ``short.{''}We found that at the
   offset of stimulus presentation, an EEG response marks the distance of
   the accumulator from the threshold. Therefore, this model offers an
   accurate description of our behavioral data as well as the EEG response
   using the same two model parameters. We then replicated this finding in
   an identical experiment conducted in the tactile domain. We also
   extended this finding to two different temporal ranges (sub-and
   supra-second). Taken together, the work provides a new way to study the
   cognitive processes underlying temporal decisions, using a combination
   of behavior, EEG, and modeling.},

Title = {Look-up and look-down neurons in the mouse visual thalamus during freely
   moving exploration},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {18},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Visual information reaches cortex via the thalamic dorsal lateral
   geniculate nucleus (dLGN). dLGN activity is modulated by global
   sleep/wake states and arousal, indicating that it is not simply a
   passive relay station. However, its potential for more specific
   visuomotor integration is largely unexplored. We addressed this question
   by developing robust 3D video reconstruction of mouse head and body
   during spontaneous explo-ration paired with simultaneous neuronal
   recordings from dLGN. Unbiased evaluation of a wide range of pos-tures
   and movements revealed a widespread coupling between neuronal activity
   and few behavioral param-eters. In particular, postures associated with
   the animal looking up/down correlated with activity in >50\% neurons,
   and the extent of this effect was comparable with that induced by
   full-body movements (typically locomotion). By contrast, thalamic
   activity was minimally correlated with other postures or movements
   (e.g., left/right head and body torsions). Importantly, up/down postures
   and full-body movements were largely independent and jointly coupled to
   neuronal activity. Thus, although most units were excited during
   full-body movements, some expressed highest firing when the animal was
   looking up ({''}look-up{''}neurons), whereas others expressed highest
   firing when the animal was looking down ({''}look-down{''}neurons).
   These results were observed in the dark, thus representing a genuine
   behavioral modulation, and were amplified in a lit arena. Our results
   demonstrate that the primary visual thalamus, beyond global modulations
   by sleep/awake states, is potentially involved in specific visuomotor
   integration and reveal two distinct cou-plings between up/down postures
   and neuronal activity.},

Title = {Mosquito cryptochromes expressed in Drosophila confer species-specific
   behavioral light responses},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},

Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Cryptochrome (CRY) is a short-wavelength light-sensitive photoreceptor
   expressed in a subset of circadian neurons and eyes in Drosophila that
   regulates light-evoked circadian clock resetting. Acutely, light evokes
   rapid electrical excitation of the ventral lateral subset of circadian
   neurons and confers circadian-modulated avoidance behavioral responses
   to short-wavelength light. Recent work shows dramatically different
   avoidance versus attraction behavioral responses to short-wavelength
   light in day-active versus night-active mosquitoes and that these
   behavioral responses are attenuated by CRY protein degradation by
   constant light exposure in mosquitoes. To determine whether CRY1s
   mediate species-specific coding for behavioral and electrophysiological
   light responses, we used an ``empty neuron{''} approach and
   transgenically expressed diurnal Aedes aegypti (AeCRY1) versus nocturnal
   Anopheles gambiae (AgCRY1) in a cry-null Drosophila background. AeCRY1
   is much less light sensitive than either AgCRY1 or DmCRY as shown by
   partial behavioral rhythmicity following constant light exposure.
   Remarkably, expression of nocturnal AgCRY1 confers low survival to
   constant white light as does expression of AeCRY1 to a lesser extent.
   AgCRY1 mediates significantly stronger electrophysiological
   cell-autonomous responses to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light relative to
   AeCRY1. AgCRY1 expression mediates electrophysiological sensitivity to
   635 nm red light, whereas AeCRY1 does not, consistent with
   species-specific mosquito red light responses. AgCRY1 and DmCRY mediate
   intensity-dependent avoidance behavior to UV light at different light
   intensity thresholds, whereas AeCRY1 does not, thus mimicking mosquito
   and fly behaviors. These findings highlight CRY as a key
   non-image-forming visual photoreceptor that mediates physiological and
   behavioral light responses in a species-specific fashion.},

Title = {The homogenization of avian morphological under the global extinction

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is facing a global extinction crisis that will reduce
   ecological trait diversity, evolutionary history, and ultimately
   ecosystem functioning and services.(1-4) A key challenge is
   understanding how species losses will impact morphological and
   phylogenetic diversity at global scales.5,6 Here, we test whether the
   loss of species threatened with extinction according to the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) leads to
   morphological and phylogenetic homogenization7,8 across both the whole
   avian class and within each biome and ecoregion globally. We use a
   comprehensive set of continuous morphological traits ex-tracted from
   museum collections of 8,455 bird species, including geometric
   morphometric beak shape data,9 and sequentially remove species from
   those at most to least threat of extinction. We find evidence of
   morphological, but not phylogenetic, homogenization across the avian
   class, with species becoming more alike in terms of their morphology. We
   find that most biome and ecoregions are expected to lose morphological
   diversity at a greater rate than predicted by species loss alone, with
   the most imperiled re-gions found in East Asia and the Himalayan uplands
   and foothills. Only a small proportion of assemblages are threatened
   with phylogenetic homogenization, in particular parts of Indochina.
   Species extinctions will lead to a major loss of avian ecological
   strategies, but not a comparable loss of phylogenetic diversity. As the

Abstract = {Sensory systems display remarkable plasticity and are under strong
   evolutionary selection. The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus,
   consists of eyed river-dwelling surface populations and multiple
   independent cave populations that have converged on eye loss, providing
   the opportunity to examine the evolution of sensory circuits in response
   to environmental perturbation. Functional analysis across multiple
   transgenic populations expressing GCaMP6s showed that functional
   connectivity of the optic tectum largely did not differ between
   populations, except for the selective loss of negatively correlated
   activity within the cavefish tectum, suggesting positively correlated
   neural activity is resistant to an evolved loss of input from the
   retina. Furthermore, analysis of surface-cave hybrid fish reveals that
   changes in the tectum are genetically distinct from those encoding eye
   loss. Together, these findings uncover the independent evolution of
   multiple components of the visual system and establish the use of
   functional imaging in A. mexicanus to study neural circuit evolution.},

Title = {The cellular basis for synergy between RCO and KNOX1 homeobox genes in
   leaf shape diversity},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3773+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Leaves of seed plants provide an attractive system to study the
   development and evolution of form. Leaves show varying degrees of margin
   complexity ranging from simple, as in Arabidopsis thaliana, to fully
   dissected into leaflets in the closely related species Cardamine
   hirsuta. Leaflet formation requires actions of Class I KNOTTED1-LIKE
   HOMEOBOX (KNOX1) and REDUCED COMPLEXITY (RCO) homeobox genes, which are
   ex-pressed in the leaves of C. hirsuta but not A. thaliana. Evolutionary
   studies indicate that diversification of KNOX1 and RCO genes was
   repeatedly associated with increased leaf complexity. However, whether
   this gene combination represents a developmentally favored avenue for
   leaflet formation remains unknown, and the cell-level events through
   which the combined action of these genes drives leaflet formation are
   also poorly understood. Here we show, through a genetic screen, that
   when a C. hirsuta RCO transgene is expressed in A. thaliana, then
   ectopic KNOX1 expression in leaves represents a preferred developmental
   path for leaflet formation. Using time-lapse growth analysis, we
   demonstrate that KNOX1 expression in the basal domain of leaves leads to
   prolonged and anisotropic cell growth. This KNOX1 action, in synergy
   with local growth repression by RCO, is instrumental in generating
   rachises and petiolules, the linear geomet-rical elements, that bear
   leaflets in complex leaves. Our results show how the combination of
   cell-level growth analyses and genetics can help us understand how
   evolutionary modifications in expression of developmen-tally important
   genes are translated into diverse leaf shapes.},

Title = {Src activation in lipid rafts confers epithelial cells with invasive
   potential to escape from apical extrusion during cell competition},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Abnormal/cancerous cells within healthy epithelial tissues undergo
   apical extrusion to protect against carci-nogenesis, although they
   acquire invasive capacity once carcinogenesis progresses. However, the
   molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells escape from apical extrusion
   and invade surrounding tissues remain elusive. In this study, we
   demonstrate a molecular mechanism for cell fate switching during
   epithelial cell competition. We found that during competition within
   epithelial cell layers, Src transformation promotes maturation of focal
   adhesions and degradation of extracellular matrix. Src-transformed cells
   underwent basal delamination by Src activation within
   sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains/ lipid rafts,
   whereas they were apically extruded when Src was outside of lipid rafts.
   A comparative analysis of contrasting phenotypes revealed that
   activation of the Src-STAT3-MMP axis through lipid rafts was required
   for basal delamination. CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was
   identified as an Src-acti-vating scaffold and as a Met regulator in
   lipid rafts, and its overexpression induced basal delamination. In renal
   cancer models, CDCP1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition-mediated
   invasive behavior by activating the Src-STAT3-MMP axis through Met
   activation. Overall, these results suggest that spatial acti-vation of
   Src signaling in lipid rafts confers resistance to apical extrusion and
   invasive potential on epithelial cells to promote carcinogenesis.},

Title = {A kinesin-1 variant reveals motor-induced microtubule damage in cells},

Abstract = {Kinesins drive the transport of cellular cargoes as they walk along
   microtubule tracks; however, recent work has suggested that the physical
   act of kinesins walking along microtubules can stress the microtubule
   lattice. Here, we describe a kinesin-1 KIF5C mutant with an increased
   ability to generate damage sites in the micro-tubule lattice as compared
   with the wild-type motor. The expression of the mutant motor in cultured
   cells resulted in microtubule breakage and fragmentation, suggesting
   that kinesin-1 variants with increased damage activity would have been
   selected against during evolution. The increased ability to damage
   microtubules is not due to the enhanced motility properties of the
   mutant motor, as the expression of the kinesin-3 motor KIF1A, which has
   similar single-motor motility properties, also caused increased
   microtubule pausing, bending, and buckling but not breakage. In cells,
   motor-induced microtubule breakage could not be prevented by increased
   a-tubulin K40 acetylation, a post-translational modification known to
   increase microtubule flexibility. In vitro, lattice damage induced by
   wild-type KIF5C was repaired by soluble tubulin and resulted in
   increased rescues and overall microtubule growth, whereas lattice damage
   induced by the KIF5C mutant resulted in larger repair sites that made
   the microtubule vulnerable to breakage and fragmentation when under
   mechanical stress. These results demonstrate that kinesin-1 motility
   causes defects in and damage to the microtubule lattice in cells. While
   cells have the capacity to repair lattice damage, conditions that exceed
   this capacity result in microtubule breakage and fragmentation and may
   contribute to human disease.},

Title = {Phylogenetic tree reconstruction via graph cut presented using a

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are essential tools in evolutionary biology that
   present information on evolutionary events among organisms and
   molecules. From a dataset of n sequences, a phylogenetic tree of
   (2n-5)!! possible to-pologies exists, and determining the optimum
   topology using brute force is infeasible. Recently, a recursive graph
   cut on a graph-represented-similarity matrix has proven accurate in
   reconstructing a phylogenetic tree con-taining distantly related
   sequences. However, identifying the optimum graph cut is challenging,
   and approximate solutions are currently utilized. Here, a phylogenetic
   tree was reconstructed with an improved graph cut using a
   quantum-inspired computer, the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and the
   algorithm was named the ``Normalized -Minimum cut by Digital Annealer
   (NMcutDA) method{''}. First, a criterion for the graph cut, the
   normalized cut value, was compared with existing clustering methods.
   Based on the cut, we verified that the simulated phylogenetic tree could
   be reconstructed with the highest accuracy when sequences were diverged.
   Moreover, for some actual data from the structure-based protein
   classification database, only NMcutDA could cluster se-quences into
   correct superfamilies. Conclusively, NMcutDA reconstructed better
   phylogenetic trees than those using other methods by optimizing the
   graph cut. We anticipate that when the diversity of sequences is
   suffi-ciently high, NMcutDA can be utilized with high efficiency.},

Title = {Anuran assemblages in western Philippines: Unraveling the effects of
   habitat types, water availability, and elevation},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Understanding the patterns and drivers of species assemblages is the
   central tenet of community ecology and this may inform effective
   conservation and management strategies. Such information is scarce in
   tropical regions, particularly the Palawan faunal region and island
   group in the western Philippines. Here we examined the patterns of
   anuran richness and identified correlations in species co-occurrences
   and their shared responses to habitat types, water availability, and
   elevation. We sampled anuran populations using standardized transects
   established across Palawan's major islands between 2013 and 2019. We
   generated interpolated and extrapolated richness using Hill numbers. To
   investigate species co-occurrences and the relative importance of
   environmental variables, we used Joint Species Distribution Model
   (JSDM). A total of 18 anuran species were recorded, including seven
   non-endemic and 11 species restricted to Palawan. Anuran richness was
   highest in forests habitats than in cultivated land areas. Sites with
   water sources had higher anuran richness than those without water.
   Species richness observed along elevational gradient exhibited a
   hump-shaped pattern. Significant positive correlations in species
   co-occurrences were found among aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Anuran
   species showed tight associations with elevation and water availability,
   indicating that these variables are strong predictors of anuran
   co-occurrences. Finally, this study broadens our understanding of the
   differences and similarities in habitat requirements among anuran
   species, highlighting the need to consider such information when
   developing conservation strategies other than the traditional
   vulnerability and irreplaceability measures.},

Title = {Phylogeny, character evolution, and biogeography of the fern genus
   Bolbitis (Dryopteridaceae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Bolbitis is a pantropical fern genus of Dryopteridaceae with ca. 80
   species mainly in tropical Asia. Earlier studies confirmed the monophyly
   of Bolbitis when Mickelia is excluded and identified three major clades
   in Bolbitis. However, earlier studies are based on relatively small
   sampling and the majority of Asian species are not sampled. In this
   study, DNA sequences of three plastid markers of 169 accessions
   representing ca. 68 (85 \% of total) species of Bolbitis in nine out of
   the 10 series recognized by Hennipman (1977), and 54 accessions
   representing the five remaining bolbitidoid genera are used to infer a
   global phylogeny with a focus on Asian species. The major results
   include: (1) Bolbitis is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) species
   of Bolbitis are resolved into four major clades and their relationships
   are: the Malagasy/Mascarene clade is sister to the rest, followed by the
   African clade which is sister to the American clade + the Asian clade;
   (3) six well-supported subclades are identified in the most speciose
   Asian clade; (4) the free-veined Egenolfia is embedded in Bolbitis and
   is paraphyletic in relation to species with anastomosing venation; (5)
   three series sensu Hennipman (1977), B. ser. Alienae, B. ser.
   Egenolfianae, and B. ser. Heteroclitae, are paraphyletic or
   polyphyletic; (6) evolution of six morphological characters is analyzed
   and free venation is found to have evolved from anastomosing venation
   and reversed to free venation in Bolbitis; and (7) biogeographical
   implications are drawn and it is shown that a single recent dispersal
   from Asia resulted in continental disjunction of closely related ferns
   of Bolbitis between Africa and America.},

Title = {Phylogeography, hybridization, and species discovery in the Etheostoma
   nigrum complex (Percidae: Etheostoma: Boleosoma)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The history of riverine fish diversification is largely a product of
   geographic isolation. Physical barriers that reduce or eliminate gene
   flow between populations facilitate divergence via genetic drift and
   natural selection, eventually leading to speciation. For freshwater
   organisms, diversification is often the product of drainage basin
   rearrangements. In young clades where the history of isolation is the
   most recent, evolutionary relationships can resemble a tangled web. One
   especially recalcitrant group of freshwater fishes is the Johnny Darter
   (Etheostoma nigrum) species complex, where traditional taxonomy and
   molecular phylogenetics indicate a history of gene flow and conflicting
   inferences of species diversity. Here we assemble a genomic dataset
   using double digest restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing
   and use phylogenomic and population genetic approaches to investigate
   the evolutionary history of the complex of species that includes E.
   nigrum, E. olmstedi, E. perlongum, and E. susanae. We reveal and
   validate several evolutionary lineages that we delimit as species,
   highlighting the need for additional work to formally describe the
   diversity of the Etheostoma nigrum complex. Our analyses also identify
   gene flow among recently diverged lineages, including one instance
   involving E. susanae, a localized and endangered species.
   Phylogeographic structure within the Etheostoma nigrum species complex
   coincides with major geologic events, such as parallel divergence in
   river basins during Pliocene inundation of the Atlantic coastal plain
   and multiple northward post-glacial colonization routes tracking river
   basin rearrangements. Our study serves as a nuanced example of how low
   dispersal rates coupled with geographic isolation among disconnected
   river systems in eastern North America has produced one of the world's
   freshwater biodiversity hotspots.},

Title = {Body colourations affect predation risk from fish in fiddler crabs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many animals show conspicuous colour patterns that inform potential
   predators about their unprofitability due to their toxicity or
   unpalatability (aposematism). However, no systematic work has evaluated
   the colouration of crabs in terms of aposematism, even though many
   species exhibit conspicuous colouration. We conducted a laboratory study
   to compare predation risk from a fish predator, the barred mudskipper
   (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), in two sympatric fiddler crab species
   with different body colour patterns: Austruca perplexa with
   brownish-white colourations and Paraleptuca crassipes with red-and-black
   colour patterns. Fiddler crabs and mudskippers are active on tidal flats
   during low tides. A predation trial by stocking one crab and one
   mudskipper in a test arena was repeated five times for each species-sex
   combination. The animal behaviour was video recorded for 24 h, and crabs
   were confirmed to be alive or dead after 72 h. A. perplexa females were
   most vulnerable to predation from mudskippers. The attack intensity from
   mudskippers was stronger during the nighttime than daytime against P.
   crassipes females and males and A. perplexa males, suggesting that
   mudskippers may avoid them by visually detecting the body colouration in
   P. crassipes and the body structure in males of both species (i.e. a
   large weaponry claw) during the daytime. Mudskippers eventually preyed
   on and consumed some individuals in both species-sexes. Mudskippers are
   known to shift their main food components from small crustaceans through
   polychaete worms to crabs, such as fiddler crabs, and unpalatable
   polychaete worms tend to be brightly coloured. We suggest that the red
   colouration of P. crassipes may be incidental mimicry of the unpalatable
   red/orange-coloured polychaete worms that mudskippers might have learned
   to avoid.},

Title = {Spatial isolation impacts pollinator visitation and reproductive success
   of a threatened self-incompatible Mediterranean tree},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pollination service is crucial to achieve successful plant sexual
   reproduction and long-term population persistence. This pollination
   service can be affected by plant conspecific density and also by
   intrinsic features of individuals related to their flowering phenology
   and floral display. However, studies examining intrinsic and extrinsic
   traits on pollinator visitation and reproductive success of
   Mediterranean trees with limited reproduction are still scarce. We
   analyzed the effects of plant isolation, flowering phenology, flower
   weight and tree size on flower visitation probability, flowering patch
   visitation probability, fruit set and crop size. To this end, we
   intensively monitored pollinator visitation and fruit production of 67
   (in 2019) and 73 (in 2020) Pyrus bourgaeana Decne trees within a
   threatened Mediterranean population. Our results revealed that isolated
   individuals received more pollinators than those on conspecific
   aggregations, suggesting intraspecific competition for pollinators in
   dense flowering neighborhoods. However, fruit set was higher in trees
   close to flowering conspecifics despite having fewer visits from
   pollinators, suggesting pollen limitation but not pollinator limitation
   in spatially isolated trees. Interestingly, we found increased crop
   sizes in spatially isolated trees which could be related to reduced
   intraspecific competition for resources in low-density neighborhoods
   (water, nutrients) and/or to higher reproductive investment (i.e. higher
   flower production). Overall, our results indicated pollen but not
   pollinator limitation in spatially isolated trees. Under this scenario
   of sexual reproduction mediated by pollinators, our findings stress the
   relevance of individuals' spatial distribution for self-incompatible
   trees exhibiting low individuals' densities.},

Title = {Subindividual variation accounts for most of the variability in two
   reproductive traits in Cistus ladanifer},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is increasing evidence of within species flower trait variability.
   In Cistus ladanifer, there is a great variation in the number of locules
   of the ovary (6-12). In this study, we assessed the variation in the
   number of ovary locules and ovule production at population, individual
   and intraindividual levels in 5 localities in the Madrid Region (Central
   Spain). We have answered the following questions: What level present
   larger variation? Is there a relationship between the number of ovary
   locules and ovule production? And if yes, does it hold across all
   levels? We sampled almost 500 flowers from 50 individuals for five
   localities. We counted the number of locules of the ovary and estimate
   the number of ovules per flower. The partitioning of total variation
   among populations, individuals and within-individuals was estimated for
   both variables. To analyze differences among locations, we performed
   general linear models. We found that within-individual variation was the
   main source of variation for all measured variables. Inter-individual
   variation was relevant only for the number of locules, and inter
   -population variation was almost negligible for all variables. Despite
   the positive correlation between the num-ber of locules per flower and
   ovule production, populations with more locules did not present more
   ovules per flower. In summary, we found that variation in the number of
   locules and its relationship with ovule production is scale dependent.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3659+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to produce their
   outputs, but the role of input timing in this integration remains poorly
   understood. Motion detection is a paradigmatic example of this
   integration, since theories of motion detection rely on different delays
   in visual signals. These delays allow circuits to compare scenes at
   different times to calculate the direction and speed of motion.
   Different motion detection circuits have different velocity sensitivity,
   but it remains untested how the response dynamics of individual cell
   types drive this tuning. Here, we sped up or slowed down specific neuron
   types in Drosophila's motion detection circuit by manipulating ion
   channel expression. Altering the dynamics of individual neuron types
   upstream of motion detectors increased their sensitivity to fast or slow
   visual motion, exposing distinct roles for excitatory and inhibitory
   dynamics in tuning directional signals, including a role for the
   amacrine cell CT1 . A circuit model constrained by functional data and
   anatomy qualitatively reproduced the observed tuning changes. Overall,
   these results reveal how excitatory and inhibitory dynamics together
   tune a canonical circuit computation.},

Title = {Intrinsic maturation of sleep output neurons regulates sleep ontogeny in
   Drosophila},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The maturation of sleep behavior across a lifespan (sleep ontogeny) is
   an evolutionarily conserved phenom-enon. Mammalian studies have shown
   that in addition to increased sleep duration, early life sleep exhibits
   stark differences compared with mature sleep with regard to sleep
   states. How the intrinsic maturation of sleep output circuits
   contributes to sleep ontogeny is poorly understood. The fruit fly
   Drosophila mela-nogaster exhibits multifaceted changes to sleep from
   juvenile to mature adulthood. Here, we use a non-inva-sive probabilistic
   approach to investigate the changes in sleep architecture in juvenile
   and mature flies. Increased sleep in juvenile flies is driven primarily
   by a decreased probability of transitioning to wake and characterized by
   more time in deeper sleep states. Functional manipulations of
   sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) suggest that
   these neurons differentially regulate sleep in juvenile and mature
   flies. Transcriptomic analysis of dFB neurons at different ages and a
   subsequent RNAi screen impli-cate the genes involved in dFB sleep
   circuit maturation. These results reveal that the dynamic
   transcriptional states of sleep output neurons contribute to the changes
   in sleep across the lifespan.},

Abstract = {Cells are complex biochemical systems whose behaviors emerge from
   interactions among myriad molecular components. Computation is often
   invoked as a general framework for navigating this cellular complexity.
   However, it is unclear how cells might embody computational processes
   such that the theories of computation, including finite-state machine
   models, could be productively applied. Here, we demonstrate
   finite-state-machine-like processing embodied in cells using the walking
   behavior of Euplotes eurystomus, a ciliate that walks across surfaces
   using fourteen motile appendages (cirri). We found that cellular walking
   entails regulated transitions among a discrete set of gait states. The
   set of observed transitions decomposes into a small group of
   high-probability, temporally irreversible transitions and a large group
   of low-probability, time-symmetric transitions, thus revealing
   stereotypy in the sequential patterns of state transitions. Simulations
   and experiments suggest that the sequential logic of the gait is
   functionally important. Taken together, these findings implicate a
   finite-state-machine-like process. Cirri are connected by microtubule
   bundles (fibers), and we found that the dynamics of cirri involved in
   different state transitions are associated with the structure of the
   fiber system. Perturbative experiments revealed that the fibers mediate
   gait coordination, suggesting a mechanical basis of gait control.},

Abstract = {Neural circuits must both execute the behavioral repertoire of
   individuals and account for behavioral variation across species.
   Understanding how this variation emerges over evolutionary time requires
   large-scale phylogenetic comparisons of behavioral repertoires. Here, we
   describe the evolution of walking in fruit flies by capturing
   high-resolution, unconstrained movement from 13 species and 15 strains
   of drosophilids. We find that walking can be captured in a universal
   behavior space, the structure of which is evolutionarily conserved.
   However, the occurrence of and transitions between specific movements
   have evolved rapidly, resulting in repeated convergent evolution in the
   temporal structure of locomotion. Moreover, a meta-analysis demonstrates
   that many behaviors evolve more rapidly than other traits. Thus, the
   architecture and physiology of locomotor circuits can execute precise
   individual movements in one species and simultaneously support rapid
   evolutionary changes in the temporal ordering of these modular elements
   across clades.},

Title = {Nitric oxide signaling controls collective contractions in a colonial

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Although signaling by the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) regulates
   key physiological processes in animals, including contractility,(1-3)
   immunity,(4,5) development,(6-9) and locomotion,(10,11) the early
   evolution of animal NO signaling remains unclear. To reconstruct the
   role of NO in the animal stem lineage, we set out to study NO signaling
   in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals.(12) In
   animals, NO produced by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) canonically
   signals through cGMP by activating soluble guanylate cyclases
   (sGCs).(13,14) We surveyed the distribution of the NO signaling pathway
   components across the diversity of choanoflagellates and found three
   species that express NOS (of either bacterial or eukaryotic origin),
   sGCs, and downstream genes previously shown to be involved in the
   NO/cGMP pathway. One of the species coexpressing sGCs and a
   bacterial-type NOS, Choanoeca flexa, forms multicellular sheets that
   undergo collective contractions controlled by cGMP.(15) We found that
   treatment with NO induces cGMP synthesis and contraction in C. flexa.
   Biochemical assays show that NO directly binds C. flexa sGC1 and
   stimulates its cyclase activity. The NO/cGMP pathway acts independently
   from other inducers of C. flexa contraction, including mechanical
   stimuli and heat, but sGC activity is required for contractions induced
   by light-todark transitions. The output of NO signaling in C.
   flexa-contractions resulting in a switch from feeding to
   swimming-resembles the effect of NO in sponges(1-3) and
   cnidarians,(11,16,17) where it interrupts feeding and activates
   contractility. These data provide insights into the biology of the first
   animals and the evolution of NO signaling.},

Title = {Re-evaluating and dating myriapod diversification with
   phylotranscriptomics under a regime of dense taxon sampling},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent transcriptomic studies of myriapod phylogeny have been based on
   relatively small datasets with <40 myriapod terminals and variably
   supported or contradicted the traditional morphological groupings of
   Progoneata and Dignatha. Here we amassed a large dataset of 104 myriapod
   terminals, including multiple species for each of the four myriapod
   classes. Across the tree, most nodes are stable and well supported. Most
   analyses across a range of gene occupancy levels provide moderate to
   strong support for a deep split of Myriapoda into Symphyla + Pauropoda
   (=Edafopoda) and an uncontradicted grouping of Chilopoda + Diplopoda
   (=Pectinopoda nov.), as in other recent transcriptome-based analyses; no
   analysis recovers Progoneata or Dignatha as clades. As in all recent
   multi-locus and phylogenomic studies, chilopod interrelationships
   resolve with Craterostigmus excluded from Amalpighiata rather than
   uniting with other centipedes with maternal brood care in
   Phylactometria. Diplopod ordinal interrelationships are largely
   congruent with morphology-based classifications. Chilognathan clades
   that are not invariably advocated by morphologists include Glomerida +
   Glomeridesmida, such that the volvation-related characters of pill
   millipedes may be convergent, and Stemmiulida + Polydesmida more closely
   allied to Juliformia than to Callipodida + Chordeumatida. The latter
   relationship implies homoplasy in spinnerets and contradicts
   Nematophora. A time-tree with nodes calibrated by 25 myriapod and six
   outgroup fossil terminals recovers Cambrian-Ordovician divergences for
   the deepest splits in Myriapoda, Edafopoda and Pectinopoda, predating
   the terrestrial fossil record of myriapods as in other published
   chronograms, whereas age estimates within Chilopoda and Diplopoda
   overlap with or do not appreciably predate the calibration fossils. The
   grouping of Chilopoda and Diplopoda is recovered in all our analyses and
   is formalized as Pectinopoda nov., named for the shared presence of
   mandibular comb lamellae. New taxonomic proposals for Chilopoda based on
   uncontradicted clades are Tykhepoda nov. for the three blind families of
   Scolopendromorpha that share a ``sievetype{''} gizzard, and Taktikospina
   nov. for Scolopendromorpha to the exclusion of Mimopidae.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Iuridae is a family of scorpions that exhibits a highly complex
   biogeographic and taxonomic history. Iuridae taxa are mainly found in
   Turkey and Greece, whereas a single species is found in northern Iraq.
   Several taxonomic revisions have been conducted on this family that
   initially comprised two genera. The latest taxonomic review, based on
   morphological and anatomical features, raised the number of Iuridae
   genera to four, and the number of species to 14. Sequence data from
   three molecular markers (COX1, 16S rDNA, ITS1) originating from numerous
   Iuridae taxa were analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. Divergence
   time-estimate analyses, species delimitation approaches and estimation
   of ancestral areas were implemented in order to: (1) reconstruct the
   phylogenetic relationships of the Iuridae taxa, (2) evaluate the
   morphological classifications, and (3) obtain insights into the
   biogeographic history of the family in the East Mediterranean. The
   multi-locus phylogeny clearly confirms an ancient division into two
   clades, Calchinae and Iurinae. Ancient patterns of isolation and
   dispersal are revealed. Both subfamilies are largely confined to the
   Anatolian peninsula and its few coastal islands; only the most derived
   genus Iurus has dispersed westward to Crete and Peloponnese. Based on
   our findings, three new genera of Iurinae (Metaiurus, Anatoliurus, and
   Letoiurus) are established. The genus Neocalchas emerges as one of the
   most ancient scorpion clades, with divergence time about 27 mya.},

Abstract = {Apical-basal polarity is an essential epithelial trait controlled by the
   evolutionarily conserved PAR-aPKC po-larity network. Dysregulation of
   polarity proteins disrupts tissue organization during development and in
   dis-ease, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear due to the broad
   implications of polarity loss. Here, we un-cover how Drosophila aPKC
   maintains epithelial architecture by directly observing tissue
   disorganization after fast optogenetic inactivation in living adult
   flies and ovaries cultured ex vivo. We show that fast aPKC perturbation
   in the proliferative follicular epithelium produces large epithelial
   gaps that result from increased apical constriction, rather than loss of
   apical-basal polarity. Accordingly, we can modulate the incidence of
   epithelial gaps by increasing and decreasing actomyosin-driven
   contractility. We traced the origin of these large epithelial gaps to
   tissue rupture next to dividing cells. Live imaging shows that aPKC
   perturbation in-duces apical constriction in non-mitotic cells within
   minutes, producing pulling forces that ultimately detach dividing and
   neighboring cells. We further demonstrate that epithelial rupture
   requires a global increase of apical constriction, as it is prevented by
   the presence of non-constricting cells. Conversely, a global induction
   of apical tension through light-induced recruitment of RhoGEF2 to the
   apical side is sufficient to produce tis-sue rupture. Hence, our work
   reveals that the roles of aPKC in polarity and actomyosin regulation are
   sepa-rable and provides the first in vivo evidence that excessive tissue
   stress can break the epithelial barrier during proliferation.},

Title = {Filopodial adhesive force in discrete nodes revealed by integrin
   molecular tension imaging},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4386+},

Abstract = {Filopodia are narrow cell extensions involved in various physiological
   processes. Integrins mediate filopodia adhesion and likely transmit
   adhesive force to regulate filopodia formation and functions, but the
   force is extremely weak to study and remains poorly understood. Using
   integrative tension sensor (ITS), we imaged filopodia adhesive force at
   the single molecular tension level and investigated the force dynamics
   and sour-ces. Results show that filopodia integrin tension (FIT) is
   generated in discrete foci (force nodes) along single filopodia with a
   spacing of-1 mm. Inhibitions of actin polymerization or myosin II
   activity markedly reduced FIT signals in force nodes at filopodia tips
   and at filopodia bases, respectively, suggesting differential force
   sources of FIT in the distal force nodes and proximal ones in filopodia.
   Using two ITS constructs with different force thresholds for activation,
   we showed that the molecular force level of FIT is greater at filopodia
   bases than that at filopodia tips. We also tested the role of vinculin
   and myosin X in the FIT transmission. With vin-culin knockout in cells,
   filopodia and associated force nodes were still formed normally,
   suggesting that vin-culin is dispensable for the formation of filopodia
   and force nodes. However, vinculin is indeed required for the
   transmission of strong FIT (capable of rupturing DNA in a shear
   conformation), as the strong FIT vanished in filopodia with vinculin
   knockout. Co-imaging of FIT and myosin X shows no apparent
   co-localization, demonstrating that myosin X is not directly responsible
   for generating FIT, despite its prominent role in filo -podium
   elongation.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3443+},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {The wiring architecture of neuronal networks is assumed to be a strong
   determinant of their dynamical com-putations. An ongoing effort in
   neuroscience is therefore to generate comprehensive synapse-resolution
   connectomes alongside brain-wide activity maps. However, the
   structure-function relationship, i.e., how the anatomical connectome and
   neuronal dynamics relate to each other on a global scale, remains
   unsolved. Systematically, comparing graph features in the C. elegans
   connectome with correlations in nervous system-wide neuronal dynamics,
   we found that few local connectivity motifs and mostly other non-local
   features such as triplet motifs and input similarities can predict
   functional relationships between neurons. Surpris-ingly, quantities such
   as connection strength and amount of common inputs do not improve these
   predictions, suggesting that the network's topology is sufficient. We
   demonstrate that hub neurons in the connectome are key to these relevant
   graph features. Consistently, inhibition of multiple hub neurons
   specif-ically disrupts brain-wide correlations. Thus, we propose that a
   set of hub neurons and non-local connectivity features provide an
   anatomical substrate for global brain dynamics.},

   laboratory study on two ecosystem engineers, Abra alba and Lanice
   conchilega},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The feeding activity and burrow ventilation by benthic invertebrates
   importantly affect the biodiversity and functioning of seafloor
   sediments. Here we investigated how ocean acidification can modify these
   behavioural activities in two common and abundant macrofaunal ecosystem
   engineering species in temperate continental shelf communities: the
   white furrow shell Abra alba and the sand mason Lanice conchilega. Using
   time-lapse imagery and sediment porewater hydraulic signatures we show
   that both species adapt their behaviour in response to predicted future
   pH conditions (-0.3 units). During a three-week laboratory experiment,
   A. alba reduced the duration per feeding event when suspension and
   deposit feeding (by 86 and 53\%, respectively), and almost completely
   ceased suspension feeding under reduced seawater pH in comparison to
   ambient seawater pH (pH similar to 8.2). This behavioural change reduces
   the intake of low pH water during feeding and respiration. L. conchilega
   increased its piston-pumping frequency by 30 and 52\%, respectively,
   after one and two weeks of exposure to future pH conditions (-0.3 units)
   relative to ambient conditions. This change in irrigation activity
   suggests higher metabolic demands under low seawater pH, and also
   extended low water column pH conditions deeper into the seafloor.
   Because the distribution of other populations depends on the
   physicochemical setting by our focal species, we argue that the
   demonstrated behavioural plasticity will likely have cascading effects
   on seafloor diversity and functioning, highlighting the complexity of
   how ocean acidification, and climate change in general, will affect
   seafloor ecology.},

Title = {The ontogeny of at-sea behaviour in male southern elephant seals
   (Mirounga leonina) at Marion Island},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Megafauna, such as southern elephant seals (SESs) (Mirounga leonina,
   Linn.), forage in diverse, seemingly lim-itless habitats. In pelagic
   settings, their behaviour is more likely to be limited by physiological
   ability and prey distribution, than physical barriers. For elephant
   seals, their rapid growth in body size corresponds to changing
   physiological abilities. These changes are most pronounced for male
   elephant seals. While most studies have compared male and female SESs in
   terms of changing body size and physiological ability, few studies have
   compared the influence of changing body size on behaviour of male SESs
   from the same population using long term satellite tracking data. We
   describe age-related differences in movement and diving behaviour for
   male SESs from Marion Island. We analysed satellite tracking data
   collected from 23 male SESs seals fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit
   Satellite Relay Data Loggers at Marion Island between 2005 and 2011.
   Each dive was assigned a behavioural mode, either `searching' or
   `transit', using state-space modelling. We used mixed-effects models to
   quantify the influence of age and behavioural mode on dive duration,
   surface duration, dive depth and number of daily dives. Younger seals
   travelled significantly further from Marion Island and spent most of
   their dives in transit mode, whereas older seals stayed closer to the
   island but were in searching mode for most of their tracks. When
   searching, older seals dived more frequently, displayed longer dive and
   surface durations, and reached greater depths than younger seals. These
   differences in diving behaviour seem to reflect changing physiological
   ability. For male SESs, changes in physiological ability necessitate

Title = {One-way ticket to the blue: A large-scale, dated phylogeny revealed
   asymmetric land-to-water transitions in acariform mites (Acari:
   Acariformes)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Acariform mites are an ancient and megadiverse lineage that may have
   experienced a complex pattern of in-vasions into terrestrial and aquatic
   habitats. These among-realm transitions may relate to periods of turmoil
   in Earth's history or be simply results of uneven biodiversity patterns
   across habitats. Here, we inferred a dated, representative acariform
   phylogeny (five genes, 9,200 bp aligned, 367 terminals belonging to 150
   ingroup plus 15 outgroup families, 23 fossil calibration points) which
   was used to infer transitions between marine/fresh-water/terrestrial
   habitats. We detected four unambiguous transitions from terrestrial to
   freshwater habitats (Hydrozetes, Naiadacarus, Fusohericia, Afronothrus,
   Homocaligus); one from freshwater to marine (Pontar-achnidae), and four
   from marine to brackish or freshwater transitions (all among
   Halacaridae: Acarothrix; Halacarellus petiti; Copidognathus sp.; clade
   Limnohalacarus + Soldanellonyx + Porohalacarus + Porolohmannella). One
   transition to the sea was inferred ambiguously with respect to the
   ancestor being either terrestrial or freshwater (Hyadesiidae), and
   another must be most carefully examined by adding potential related taxa
   (Selenoribatidae + Fortuyniidae). Finally, we inferred a single,
   remarkable transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats involving
   early evolution of the large and ecologically diverse lineage: the
   ancestor of the Halacaridae + Parasitengona clade was probably
   freshwater given our dataset, thus making terrestrial Parasitengona
   second-arily terrestrial. Overall, our results suggested a strong
   asymmetry in environmental transitions: the majority occurred from
   terrestrial to aquatic habitats. This asymmetry is probably linked to
   mites' biological properties and uneven biodiversity patterns across
   habitats rather than Earth's geological history. Since the land holds
   more acariform diversity than water habitats, a shift from the former is
   more likely than from the latter. We inferred the following
   relationships: alicid endeostigmatid + eriophyoid (Alycidae,
   (Nanorchestidae, (Nematalycidae, Eriophyoidea))) being sister group to
   the remaining Acariformes: (proteonematalycid Endeostigmata,
   alico-rhagiid Endeostigmata, Trombidiformes, Oribatida (including
   Astigmata)). Trombidiform relationships had several novel
   rearrangements: (i) traditional Eupodina lacked support for the
   inclusion of Bdelloidea; (ii) Ten-eriffidae, traditionally placed among
   Anystina, was consistently recovered in a clade including Heterostigmata
   in Eleutherengona; (iii) several lineages, such as Adamystidae,
   Paratydeidae, Caeculidae and Erythracaridae, were recovered in a large
   clade along other Anystina and Eleutherengona, suggesting single origins
   of several fundamental character states, such as the reduction of the
   cheliceral fixed digit and development of the palpal thumb-claw complex.},

Title = {Phylogeny and evolution of morphological structures in a highly diverse
   lineage of fruiting-body-forming amoebae, order Trichiales (Myxomycetes,
   Amoebozoa)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Early phylogenetic studies refuted most previous assumptions concerning
   the evolution of the morphological traits in the fruiting bodies of the
   order Trichiales and did not detect discernible evolutionary patterns,
   yet they were based on a limited number of species. We infer a new
   Trichiales phylogeny based on three independently inherited genetic
   regions (nuclear and mitochondrial), with a fair taxonomic sampling
   encompassing its broad diversity. Besides, we study the evolutionary
   history of some key morphological characters. According to the new
   phylogeny, most fruiting body traits in Trichiales systematics do not
   represent exclusive synapomorphies or autapomorphies for most
   monophyletic groups. Instead, the evolution of the features derived from
   the peridium, stalk, capillitium, and spores showed intricate patterns,
   and character state transitions occurred rather within -than between
   clades. Thus, we should consider other evolutionary scenarios instead of
   assuming the homology of some characters. According to these results, we
   propose a new classification of Trichiales, including the creation of a
   new genus, Gulielmina, the resurrection of the family
   Dictydiaethaliaceae and the genus Ophiotheca, and the proposal of 13 new
   combinations for species of the genera Arcyria (1), Hemitrichia (2),
   Ophiotheca (2), Oligonema (4), Gulielmina (3), and Perichaena (1).},

Title = {Two new tardigrade genera from New Zealand?s Southern Alp glaciers
   display morphological stasis and parallel evolution},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tardigrada is an invertebrate phylum that often constitutes a dominant
   micrometazoan group on glaciers worldwide. We investigated tardigrades
   residing in surface ice above the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) on
   three temperate glaciers of New Zealand's Southern Alps. Morphological,
   morphometric and multilocus DNA analyses (CO1, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA,
   ITS-2) revealed two new genera comprising four species, of which two are
   formally described here: Kopakaius gen. nov. nicolae sp. nov. and
   Kararehius gen. nov. gregorii sp. nov. The former is represented by
   three genetically distinct phyletic lineages akin to species. According
   to CO1, Kopakaius gen. nov. nicolae sp. nov. inhabits Whataroa Glacier
   only while the remaining two Kopakaius species occur on Fox and Franz
   Joseph Glaciers, suggesting low dispersal capabilities. Although
   morphological characteristics of the new genera could indicate affinity
   with the subfamily Itaquasconinae, phylogenetic analysis placed them
   confidently in the subfamily Diphasconinae. Kopakaius gen. nov. lack
   placoids in the pharynx similar with some Ita-quasconinae, whereas dark
   pigmentation and claw shape aligns them with the glacier-obligate genus,
   Cryobiotus (subfamily Hypsibiinae), which is an example of parallel
   evolution. The second genus, Kararehius gen nov. could be classified as
   Adropion-like (subfamily Itaquasconinae), but differs greatly by
   genetics (placed in the subfamily Diphasconinae) as well as morphology
   (e.g., lack of septulum), exemplify deep stasis in Hypsibiidae. Our
   results suggest that glacier fragmentation during the Pleistocene
   triggered tardigrade speciation, making it a suitable model for studies
   on allopatric divergence in glacier meiofauna.},

Abstract = {Root systems regulate their branching patterns in response to
   environmental stimuli. Lateral root develop-ment in both monocotyledons
   and dicotyledons is enhanced in response to inoculation with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which has been interpreted as a developmental
   response to specific, symbiosis -acti-vating chitinaceous signals. Here,
   we report that generic instead of symbiosis-specific, chitin-derived
   mole-cules trigger lateral root formation. We demonstrate that this
   developmental response requires the well-known microbe-associated
   molecular pattern (MAMP) receptor, Chitin Elicitor Receptor Kinase 1
   (CERK1), in rice, Medicago truncatula, and Lotus japonicus, as well as
   the non-host of AM fungi, Arabidopsis thaliana, lending further support
   for a broadly conserved signal transduction mechanism across
   angiosperms. Using rice mutants impaired in strigolactone biosynthesis
   and signaling, we show that strigolactone signaling is necessary to
   regulate this developmental response. Rice CERK1 operates together with
   either Chitin Elicitor Binding Protein (CEBiP) or Nod Factor Receptor 5
   (NFR5) in immunity and symbiosis signaling, respectively; for the
   lateral root response, however, all three LysM receptors are required.
   Our work, therefore, reveals an overlooked but a conserved role of LysM
   receptors integrating MAMP perception with developmental re-sponses in
   plants, an ability that might influence the interaction between roots
   and the rhizosphere biota.},

Abstract = {The hippocampus occupies a central role in mammalian navigation and
   memory. Yet an understanding of the rules that govern the statistics and
   granularity of the spatial code, as well as its interactions with
   perceptual stimuli, is lacking. We analyzed CA1 place cell activity
   recorded while rats foraged in different large-scale environments. We
   found that place cell activity was subject to an unexpected but precise
   homeostasis-the distribution of activity in the population as a whole
   being constant at all locations within and between environments. Using a
   virtual reconstruction of the largest environment, we showed that the
   rate of transition through this statistically stable population matches
   the rate of change in the animals' visual scene. Thus, place fields near
   boundaries were small but numerous, while in the environment's interior,
   they were larger but more dispersed. These results indicate that
   hippocampal spatial activity is governed by a small number of simple
   laws and, in particular, suggest the presence of an
   information-theoretic bound imposed by perception on the fidelity of the
   spatial memory system.},

Title = {A mechanism for exocyst-mediated tethering via Arf6 and PIP5K1C-driven
   phosphoinositide conversion},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2821+},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Polarized trafficking is necessary for the development of eukaryotes and
   is regulated by a conserved molecular machinery. Late steps of cargo
   delivery are mediated by the exocyst complex, which integrates lipid and
   protein components to tether vesicles for plasma membrane fusion.
   However, the molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly defined.
   Here, we reconstitute functional octameric human exocyst, demonstrating
   the basis for holocomplex coalescence and biochemically stable
   subcomplexes. We determine that each subcomplex independently binds to
   phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P-2), which is minimally
   sufficient for membrane tethering. Through reconstitution and epithelial
   cell biology experiments, we show that Arf6-mediated recruitment of the
   lipid kinase PIP5K1C rapidly converts phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
   (PI(4)P) to PI(4,5)P-2, driving exocyst recruitment and membrane
   tethering. These results provide a molecular mechanism of
   exocyst-mediated tethering and a unique functional requirement for
   phosphoinositide signaling on late-stage vesicles in the vicinity of the
   plasma membrane.},

Title = {Constraints in using relative biomass as a measure of competitive
   success in phytoplankton - A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {`The plankton paradox' view which contradicted competitive exclusion
   principle has been changing since the last decade. Current outlook based
   on the evidence from size scaling studies suggests that in a given
   nutrient regime, phytoplankton that are capable of efficient nutrient
   intake increases in biomass, perhaps leading to the exclusion of those
   with inefficient nutrient intake ability. Commonly observed higher
   biomass of larger cells (e.g., diatoms and dianoflagellates) in
   eutrophic environment and that of smaller cells (e.g.,picophytoplankton)
   in oligotrophic environment has been viewed as the competitive success
   of higher and lower size strata in respective nutrient gradients. We
   analyse the above view point sceptically, and share the opinion as
   follows. Conventional approach of using relative biomass as a measure of
   competitive success in phytoplankton could lead to underestimate the
   ecological success of smaller phytoplankton in eutrophic and mesotrophic
   waters. We also suggest that pico-phytoplankton that require very low
   nutrient quota can co-exist with larger cells by sharing a negligible
   part of the community niche, without exerting competition related
   pressure, irrespective of the nutrient status of the system. Similarly,
   large cells that are confined to the nutrient rich waters, can avoid
   competition with smaller algae by their exceptional nutrient storage
   ability. Consequently, there is a limitation in using relative biomass
   as a measure of competitive success in phytoplankton community. We also
   emphasis that in aquatic microbial world where all interactions occur at
   cellular level, difference in particle size could provide an additional
   mechanism to prevent competitive exclusion by facilitating resource
   partitioning and selective predation pressure.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Otoliths are very useful biomarkers especially for fish growth. Climate
   change with the associated global changes in warming and acidification
   could affect the calcification and the shape of otoliths during the
   crucial larval period in teleost fish. To evaluate this predicted
   combined effect of temperature and CO2, Atlantic herring (Clupea
   harengus) embryos and larvae were reared from hatching to respectively
   47 and 60 days post-hatching (dph), under present day conditions and a
   scenario predicted for the year 2100 (IPCC RCP8.5). Otolith
   morphogenesis was tracked by analyzing area and normalized Elliptical
   Fourier coefficients. We found that otolith area for fish of similar
   size increased under the predicted 2100 climate change scenario compared
   to the present day. Climate change does not, however, seem to directly
   affect the otolith shape. Finally, the onset of otolith morphogenesis is
   hardwired, but the relationship between otolith and fish size is
   environment-dependent.},

Title = {Rehabilitation promotes rapid recovery of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   in iron mining areas},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform important ecological
   functions in the rehabilitation of degraded areas, acting through
   several mechanisms, such as the production of glomalin-related soil
   proteins (glomalin), which act as cementing agents and nutritional
   reserves and sequester carbon in soil. The aim of the present study was
   to determine whether a short rehabilitation time influenced the soil AMF
   community diversity and glomalin production in areas undergoing
   rehabilitation after iron mining. We analyzed the number of spores,
   mycorrhizal colonization, AMF species richness, and concentrations of
   easily extractable and total glomalin-related soil proteins. Species
   richness was reduced by approximately 50 \% after mining activity.
   However, after the initial rehabilitation of degraded areas, we observed
   an increase in the number of spores, colonization, and AMF species.
   Families Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae were considered dominant in the
   studied areas. Glomus sp.1 and Acaulospora mellea were the most frequent
   morphotypes. The relationship between glomalin and the levels of
   dissolved organic carbon, total carbon, and total nitrogen in the soil
   was found to be an interesting and easily interpretable parameter of the
   influence of AMF on the storage of organic matter in the soil,
   indicating the degree of equilibrium and/or recovery of revegetated
   environments. Rehabilitation, even in early stages, favored
   im-provements in AMF status and provided increases in total
   glomalin-related soil protein production, which may have contributed to
   the enrichment of carbon and nitrogen in the soil. These characteristics
   are indicative of the success of the rehabilitation actions carried out
   in these areas after mining activity.},

Title = {Effects of phylogeny, traits, and seasonality on invertebrate herbivory
   damage in a meadow community},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invertebrate herbivory affects the composition of meadow communities by
   differentially decreasing the fitness of individual species. The ability
   of individual species to resist herbivore pressure depends on their
   traits, which are often phylogenetically structured, and changes
   seasonally. We conducted a field study assessing invertebrate herbivory
   damage of 17 selected plant species in an oligotrophic wet meadow,
   aiming to assess the effect of functional traits, specifically leaf dry
   matter content (LDMC), carbon content (C), nitrogen content (N),
   carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N), specific leaf area (SLA), and plant height
   on invertebrate herbivory damage, while taking into account seasonal
   dynamics of herbivory and phylogenetic relationships of studied species.
   Herbivory damage was different among individual species, with the
   biggest distinction between monocots and dicots. Herbivory was best
   predicted by LDMC, season, and interaction of height with season. After
   filtering the effect of common evolutionary history from the model, the
   effect of C, height, and interaction of C with season became
   significant. LDMC was the best trait predictor in both models. Unique
   relative contributions of phylogeny and traits to the model explained
   variability were 15.4\% and 33.9\%, respectively (with phylogeny using 3
   and traits 6 df), with their substantial overlap (35.7\%) emphasizing
   that traits are considerably phylogenetically structured. The effect of
   seasonality was rather minor (15\%). In this study, we point out to the
   strong interplay between traits, evolutionary history, and seasonal
   changes influencing herbivory damage and stress the importance of
   phylogenetic context when evaluating the effect of plant characteristics
   in plant-herbivore interactions.},

Title = {Environmental factors controlling structure, litter productivity, and
   phenology of mangroves in arid region of the Gulf of California},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems permanently contributing,
   through their litter productivity, with organic material into the
   superior trophic compartments. This research took place in three coastal
   lagoons on the southeast coast of the Gulf of California. The objective
   is to describe environmental factors controlling structure,
   phenological, and litter productivity in arid zone mangruves. The study
   sites were established along a latitudinal arid climate gradient, were
   evaporation (-3000 mm year(-1)) exceeds precipitation (-300 mm
   year(-1)), and a microtidal regime predominates. The study period was
   from June 2018 to May 2019. Litter productivity was quantified using
   litter traps, while piezometer were used to monitor surface,
   interstitial, and groundwater physicochemical properties and the water
   level. The different mangrove species present in the study area are
   influenced by high interstitial salinity, due to scarce freshwater
   inputs, because precipitation runoff is limited to the monsoon
   (June-August). The flowering phenophase started before the monsoon and
   peaked during the monsoon season, propagules production was highest in
   september and peaked from august to october (highest water level). Air
   and water temperature in warmer months influenced flower and propagules
   production. Despite the harsh environmental conditions provide a
   suboptimal scenario for mangroves to grow, resulting in low structural
   development and low litter productivity (-4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1))
   influenced by temperature, and water properties (i.e. temperature,
   salinity and ORP), precipitation and flood pattern. An important
   highlight of this research is the triggered phenological response to
   temperature (air and water), therefore the importance of long-term
   monitoring of such processes and variables.},

Title = {Evolutionary history of metazoan TMEM16 family},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most of Transmembrane protein 16 (TMEM16) family members function as
   either a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel (CaCC) or phospholipid scramblase
   (CaPLSase) and play diverse physiological roles. It is well conserved in
   eu-karyotes; however, the origin and evolution of different subfamilies
   in Metazoa are not yet understood. To uncover the evolutionary history
   of the TMEM16 family, we analyzed 398 proteins from 74 invertebrate
   species using evolutionary genomics. We found that the TMEM16C-F and J
   subfamilies are vertebrate-specific, but the TMEM16A/B, G, H, and K
   subfamilies are ancient and present in many, but not all metazoan
   species. The most ancient subfamilies in Metazoa, TMEM16L and M, are
   only maintained in limited species. TMEM16N and O are Cnidaria-and
   Ecdysozoa-specific subfamilies, respectively, and Ctenophora,
   Xenacoelomorpha, and Rotifera contain species-specific proteins. We also
   identified TMEM16 genes that are closely linked together in the genome,
   suggesting that they have been generated via recent gene duplication.
   The anoctamin domain structures of invertebrate-specific TMEM16 proteins
   predicted by AlphaFold2 contain conserved Ca2+-binding motifs and
   permeation pathways with either narrow or wide inner gates. The inner
   gate distance of TMEM16 protein may have frequently switched during
   metazoan evolution, and thus determined the function of the protein as
   either CaCC or CaPLSase. These results demonstrate that TMEM16 family
   has evolved by gene gain and loss in metazoans, and the genes have been
   generally under purifying selection to maintain protein structures and
   physiological functions.},

Title = {Phylogeography and taxonomy of Coleonyx elegans Gray 1845 (Squamata:

   environmental barrier},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Population divergence leading to speciation is often explained by
   physical barriers causing allopatric distributions of historically
   connected populations. Environmental barriers have increasingly been
   shown to cause population divergence through local adaptation to
   distinct ecological characteristics. In this study, we evaluate
   population structuring and phylogeographic history within the Yucat ` an
   banded gecko Coleonyx elegans Gray 1845 to assess the role of both
   physical and environmental barriers in shaping the spatio-genetic
   distribution of a Mesoamerican tropical forest taxon. We generated
   RADseq and multi-locus Sanger datasets that included sampling across the
   entire species' range. Results find support for two distinct
   evolutionary lineages that diverged during the late Pliocene and show
   recent population expansions. Furthermore, these genetic lineages
   largely align with subspecies boundaries defined by morphology. Several
   mountain ranges identified as phylogeographic barriers in other taxa act
   as physical barriers to gene flow between the two clades. Despite the
   absence of a physical barrier between lineages across the lowland
   Isthmus of Tehuantepec, no introgression was observed. Here, a steep
   environmental cline associated with seasonality of precipitation
   corresponds exactly with the distributional limits of the lineages,
   whose closest samples are only 30 km apart. The combination of molecular
   and environmental evidence, and in conjunction with previous
   morphological evidence, allows us to reassess the current taxonomy in an
   integrative framework. Based on our findings, we elevate the previously
   recognized subspecies from the Pacific versant, the Colima banded gecko
   C. nemoralis Klauber 1945, to full species status and comment on
   conservation implications.},

Title = {Polyhydroxy Acids as Fabaceous Plant Components Induce Oviposition of
   the Common Grass Yellow Butterfly, Eurema Mandarina},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {The common grass yellow butterfly, Eurema mandarina is a
   Fabaceae-feeding species, the females of which readily oviposit on
   Albizia julibrissin and Lespedeza cuneata in mainland Japan. We
   previously demonstrated that the methanolic leaf extracts of these
   plants, and their highly polar aqueous fractions strongly elicit female
   oviposition. Furthermore, the three subfractions obtained by
   ion-exchange chromatographic separation of the aqueous fraction have
   been found to be less effective alone, but synergistically stimulate
   female oviposition when combined. This indicates that female butterflies
   respond to multiple compounds with different acidity. We have previously
   identified d-pinitol from the neutral/amphoteric subfractions and
   glycine betaine from the basic subfractions as oviposition stimulants of
   E. mandarina. The present study aimed to identify active compounds in
   the remaining acidic subfractions of A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaf
   extracts. GC-MS analyses of trimethylsilyl-derivatized samples revealed
   the presence of six compounds in the acidic subfractions. In bioassays
   using these authentic chemicals, erythronic acid (EA) and threonic acid
   (TA) were moderately active in eliciting oviposition responses in E.
   mandarina, with their d-isomers showing slightly higher activity than
   their l-isomers. Female responsiveness differed between d-EA and l-TA,
   the major isomers of these compounds in plants, with the response to
   d-EA reaching a plateau at concentrations above 0.005\% and that to l-TA
   peaking at a concentration of 0.01\%. The natural concentrations of d-EA
   and l-TA in fresh A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaves were sufficient
   to stimulate oviposition. Furthermore, mixing 0.001\% d-EA or 0.001\%
   l-TA, to which females are mostly unresponsive, with 0.1\% d-pinitol
   resulted in a synergistic enhancement of the oviposition response. These
   findings demonstrate that E. mandarina females utilize both polyhydroxy
   acids, EA and TA, as chemical cues for oviposition.},

Abstract = {This study investigated effects of volatile blends released from
   undamaged (UD), insect-damaged {[}ID, plants fed by larvae of Spilosoma
   obliqua Walker (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae)] and mechanically-damaged (MD)
   plants of three green gram cultivars {[}PDM 54, Pusa Baisakhi and
   Samrat] including synthetic blends on the behavior of conspecific adult
   moths in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. Females showed attraction
   towards volatile blends of UD, ID and MD plants of these green gram
   cultivars against the control solvent (CH2Cl2). The components of
   volatile blends in UD plants of three green gram cultivars are not
   similar, but no any difference was found among three cultivars in term
   of the attractive effect on the insect moths when volatile blends from
   UD plants of these three cultivars were tested against one another.
   Females were more attracted towards volatile blends of ID plants of a
   particular cultivar compared to UD plants of the same cultivar. Total
   amount of volatiles was higher in ID plants than UD plants. Some
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles - (Z)-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol,
   (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 2-octanol and ocimene were attractive to the
   insect moths. Females were attracted towards three synthetic blends
   resembling amounts present in natural volatile blends of ID plants of
   these three cultivars in Y-tube olfactometer and wind tunnel bioassays,
   suggesting that involvement of host-specific chemical cues in long-range

Title = {New TNT routines for parallel computing with MPI},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic inference, which involves time-consuming calculations, is a
   field where parallelization can speed up the resolution of many
   problems. TNT (a widely used program for phylogenetic analysis under
   parsimony) allows parallelization under the PVM system (Parallel Virtual
   Machine). However, as the basic aspects of the implementation remain
   unpublished, few studies have taken advantage of the parallelization
   routines of TNT. In addition, the PVM system is deprecated by many
   system administrators. One of the most common standards for high
   performance computing is now MPI (Message Passing Interface). To
   facilitate the use of the parallel analyses offered by TNT, this paper
   describes the basic aspects of the implementation, as well as a port of
   the parallelization interface of TNT into MPI. The use of the new
   routines is illustrated by reanalysis of seven significant datasets,
   either recent phylogenomic datasets with many characters (up to
   2,509,064 characters) or datasets with large numbers of taxa (up to
   13,921 taxa).},

Title = {A comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the brachyuran crab superfamily
   Xanthoidea provides novel insights into its systematics and evolutionary
   history},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for the brachyuran crab
   superfamily Xanthoidea were estimated based on three mitochondrial and
   four nuclear genes to infer phylogenetic relationships and inform
   taxonomy. Habitat data was then used in conjunction with several
   diversification rates analyses (BAMM, BiSSE, HiSSE, and FiSSE) to test
   evolutionary hypotheses regarding the diversification of xanthoid crabs.
   The phylogenies presented are the most comprehensive to date in terms of
   global diversity as they include all four constituent families
   (Xanthidae, Panopeidae, Pseudorhombilidae, and Linnaeoxanthidae)
   spanning all oceans in which xanthoid crabs occur. Six Xanthoidea
   families are recognised. Panopeidae and Xanthidae sensu stricto are the
   two largest family-level clades, which are reciprocally monophyletic.
   Pseudorhombilidae is nested within and is here treated as a subfamily of
   Panopeidae. Former subfamilies or tribes of Xanthidae sensu lato are
   basally positioned clades in Xanthoidea and are here assigned
   family-level ranks: Garthiellidae, Linnaeoxanthidae, Antrocarcinidae,
   and Nanocassiopidae. The genera Linnaeoxantho and Melybia were recovered
   in separate clades with Linnaeoxantho being sister to the family
   Antrocarcinidae, while Melybia was recovered within the family
   Panopeidae. The existing subfamily classification of Xanthidae and
   Panopeidae is drastically restructured with 20 xanthid and four panopeid
   subfamilies provisionally recognised. Diversification-time analyses
   inferred the origin of Xanthoidea and Garthiellidae in the Eocene, while
   the other families originated during the Oligocene. The majority of
   genusand species-level diversification took place during the Miocene.
   Ancestral state reconstruction based on depth of occurrence (shallow vs.
   deep water) shows some ambiguity for the most recent common ancestor of
   Xanthoidea and Nanocassiopidae. The most recent common ancestors of
   Antrocarcinidae and Panopeidae were likely deepwater species, while
   those of Garthiellidae and Xanthidae were probably shallow-water
   species. Several shifts in net diversification rates were detected but
   they were not associated with depth-related habitat transitions.},

Title = {Phylogenomics reveals extensive introgression and a case of mito-nuclear
   discordance in the killifish genus Kryptolebias},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introgression is a widespread evolutionary process leading to
   phylogenetic inconsistencies among distinct parts of the genomes,
   particularly between mitochondrial and nuclear-based phylogenetic
   reconstructions (e.g., mito-nuclear discordances). Here, we used mtDNA
   and genome-wide nuclear sites to provide the first phylogenomic-based
   hypothesis on the evolutionary relationships within the killifish genus
   Kryptolebias. In addition, we tested for evidence of past introgression
   in the genus given the multiple reports of undergoing hybridization
   between its members. Our mtDNA phylogeny generally agreed with the
   relationships previously proposed for the genus. However, our
   reconstruction based on nuclear DNA revealed an unknown lineage
   -Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' - as the sister group of the self-fertilizing
   mangrove killifishes, K. marmoratus and K. hermaphroditus. All
   individuals sequenced of Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' had the same mtDNA
   haplotype commonly observed in K. hermaphroditus, demonstrating a clear
   case of mito-nuclear discordance. Our analysis further confirmed
   extensive history of introgression between Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' and K.
   hermaphroditus. Population genomics analyses indicate no current gene
   flow between the two lineages, despite their current sympatry and
   history of introgression. We also confirmed introgression between other
   species pairs in the genus that have been recently reported to form
   hybrid zones. Overall, our study provides a phylogenomic reconstruction
   covering most of the Kryptolebias species, reveals a new lineage hidden
   in a case of mito-nuclear discordance, and provides evidence of multiple
   events of ancestral introgression in the genus. These findings
   underscore the importance of investigating different genomic information
   in a phylogenetic framework, particularly in taxa where introgression is
   common as in the sexually diverse mangrove killifishes.},

Title = {Hermit crabs use vision, olfaction, and eavesdropping to detect
   potentially available gastropod shells on a natural rocky shore},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {559},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Intertidal marine crustaceans use multimodal cues to find resources,
   relying most heavily on chemical cues. However, water movement on
   intertidal shores acts as a sensory stressor, diluting and modifying the
   direction of waterborne chemicals, which may increase the relative
   importance of visual cues. We compared the influence of visual cues,
   chemical cues, and their combination in attracting free-living hermit
   crabs (Calcinus californiensis) to potentially available shells in
   shallow natural wave-protected tide pools. We used the tissue of dead
   gastropods as a chemical cue and clean, varnished shells as a visual cue
   from the gastropod species whose shell is most preferred by C.
   californiensis. The visual, chemical, or combined (bimodal) cue was
   placed in the center of a circular arena. We counted the crabs that
   entered the arena and classified their behavior into one of three
   mutually exclusive categories: touching the stimulus, remaining in the
   arena without reaching the stimulus, or leaving the arena without
   touching the stimulus. We ranked the quality of each hermit crab's
   current shell and recorded the time they took to reach the stimulus.
   Since more than one hermit crab participated in each trial in the field,
   we explored potential eavesdropping by comparing the time required to
   reach the stimulus among the first three hermit crabs. Cue type did not
   affect the number of crabs that entered the arena. However, most hermit
   crabs that entered the arena reached the chemical and bimodal shell
   cues; in contrast, with the visual cue alone most crabs remained in the
   arena without touching the stimulus, and those that touched it took
   longer to do so. Hermit crabs were more likely to touch the stimuli when
   a bimodal cue was presented in the arena and when they were in a broken
   shell (a low-quality refuge). Interestingly, there was only an apparent
   eavesdropping effect in the unimodal visual cue; subsequent crabs
   touched the visual stimulus more quickly once a pioneer crab had already
   touched it. Previous demonstrations that C. californiensis can visually
   discriminate shells suggest that the reduced number of crabs that
   touched the visual stimulus and their longer latency to do so was not
   due to low visual acuity or inability to interpret the image. Rather, it
   is likely due to the incongruous set of cues (visible shell without
   odor), which may reduce the perceived value or certainty about the
   shell, therefore the benefit/risk relationship in the natural
   environment. Our results highlight the importance of matching chemical
   sensing with vision as a trigger for decision-making in dynamic and
   unpredictable environments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9-10},

Abstract = {Honeydew is the keystone of many interactions between aphids and their
   predators, parasitoids, and mutualistic partners. Despite the crucial
   importance of honeydew in aphid-ant mutualism, very few studies have
   investigated the potential impacts of climate change on its production
   and composition. Here, we quantified changes in sugar compounds and the
   amount of honeydew droplets released by Aphis fabae reared on Vicia faba
   plants under elevated temperature and/or CO2 conditions. Following the
   combined elevation of these two abiotic factors, we found a significant
   increase in the fructose content of A. fabae honeydew, accompanied by
   nonsignificant trends of increase in total honeydew production and
   melezitose content. The environmental conditions tested in this study
   did not significantly impact the other honeydew sugar contents. The
   observed changes may be related to changes in phloem composition under
   elevated CO2 conditions as well as to increases in aphid metabolism and
   sap ingestion under elevated temperatures. Although limited, such
   changes in aphid honeydew may concurrently reinforce ant attendance and
   mutualism under elevated temperature and CO2 conditions. Finally, we
   discuss the enhancing and counteracting effects of climate change on
   other biological agents (gut microorganisms, predators, and parasitoids)

Title = {Fisheries restrictions and their cascading effects on herbivore
   abundance and macroalgae removal at Kenyan coral reefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {559},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The increase of macroalgae at degraded reefs impedes several ecosystem
   services and calls for effective methods to facilitate a return to coral
   dominance. Removal of macroalgae (browsing) is typically realized by
   fish, but the role and identity of browsers at the heavily-fished East
   African coast is still largely unknown. This study investigated how
   browsing pressure at Kenyan reefs (-4.700, 39.396) related to fisheries
   management and herbivore community. From October 2018 to January 2019,
   consumption during 24-h buffet assays using the brown macroalgae
   Sargassum and Padina was determined and video recorded at six sites: two
   in fished zones, two in marine reserves (traditional fishing allowed)
   and two in no-take zones. Herbivorous fish composition, biomass and sea
   urchin density were also determined. Consumption of Sargassum and Padina
   was nearly three-fold lower in the fished zones (26\% and 28\% of
   macroalgal biomass consumed, respectively) compared to the no-take zones
   (62\% and 82\%), with intermediate consumption in the marine reserves
   (48\% and 71\%). Herbivore biomass was seven-fold higher in no-take
   zones and included substantially more browsers (mainly unicornfishes,
   Naso spp.) and scrapers (scarids), which were associated with the higher
   browsing pressure. Browsers and scrapers were predominantly responsible
   for the consumption of macroalgae as determined by video recordings,
   though key species differed across sites. In contrast,
   damselfish-dominated fished sites were associated with high sea urchin
   densities and low browsing pressure. These results indicate that fishing
   restrictions are likely to support reef resilience by increasing
   herbivorous fish biomass of key species and thereby promote macroalgae
   removal.},

Title = {Slow and steady wins the race: Diversification rate is independent from
   body size and lifestyle in Malagasy skinks (Squamata: Scincidae:
   Scincinae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Most of the unique and diverse vertebrate fauna that inhabits Madagascar
   derives from in situ diversification from colonisers that reached this
   continental island through overseas dispersal. The endemic Malagasy
   Scincinae lizards are amongst the most species-rich squamate groups on
   the island. They colonised all bioclimatic zones and display many
   ecomorphological adaptations to a fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Here
   we propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for their diversification based
   on the largest taxon sampling so far compiled for this group. We
   estimated divergence times and investigated several aspects of their
   diversification (diversification rate, body size and fossorial lifestyle
   evolution, and biogeography). We found that diversification rate was
   constant throughout most of the evolutionary history of the group, but
   decreased over the last 6-4 million years and independently from body
   size and fossorial lifestyle evolution. Fossoriality has evolved from
   fully quadrupedal ancestors at least five times independently, which
   demonstrates that even complex morphological syndromes - in this case
   involving traits such as limb regression, body elongation, modification
   of cephalic scalation, depigmentation, and eyes and ear-opening
   regression - can evolve repeatedly and independently given enough time
   and eco-evolutionary advantages. Initial diversification of the group
   likely occurred in forests, and the divergence of sand-swimmer genera
   around 20 Ma appears linked to a period of aridification. Our results
   show that the large phenotypic variability of Malagasy Scincinae has not
   influenced diversification rate and that their rich species diversity
   results from a constant accumulation of lineages through time. By
   compiling large geographic and trait-related datasets together with the
   computation of a new time tree for the group, our study contributes
   important insights on the diversification of Malagasy vertebrates.},

Title = {Evolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in Pennatulacea},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We examine the phylogeny of sea pens using sequences of whole
   mitochondrial genomes and the nuclear ri-bosomal cluster generated
   through low coverage Illumina sequencing. Taxon sampling includes 30
   species in 19 genera representing 13 families. Ancestral state
   reconstruction shows that most sea pen mitochondrial genomes have the
   ancestral gene order, and that Pennatulacea with diverse gene orders are
   found in a single clade. The monophyly of Pennatulidae and Protoptilidae
   are rejected by both the mitochondrial and nuclear dataset, while the
   mitochondrial dataset further rejects monophyly of Virgulariidae, and
   the nuclear dataset rejects monophyly of Kophobelemnidae. We show
   discordance between nuclear ribosomal gene cluster phylogenies and whole
   mitochondrial genome phylogenies and highlight key Pennatulacea taxa
   that could be included in cnidarian genome-wide studies to better
   resolve the sea pen tree of life. We further illustrate how well
   frequently sequenced markers capture the overall diversity of the
   mitochondrial genome and the nuclear ribosomal genes in sea pens.},

Title = {Dual control of formin-nucleated actin assembly by the chromatin and ER
   in mouse oocytes},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The first asymmetric meiotic cell divisions in mouse oocytes are driven
   by formin 2 (FMN2)-nucleated actin polymerization around the spindle. In
   this study, we investigated how FMN2 is recruited to the spindle
   periph-eral ER and how its activity is regulated in mouse meiosis I (MI)
   oocytes. We show that this process is regu-lated by the Ran GTPase, a
   conserved mediator of chromatin signal, and the ER-associated protein
   VAPA. FMN2 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within a
   domain (SLD) previously shown to be required for FMN2 localization to
   the spindle periphery. FMN2 NLS is bound to the importin a1/b complex,
   and the disruption of this interaction by RanGTP is required for FMN2
   accumulation in the area proximal to the chro-matin and the MI spindle.
   The importin-free FMN2 is then recruited to the surface of ER around the
   spindle through the binding of the SLD with the ER-membrane protein
   VAPA. We further show that FMN2 is autoin-hibited through an
   intramolecular interaction between the SLD with the C-terminal formin
   homology 2 (FH2) domain that nucleates actin filaments. VAPA binding to
   SLD relieves the autoinhibition of FMN2, leading to localized actin
   polymerization. This dual control of formin-mediated actin assembly
   allows actin polymeriza-tion to initiate the movement of the meiotic
   spindle toward the cortex, an essential step in the maturation of the
   mammalian female gamete.},

Abstract = {Much of our understanding of navigation comes from the study of
   individual species, often with specific tasks tailored to those species.
   Here, we provide a novel experimental and analytic framework integrating
   across humans, rats, and simulated reinforcement learning (RL) agents to
   interrogate the dynamics of behavior during spatial navigation. We
   developed a novel open-field navigation task ({''}Tartarus maze{''})
   requiring dynamic adaptation (shortcuts and detours) to frequently
   changing obstructions on the path to a hidden goal. Humans and rats were
   remarkably similar in their trajectories. Both species showed the
   greatest similarity to RL agents utilizing a ``successor
   representation,{''} which creates a predictive map. Humans also
   displayed trajectory features similar to model-based RL agents, which
   implemented an optimal tree-search planning procedure. Our results help
   refine models seeking to explain mammalian navigation in dynamic
   environments and highlight the utility of modeling the behavior of
   different species to uncover the shared mechanisms that support
   behavior.},

Title = {A causal role for the human subthalamic nucleus in non-selective
   cortico-motor inhibition},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {17},
Pages = {3785+},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Common cortico-basal ganglia models of motor control suggest a key role
   for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in motor inhibition.1-3 In particular,
   when already-initiated actions have to be suddenly stopped, the STN is
   purportedly recruited via a hyperdirect pathway to net inhibit the
   cortico-motor system in a broad, non-selective fashion.4 Indeed, the
   suppression of cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) during rapid action
   stopping extends beyond the stopped muscle and affects even
   task-irrelevant motor representations.5,6 Although such non-selective
   CSE suppression has long been attributed to the broad inhibitory
   influence of STN on the motor system, causal evidence for this
   association is hitherto lacking. Here, 20 Parkinson's disease patients
   treated with STN deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and 20 matched healthy
   controls performed a verbal stop-signal task while CSE was measured from
   a task-unrelated hand muscle. DBS allowed a causal manipulation of STN,
   while CSE was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
   over primary motor cortex and concurrent electromyography. In patients
   OFF-DBS and controls, the CSE of the hand was non -selectively
   suppressed when the verbal response was successfully stopped. Crucially,
   this effect disappeared when STN was disrupted via DBS in the patient
   group. Using this unique combination of DBS and TMS during human
   behavior, the current study provides first causal evidence that STN is
   likely involved in non-selectively suppressing the physiological
   excitability of the cortico-motor system during action stop-ping. This
   confirms a core prediction of long-held cortico-basal ganglia circuit
   models of movement. The absence of cortico-motor inhibition during
   STN-DBS may also provide potential insights into the common side effects
   of STN-DBS, such as increased impulsivity.7-11},

Title = {A robust receptive field code for optic flow detection and decomposition
   during self-motion},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2505+},

Abstract = {The perception of optic flow is essential for any visually guided
   behavior of a moving animal. To mechanistically predict behavior and
   understand the emergence of self-motion perception in vertebrate brains,
   it is essential to systematically characterize the motion receptive
   fields (RFs) of optic-flow-processing neurons. Here, we present the
   fine-scale RFs of thousands of motion-sensitive neurons studied in the
   diencephalon and the midbrain of zebrafish. We found neurons that serve
   as linear filters and robustly encode directional and speed information
   of translation-induced optic flow. These neurons are topographically
   arranged in pretectum according to translation direction. The
   unambiguous encoding of translation enables the decomposition of
   translational and rotational self-motion information frommixed optic
   flow. In behavioral experiments, we successfully demonstrated the
   predicted decomposition in the optokinetic and optomotor responses.
   Together, our study reveals the algorithm and the neural implementation
   for self-motion estimation in a vertebrate visual system.},

Title = {Intergenerational effects of ocean acidification on reproductive traits
   of an estuarine copepod},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Copepods are an important part of the marine food web because of their
   high biomass productivity and nutrient turnover rate compared to other
   zooplankton in the marine ecosystem. Despite their great ecological role
   in the ocean, there is only limited information available on the
   consequences of ocean acidification (OA) induced by the future increase
   in CO2 on the planet. More specifically, there is almost no information
   about the impact of OA on the European copepod Calanipeda aquaedulcis
   Kritschagin, 1873. Therefore, the present investigation hypothe-sized
   that OA would not produce negative multigenerational effects on the
   survival and reproductive perfor-mance of this copepod species. Here we
   assessed, the multigenerational (F1 and F2) effect of OA on eight
   important reproductive traits (maturity, prosome length, fertility, egg
   release, hatching success, survival rate, reproductive performance, and
   the total number of adults per generation). For this study, C.
   aquaedulcis were collected from the Guadalquivir River (southwest of
   Spain) and were exposed to four different pH gradients (pH 8.1 as
   control and pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5 as acidified conditions) to mimic the
   future seawater acidification scenarios. The survival rate from nauplius
   to adult, C. aquaedulcis was significantly reduced by pHs and across
   generations. Besides, results also indicated that there were marked
   effects on fertility, reflected by a significantly lower number of eggs
   per female in each generation. Similarly, hatching success also showed a
   decreasing pattern towards low pH, and importantly, F1 females had lower
   hatching success than F0 females. While a beneficial parental effect was
   detected in the offspring in response to OA, it was insufficient to
   offset the negative effects caused by it. The findings presented here
   appear to have ecological significance, as decreasing the reproductive
   performance of copepods may have a negative impact on the marine food
   web, as ichthyofaunal feeding and growth are heavily reliant on this
   component of the food web.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Jesters, butterflies in the genus Symbrenthia Hubner, 1819, comprise 14
   species mainly distributed in the Oriental region. Although this genus
   has attracted the attention of many researchers in the past, its
   taxonomy and biogeographic history remain unclear. In this study, we
   investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships inferred from
   one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear genes (ArgKin, wingless), using
   both likelihood and Bayesian approaches. With the exception of S.
   hippalus, which we find to be either sister to Mynes Boisduval, 1832 or
   sister to Symbrenthia + Mynes + Araschnia, all species of Symbrenthia
   form a single monophyletic group. We describe a new genus Mynbrenthia
   Fric \& Rindos gen. nov. to accommodate the taxon hippalus. The genus
   Symbrenthia splits into four sub-groups, ``Brensymthia `` (with S.
   niphanda and S. sinoides), ``hypselis `` (with S. hypselis, S. brabira,
   S. leoparda and S. doni), ``intricata `` (with S. intricata and S.
   hypatia) and ``hippoclus `` group (including S. platena and a complex of
   S. hippoclus and S. lilaea). The genus probably originated in Sundaland
   or continental Asia during the Eocene. The history of the genus
   Symbrenthia was more influenced by dispersal events and then by
   subsequent vicariances. Whereas the ``hypselis `` group colonised the
   Indo-Australian Archipelago from the Asian continent, the ``hippoclus ``
   group dispersed to continental Asia from the Indo-Australian
   Archipelago.},

Abstract = {Plants have to allocate their resources in both growth and defense under
   different environmental challenges. Several plant species have become
   invasive particularly in disturbed fertile habitats, which may influence
   their resource allocation. We studied the effects of nitrate
   fertilization (low versus high) on various plant responses towards a
   pathogenic fungus, Alternaria brassicae, and a herbivorous insect
   species, Mamestra brassicae, in a population of Bunias orientalis, which
   is invasive in parts of central Europe. Aboveground biomass and leaf
   trichome density were enhanced in plants under high fertilization. In
   contrast, the short-term fungal infection and herbivory had no effect on
   aboveground biomass. Leaf water, nitrogen content and glucosinolate
   concentrations were neither affected by fertilization nor in response to
   antagonist attack. The total soluble sugar content, especially fructose,
   as well as leaf peroxidase activity increased significantly in leaves
   upon fungal infection, but independent of fertilization. Larval biomass
   gain and herbivore survival were likewise unaffected by fertilization.
   Our findings highlight that under conditions of high fertilization, B.
   orientalis plants allocate more resources into growth and morphological
   defenses than chemical defenses. In contrast, induced responses to
   short-term antagonist attack seem independent of nitrate availability in
   this population.},

Title = {A polarized supercell produces specialized metabolites in cannabis

Abstract = {For centuries, humans have cultivated cannabis for the pharmacological
   properties that result from consuming its specialized metabolites,
   primarily cannabinoids and terpenoids. Today, cannabis is a
   multi-billion-dollar in-dustry whose existence rests on the biological
   activity of tiny cell clusters, called glandular trichomes, found mainly
   on flowers. Cannabinoids are toxic to cannabis cells,1 and how the
   trichome cells can produce and secrete massive quantities of lipophilic
   metabolites is not known.1 To address this gap in knowledge, we
   inves-tigated cannabis glandular trichomes using ultra-rapid
   cryofixation, quantitative electron microscopy, and im-muno-gold
   labeling of cannabinoid pathway enzymes. We demonstrate that the
   metabolically active cells in cannabis form a ``supercell,{''}with
   extensive cytoplasmic bridges across the cell walls and a polar
   distribution of organelles adjacent to the apical surface where
   metabolites are secreted. The predicted metabolic role of the
   non-photosynthetic plastids is supported by unusual membrane arrays in
   the plastids and the localization of the start of the
   cannabinoid/terpene pathway in the stroma of the plastids. Abundant
   membrane contact sites connected plastid paracrystalline cores with the
   plastid envelope, plastid with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ER with
   plasma membrane. The final step of cannabinoid biosynthesis, catalyzed
   by tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS), was localized in the
   cell-surface wall facing the extracellular storage cavity. We pro-pose a
   new model of how the cannabis cells can support abundant metabolite
   production, with emphasis on the key role of membrane contact sites and
   extracellular THCA biosynthesis. This new model can inform synthetic
   biology approaches for cannabinoid production in yeast or cell cultures.},

Title = {Self-avoidance alone does not explain the function of Dscam1 in mushroom

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam1 into 38,016 isoforms provides
   neurons with a unique molecular code for self-recognition and
   self-avoidance. A canonical model suggests that the homophilic binding
   of identical Dscam1 isoforms on the sister branches of mushroom body
   (MB) axons supports segregation with high fidelity, even when only a
   single isoform is expressed. Here, we generated a series of mutant flies
   with a single exon 4, 6, or 9 variant, encoding 1,584, 396, or 576
   potential isoforms, respectively. Surprisingly, most of the mutants in
   the latter two groups exhibited obvious defects in the growth,
   branching, and segregation of MB axonal sister branches. This
   demonstrates that the repertoires of 396 and 576 Dscam1 isoforms were
   not sufficient for the normal patterning of axonal branches. Moreover,
   reducing Dscam1 levels largely reversed the defects caused by reduced
   isoform diversity, suggesting a functional link between Dscam1
   expression levels and isoform diversity. Taken together, these results
   indicate that canonical self-avoidance alone does not explain the
   function of Dscam1 in MB axonal wiring.},

Abstract = {Once a booming fishery in the Gulf of Maine, green sea urchin
   (Stronglocentrotus droebachiensis) catches declined drastically in the
   1990s and have remained low over the past couple decades. To monitor
   changes in urchin populations, settlement patterns of S. droebachiensis
   at sites in the northern (Eastport and Frazer Point, ME) and southern
   Gulf of Maine (York, ME and Isles of Shoals, NH) were recorded. From
   1994 to 2019, AstroTurf (R) panels attached to wire frames were
   intermittently laid on the ocean bottom at five sites along the Gulf of
   Maine in late spring and retrieved in the mid to late summer. The
   present study examined changes in recruitment densities over the 23-year
   period from 1996 to 2019 and found a drop in recruitment at the southern
   sites by two orders of magnitude over the time span. Aside from the
   likely pressure of overfishing, recruitment declines may be influenced
   by anthropogenic climate change and higher predation rates by Jonah
   crabs, Cancer borealis.},

Title = {Experimental effects of warming and epiphyte grazing on the
   ecophysiology of two seagrass morphotypes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {558},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seagrasses form important ecosystems providing essential provisioning
   and regulating services. They exhibit acclimative properties to contend
   with environmental change while intrinsic responses allow seagrasses to
   persist in sub-and supra-optimal temperatures, and are critical to
   understanding their ability to cope with a changing climate. An indoor
   mesocosm approach was used to investigate the effects of warming, i.e.
   mean summer (24 degrees C) and extreme (30 degrees C) temperatures, and
   epiphyte grazing on large-leaved and small-leaved morphotypes of a dwarf
   eelgrass (Zostera capensis) from a temperate lagoon habitat. Both
   morphotypes displayed similar responses under extreme temperatures with
   greater losses observed in shoot densities and total biomass compared to
   summer mean temperatures. However, higher photosynthetic rates and
   accumulations of carbon, nitrogen and phenolics were observed in
   small-compared to large-leaved plants. This suggests that small-leaved
   populations possess a larger propensity to store resources -a potential
   for resilience. Large-leaved populations appeared to have channelled
   resources towards growth suggesting a greater susceptibility to stress
   from e.g. fouling. Epiphyte biomass increased under extreme temperatures
   and, even though grazing had a positive effect on seagrass biomass under
   summer mean conditions, grazers did not regulate algal growth under
   extreme temperatures which may have been too rapid for grazer control.
   These findings indicate that seagrasses will be negatively affected by
   extreme warming with ensuing reductions in biomass, increasing their
   susceptibility to stressors. However, acclimation strategies including
   carbon and nitrogen stores provide high resilience potential and attest
   to a system's ability to cope with stress.},

Title = {Mesofauna community influences litter chemical trajectories during
   early-stage litter decay},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decomposition of organic material is moderated by both litter chemistry
   and decomposer communities. Chemical alteration of the litter occurs
   throughout decomposition, yet our understanding of the nature of
   chemical change during decomposition is limited, particularly beyond
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The decomposer food web likely interacts
   with these chemical changes in their basal resource to alter the
   trajectories of chemical changes during decay. To investigate how
   decomposer mesofauna influence patterns of litter chemical change
   throughout early stages of decay, we tracked mass loss, macro-and
   micronutrient elements, and fiber chemistry dynamics in Arizona sycamore
   (Platanus wrightii) leaves decomposed in a mesocosm of optimal decay
   conditions in a bio-tically diverse compost pile. By using litterbags of
   two different mesh sizes to manipulate the mesofauna gaining access to
   the litter, we identify how the complexity of the soil mesofauna
   community changes the trajectory of litter chemistry, beyond the typical
   focus on mass loss and N dynamics. Counter to many examples in the
   literature, the more abundant and complex arthropod community slowed
   mass loss and enhanced nutrient immobilization, perhaps due to
   competition and grazing pressure on the microbial community to
   immobilize N, P, and Ca sooner from the surrounding compost.},

Title = {Genomic analysis reveals strong population structure in the Giant Sydney
   Crayfish (Euastacus spinifer (Heller, 1865))},

Abstract = {Australia is home to over 140 species of freshwater crayfish (Decapoda:
   Parastacidae), representing a centre of diversity for this group in the
   Southern Hemisphere. Species delimitation in freshwater crayfish is
   difficult because many species show significant variation in colouration
   and morphology. This is particularly evident in the genus Euastacus,
   which exhibits large variations in colour and spination throughout its
   putative range. To understand this variation, we investigated the
   genetic diversity, population structure, phylogeny, and evolutionary
   timescale of the Giant Sydney Crayfish (Euastacus spinifer (Heller,
   1865)). Our data set is sampled from over 70 individuals from across the
   similar to 600 km range of the species, and includes a combination of
   two mitochondrial markers and more than 7000 single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nuclear genome. Data were also obtained
   for representatives of the close relative, Euastacus vesper McCormack
   and Ahyong, 2017. Genomic SNP analyses revealed strong population
   structure, with multiple distinct populations showing little evidence of
   gene flow or migration. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial data
   revealed similar structure between populations. Taken together, our
   analyses suggest that E. spinifer, as currently understood, represents a
   species complex, of which E. vesper is a member. Molecular clock
   estimates place the divergences within this group during the
   Pleistocene. The isolated and highly fragmented populations identified
   in our analyses probably represent relict populations of a previously
   widespread ancestral species. Periodic flooding events during the
   Pleistocene are likely to have facilitated the movement of these
   otherwise restricted freshwater crayfish within and between drainage
   basins, including the Murray-Darling and South East Coast Drainages. We
   present evidence supporting the recognition of populations in the
   southern parts of the range of E. spinifer as one or two separate
   species, which would raise the number of species within the E. spinifer
   complex to at least three. Our results add to the growing body of
   evidence that many freshwater crayfish exhibit highly fragmented,
   rangerestricted distributions. In combination with the life-history
   traits of these species, the restricted distributions exacerbate the
   threats already placed on freshwater crayfish, which are among the five
   most endangered animal groups globally.},

Title = {High sclerobiont calcification in marginal reefs of the eastern tropical
   Pacific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A sclerobiont is any organism capable of fouling hard substrates.
   Sclerobionts have recently received attention due to their notable
   calcium carbonate contributions to reef structures and potential to
   offset drops in carbonate budgets in degraded reefs. However, due to
   their encrusting nature, it is difficult to quantify net calcium
   car-bonate production at the level of individual taxonomic groups, and
   knowledge regarding the main environmental factors that regulate their
   spatial distributions is limited. In addition, the material types used
   to create experi-mental substrates, their orientations, and their
   overall deployment times can influence settlement and the composition of
   the resulting communities. Thus, comparative evaluations of these
   variables are necessary to improve future research efforts. In this
   study, we used calcification accretion units (CAUs) to quantify the
   cal-cium carbonate contributions of sclerobionts at the taxonomic group
   level and evaluated the effects of two frequently used materials
   {[}i.e., polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and terracotta (TCT) tiles] on the
   recruitment and calcification of the sclerobiont community in the
   tropical Mexican Pacific and the Midriff Island Region of the Gulf of
   California over 6 and 15 months {[}n = 40; 5 CAUs x site (2) x
   deployment time (2) x material type (2)]. The net sclerobiont
   calcification rate (mean +/- SD) reached maximum values at six months
   and was higher in the Mexican Pacific (2.15 +/- 0.99 kg m- 2 y-1) than
   in the Gulf of California (1.70 +/- 0.67 kg m- 2 y-1). Moreover, the
   calcification rate was slightly higher on the PVC-CAUs compared to that
   of the TCT-CAUs, although these dif-ferences were not consistent at the
   group level. In addition, cryptic microhabitats showed low calcification
   rates when compared to those of exposed microhabitats. Crustose
   coralline algae and barnacles dominated the exposed experimental
   surfaces, while bryozoans, mollusks, and serpulid polychaetes dominated
   cryptic surfaces. Regardless of the site, deployment time, or material
   type, barnacles made the greatest contributions to calcimass production
   (between 41 and 88\%). Our results demonstrate that the orientation of
   the experimental substrate, and the material to a lesser extent,
   influence the sclerobiont community and the associated calcification
   rate. Upwelling-induced surface nutrient levels, low pH levels, and the
   aragonite saturation state (omega Ar) limit the early cementation of
   reef-building organisms in the tropical Mexican Pacific and promote high
   bioerosion rates in corals of the Gulf of California. Our findings
   demonstrate that sclerobionts significantly contribute to calcium
   carbonate production even under conditions of high environmental
   variability.},

Abstract = {Silicon (Si) fertilization alleviates biotic stresses in plants. Si
   enhances plant resistance against phytophagous insects through physical
   and biochemical mechanisms. In particular, Si modifies jasmonic acid
   levels and the emissions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).
   Here, we investigated whether Si accumulation in the tissues of maize
   leaves modifies the emissions of constitutive and herbivore-induced
   plant volatiles, with cascade deterrent effects on oviposition site
   selection by Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Maize
   plants were cultivated in a hydroponic system under three Si
   concentrations, resulting in three groups of plants expressing different
   Si concentrations in their tissues (0.31 +/- 0.04, 4.69 +/- 0.49, and
   9.56 +/- 0.30 g Si. Kg(- 1) DW). We collected volatiles from undamaged
   and caterpillar-infested plants, and found that Si concentration in
   plant tissues had no significant impact. Jasmonic acid content was high
   in insect-infested plants, but was similar across all Si treatments.
   Oviposition site selection bioassays using fertilized S. exigua females
   showed that Si concentration in plant tissues did not affect the number
   of eggs laid on Si-treated plants. In conclusion, our study shows that
   the Si content in maize tissues does not impact the semiochemical
   interactions with S. exigua.},

Title = {Identification of the Sex Pheromone of the Pink Grass Worm, Tmetolophota

Abstract = {The pink grass worm, Tmetolophota atristriga (Walker), is an endemic New
   Zealand noctuid moth species that is abundant throughout the North and
   South Islands. The larvae are minor defoliators of agricultural pasture.
   We investigated the sex pheromone of this species. Analysis of extract
   of the female sex pheromone gland identified six compounds: two
   monounsaturated compounds, (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) and
   (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:Ac), three saturated compounds,
   hexadecanal (16:Ald), hexadecyl acetate (16:Ac) and octadecan-1-ol
   (18:OH), and a triene hydrocarbon, (3Z,6Z,9Z)-tricosatriene
   (Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy). Several field-trapping experiments testing combinations
   of the six compounds were conducted. Results suggested that males of two
   different populations of T. atristriga responded differently to
   different blends of the compounds. Males of one population responded
   equally to a two-component blend as to other blends, including the one
   with all six compounds. By contrast, males of the second population
   responded only to the six-component blend or a ternary blend of
   Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:Ac and Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy. In experiments testing different
   doses of Z11-16:Ald and Z11-16:Ac in a binary or a six-component blend,
   a 1 mg dose of the binary blend gave the greatest male catch for both
   populations. This is the second sex pheromone identification of a New
   Zealand species of Noctuidae and is the first reported occurrence of
   Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy as a sex pheromone component of any noctuid species.},

Title = {Alternative nitrogenase of Paenibacillus sonchi genomovar Riograndensis:
   An insight in the origin of Fe-nitrogenase in the Paenibacillaceae
   family},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Paenibacillus sonchi genomovar Riograndensis is a nitrogen-fixing
   bacteria isolated from wheat that displays diverse plant
   growth-promoting abilities. Beyond conventional Mo-nitrogenase, this
   organism also harbors an alternative Fe-nitrogenase, whose many aspects
   related to regulation, physiology, and evolution remain to be
   elucidated. In this work, the origins of this alternative system were
   investigated, exploring the distribution and diversification of
   nitrogenases in the Panibacillaceae family. Our analysis showed that
   diazotrophs represent 17\% of Paenibacillaceae genomes, of these, only
   14.4\% (2.5\% of all Paenibacillaceae genomes) also contained Fe or
   V-nitrogenases. Diverse nif-like sequences were also described,
   occurring mainly in genomes that also harbor the alternative systems.
   The analysis of genomes containing Fe-nitrogenase showed a conserved
   cluster of nifEN anfHDGK across three genera: Gorillibacterium,
   Fontibacillus, and Paenibacillus. A phylogeny of anfHDGK sepa-rated the
   Fe-nitrogenases into three main groups. Our analysis suggested that
   Fe-nitrogenase was acquired by the ancestral lineage of Fontibacillus,
   Gorillibacterium, and Paenibacillus genera via horizontal gene transfer
   (HGT), and further events of transfer and gene loss marked the evolution
   of this alternative nitrogenase in these groups. The species phylogeny
   of N-fixing Paenibacillaceae separated the diazotrophs into five clades,
   one of these containing all occurrences of strains harboring alternative
   nitrogenases in the Paenibacillus genus. The pan-genome of this clade is
   open and composed of more than 96\% of accessory genes. Diverse
   functional categories were enriched in the flexible genome, including
   functions related to replication and repair. The latter involved diverse
   genes related to HGT, suggesting that such events may have an important
   role in the evolution of diazotrophic Paenibacillus. This study provided
   an insight into the organization, distribution, and evolution of
   alternative nitrogenase genes in Paenibacillaceae, considering different
   genomic aspects.},

Abstract = {Hitherto, the phylogeny of ciliated protists, an important group of
   model organisms in many fields, has been mainly based on a single marker
   gene (SSU rDNA, nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene). However,
   there is increasing evidence showing this is insufficient to provide
   robust phylogenies and has resulted in confusing systematics in many
   ciliates groups. Among these, the phylogenies within family Deviatidae
   (Spirotrichea, Hypotrichia) are ambiguous due to the dependence on SSU
   rDNA and undersampling. Here, we provide eight new sequences and conduct
   phylogenetic analyses based on both multi-gene and single-gene to
   clarify evolu-tionary relationships among all deviatids for which gene
   sequence are available. The results reveal that: (1) the monophyly of
   Deviatidae is well-supported by both single-gene and concatenated data;
   (2) the presence of fine cirri and relatively wide spacing of these
   cirri within all rows are plesiomorphies of Deviatidae; (3)
   Pseudosincirra longicirrata is closely related to Deviata rositae, which
   is supported by their shared possession of dorsomarginal kineties; (4)
   phylogenetic analyses and approximately unbiased test based on
   multi-gene support a close rela-tionship among taxa lacking
   dorsomarginal kineties (D. parabacilliformis, D. multilineae nov. spec.,
   D. abbrevescens, D. brasiliensis and Perisincirra paucicirrata); (5)
   Deviatidae shows a close relationship with Dor-somarginalia and
   Strongylidium-Hemiamphisiella-Pseudouroleptus assemblage, suggesting the
   presence/absence of dorsomarginal kineties is phylogenetically
   informative in this family and presence of them may be a plesio-morphy.
   Based on the morphological, morphogenetic and phylogenetic data, the
   evolutionary relationships within Deviatidae are hypothesized, and a new
   ciliate, Deviata multilineae nov. spec., collected from China, is
   investigated.},

Title = {Resolving the deep phylogeny: Implications for early adaptive radiation,
   cryptic, and present-day ecological diversity of Papuan microhylid frogs},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The microhylid frogs of the New Guinea region are the largest and most
   ecologically diverse subfamily (Aster-ophryinae) of one of the largest
   anuran families in the world and can live in communities of up to 20
   species. While there has been recent progress in resolving the
   phylogenetic relationships of Asterophryinae, significant uncertainties
   remain, impeding further progress in understanding the evolution of
   microhabitat use, parental care, and life history variation in this
   group. In particular, the early divergences at the base of the tree
   remain unclear; as does the monophyly of some genera; and recent studies
   have discovered that species with wide geographic distribution are
   instead cryptic species complexes. In this study, we fortified
   geographic sampling of the largest previous phylogenetic effort by
   sequencing an additional 62 taxa and increased data quality and quantity
   by adding new layers of data vetting and by filling in previously
   incomplete loci to the five gene dataset (2 mitochondrial, 3 nuclear
   protein-coding genes) to obtain a dataset that is now 99\% complete in
   over 2400 characters for 233 samples (205 taxa) of Asterophryinae and 3
   outgroup taxa, and analyzed microhabitat use data for these taxa from
   field data and data collected from the literature. Importantly, our
   sampling includes complete community complements at 19 sites as well as
   representatives at over 80 sites across New Guinea and its offshore
   islands. We present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny which, for the
   first time, has over 95\% of nodes supported (84\% highly supported)
   whether using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference, allowing
   clarification of all genera (whether monophyletic or clearly not), their
   sister genera relationships, as well as an age estimate for the
   Asterophryinae at approximately 20MYA. Early generic diversification
   occurring between 17 and 12 MYA gave rise to a surprising diversity of
   about 18 genera as well as the 5 putative microhabitat types. Our tree
   reveals extensive cryptic diversity calling any widespread taxa into
   doubt, and clearly demonstrates that complex multispecies communities of
   Asterophryinae are ecologically diverse, are numerous, and of ancient
   origin across New Guinea. We discuss the implications of our phylogeny
   for explaining the explosive diversifi-cation of Asterophryinae as the
   result of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and non-adaptive
   radiation.},

Abstract = {Soil particle-size fractions play an important influence soil
   physico-chemical properties, microbial biomass processes as well as fine
   roots morphological traits in beech forest ecosystem. The objectives of
   study were to determine how soil texture interacts with soil
   physico-chemical properties and microbial biomass as well as fine roots
   traits in oriental beech forest in Guilan province, northern Iran. Five
   subplots of 400 m2 were randomly selected at a plot of 1 ha. At five
   different locations, soil samples were collected at depth of 0-20 cm and
   fine root samples were also taken from beech trees. Results indicated
   that clay content was positively correlated with carbon, carbon/nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio, and moisture, but negatively correlated with nitrogen (N)
   and phosphorous (P). Silt values had significant positive correlation
   with C/N, and negative correlation with N and P. The microbial biomass
   carbon/carbon (MBC/C) ratio in soil increased significantly with clay,
   but microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) decreased significantly with
   increasing clay. The MBC/C ratio decreased significantly with sand
   values in soil at depth 0-20 cm. Results showed that silt value of soil
   profile was negatively correlated with MBN, but positively with MBN/N
   ratio. Soil acidic phosphatase concentration was negatively correlated
   with clay content, but soil alkaline phosphatase was positively
   correlated with silt. Clay and sand contents were positively correlated
   with fine root density, fine root biomass, fine root length, and surface
   root area. Sand content was negatively correlated with fine root volume.
   The results of research, considering the correlation between soil
   particle-size fractions and some soil characteristics as well as fine
   root traits, show that soil texture in oriental beech forest can play an
   important role in forest stand dynamics.},

Title = {Toward finally unraveling the phylogenetic relationships of Juncaceae
   with respect to another cyperid family, Cyperaceae},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Juncaceae is a cosmopolitan family belonging to the cyperid clade of
   Poales together with Cyperaceae and Thurniaceae. These families have
   global economic and ethnobotanical significance and are often keystone
   species in wetlands around the world, with a widespread cosmopolitan
   distribution in temperate and arctic regions in both hemispheres.
   Currently, Juncaceae comprises more than 474 species in eight genera:
   Distichia, Juncus, Luzula, Marsippospermum, Oreojuncus, Oxychloe center
   dot, Patosia and Rostkovia. The phylogeny of cyperids has not been
   studied before in a complex view based on most sequenced species from
   all three families. In this study, most sequenced regions from
   chloroplast (rbcL, trnL, trnL-trnF) and nuclear (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) genomes
   were employed from more than a thousand species of cyperids covering all
   infrageneric groups from their entire distributional range. We analyzed
   them by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference to
   revise the phylogenetic relationships in Juncaceae and Cyperaceae. Our
   major results include the delimitation of the most problematic
   paraphyletic genus Juncus, in which six new genera are recognized and
   proposed to recover monophyly in this group: Juncus, Verojuncus, gen.
   nov., Juncinella, gen. et stat. nov., Alpinojuncus, gen. nov.,
   Australojuncus, gen. nov., Boreojuncus, gen. nov. and Agathryon, gen. et
   stat. nov. For these genera, a new category, Juncus supragen. et stat.
   nov., was established. This new classification places most groups
   recognized within the formal Juncus clade into natural genera that are
   supported by morphological characters.},

Title = {The significance of recent diversification in the Northern Hemisphere in
   shaping the modern global flora revealed from the herbaceous tribe of
   Rubieae (Rubiaceae)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The global herbaceous flora is probably shaped by both ancient and/or
   recent diversification, companied with the impacts from geographic
   differences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Therefore,
   its biogeographic pattern with respect to temporal and spatial
   divergence is far from full understanding. Tribe Rubieae, the largest
   herbaceous tribe in the woody-dominant Rubiaceae, provides an excellent
   opportunity for studying the macroevolution of worldwide colonization.
   Here, we aim to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Rubieae with
   regard to climate fluctuation and geological history in the Cenozoic. A
   total of 204 samples of Rubieae representing all the distribution areas
   of the tribe were used to infer its phylogenetic and biogeographic
   histories based on two nrDNA and six cpDNA regions. The ancestral area
   of Rubieae was reconstructed using a time-calibrated phylogeny in RASP
   and diversification rates were inferred using Bayesian analysis of
   macroevolutionary mixtures (BAMM). Our results show Rubieae probably
   originated in European region during the middle Oligocene, with the two
   subtribes separating at 26.8 million years ago (Ma). All the genera in
   Rubieae formed separate clades between 24.79 and 6.23 Ma. The ancestral
   area of the subtribe Rubiinae was the Madrean-Tethyan plant belt and the
   North Atlantic land bridge (NALB) provided passage between North America
   and Europe for Rubiinae. The subtribe Galiinae clade originated in
   Europe/central Asia during the late Oligocene. Two diversification
   shifts were detected within Rubieae in the late Neogene. Most extant
   Rubieae species diverged recently during the Neogene within clades that
   generally were established during the late Paleogene. The tribe shows
   complex migration/dispersal patterns within the North Hemisphere
   combined with multiple recent dispersals into Southern Hemisphere. Our
   results highlighted the important role of recent biogeographic
   diversification in the Northern Hemisphere in shaping the modern global
   herbaceous flora during the latest and rapid worldwide expansion in the
   Neogene.},

Abstract = {Bathycoelia distincta (Pentatomidae) is the dominant pest in South
   African macadamia orchards, where adults are responsible for causing
   severe yield losses. Similar to other hemipterans, B. distincta release
   volatile compounds from scent glands that can deter natural enemies and
   act as an alarm signal among conspecifics. The overall aim of this study
   was to characterise the alarm pheromone of B. distincta. We: (i)
   analysed the scent gland contents of individual adult B. distincta by
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (ii) quantified volatiles
   released from live stink bugs after stress, and (iii) evaluated the
   electrophysiological and behavioural activity of alarm pheromone
   compounds with dose-response experiments. A blend of fourteen compounds
   was identified in the scent gland extracts of adult stink bugs. Of
   these, six compounds were detected in the effluvia of live stressed
   stink bugs {[}(E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, tridecane, dodecane,
   (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal and (E)-2-decenyl acetate]. No qualitative or
   quantitative differences were observed between sexes. Tridecane was the
   most abundant compound, comprising similar to 50\% of total secretions.
   Only (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal elicited an
   antennal response in both sexes. Finally, exposure to a mixture of
   (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal resulted in an
   increase in the speed and distance travelled by walking bugs and a
   decrease in time spent resting compared to unexposed bugs. Our results
   show that the blend of (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-decenal, and
   (E)-4-oxohex-2-enal can induce an alarm response in B. distincta.},

Title = {Sea Lamprey Alarm Cue Comprises Water- and Chloroform- Soluble
   Components},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {A diversity of aquatic organisms manage predation risk by avoiding
   waters activated with conspecific alarm cues, a chemical mixture
   released from injuries. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a
   nocturnal migratory species that relies on its alarm cue to navigate
   around areas of predation risk when moving through river channels.
   Identification of the cue's chemistry would allow managers to harness
   this innate behavioral response to guide migrating sea lamprey to traps
   (invasive population in the Laurentian Great Lakes) or to fish passage
   devices where dams block migrations in their native range. We pursued
   isolation of the sea lamprey alarm cue through behaviorally guided
   fractionation, fractionating the alarm cue into water-soluble and
   chloroform-soluble fractions, each of which elicited a substantial
   avoidance response. Recombining the two fractions restored full
   reactivity, suggesting the alarm cue mixture contains components that
   exhibit high solubility in water (e.g., nitrogenous compounds),
   chloroform (e.g., lipids), or perhaps materials that dissolve readily in
   either solvent. We further screened 13 individual compounds or pure
   isolates and 6 sub-fractions from the water-soluble fraction and found
   one of the pure isolates, isoleucine, evoked an avoidance response on
   its own, but not consistently when found in other mixtures. In a third
   experiment, we observed no behavioral response after recombining 32
   compounds isolated and identified from the water-soluble fraction. These
   results confirm other suggestions that the process of elucidating alarm
   cue constituents is challenging. However, we suggest the pursuit is
   worthwhile given the strong evidence for the utility of alarm cues for
   use in the conservation and management of fishes and other aquatic
   organisms.},

Title = {Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of
   Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {11-12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism
   is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate
   intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain
   defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes
   (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is
   unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have
   intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on
   maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of
   endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in
   the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe
   occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids
   known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated
   the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration,
   resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass.
   Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines
   in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants.
   There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect
   increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic
   plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than
   their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not
   affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the
   progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic
   regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this
   regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont.
   Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and
   non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence
   of herbivores.},

Title = {Sponges sneeze mucus to shed particulate waste from their seawater inlet

Abstract = {Sponges, among the oldest extant multicellular organisms on Earth,1 play
   a key role in the cycling of nutrients in many aquatic ecosystems.2-5
   They need to employ strategies to prevent clogging of their internal
   filter system by solid wastes,6-8 but self-cleaning mechanisms are
   largely unknown. It is commonly assumed that sponges remove solid waste
   with the outflowing water through distinct outflow openings (oscula).3,9
   Here, we present time-lapse video footage and analyses of sponge waste
   revealing a completely different mechanism of particle removal in the
   Caribbean tube sponge Aplysina archeri. This sponge actively moves
   particle-trapping mucus against the direction of its internal water flow
   and ejects it into the surrounding water from its seawater inlet pores
   (ostia) through periodic surface contractions that have been described
   earlier as ``sneezing. ``10,11 Visually, it appears as if the sponge is
   continuously streaming mucus-embedded particles and sneezes to shed this
   particulate waste, resulting in a notable flux of detritus that is
   actively consumed by sponge-associated fauna. The new data are used to
   estimate production of detritus for this abundant sponge on Caribbean
   coral reefs. Last, we discuss why waste removal from the sponge inhalant
   pores may be a common feature among sponges and compare the process in
   sponges to equivalent mechanisms of mucus transport in other animals,
   including humans.},

Abstract = {Autophagy is a conserved, multi-step process of capturing proteolytic
   cargo in autophagosomes for lysosome degradation. The capacity to remove
   toxic proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative disorders attests to
   the disease-modifying potential of the autophagy pathway. However,
   neurons respond only marginally to conventional methods for inducing
   autophagy, limiting efforts to develop therapeutic autophagy modulators
   for neurodegenerative diseases. The determinants underlying poor
   autophagy induction in neurons and the degree to which neurons and other
   cell types are differentially sensitive to autophagy stimuli are
   incompletely defined. Accordingly, we sampled nascent transcript
   synthesis and stabilities in fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs), and iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons), thereby uncovering a
   neuron-specific stability of transcripts encoding myotubularin-related
   phosphatase 5 (MTMR5). MTMR5 is an autophagy suppressor that acts with
   its binding partner, MTMR2, to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides
   critical for autophagy initiation and autophagosome maturation. We found
   that MTMR5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress autophagy in iNeurons
   and undifferentiated iPSCs. Using optical pulse labeling to visualize
   the turnover of endogenously encoded proteins in live cells, we observed
   that knockdown of MTMR5 or MTMR2, but not the unrelated phosphatase
   MTMR9, significantly enhances neuronal degradation of TDP-43, an
   autophagy substrate implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases.
   Our findings thus establish a regulatory mechanism of autophagy
   intrinsic to neurons and targetable for clearing disease-related
   proteins in a cell-type-specific manner. In so doing, our results not
   only unravel novel aspects of neuronal biology and proteostasis but also
   elucidate a strategy for modulating neuronal autophagy that could be of
   high therapeutic potential for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.},

Title = {Tree visitation and potential seed dispersal of keystone Ficus species
   by vertebrates in an urban mosaic landscape in eastern South Africa},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Globally with the human population increase, urban expansion has
   increased, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Visitation of
   fruiting trees by vertebrate frugivores can influence the persistence of
   fleshy fruited trees and so further maintain frugivore communities in
   transformed landscapes. Figs (Ficus spp.) have been recognised as
   keystone plant resources that support diverse frugivorous vertebrate
   communities. Our main objective was to identify the frugivorous
   vertebrates visiting fruiting Ficus trees in an urban mosaic landscape
   of Durban, Ethekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using
   camera traps focused on focal fig trees. We quantified the diurnal and
   nocturnal frugivore visitation rates and levels of interactions. We
   analysed frugivore visits to 12 individual trees of five Ficus species
   between 2019 and 2020. During 3888 h, we recorded a total of 4,071
   videos from camera traps with 10,016 visits and levels of interactions
   of three main vertebrate taxa (8958 fruit bat visits, 808 bird visits
   and 250 monkey visits). These were in five Ficus species (F. buriei, F.
   lutea, F. natalensis, F. sur and F. sycomorus). Of the bird species
   visiting, we identified a total of 34 species, but some species were
   unidentified. We recorded a total of 8958 visits by Wahlberg's
   epauletted fruit bats Epomophorus wahlbergi, and 250 visits by vervet
   monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus. The latter tended to stay for prolonged
   periods in the trees feeding. Our data showed the importance of fruiting
   fig trees for vertebrate frugivores in the urban mosaic landscape. This
   highlights the conservation implications of figs as keystone resources
   in the urban mosaic landscape. Our findings support the planting and
   conservation of native Ficus tree species in transformed urban mosaic
   landscapes for the persistence of forest species biodiversity.},

Title = {Does the consumption of pioneer-tree seeds from flooded forests by
   freshwater sardines affect seed germination?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To understand the ecological relevance of fish-forest interactions, we
   sampled fish for a period of 8 months in a lowland forest of the
   Brazilian Amazon and evaluated the germination of intact seeds recovered
   from the in-testine of three species of congeneric and sympatric
   freshwater sardines, Triportheus albus, T. angulatus and T. auritus. The
   number of seeds consumed by the three fish species and the possible
   effect of individual fish size on seed germination were investigated. We
   captured 150 individual sardines, of which N = 59, contained 982 intact
   seeds from seven flooded forest tree species. All the seeds were already
   pulped due to the digestive process and were sown to check its
   germination rates. We selected two pioneer tree species, Cecropia
   latiloba and Laetia corymbulosa, which were the two most consumed seeds
   to analyze the effects of its passage through the fishes' digestory
   tracts on seed germination rates and speed, compared to intact seeds
   directly collected from trees (control). Seeds harvested from the wild
   were not scarified or scrapep to remove the pulp because of the large
   amount of diminutive seeds of the two pioneer tree species. Fish body
   size did not affect the probability of germination of the consumed seeds
   of C. latiloba or L. corymbulosa. For both plant species, there was a
   reduction in the probability of germination of seeds taken from the
   intestine of fish in relation to control seeds collected in nature.
   Control seeds also germinated faster than those consumed by fish.
   Despite the seemingly negative effects on germination rates and speed
   after passing through the digestory tracts of the freshwater sardines,
   the fishes' ability to transport seeds away from the parent plants can
   compensate for the loss of viability of some of the ingested seeds,
   especially when the proportion of viable seeds remains high.},

Title = {How are arthropod communities structured in a modified wetland under
   different productive activities?},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems around the world due
   to changes in land use. Particularly, in the Lower Parana River Delta
   the main productive activities with economic impact in the region are
   planted forest and silvopastoral systems. To carry out these productive
   activities, natural hydrology of this wetland has been deeply modified
   and different management practices are implemented. Ground-dwelling
   arthropods are among the most sensitive taxa to environmental changes,
   so they are good bioindicators of the effect of these changes on
   biodiversity. In this context, we compare the structure and composition
   of ground-dwelling arthropod communities and their seasonal variations
   in the planted forest and silvopastoral systems of the Lower Parana
   River Delta, to characterize these land use associated with different
   management practices. We recorded a total of 73 families using pitfall
   traps (N = 1728). We observed that communities in intensive-managed
   planted forests were less rich and more evenness, while communities in
   less-managed planted forests were richer and less evenness. Also, we
   observed that warm seasons presented more arthropod family richness than
   cold seasons. The intensity of management practices, the presence of
   cattle and seasonality are factors that significantly decrease
   ground-dwelling arthropod richness. So, Silvopastoral systems negatively
   affect ground-dwelling arthropod communities compared to planted forest.
   A decrease in the intensity of management practices favors the
   understory growth, offering more resources for the arthropod families
   already established and facilitating the establishment of new ones. This
   increase in arthropod diversity promotes the presence of benefic species
   and the conservation of biodiversity in this modified wetland ecosystem.},

Title = {Reasons to move far away: studying the drivers of Carpetania matritensis
   (Hormogastridae: Crassiclitelatta) dispersal behaviour},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dispersal is a crucial process for animal populations as it allows the
   colonisation of new habitats and the maintenance of genetic diversity.
   However, it has not been studied enough for soil fauna, which is the
   basis for a wide variety of ecosystem services. Therefore, the study of
   their dispersal and the factors that trigger this behaviour is a
   relevant area of knowledge for the maintenance of the services they
   provide. For this work, Carpetania matritensis, an endogeic earthworm
   species endemic to the central Iberian Peninsula, has been used as a
   model to study the effect of habitat quality and conspecific density on
   dispersal and exploratory behaviour. The experiment was carried out in
   horizontal mesocosms divided into three sectors of the same dimensions:
   an inoculation section (left), a crossing section (centre) and a target
   sector (right). Those sectors were occupied by soil, a favourable
   habitat for earthworms, or sand, which represents an unsuitable habitat
   for earthworms and a physical barrier for their displacement. Earthworms
   were inoculated at two different densities (2 and 6 in-dividuals per
   mesocosm; 848.86 and 2546.58 individuals/m3 respectively) and at two
   experimental durations (4 and 8 days) for each of the three different
   experimental treatments (unsuitable-unsuitable-suitable (U-U-S),
   suitable-unsuitable-suitable (S-U-S) and suitable-suitable-suitable
   (S-S-S), depending on the habitat type filling the inoculation, crossing
   and target section respectively). The results showed a large effect of
   treatment on the dispersal rate, being higher when earthworms were
   inoculated in an adverse environment, establishing habitat quality as a
   driver of the species' dispersal behaviour. No significant effects of
   conspecific density, experimental duration or its interactions were
   found. Further studies are needed to clarify the species dispersal
   behaviour with a view to its conservation.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the effect on litter decomposition of the
   geographical and land-use gradient from the dry Cerrado in Mato Grosso
   to the southern Amazonian rainforest in Par ` a, Brazil. The study area
   also rep-resents a gradient of land-use intensification, reaching from
   the southern Cerrado region which had the most active land use change
   and agricultural intensification in the past to the northern rainforest
   region where agricultural use is currently intensifying. We assessed the
   effects on litter decomposition of climate (seasonality: rainy vs dry),
   litter quality (litter type: standard maize litter vs local habitat
   litter), disturbance (land-use: forest vs pasture vs cropland), soil
   organisms (soil fauna: inclusion vs exclusion), and original land
   cover/vegetation gradient (region: savanna vs transitional zone vs rain
   forest). Our results showed that the contribution of the different soil
   organism groups (mesh size) to litter decomposition was strongly
   influenced by the change in land -use, but also by the original
   land-cover/vegetation of the region. The overall effect of climate
   seasonality on decomposition was particularly pronounced at higher
   latitudes, whereas at lower latitudes only minimal effects were found.},

Title = {A Synthetic Blend of Fruit and Live Yeast Odours Shows Promise for

Abstract = {Tephritid fruit flies are major horticultural pests of fruit and
   vegetable crops. Developing an odour lure that can attract mated female
   flies under field conditions has presented a major challenge to chemical
   ecologists around the globe. We have designed a new lure to attract
   female Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, based on the knowledge
   that this pest tephritid is attracted not only to odours from ripening
   fruits, but also to odours of symbiotic (gut-associated) yeasts on which
   the larvae feed. Initial field trials screened four volatile mixtures,
   each containing a base mix of three, short-chain ``fruit ripening{''}
   esters and differing in the addition of long-chain ``fruity{''} esters
   and / or alcohols produced by live yeasts. Results demonstrated that the
   lure formulated from short-chain esters and live yeast alcohols
   attracted the most female flies, with significantly higher catches than
   an odourless control trap, and a protein-baited trap. As
   electrophysiological studies exploring peripheral responses in
   tephritids to alcohols associated with fermentation have not been
   extensively investigated, we conducted this work on both the antennae
   and maxillary palps, and discovered that three yeast alcohols were
   detected by both sensory organs. Performance trials conducted in pome
   fruit and stone fruit orchards evaluated the six-component blend of
   short-chain ester and live yeast alcohol lure against a commercially
   available synthetic fruit-odour lure and a protein-based lure. In the
   apple orchard, the new lure caught significantly more female flies, and
   in particular mated females, compared to the commercially available
   lures. In the stone fruit orchard, while the new lure again caught the
   most mated female flies compared to the other lures, differences were
   not significant. The visual stimulus (trap design) used had a
   significant effect on capture, with a Ladd trap (red sphere on a yellow
   panel) being considerably more effective than the other traps. We
   discuss the implications of this study, including why the degree of
   effectiveness of the new lure might have differed among the test
   orchards (citrus, apple, stonefruit), and why yeast odours might
   increase attractiveness to ``ripening fruit{''} volatile blends under
   field conditions.},

Abstract = {Litter decomposition is a crucial biochemical process in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Litter mixture consisting of litter from multiple plant
   species may have non-additive decomposition rates relative to litter of
   single-species. The litter-mixing effect (LME) on the decomposition
   process in plants has been explored widely. Allelopathic effects from
   leaf litter of invasive plants may suppress growth in neighbouring
   species. Yet, few studies have examined the association between the
   effects of allelopathy on plant invasions and changes in litter
   decomposition. To test the relationship between allelopathy and LME
   during litter decomposition, we conducted both field and greenhouse
   experiments. The allelopathic effect of invasive Solidago canadensis and
   native Pterocypsela laciniata was tested on lettuce (Lactuca sativa)
   using litter extracts. We found that overall invasive litter had a
   strong allelopathic effect before litter decomposition compared with
   native litter. Litter extracts in the mixed and single treatments showed
   both additive and non-additive effects on seed germination and seedling
   growth in lettuce. Invasive and native litter significantly increased
   total inorganic nitrogen content (NO3--N and NH4+-N), and decreased soil
   pH value, total phenolics, and total flavonoids after litter
   decomposition under field conditions. Additionally, the effect of litter
   types on germination and growth varied between the field and the
   greenhouse. These findings demonstrate a general relationship between
   plant performance indices and non-additive responses to allelopathy and
   suggest that the incubation site may be an important factor in
   successful invasions.},

Title = {Chemometric analysis of the seasonal variation in the essential oil

Abstract = {Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. ex Britton \& P. Wilson is an aromatic shrub
   native and not endemic to Brazil, popularly known as lemon balm, and
   widely used throughout Brazil in folk medicine. This study aimed to
   evaluate the influence of climatic parameters on the yield,
   radical-scavenging, and chemical composition of the L. alba essential
   oil. The specimen was collected monthly from August/2021 to May/2022.
   Essential oils (EOs) were obtained by hydrodistillation, and GC-MS
   analyzed their chemical composition. Chemometric analyses were performed
   to verify the climatic influences on the yields, chemical composition,
   and radical-scavenging apacity on L. alba EOs. The radical-scavenging
   capacity was performed by the DPPH radical-scavenging method. The lowest
   oil yield was obtained in October (0.6\%) and the highest in March
   (2.2\%). The average yields in the dry season (August-February, 1.1 +/-
   0.3\%) did not show a statistical difference with the rainy season
   (April-May, 1.7 +/- 0.5\%). On the other hand, there was a strong and
   significant correlation between oil yields and humidity (r = 0.79),
   precipitation (r = 0.77) and insolation (r =-0.76). Oxygenated
   monoterpenoids (44.4-66.8\%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenoids
   (11.1-26.4\%) were predominant in the EOs. The major constituents in the
   EO were geraniol (21.0-46.9\%, average 37.5 +/- 8.0\%) and elemol
   (9.0-22.2\%). The average amounts of geraniol in the dry season (37.9
   +/- 5.8\%) did not show statistical difference with the rainy season
   (36.5 +/- 13.7\%). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation
   between geraniol and elemol amounts with climatic param-eters. The PCA
   analysis showed a separation between the samples from the dry and rainy
   seasons, and classified them into three groups: groups I and III (rainy
   season) and group II (dry season). Geraniol standard content showed a
   moderate correlation (r = 0.52) with antioxidant capacity. However, L.
   alba EOs showed low anti-oxidant capacity against DPPH radicals (<8.6\%,
   148.5 mg. ET/g). The constant chemical composition of the studied
   specimens, along with low environmental influence, suggests that
   seasonal changes do not alter the phytotherapeutic effects.},

Title = {Floral synomone components of fruit fly-attracting orchids, Bulbophyllum
   sinapis and B. hahlianum, in Papua New Guinea},

Abstract = {Papua New Guinea (PNG) is known as the center of diversification of the
   largest orchid genus Bulbophyllum. In order to understand the ecological
   adaptation mechanisms in two closely related Dacini fruit fly-attracting
   orchids species, B. sinapis and B. hahlianum, their floral synomone
   components were examined. Flowers of B. sinapis attract males of various
   agricultural pest fruit fly species, such as Bactrocera musae and Ba.
   umbrosa, with methyl eugenol (a phenylpropanoid). However, flowers of B.
   hahlianum, attract fruit fly males belonging to a more diverse group of
   cue-lure-responsive species, namely, Ba. frauenfeldi, Ba. bryoniae and
   Zeugodacus cucurbitae with a mixture of phenylbutanoids including anisyl
   acetone (AA), raspberry ketone (RK) and zingerone (ZN). Contents of the
   volatiles in floral parts of both species were quantified. The highest
   contents of floral volatiles were detected in the lateral sepals of both
   the Bulbophyllum species. Attractant activity of synthetic AA, RK and ZN
   was examined in a local habitat in East New Britain. Furthermore, male
   flies attracted to B. hahlianum were found to sequester RK in the body
   tissues in varying quantities, which suggests its role as a sex
   pheromonal component to attract conspecific females as in the case of
   other Dacini fruit fly species through pharmacophagous acquisition of
   the orchid synomone.},

Abstract = {Medicinal plants represent an enormous potential source of chemical
   derivatives with many therapeutic prop-erties whose variability is
   modified by exogenous factors. The present research focused on the
   evaluation of the effects of solvents with different polarities
   (hydro-methanolic, hydro-ethanolic, hydro-acetonic, and aqueous) and the
   extraction methods: maceration extraction (ME), and ultrasound-assisted
   extraction (UAE) on the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid
   content (TFC), and total condensed tannins (TCT) in Cupressus
   semper-virens L., Juniperus phoenicea L., Mentha rotundifolia (L.) Huds,
   and Asphodelus microcarpus Salzm. \& Viv. extracts. The toxicity by
   contact of the plant extracts obtained against Tribolium castaneum
   (Herbst) adults was studied. The quantitative characterization revealed
   significant differences (p <0.05) in the secondary metabolites of the
   different extracts analyzed depending on the method and solvent used.
   The result of the contact test indicated that the hydro-acetonic
   extracts obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction exhibited the
   strongest insecticidal power with a corrected mortality of 59.25 +/-
   6.41\% and 51.72 +/- 11.54\% for C. sempervirens L. and J. phoenicea L.,
   respectively, and a mortality rate of 66.66 +/- 5.77\% was recorded for
   the hydro-methanolic extract of M. rotundifolia (L.) Huds. While in A.
   microcarpus Salzm. \& Viv., the highest mortality rate (33.33 +/-
   7.07\%) was registered in the hydro-acetonic extract obtained by
   maceration. The results show that there is a strong rela-tionship
   between the efficacy of extracts as biopesticides and their abundance in
   biomolecules.},

Title = {Based on multiple environmental factors to explore the habitat
   distribution of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) in different time and
   space},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a traditional medicinal plant, licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) with
   high medicinal and economic value and its demand is increasing around
   the world. In recent decades, the endless human excavation and climate
   change have reduced the natural habitat of licorice. Identifying the
   suitable habitat of licorice and climatic factors is crucial to
   formulating effective protection and management strategies. This study
   simulated the suitability geographic distribution of licorice in the
   current period by combining climate and topographic variables and
   predicted the possible changes in suitable habitats for licorice under
   different climate warming scenarios (RCP8.5, 6.0, 4.5, 2.6) in the
   future (2041-2080) based on Maxent and ArcGIS models. The study results
   showed that annual average temperature, temperature seasonality, annual
   precipitation and elevation were the primary eco-factors influencing the
   spatial distribution of licorice. Currently, the high, medium and low
   suitable areas of licorice are 108.87 x 104 km2, 70.29 x 104 km2 and
   122.80 x 104 km2, respectively. These habitat regions were mainly
   distributed in the northwest, northeast and north of China. The research
   found that the habitat suitability and habitat range of licorice will
   increase in the future, while the potentially highly suitable habitat
   will decrease and the habitat fragmentation will increase with the
   intensification of global warming. The analysis results can provide a
   theoretical reference for the formulation of protection strategies and
   the selection of suitable planting areas for licorice.},

Title = {Earthworms regulate the nematode community by directly enhancing the

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Earthworms and their casts act as biocatalysts and regulators of the
   biotic and abiotic processes in soil ecosys-tems. However, the relative
   importance of the presence of earthworms and earthworm casts in
   affecting other soil biota remains underexplored. In this study, we
   conducted a manipulative mesocosm experiment in a 30-year -old
   subtropical broadleaved plantation forest to determine how epi-endogeic
   earthworms (Amynthas corticis) and their casts affect soil nematode
   communities individually and additively. We found that the addition of
   the epi-endogeic earthworms significantly increased the proportion of
   the Ba1 guild nematodes and enhanced the enrichment index of the soil
   nematode community, but decreased the channel index. These results
   indicate that the soils become enriched in nutrients with a higher
   activity in bacterial-based decomposition pathways in the presence of
   earthworms. However, cast addition alone had a minor effect on soil
   nematodes. Results of a redundancy analysis suggest that elevated
   contents of soil ammonium and available phosphorous were the major
   influencing factors on soil nematode abundances in the presence of
   epi-endogeic earthworms. Our results indicate that epi-endogeic
   earthworms rather than through their casts contributed to the
   structuring of the nematode communities and enhancing of the
   bacterial-based energy channel. This finding contributes to our
   understanding of soil biodiversity maintenance mechanisms and how the
   relationship of the soil biota affects their functions in soil food
   webs.},

Title = {Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil
   attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon},
Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in
   the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density,
   and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to
   intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity,
   and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers,
   are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The
   slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in
   Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other
   regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its
   potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with
   soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in
   the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often
   used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by
   land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates
   the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch
   system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density,
   and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical
   and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and
   secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil
   fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity
   and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional
   groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with
   slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change.
   Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth
   forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil
   invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their
   conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show
   the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance
   the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil
   quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of
   soil functionality and agriculture productivity.},

   flavanone 16. It is the first time they were isolated from the green
   propolis of Caatinga M. tenuiflora. Flavonols 2-3, and 5-11, and
   flavanones 14-16 were first isolated from the genus Mimosa related
   materials, as well as ermanin (2), axillarin (5), eriodictyol 5-O-methyl
   ether (13), and 5,4'-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (14) have never

Title = {Variation in essential oil composition within and among Tunisian Thymus

   factors and incidence on antiacetylcholinesterase and antioxidant
   activities},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {106},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The variation of the essential oil composition of fourteen Tunisian
   Thymus algeriensis populations and their antioxidant and
   antiacetylcholinesterase activities were assessed. At the species level,
   alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, caryophyllene oxide and carvacrol
   were the main compounds. Significant variation in the essential oil
   composition was observed between populations according to ecological
   factors. Six chemotypes were revealed
   (1,8-cineole-beta-panasinsene/1,8-cineole/caryophyllene
   oxide/1,8-cineole-camphor-caryophyllene
   oxide/1,8-cineole-camphor-caryophyllene oxide-terpenyl
   acetate/carvacrol) with the distinction of upper arid populations (Ta 13
   and Ta 14) with the dominance of carvacrol chemotype. The occurrence of
   the carvacrol was positively correlated to the evapotranspiration,
   summer drought stress and the temperature of the warmest months of the
   year.High chemical intrapopulation variability was also observed,
   revealing the presence of seven chemotypes (carvacrol/terpenyl
   acetate/caryophyllene oxide/linalool-linalyl
   acetate/1,8-cineole-beta-panasinsene/1,8-cineole/ 1,8-cineole-camphor).
   The level of antioxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase activity was
   linked to their chemical composition difference. The best activities
   were revealed for populations Ta 13 and Ta 14 from the most arid zones,
   characterized by their carvacrol richness.},

Title = {Anatomical and physiological systematics of Capparis decidua (Forsskal.)
   Edgew from different habitats of Cholistan Desert, Pakistan},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Capparis decidua a medicinal shrub belonging to the family Capparaceae,
   grows abundantly in wild regions of Asia, Africa, and Saudi Arabia. Due
   to its medicinal and nutritional value, a study on anatomical and
   physio-logical adaptations under various desert habitats was conducted.
   Results revealed that plants in saline areas showed significant
   anatomical and physiological modifications particularly in stem and
   roots show better sur-vival under the harsh saline conditions of the
   desert. It was noted that the root epidermis thickness was not affected
   in a slightly saline environment as it showed no significant increasing
   or decreasing trend in the cross-section of the plant population from
   non-saline to slightly saline (p > 0.05) while it increased
   significantly in plants growing at highly saline (p < 0.05). Whereas
   endodermis cell area differs significantly between plants growing at all
   selected study sites it increased continuously with a rise in the
   salinity level of the soil (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, water storage capacity
   and reduction of water loss in the stem area, epidermis, and
   sclerenchyma were also recorded. In a highly saline environment, results
   intimate the deduction of photosynthetic pigments, an increase in total
   soluble proteins, total free amino acids, total soluble sugars, and
   proline, and a rise in stem and root tissue Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-
   contents and meanwhile, accumulation of secondary metabolites (Phenolics
   and flavonoids). These anatomical and physiological adaptations in
   natural populations appear to be very important for their better
   survival in a harsh saline desert environment. It was concluded that C.
   decidua was found in all different edaphic habitats of the Cholistan
   Desert, due to its adaptive features, which were very obvious in this
   plant and highly saline site.},

   adaptive response to salinity stress},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {102},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plant secondary metabolites, including essential oils, are very
   important in the adaptive responses to stress conditions. Salt stress is
   a major element in natural saline habitats. Plants adapted to variations
   in substrate salinity (such as facultative halophytes) are very suitable
   for comparative analysis of the adaptive response under saline
   conditions on natural habitats. Based on their distribution on both
   saline and non-saline habitats, Teucrium scordium L. and Mentha pulegium
   L. were selected to determine the potential importance of essential oil
   components in the adaptive response to salt-induced stress conditions as
   stress-related metabolites. Quantitativequalitative analysis of
   essential oils in plant material of the tested species sampled from two
   saline habitats was performed and compared with samples from non-saline
   habitat. The prepared plant material of T. scordium and M. pulegium was
   hydrodistilled using a Clevenger-type apparatus by standard procedure.
   Volatile compounds were analyzed by GC/MS. The qualitative composition
   of the T. scordium and M. pulegium essential oils are related to the
   substrate salinity. The results obtained for the composition of the
   essential oils indicate that the adaptive response is specific and can
   be taxonomically related. Both analyzed plants are characterized by the
   increased synthesis of individual components of essential oil that are
   potentially important in the adaptive response to saline stress
   conditions. The adaptive response to saline stress of the analyzed
   plants includes increased synthesis of individual components of
   essential oils. Essential oil components such as alpha-pinene,
   beta-pinene, beta-caryophyllene, limonene and caryophyllene oxide, as
   well as piperitenone, pulegone, isopulegone are important in the
   adaptive response on saline habitats for T. scordium and M. pulegium,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {The present work was undertaken to investigate chemical constituents and
   chemotaxonomic significance from the seeds of Raphanus sativus L. As a
   result, sixteen compounds including sinapoyl derivatives (1-7) and
   indoles (8-16) were yielded, and their chemical structures were
   elucidated by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopic methods, along with the
   comparison with relevant literature data. Of note, ethyl
   2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-indole-3-acetate (compound 11) was a new natural
   product. Three compounds (12, 13, and 16) were first isolated from the
   genus Raphanus; while five compounds (5, 9, 10, 14, and 15) were first
   reported from the family Brassi-caceae. In addition, the chemotaxonomic
   significance of isolated compounds was also discussed.},

Abstract = {Microbial resistance, industrial and agricultural wastes are the major
   concerning problems of today's world. Herein is a highly efficient
   incubated ZnO-Fe2O3-Co3O4 nanocomposite derived from Cordia myxa through
   a green chemistry approach. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was
   confirmed the peak on 508 and 387 with the energy bandgap of 2.2eV for
   I-NC. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) revealed the diffraction pattern
   of incubated nanocomposites (I-NC) that ZnO showed hexagonal, while
   Co3O4 and Fe2O3 showed cubic structure. SEM ana-lyses show the patterns
   comprising the crystal morphology of flower-ZnO, agglomerated Fe2O3
   spongy rhom-bohedral Co3O4. The results of antibacterial activity show
   that the I-NC have a greater value of zone of inhibition (ZOI) against
   bacterial strains than NC, with the highest percentage in this trend
   P-aeruginosa94\%>S-aureus91\%>K-pneumonia89\%>E-coli87\%>P-vulgaris81\%.
   The photocatalytic activity data showed that the Methy-lene Blue, Methyl
   Orange, Rhodamine-B, P-Nitroaniline, and Cresol Red dyes were degraded
   in the presence of I -NC catalysts after sunlight irradiation. The
   degradation efficiencies of I-NC show the trend Methylene Blue (99.98\%)
   > P-Nitroaniline (99.97\%) > Rhodamine-B (99.86\%) > Cresol Red
   (99.80\%) > Methyl Orange (99.6\%). This study reported that the use of
   the Cordia myxa for the formulation of incubated nanocomposite could be
   employed as a novel antibacterial agent to inhibit bacterial growth and
   biofilm formation and photo -catalytic agent.},

   Ceratonia siliqua L. provenances},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In the present study, Tunisian carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) pulp samples
   harvested from ten different geographic regions (Bizerte, Beja, Ariana,
   Ben Arous, Jendouba, Siliana, Zeghouan, Nabeul, Sousse, Kairouan) were
   analyzed for their bioactive phytochemical content and antioxidant
   activities. Total phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), condensed tannins
   (CT) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteau, aluminium trichloride
   (AlCl3) and vanillin assays, respectively. Significant variations (p <
   0.05) in total polyphenols (TPC), flavonoids (TFC) and condensed tannins
   (CT) contents were observed between the analyzed provenances. The
   highest levels of TPC (23.11 mg GAE/g DR) and TFC (10.58 mg CE/g DR)
   were detected in Kairouan site, whereas Beja sample exhibited the higher
   amount of CT (3.75 mg CE/g DR). Reversed phase RP-HPLC analysis revealed
   that gallic acid (501.26-1628.46 mg/kg), ellagic acid (398.85-940.53
   mg/kg) and isoquercetin (264.79-817.61 mg/kg) were the major phenolics
   in all studied extracts, with concentrations varying significantly
   according to the geographical origin. Using total antioxidant capacity,
   DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, carob pulp extracts were found to have
   substantial antioxidant activities, which were correlated to their
   phenolic contents. Multivariate statistical analysis (PCA) performed on
   phenolic profiles and antioxidant activities revealed three distinctive
   groups of samples. It was concluded that Ceratonia siliqua L.. pulp from
   lower semi-arid and upper arid regions of Tunisia presented appreciable
   amount of phenolic compounds and high antioxidant capacities. This
   resource deserves further attention mainly for its high potential in
   culinar, pharmaceutical and cosmetic utilisations.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim of this work was the chemical profiling of six Stachys taxa from
   Balkan Peninsula: S. recta subsp. nitens, S. atherocalyx, S. beckeana,
   S. zepcensis (all four belonging to S. recta group), S. alpina subsp.
   dinarica and S. plumosa. Dry ethanol extracts of aerial flowering plant
   parts were qualitatively and quantitatively charac-terized for their
   phenolic composition using the HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS technique. In total, 44
   phenolic compounds were detected, belonging to three main classes of
   constituents: phenolic acids, phenylethanol glycosides (PhGs) and
   flavonoids. Chlorogenic acid was the main phenolic acid in all samples.
   Regarding PhGs, in all investigated extracts acteoside and
   lavandulifolioside were present. In S. recta group, extracts of S.
   atherocalyx, S. recta subsp. nitens and S. beckeana showed similar
   pattern considering phenylethanol glycosides, while S. zepcensis
   contained only the two aforementioned compounds. PhGs profile of S.
   plumosa extract comprised the same compounds from S. recta group, but it
   was also characterized by the presence of few high-molecular compounds.
   PhGs composition of S. alpina subsp. dinarica extract was somewhat
   similar with those of S. recta group and also with S. plumosa, but still
   specific by the presence of echinacoside and leucosceptoside A. The main
   flavonoids in extracts of Stachys recta group as well as in S. alpina
   subsp. dinarica extract were 8-hydroxyflavone glycosides
   (7-O-allosylglucosides of isoscutellarein and hypolaetin and their 4 \&
   PRIME;-methyl derivatives). In addition, in the extract of S. alpina
   subsp. dinarica two luteolin-7-O-hexosides were also present. On the
   other hand, S. plumosa extract differed consider-ably containing mainly
   derivatives of chrysoeriol and apigenin, while 8-hydroxyflavones
   (isoscutellarein de-rivatives) were detected in traces. The results
   confirmed the importance of flavone 7-O-allosylglucosides at the
   sectional level of Stachys genus.},

Title = {Evaluation of acute toxicity of carbosulfan and its sub-lethal effects
   on protein patterns of Cyprinus carpio (L.) using SDS-PAGE},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Among all types of water pollutants, pesticides are of the greatest
   concern. Carbosulfan is one such carbamate pesticide extensively
   employed in rural communities, that enters the aquatic environment by
   the proximity of agricultural lands to water bodies or through direct
   application in such environments. The consequences of these sublethal
   pollutants/toxicants exposures can be quantified in terms of
   biochemical, physiological, or the fish organism's histological
   reactions. Proteins have a unique role in cell metabolism and proteomic
   analysis provides valuable information when variations that occur within
   the proteome of organisms are compared as a conse-quence of biological
   perturbations or external stimuli. The study's goal was to investigate
   the acute toxicity of carbosulfan and its influence on electrophoretic
   protein patterns in the tissues of Cyprinus carpio. Fingerlings of C.
   carpio were subjected to various carbosulfan concentrations ranging from
   2.6 mg/L to 4.6 mg/L for 96 h, and acute toxicity was determined as 3.41
   mg/L. The comparison of the 96 h LC50 values between fish species shows
   that C.carpio is more resistant to carbosulfan. SDS-PAGE was performed
   on muscle, liver, gill, and brain tissues after exposing fish to two
   sublethal concentrations (1/10th and 1/5th of the 96 h LC50) in a
   semi-static system for 3 weeks. The intensity of protein subunits in
   carbosulfan-exposed tissues decreased, and some protein subunits
   disappeared. Carbosulfan attacks proteins having two or more domains
   easily in low concentrations, and as concentration increases, it begins
   to attack single domain proteins as well. Variations in protein subunits
   band patterns due to protein deprivation, proteolysis, or maybe
   insufficient amino acid incorporation into the poly -peptide chain. The
   study concludes that carbosulfan provides a larger risk to the animal
   and alters the entire physiology of the fish. Given the importance of
   fish in human nutrition, biological monitoring of water and fish meat
   should be done frequently to ensure the continued safety of freshwater
   food. To prevent these pesticides and other toxins from entering the
   environment, safe disposal and recycling of domestic sewage and
   industrial wastes should be practiced and precautions should be taken
   while using even low concentrations of carbosulfan, and prohibiting or
   restricting carbosulfan usage is preferable.},

Abstract = {Globally, Ocimum species are widely grown aromatic crops for its herb \&
   essential oils. In India, it is the most promising and demanding crop
   for farmers and industries. The study was aimed to compare the varieties
   of Ocimum species majorly grown in sub-tropical humid climatic
   condition. The selected varieties were Angana and Ayu of Ocimum
   tenuiflorum L., Saumya, Snigddha, and Surabhi of Ocimum basilicum L.,
   and Jyoti of Ocimum africanum Lour. An open field experiment was
   conducted in Randomized Complete Block design (RCBD) in Kharif (July
   2020 and 2021) at CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic
   Plants (CIMAP), Research Centre, Pantnagar (Udham Singh Nagar)
   Uttarakhand, India. Results indicated a wide range of variations in the
   essential oil composition of different variaties. Varieties `Angana' and
   `Ayu' were found to be rich in eugenol, and `Sur-abhi', `Saumya', \&
   `Snigddha' were rich in linalool, methyl chavicol, methyl cinnamate,
   respectively, and Jyoti in citral content. With respect to other
   parameters, Saumya variety performed the best in terms of herb yield and
   essential oil yield, whereas, Jyoti for seed yield. Based on their
   performance, their economic analysis was also done. `Surabhi', `Saumya',
   and `Snigddha' resulted in higher return for dry herb yield, `Angana'
   and `Ayu' for oil production \& `Jyoti' for seed production.},

Abstract = {The changing climatic condition of the world significantly affecting the
   average grain yield of wheat crop. In the present study, fifty-six wheat
   genotypes including checks (Akbar-2019 and Barani-2017) were tested
   under drought stress. The crop was grown under rainfed conditions (only
   pre-sowing irrigation was applied at the time of land preparation)
   following alpha lattice design with two replications at Wheat Research
   Institute, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan during 2020-21. Several yield
   and yield contributing traits were examined under drought stress. The
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) depicted significant differences among all
   traits which showed existence of great variation among them. Pearson's
   correlation studies showed significant positive correlation of yield (kg
   ha(-1)) with spike length (0.98{*}{*}), flag leaf area (0.97{*}{*}),
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at booting (0.87{*}{*})
   and grain filling stage (0.97{*}{*}). Similarly, bi-plot analysis also
   revealed association of yield (kg ha(-1)) with spike length (cm), flag
   leaf area (cm(2)), NDVI at booting and NDVI at grain filling stage under
   drought stress condition. Estimation of canopy temperature at grain
   filling stage expressed negative relationship with yield (-0.11) under
   drought stress. Genotypes V-19274 (4536.2 kg ha(-1)) and V-19177 (4450.5
   kg ha(-1)) were found best regarding yield and its contributing traits
   (spike length and flag leaf area) under drought stress. Cluster analysis
   separated the wheat genotypes in to four groups. Among all clusters the
   group four expressed high magnitude of yield (5163.4 kg ha(-1)). The
   genotypes in this cluster expressed high magnitudes of spike length
   (15.18 cm), flag leaf area (64.03 cm(2)), grain filling period (40.5
   days), NDVI at booting (0.81) and NDVI at grain filling stage (0.72),
   while showed lower magnitude regarding plant height (97 cm), days to
   50\% maturity (141.5), days to 50\% heading (101) and canopy temperature
   at grain filling stage (21.55) as compared to other three clusters. The
   identified wheat genotypes can be further used in different wheat
   breeding programs for water deficient conditions in changing climate
   scenario of the region to develop drought tolerant wheat cultivars.},

Title = {Antifungal diterpene from Rhizome of wild bornean ginger, Hornstedtia
   havilandii (Zingiberaceae)},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hornstedtia havilandii (K. Schum.) belongs to the ginger (Zingiberaceae)
   family and is one of the nine reported species of Hornstedtia in Borneo.
   It is widely used as an important resource in traditional healing and
   cultural practices by the tribal communities. Rhizome of H. havilandii
   was extracted in ethanol and its biologically active antifungal
   metabolite was isolated via bioassay-guided separation technique.
   Isolated compound was subjected to spectroscopy measurements and the
   structure was elucidated as (E)-labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial (1).
   Although 1 was identified as a previously published compound, we were
   able to differentiate and assign the chemical shift values for two
   overlapping carbons; C-4 and C-18 via Gaussian processing of the 13C-NMR
   data, and consequent 2D NMR assignments. The antifungal activities were
   seen against crustacean pathogenic fungal strains Lagenidium
   thermophilum, Haliphthoros sabahensis, and Haliphthoros milfordensis as
   MIC value of <82.78 mu M (25 mu g/mL) while Fusarium solani and Fusarium
   oxysporum required <165.56 mu M (50 mu g/mL). In addition, this is the
   first record of H. havilandii that produces labdane type diterpene. Data
   revealed here could be used as an important chemotaxonomic marker for
   this genus.},

   essential oil yield},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study aimed to see how fly ash (FA) and vermicompost (VC)
   proportions affected lemongrass growth characteristics, essential oil
   yield, and quality. The application of 10\% Fly ash with 90\%
   vermicompost produced considerably greater biomass yield (69.7t/ha) and
   essential oil yield (429.3 kg/ha) than the rest of the cultivar,
   followed by 20\% FA + 80\% VC (68.5 t/ha and 401.2 kg/ha), respectively
   and 100\% VC (68.3 t/ha and 371.0 kg/ha), respectively. Citral content,
   a combination of isomeric aldehydes such as neral and geranial, was used
   to determine lemongrass oil's quality. Geranial and neral concentrations
   of more than 75\% are considered high-grade essential oils. Geranial and
   neral were our research's most important essential oil components. All
   treatments except zero fertilizer, i.e., control, had higher geranial
   and neral content (\%). However, the concentration of geranial and
   geranyl acetate in lemongrass is unaffected by treatment among these
   many treatments. 10\% FA + 90\% VC had greater gross return, the net
   return, and B: C ratios than the remainder of the treatment, followed by
   20\% FA + 80\% VC and 100\% VC). In the meantime, there was no
   discernible variation in bulk density (mg m(-3)) or infiltration rate
   (cm hr(-1)). However, a considerable difference was seen concerning
   porosity, with 100\% VC recorded significantly higher porosity (52.8\%)
   than the rest of the treatment.},

Volume = {105},

Abstract = {Trachyspermum ammi seed is an important spice and aromatic herb due to
   its bioactive essential oil. Drought stress and Azotobacter chroococcum
   have also been reported to improve medicinally important biomolecules
   and secondary metabolite content in plants. The present study was
   undertaken to determine the ability of A. chroococcum in combination
   with drought stress to improve the anticancer potential of T. ammi seed
   essential oil. The overall results indicated that several compounds in
   T. ammi seeds essential oil increased following A. chroococcum bacteria
   treatment under slight drought stress (irrigation at 80\% field
   capacity), thus improving the antiradical efficacy. Furthermore, the
   application of A. chroococcum as plant growth promoting agent together
   with slight drought stress significantly (p < 0.05) resulted in a
   remarkable decrease in tumor size, diminish the liver enzymes activities
   and lipid peroxidation potential in mice inoculated with TUBO cell line
   (breast cancer cell). The up-regulated caspase-3 gene expression also
   confirms the results as well. Our finding revealed that slight drought
   stress (irrigation at 80\% field capacity) together with treatment of T.
   ammi plant with A. chroococcum bacteria could be a promising approach to
   improving the pharmaceutical properties of T. ammi seeds' essential oil.},

Title = {Comparative monosaccharide profiling for taxon differentiation: An
   example of Icelandic edible seaweeds},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Edible seaweeds are usually sold as flakes or even powers, and
   morphological identification of seaweed taxa is difficult. Water-soluble
   polysaccharides (WSPs) in edible seaweeds are not only interesting
   functional food in-gredients (e.g. gel-forming property, health
   benefits), but also useful for seaweed taxon differentiation. The
   current study aims to explore the utility of monosaccharide profiling of
   WSPs in seaweed differentiation. We developed a high-performance liquid
   chromatography-photodiode array detection for monosaccharide
   deter-mination, and characterized monosaccharide profiles of WSPs from
   five edible seaweeds sold in Iceland (i.e. kombu Iceland - Laminaria
   hyperborea, sugar kelp - Saccharina latissima, dulse - Palmaria palmata
   and two types of nori labelled as Porphyra sp. and Pyropia sp.).
   Monosaccharide profiling data reflected both the complexity and
   quantitative differences of WSPs. The seaweed dulse showed the highest
   concentrations of total sugar (ca. 16 mM), followed by kombu (ca. 12
   mM). From monosaccharide profiling of red algae, it was found that
   galactose (ca. 81-87\% of total sugars) and xylose (ca. 65-77\% of total
   sugars) are the dominant sugars in nori and dulse, respectively, which
   reflected the presence of galactans and xylans. In brown algae (i.e.
   kombu and sugar kelp), glucose (ca. 64-83\%) and fucose (13-20\%) are
   the main sugars, and they represent laminarins and fucoidans. The
   principal component analysis of sugar profiles showed the useful
   patterns `for seaweed taxon differentiation. The dendrogram resulting
   from hierarchical cluster analysis is congruent with phylogenetic tree,
   implying the chemotaxonomic value of seaweed monosaccharide profiles.
   This tool will be more useful in authentication of seaweed taxa when
   morphological and genetic identifications are not available.},

Abstract = {Aconitum georgei Comber is a China-specific Aconitum (Ranunculaceae)
   plant. In the present study, eighteen compounds, including fourteen
   diterpenoid alkaloids (1-14) and four nonalkaloidal constituents (15-18)
   were isolated from the roots of A. georgei. Among them, fifteen
   compounds (1-11 and 14-18) have not previously been found in this
   species, and 3-methoxymethylbenzoate (17) has not previously been
   isolated from the Aconitum genus. The chemotaxonomic value of these
   compounds was explored through network analysis. The results showed that
   some of these compounds such as falconeridine (6) and
   14-anisoyl-N-deethylaconine (10) showed limited distribution in the
   genus, which could help to narrow species identification to A. georgei
   where other phenotypic characters are limited.},

Abstract = {Embedded in the tail base of all snakes is a pair of scent glands that
   open through ducts at the margin of the cloaca. Scent gland secretions
   (SGS), which typically are discharged when snakes are disturbed, are
   thought to deter predators. Previous chemical analyses have indicated
   carboxylic acids as the chief lipid constituents of SGS. We examined by
   GC-MS the SGS of the eastern small-scaled burrowing asp (Atractaspis
   fallax), a venomous, fossorial species in the Lamprophiidae, a diverse
   family containing more than 60 genera of mostly non-venomous African
   snakes. Our results confirm that acetic, propionic, 2-methylpropanoic,
   n-butanoic, and 3-methylbutanoic acids are the major constituents in the
   SGS samples of A. fallax. These compounds are widespread in the SGS of
   the Alethinophidia ('typical snakes'). Some of these short-chain acids
   also occur in the anal glands of mammals and the uropygial (preen)
   glands of birds, where they arise via microbial activity. Whether these
   compounds in SGS have a similar origin is unknown.},

   Cyprinus carpio (L.)},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbosulfan, a carbamate pesticide extensively employed in rural
   communities, enters the aquatic environment by the proximity of
   agricultural lands to water bodies or through direct application in such
   environments. To know the long-term effect of carbosulfan on
   carbohydrate and protein metabolism, the fish Cyprinus carpio was
   exposed to 1/5th sublethal concentration (0.68 mg/L) of 96 h LC50 for 7,
   14, and 21 days. Significant (P < 0.05) alterations in the glucose,
   glycogen, total protein, and free amino acid level, as well as in the
   activity of enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase,
   malate dehydrogenase, protease, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine
   aminotransferase were observed in the tissues of C. carpio and the
   changes developed progressively with exposure time. The significant
   alternations in carbohydrate metabolic enzymes demonstrate that
   carbo-sulfan causes metabolic interference and shifts aerobic metabolism
   to anaerobiosis in C. carpio, while changes in protein metabolic enzymes
   explain that carbosulfan may interact with peptide sequences in C.
   carpio directly or indirectly. Changes in these characteristics may
   provide an early warning signal for determining carbosulfan toxicity and
   its impact on aquatic species. As a result, it is necessary to monitor
   the aquatic system and forecast the hazardous effect of carbosulfan on
   fish; precautions should be taken while using even low concentrations of
   carbosulfan, and prohibiting or restricting carbosulfan usage is
   preferable.},

Title = {Evaluation of the allelopathic potential of Trianthema portulacastrum L.
   on Convolvulus arvensis L},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: As the crop season progresses and plants size increases,
   weeds also begin to compete with the essential resources available for
   plant growth. Once weeds initiate to deprive the crop of these essential
   resources, the crop yield potential can be negatively impacted. Weeds
   infestations not only caused a severe impact on the yield but also
   provide shelter for various pathogens. Convolvulus arvensis (field
   bindweed) is a serious detrimental weed to various crops. Among weed
   control methods, herbicidal control through synthetic chemicals is the
   most popular method but excessive usage of herbicides is a health hazard
   and causes environmental pollution along with resistance problems in
   weeds. Therefore, allelopathy is an eco-friendly biological control
   method. The objective of this research was to study the allelopathic
   influence of Trianthema portulacastrum (horse purslane) on the growth of
   C. arvensis. To meet the objectives, root and shoot length, leaf area,
   chlorophylls (a and b), total soluble sugars, proline, superoxidase
   dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were assessed. Results:
   Results intimate that water extracts of root and shoot of T.
   portulacastrum significantly (p <= 0.05) inhibited growth parameters.
   But the allelopathic effect of shoot extract was more toxic than the
   root extract and maximum growth inhibition was found in 100\% shoot
   extract. This inhibition of the growth of C. arvensis was coupled with a
   significant increase in soluble sugars and proline. In addition, growth
   reduction was associated with a decrease in photosynthetic pigments and
   activities of SOD and CAT. Shoot extract treatments caused almost equal
   inhibitory action in the growth of C. arvensis with herbicide treatment.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that shoot extract of T.
   portulacastrum could be used as a bio-herbicide against C. arvensis.},

Title = {Effects of ecological factors on phenolic compounds in Salvia
   multicaulis Vahl (Lamiaceae)},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study aimed to assess the impact of certain climatic factors and
   soil elements on principal phenolic compounds in Salvia multicaulis (S.
   multicaulis). For this purpose, the association between the
   environmental factors and phenolic compounds in the samples was analysed
   consecutively using the hybrid redundancy analysis (hRDA), correlation,
   and path analyses. Based on hRDA, the climatic factors were the major
   environmental factors influencing total phenolics (Y-TPhen) and total
   flavonoids (Y-TFlav) contents, but phenolic acids were affected by both
   climatic factors and the soil elements. In path analysis, the average
   April-May daily minimum temperature (XAp-MaMinT) negatively affected
   Y-TPhen (path coefficient of -0.524). The average April-May daily
   relative humidity (XAp-MaRH) was the key climatic factor promoting
   (0.609) Y-TFlav. April-May cumulative precipitation (XAp-MaPr) and the
   soil sodium content (X-Na) were the determinant factors negatively
   affecting (-0.405 and -0.388, respectively) rosmarinic acid content
   (Y-RosA). XAp-MaRH and the soil pH (X-pH) were the most effective
   factors influencing (0.465 and -0.498, respectively) caffeic acid
   content (Y-CafA). The soil magnesium (X-Mg) was the only environmental
   factor reducing (-0.483) the chlorogenic acid content (Y-ChlA). These
   findings could aid sit specific exploration of the plants with a high
   yield of specific phytochemicals demanded by the food and pharmaceutical
   industries.},

Abstract = {Information on factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality of
   the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena
   mysticetus) is fundamental to its successful management and recovery.
   The Alaska Arctic coastline is remote and expansive, making monitoring
   for and gross examination of carcasses difficult. However, sighting data
   and imagery collected during aerial surveys in the eastern Chukchi (EC)
   and western Beaufort (WB) seas from 2009 through 2019 provide
   information on bowhead whale mortality. We present bowhead whale carcass
   data from the 2019 aerial surveys that add to the long series of
   consistent information on floating and beach-cast bowhead whale
   carcasses. The 2019 carcass data suggest an increased occurrence of
   probable killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation on bowhead whales in the
   WB. Eleven bowhead whale carcasses were photo-documented from July to
   October 2019 in the EC and WB study areas. Of the 11 carcasses
   documented, 7 had injuries consistent with probable killer whale
   predation-2 in the EC and 5 in the WB. Probable cause of death could not
   be assigned to four carcasses. No carcasses were associated with
   aboriginal subsistence hunting. Despite similar annual survey effort
   from 2009 to 2019, several compelling deviations in carcass numbers and
   locations were observed in 2019. Compared to 2009-2018, 2019 had the
   highest yearly number of documented carcasses and the most categorized
   as probable killer whale predation. Carcass locations exhibited a
   striking shift from the EC to the WB. Lastly, more carcasses were
   categorized as probable killer whale predation in the WB during 2019
   than in 2009-2018 combined.},

Abstract = {Research surveys provide the foundation for sound, effective management
   of fishery resources and are integral to observing fish population
   trends. However, bias in sampling gear and operating hours may confound
   observed shifts in species distributions over space and time. Within
   North Pacific waters off Alaska, Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus)
   support a large, commercial fishery and is an example of a species that
   experiences spatial and temporal shifts. Seasonal migratory shifts are
   difficult to incorporate into stock assessment models and are further
   complicated if research surveys do not effectively sample the underlying
   size distributions. In the Bering Sea, differences in median fish size
   between the winter Pacific cod bottom-trawl fishery (directed) and the
   summer research survey have been observed since the onset of the surveys
   in the 1980s (66 and 41 cm, respectively). Because of this, it has been
   suggested that large Pacific cod may not be available to the summer
   research survey for varying reasons. In this study, we compared
   standardized observations of mature Pacific cod length distributions
   from a summer multi-species fishery with the National Marine Fisheries
   Service summer research survey from 2009 to 2018 in the Bering Sea.
   Controlling for spatiotemporal effects, there was no difference detected
   in Pacific cod length distributions between the fishery and survey,
   suggesting that the survey accurately captures the entire size
   distribution of Pacific cod in the summer. Although standardized
   research surveys are considered to be representative samples of the
   entire population, using non-random fishery observations, where the
   fishery and survey spatiotemporally overlap, can validate survey
   observations and inform selectivity relationships in stock assessment
   models.},

Abstract = {The inshore waters off the Argentine Islands host a diversified benthic
   fish community largely dominated by the black rockcod, Notothenia
   coriiceps. Compared to other areas along the western Antarctic
   Peninsula, the feeding habits of this species in this location are
   poorly known. Hence, the aim of the study is to assess food preferences
   by the stomach content examination, applying a sophisticated analytical
   approach. As reported elsewhere, the black rockcod is omnivorous,
   relying primarily on algae, gastropods, amphipods, euphausiids and
   fishes, each consumed with different foraging strategies. Based on
   multidimensional scaling statistical procedures, fish size and water
   depth are the primarily contributers to prey resource diversification
   and partitioning. Overall the sampled population of the black rockcod
   are generalist feeders with a relatively high between-phenotype
   component to the niche width, consisting of specialized individuals with
   little or no overlap in food resource use.},

Abstract = {A small amount of information about the composition and functioning of
   prokaryotes and viruses in the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas makes
   it impossible to provide a quantitative assessment of all parameters of
   the carbon cycle which is necessary to analyze and predict the impact of
   climate change on the entire Arctic biota. Of particular interest are
   the areas of the inner and outer shelf of the Arctic seas which are, on
   the one hand, a zone of mixing of river and sea waters of the Ob,
   Yenisei, Lena, Indigirka and Kolyma rivers with a large amount of the
   smallest detrital particles; on the other hand, it is a zone of highly
   saline marine areas, which determined the task of our study. The modern
   methods of studying the structural and functional characteristics of
   microorganisms are used in the work: epifluorescence microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy; the growth rate and production of
   plankton heterotrophic prokaryotes were determined by dilution method in
   situ and the method involving application of antibiotics, modified for
   natural habitats. On the shelf of the Siberian Arctic seas, the
   abundance of free viruses, frequency of visibly infected prokaryotic
   cells and viral-mediated mortality of prokaryotes values varied within
   0.1-13.6 x 10(6) viruses mL(-1), 0.2-5.6\% abundance of prokaryotes,
   1.4-64.4\% production of heterotrophic prokaryotes, respectively. We
   suggest that the input of a large amount of the smallest organic
   particles on which a significant amount of viruses is absorbed into the
   coastal waters of the Siberian seas (including riverine-marine water
   mixing zone) leads to a decrease in viral infection and mortality of
   prokaryotes.},

Title = {Diet, isotopic niche, and spatial distribution of the white-headed
   petrel (Pterodroma lessonii) at Kerguelen Islands},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {45},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1607-1621},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The subantarctic white-headed petrel is unique amongst Procellariidae by
   its biennial breeding frequency. Its food and feeding ecology is poorly
   known with limited available bio-logging data and no dietary and
   isotopic information. Our goal was to detail its prey species and
   isotopic niche at Kerguelen Islands, which is the most important
   breeding site in the Indian Ocean. Analysis of stomach contents (n = 56)
   indicated chicks were fed on fish (68\% by mass) and secondarily on
   cephalopods (26\%), whilst crustaceans were minor dietary components.
   Mesopelagic fishes were the main prey, with myctophids and melamphaids
   being the most important fish family in terms of both abundance (50\%
   and 15\% of the fish, respectively) and diversity (10 and three
   species). Prey distribution indicated that petrels foraged primarily in
   subantarctic waters and secondarily further south to feed their chicks,
   which is corroborated by the lower blood delta C-13 values of fledglings
   (n = 10) than incubating adults (n = 9). Body feather delta C-13 values
   (n = 45) indicate that adult white-headed petrels moulted over different
   latitudinal habitats, from the subtropics to Antarctica where delta N-15
   values showed they fed on low trophic-level prey (most likely Antarctic
   krill). Indeed, three geolocator-tracked birds ranged widely, from the
   mid-Atlantic (18 degrees W) to the eastern Indian Ocean (110 degrees E)
   and from the warmer Subtropical Zone (19\% of the locations), across the
   Subantarctic Zone (58\%) to the colder Antarctic Zone (23\%). Neither
   fishery-related items nor plastic debris were found in chick food
   samples, thus indicating no significant interactions with human
   activities, which is a key positive issue for the conservation of
   white-headed petrels.},

Title = {Diet of adult and immature imperial cormorants, Leucocarbo atriceps,
   from southern Patagonia. A combined dietary approach and an exploratory
   analysis of stable isotopes of pellet membrane},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1529-1539},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The use of combined conventional and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to
   study the diet of seabirds has become very frequent. Unfortunately,
   information on the trophic ecology of immature seabirds remains scarce
   because the sampling of tissues to perform SIA is often very limited due
   to the difficulty to capture these birds. The koilin membrane, which
   covers the regurgitated pellet casts of some seabirds, could offer an
   interesting non-intrusive alternative tissue to perform SIA. In this
   two-year study of the diet of imperial cormorants in southern Patagonia,
   we (1) compare the diets of breeding and non-breeding birds through
   conventional pellet analysis; (2) describe the diet of breeding adults
   and chicks through a combined method of pellet analysis and whole blood
   SIA; and finally, (3) compare SIA values of breeding adults obtained
   from blood with those obtained from koilin membranes. We found that
   immature individuals incorporated abundant invertebrate taxons, compared
   with breeding adults which relied mainly on fish. Younger and
   inexperienced individuals, which are not under the constraint to feed
   chicks, are feeding on more predictable, but lower trophic and less
   energetic prey. By comparing the stable isotope values of koilin and
   blood in breeding adults, a correlated interannual difference between
   the two seasons was found. Under the light of our results, the koilin
   offers an encouraging alternative to blood in the study of trophic
   ecology, particularly for ages or stages in which capture is not
   possible.},

Abstract = {In 2018, commercially exploitable concentrations of Atlantic cod Gadus
   morhua were found on the shelf around the Arctic island Jan Mayen (7 1
   degrees N, 8-9 degrees W) and in 2019-2021 an exploratory cod fishery
   with longline was carried out in the area. The total catch in the period
   2018-2021 was 1737 tonnes. The first records of cod fishery in the Jan
   Mayen area are from the early 1930s but catches before 2018 were
   minimal. In 2019-2020 cod spawning was documented in this area for the
   first time. Catches in 2019 and 2020 were dominated by cod between 70
   and 100 cm, while in 2021 the main part of the catches was cod between
   60 and 100 cm. Catch rates were highest in autumn. We summarize the
   history of cod observations and the experience from the recent
   exploratory fishery in this shelf area where there has been no regular
   monitoring of demersal fish abundance. Further, we consider possible
   links with cod stocks in other Arctic and sub-Arctic areas and discuss
   the occurrence of cod in the Jan Mayen area in relation to the biology
   and recent development of other cod stocks.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean phytoplankton are especially subjected to pronounced
   seasonal and interannual changes in light availability. Although
   previous studies have examined the role of light in these environments,
   very few combined pigment-based taxonomy with flow cytometry to better
   discriminate the light response of various phytoplankton groups. In
   particular the different populations within the diverse and important
   taxonomic group of diatoms require further investigation. Six incubation
   experiments (9-10 days) were performed during the main productive period
   with natural seawater collected at the Western Antarctic Peninsula.
   Standing stock of Phaeocystis spp. cells displayed relatively fast
   accumulation under all levels of light (low, medium, high; 4-7, 30-50
   and 150-200 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), whilst the small- and
   larger-sized diatom populations (4.5 and 20 mu m diameter) exhibited
   faster accumulation in medium and high light. In contrast,
   intermediate-sized diatoms (11.5 mu m diameter) displayed fastest net
   growth under low light, subsequently dominating the phytoplankton
   community. Low light was a key factor limiting accumulation and peak
   phytoplankton biomass, except one incubation displaying relatively high
   accumulation rates under low light. The 3-week low-light period prior to
   experimentation likely allowed adaptation to maximize achievable growth
   and seems a strong determinant of whether the different natural
   Antarctic phytoplankton populations sustain, thrive or decline. Our
   study provides improved insight into how light intensity modulates the
   net response of key Antarctic phytoplankton, both between and within
   taxonomic groups.},

Abstract = {Trait-based approaches connect the traits of species to ecosystem
   functions to estimate the functional diversity of communities and how
   they may respond to environmental change. For the first time, we
   compiled a traits matrix across 11 traits for 28 species of Arctic ice
   meiofauna, including Copepoda (Subclass), Nematoda (Phylum), Acoela
   (Order), Rotifera (Phylum), and Cnidaria (Phylum). Over 50 years of
   pan-Arctic literature were manually reviewed, and trait categories were
   assigned to enable future trait-function connections within the
   threatened ice-associated ecosystem. Approximately two-thirds of the
   traits data were found at the genus or species level, ranging from 44\%
   for Nematoda to 100\% for Cnidaria. Ice meiofauna were shown to possess
   advantageous adaptations to the brine channel network within sea ice,
   including a majority with small body widths < 200 mu m, high body
   flexibility, and high temperature and salinity tolerance. Diets were
   found to be diverse outside of the algal bloom season, with most
   organisms transitioning to ciliate-, omnivore-, or detritus-based diets.
   Eight species of the studied taxa have only been recorded within sea
   ice, while the rest are found in a mixture of sympagic-pelagic-benthic
   habitats. Twelve of the ice meiofauna species have been found with all
   life stages present in sea ice. Body width, temperature tolerance, and
   salinity tolerance were identified as traits with the largest research
   gaps and suffered from low-resolution taxonomic data. Overall, the
   compiled data show the degree to which ice meiofauna are adapted to
   spending all or portions of their lives within the ice.},

   could allow a species to respond to changes in climate. Nonetheless,
   this expansion might be a detriment to other penguin species that

Abstract = {Conventional microbiological methods reveal the diversity of culturable
   microorganisms and are used for the isolation of strains with various
   properties. On the Argentine Islands-Kyiv Peninsula region, a study of
   microorganisms of plant communities has been reported; however, they to
   the full extent did not elucidate the microbial diversity. Animal
   populations are shifting because of climate change, which, together with
   anthropogenic influence, causes the shaping of microbial communities.
   The study aimed to establish the diversity, enumeration of
   microorganisms of different groups, and relationships with the physical
   and chemical properties of the samples from the ecosystem of the
   Argentine Islands-Kyiv Peninsula region that were collected from the
   vegetation and soils of the nesting and feeding site of Larus
   dominicanus (a Kelp Gull). The microbial communities and relationships
   between the Antarctic Peninsula maritime ecosystems (Galindez Island and
   Booth Island) factors were studied with the application of conventional
   microbiological techniques, statistical analyses, and 16S rRNA-based
   taxonomy. The study of the content of trace elements and the enumeration
   of cultivated microorganisms of different groups in soil samples
   demonstrated the difference in the enumeration of microorganisms between
   soil layers and the relationship between microbial enumeration and the
   properties of the samples. The samples from Booth Island differed in
   microbial enumeration from samples from Galindez Island. The greatest
   diversity and abundance of microorganisms were found in the samples from
   the most polluted due to the activity of the diesel station area. Among
   over 200 isolates, several of them were found to be tolerant to high
   levels of trace elements.},

Abstract = {Complex bottom topography and the presence of floating ice significantly
   complicate the use of traditional sampling methods in Arctic coastal
   waters, forcing to look for alternative approaches. One such technique
   is underwater imagery, which has grown in popularity in recent decades
   based on its effectiveness in hard-to-reach places. We demonstrate that
   an underwater video mosaic can be a reliable method for comparative
   analysis of Arctic habitats under the glacier influence and glacier
   influence-free habitats. The filming was carried out in the upper
   sublittoral (2-65 m) of Hornsund and Isfjorden areas, representing two
   ice-free and two glaciated bays. Video footage was obtained using an ROV
   mounted and ``drop-down{''} video cameras and transformed into 148 video
   mosaics. Based on the lowest possible taxonomic level, 31 biological
   features (morphospecies) were identified and ascribed to benthic
   functional groups based on their feeding and mobility type. The
   morphospecies and functional groups were used for the comparative
   analysis to reveal the ecologically meaningful differences in benthic
   community structure in different Arctic benthic habitats. We discovered
   greater abundances of motile scavengers in glacier-influenced bays
   whereas glacier influence-free bay had more sessile suspension filters
   and glacier influence-free riverine bay was dominated by discreetly
   motile and deposit feeders. Underwater imagery mosaics have proven to be
   a fairly reliable tool for fieldwork-efficient quantitative
   characterization of benthic communities in the hard-to-reach Arctic's
   upper sublittoral.},

Abstract = {Antarctic notothenioid fishes are recognised as one of the rare examples
   of adaptive radiation in the marine system. Withstanding the freezing
   temperatures of Antarctic waters, these fishes have diversified into
   over 100 species within no more than 10-20 million years. However, the
   exact species richness of the radiation remains contested. In the genus
   Channichthys, between one and nine species are recognised by different
   authors. To resolve the number of Channichthys species, genetic
   information would be highly valuable; however, so far, only sequences of
   a single species, C. rhinoceratus, are available. Here, we present the
   nearly complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of C. rugosus,
   obtained from a formalin-fixed museum specimen sampled in 1974. This
   sequence differs from the mitochondrial genome of C. rhinoceratus in no
   more than 27 positions, suggesting that the two species may be
   synonymous.},

Abstract = {Drones, or unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS), can transform the way
   scientific information on wildlife populations is collected. UAS surveys
   produce accurate estimates of ground-nesting seabirds and a variety of
   waterbirds, but few studies have examined the trade-offs of this
   methodology for counting cliff-nesting seabirds. In this study, we
   examined how different UAS survey parameters might influence seabird
   counts for population monitoring and assessed behavioral responses to
   aerial surveys for three sub-Arctic seabird taxa in the Gulf of Alaska:
   common murres (Uria aalge), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla),
   and pelagic and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus and
   Phalacrocorax auritus). We flew two commercially available models of UAS
   in planned approaches at different speeds and distances from colonies
   during incubation and chick-rearing periods. We compared counts from
   UAS-derived images with those from vessel-based photography and assessed
   video recordings of individual birds' behaviors for evidence of
   disturbance during UAS operations and control phases. Count estimates
   from UAS images were similar to or higher than those from conventional
   vessel-based images, and UAS were particularly effective at
   photographing birds at sites with high cliff walls or complex
   topography. We observed no significant behavioral responses to the UAS
   by murres or cormorants, but we did observe flushing by black-legged
   kittiwakes during UAS flights; most of these birds were not incubating
   or brooding. At both the colony and individual level, we observed
   slightly greater responses to the smaller UAS platform and closer
   approaches. These results inform both species specific and general best
   practices for research and recreational usage of UAS near cliff-nesting
   seabird colonies.},

Title = {Differences in the gonadal cycle between two ascidians species,
   Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona robusta, help to explain their invasion
   success in a cold temperate port},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Invasive ascidians are one of the most abundant components of the
   fouling communities of artificial structures. Ascidians' tolerance to
   pollution, salinity, and temperature differences, alongside high
   reproductive and growth rates, facilitate their global spread and
   establishment. However, the influence of ascidians' reproductive ecology
   on their abundance in cold temperate areas is poorly studied. In cold
   regions, ascidians' reproductive ecology fluctuates markedly, depending
   on environmental factors. This might lead to differences in the gonadal
   cycle of invasive ascidians between the native and invaded area. Our
   study investigates the gonadal cycle of two invasive ascidian species,
   Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona robusta, and discusses their potential role
   in the invasion success in a cold temperate port. Using histological
   analysis, the gonadal cycle of each species was compared throughout the
   year and among seasons. Only A. aspersa showed a reproductive cycle
   different from their native range, with mature gonads during spring and
   summer. Ciona robusta showed mature gonads throughout the year, similar
   to its native range. These results were unexpected, as the larger
   abundance of A. aspersa is constant throughout the year, whereas the
   less abundant C. robusta shows a peak during autumn. Future research
   should explore how interspecific competition and predation interact with
   reproductive ecology, shaping the abundance of invasive ascidians.
   Considering the high connectivity of southern South America with
   Antarctica and the future scenarios of global change, knowing how the
   biology of invasive species change in their invasive range is key to
   advance and implement management strategies.},

Abstract = {The presence of marine vertebrates in dense reproductive colonies and
   other aggregations contributes to the input of organic matter and
   nutrients into the local environment and it is believed that chemical
   elements are subsequently remobilized from the excreta of these animals.
   In this study, we investigated the influence of marine vertebrates on
   trace elements levels (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb,
   Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tb, U and Zn), nutrient (total phosphorus) and soil
   organic matter (SOM) content from five locations with and without the
   presence of seabirds and marine mammals in Admiralty Bay, King George
   Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Soils were acid digested
   using a microwave digestion system, elements were quantified using
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and SOM was calculated by
   loss-on-ignition. The non-influenced and vertebrate-influenced soils had
   similar concentrations of most of the trace elements assessed, however,
   we observed a significant increase in SOM and P that was positively
   correlated with the concentrations of As, Cd, Se, Sr and Zn. Although
   marine vertebrates did not appear to significantly increase the
   elemental concentrations in the soils examined here, there is a clear
   evidence of selective enrichment indicating a zoogenic influence.
   Comparing our results with other studies, we conclude that soil
   elemental levels are result from an interplay between local geology,
   vertebrate diet and colony size. Further studies with increased sample
   size are required to obtain a better understanding of the influence of
   marine vertebrates on chemical element levels in Antarctic soils.},

Abstract = {In recent years, functional changes in Southern Ocean are becoming more
   noticeable, due to climate change and increasing human impacts,
   including a growing fishery that is concentrating in the Antarctic
   Peninsula (AP) region. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is often the
   primary prey species for animals such as Pygoscelis penguins, a sentinel
   species for ecosystem monitoring and management. During the last two
   decades in the AP gentoo penguin numbers (Pygoscelis papua) have
   increased and their range has shifted southward, in contrast to the
   decline in numbers of Adelie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus)
   penguins. Given divergent population trends, the goal of this study was
   to examine differences in their diet, and size structure of Antarctic
   krill recovered from penguin diet samples. The study is based on diet
   samples collected during the austral summers on King George Island
   (South Shetland Islands) where P. adeliae, P. antarcticus, and P. papua
   breed in mixed colonies. Results indicate that the penguins consumed
   krill of similar sizes during the breeding period. In contrast to prior
   diet studies, we found higher proportions of krill in the gentoo diet
   and changes in the percentage of krill in the diet relative obtained
   during 1970s. The similarity in diets among all three species suggests
   that the availability prey items (e. g., fishes) may be changing and
   driving higher dietary overlap. Moreover, we also check differences in
   krill length among penguin individuals and we did not find any
   statistically significant differences. We also found plastic debris in
   penguin stomachs during both summers.},

Abstract = {Blue whales are rarely sighted off the coasts of South Africa due to
   their low numbers and offshore habitat preference. Visual observations
   to search for marine mammals were conducted onboard a platform of
   opportunity during the Integrated Ecosystems Programme survey in
   November 2019. A cow-calf pair of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus was
   sighted offshore Kleinzee (30 degrees 05'02.4 `' S, 14 degrees 24'53.2
   `' E) at a water depth of 1670 m on the west coast of South Africa in
   the southern Benguela Current System. The pair was identified as
   Antarctic blue whales B. m. intermedia based on the size of the cow
   (similar to 29 m), ``torpedo-shaped{''} body of the cow, known
   distribution ranges and recent acoustic data showing that pygmy blue
   whales B. m. brevicauda do not occur in these waters. The calf was
   likely born in the Benguela ecosystem given its relatively small size.
   This is the first sighting of Antarctic blue whale cow-calf pair in
   South African waters post whaling, indicating that animals might still
   use this area as a calving or nursing ground. Improved protection of
   this region in the low latitudes might benefit the recovery and
   conservation of the species.},

Title = {Evaluation of agricultural soil health after applying pyraclostrobin in
   wheat/maize rotation field based on the response of soil microbes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The green development of agriculture, the rational use of pesticides,
   and soil health are closely related. However, our understanding of them
   is still limited. Pyraclostrobin (PYRA) is one of the most popular
   strobilurin fungicides due to its broad-spectrum control of fungal
   diseases. However, PYRA has been shown to have negative effects on
   bacterial communities and soil enzyme activities under laboratory
   conditions. The effects of PYRA on soil mi-crobes (mainly bacteria) in
   actual field environments still need to be addressed. In the present
   study, after applying PYRA in a wheat/maize rotation field for 2 years,
   we determined the level of residual PYRA and assessed the soil bacterial
   community structure, soil enzyme activity, and ammonia-oxidizing
   functional gene expression. The results show that the DT50 of PYRA in
   agricultural soil was 2.16-38.93 days. The final residual levels of PYRA
   in wheat/maize grain were less than 0.01 mg kg(-1), which is lower than
   the maximum residue limit (MRL) recommended (0.2 mg kg(-1)) by China and
   the European Union. The culturable fungi and bacteria populations were
   significantly reduced after applying PYRA. The genera's abundance
   (Sphingomonas and Lyso-bacter) and urease activity associated with
   phosphorus cycle were inhibited. The amoA genes abundance of
   ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)
   showed that the N-cycle function of soil microbes was inhibited.
   Overall, applying PYRA for 2 years did not increase the negative
   response of soil microbes. However, in some indicators, such as
   culturable microorganism populations, more significant re-ductions in
   populations were observed in the double recommended dose group than in
   the recommended dose group. The results obtained in this study reflect
   the response of soil microbes subjected to pyraclostrobin in an actual
   field and provide new insights into how agricultural development
   influences soil health.},

Title = {Effect of fertilization regimes on continuous cropping growth
   constraints in watermelon is associated with abundance of key ecological
   clusters in the rhizosphere},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The deterioration of the microbiome within the rhizosphere is the main
   reason behind continuous cropping obstacles and is affected by
   fertilization regimes. However, the potential associations among
   fertilization re-gimes, rhizosphere microbial communities, and the
   severity of continuous cropping obstacles are poorly un-derstood. Here,
   we investigated how three-year fertilization regimes (including no
   fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer, combination of
   chemical and organic fertilizer, and bio-organic fertilizer application)
   affect the rhizosphere microbiome and its associations with continuous
   cropping growth constraints during the whole growing period of
   watermelon, using a rhizobox system under greenhouse conditions. The
   results showed that different fertilization treatments induced drastic
   shifts in the richness, structure, and composition of rhizosphere
   microbial communities, whereas the growth stages induced few changes.
   Compared with no fertilizer treatment, the continuous application of
   chemical fertilizer inhibited the growth of watermelon. This was
   strongly associ-ated with the reduced abundance of key ecological
   clusters within the bacterial co-occurrence network, which contains
   beneficial bacterial taxa, such as Lysobacter sp. and Haliangium sp. In
   contrast, continuous application of organic and bio-organic fertilizers
   promoted the growth of watermelon and was associated with the decreased
   abundance of key ecological clusters within the fungal co-occurrence
   network, which contains pathogenic fungal taxa, such as Fusarium sp.,
   Cladosporium sp., and Acremonium sp. Overall, continuous chemical
   fertilizer appli-cation can induce severe continuous cropping obstacles
   by inhibiting the growth of beneficial bacteria. Continuous application
   of organic and bio-organic fertilizers can help alleviate such obstacles
   by suppressing pathogenic fungi. These findings reveal the microbial
   mechanisms underlying the effects of different fertilization regimes on
   continuous cropping growth constraints of watermelon.},

Title = {Ameliorating C and N balance without loss of productivity by applying
   mulching measures in rainfed areas},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Farmland mulching is applied widely as a soil management practice,
   especially in rainfed areas with scarce water resources. However, it is
   not clear how continuous mulch application might affect the carbon and
   nitrogen budget in rainfed agroecosystems. Therefore, we evaluated the
   impacts of different mulching measures (SM: flat planting pattern with
   full straw mulching; RM: ridge-furrow construction with half plastic
   film mulching; PM: flat planting pattern with full plastic film
   mulching; BM: flat planting pattern with full biodegradable film
   mulching; and NM: conventional tillage without mulching) on the maize
   yield, net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), net global warming potential
   (NGWP), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and N surplus or deficiency.
   The results showed that compared with NM, the maize yield decreased
   significantly by 10.0\% under SM, whereas the mulching treatments (RM,
   PM, and BM) significantly increased the maize yield by 15.1-24.4\% (P <
   0.05). SM, RM, and PM significantly increased CO2 emissions
   (24.8-38.2\%), N2O emissions (21.1-47.1\%), and NGWP (20.8-45.5\%), but
   reduced NECB. By contrast, BM increased NECB and significantly reduced
   GHGI (P < 0.05). Regardless of the mulching method applied, the N
   balance indicated an N surplus. Each mulching treatment (SM, RM, PM, and
   BM) increased the harvested N removal (47.9-179.9 kg N ha-1) and
   decreased the N leaching loss (8.8-35.9 kg N ha-1). RM, PM, and BM
   inhibited the ammonia volatilization rate, whereas SM promoted it. PM
   and BM achieved a lower N surplus. In conclusion, biodegradable film
   mulching (BM) can significantly reduce GHGI and the risk of N losses
   while also ensuring high crop yields, and thus it can be used as a
   high-yield and sustainable production method in rainfed areas.},

   development and application in orchards},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Soil health is universally acknowledged to be an integrative tool in
   revealing soil degradation and agro-ecosystem health, and it has been
   the focus of many national investigations to find a compromise between
   the increase of human demands in urbanization and the conservation of
   agricultural soils. Based on the soil survey database of the Yangtze
   River Delta Region in China, including 66 soil samples collected from 22
   representative orchards and 20 soil indicators analyzed for each sample,
   this study made a preliminary attempt to determine a minimum data set
   (MDS) of 10 sensitive indicators by factor analysis, to calculate
   weights and establish scoring function curves respectively, and a
   localized comprehensive assessment methodology of soil health was
   suc-cessfully developed and applied in orchards with organic, green and
   conventional management practices in Shanghai, China. The results
   indicated that, the rankings of soil health index (SHI) were generally
   organic>-green>conventional, and 95\% of the orchards were rated as the
   grades of moderate (40-60) to better (60-80). The SHI in green orchards
   with different cultivation durations followed the pattern of gradual
   increase over 5 years. The improvement of soil fertility, soil
   aggregation structure and soil bio-community were crucial to improve
   soil health, prevent soil degradation and promote soil sustainability in
   this region, particularly under the circumstance of encouraging green
   agriculture development.},

Title = {Grass-legume mixtures enhance forage production via the bacterial
   community},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Forage monoculture and grass (Gramineae)-legume mixtures are the two
   most commonly used planting patterns for establishing farming
   grasslands, but the effects of these planting patterns on the
   rhizosphere bacterial community and forage production are still unclear.
   In this study, we carried out a field experiment on the Tibetan Plateau,
   and observed that grass-legume mixtures significantly increased forage
   production over monocultures (P < 0.05). We investigated the effects of
   these two planting patterns on rhizosphere and bulk soil bacterial
   communities, and found that the grass-legume mixtures altered the
   community structure and composition of the grass rhizosphere bacterial
   community, while the bacterial community of bulk soils remained
   unchanged. Source tracker analysis demonstrated that 50.77\% and 34.72\%
   of the changes in mixture rhizosphere of two gramineous grasses were
   derived from the legume, illustrating that the legume greatly influenced
   the grass rhizosphere in grass-legume planting. The molecular ecological
   network analysis demonstrated that network vulnerability and robustness
   of the mixtures were significantly higher than that of monoculture,
   indicating that the grass-legume mixtures provided a favorable condition
   for microbial interactions. Besides, by using structural equation
   modeling, it was found that the stability and complexity of the
   bacterial community network had significant positive correlations with
   forage production, while the soil physicochemical properties had no
   significant direct correlations, suggesting the rhizosphere bacterial
   community played a critical role in enhancing plant growth in
   grass-legume mixtures. This study provides a new insight into the
   mechanism behind the enhancement of forage production in the
   grass-legume mixture planting pattern.},

Title = {Pesticide contamination and their botanical sources in pollen loads
   collected by honeybees in Kenya: A spatio-temporal context},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Honeybees are generalists, and therefore, a wide range of flowering
   plants can easily be identified from their collected pollen loads. In
   this study, the levels of pesticide contamination on corbicular pollen
   were investigated using two approaches; (i) unsorted colony level
   collected and (ii) sorted pollen samples (according to botanical
   origin). Sorted samples were palynologically identified up to the family
   level to establish the types of pesticides used across landscapes and
   identify their botanical sources. This study was carried out between
   November 2019 and October 2020 in Murang'a county, Kenya, across three
   landscape types. The landscape was characterized according to the degree
   of greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   into high, me-dium, and low classes. Pollen Hazard Quotient (PHQ) was
   used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each detected pesticide. In
   the unsorted samples, five different pesticides were detected with
   concentrations ranging between 0.12 and 37.97 mu g kg-1. From the
   results, 11 pesticides were detected, nine insecticides and two
   fungicides. These pesticides were further traced to 11 plant families,
   from which Poaceae, Rubiceae, and Astereceae were contaminated with more
   than 70\% of the 11 detected pesticides. Acetamiprid concentration in
   March was found to be extremely higher (1202.50 mu g kg-1) the
   recommended EU limit (50 mu g kg-1). Additionally, chlorpyriphos
   concentration was found to be higher than the EU set limit of 10 mu g
   kg-1 in months of July, September, and October. Additionally, pollen
   from Rubiaceae and Poaceae plant families were the most collected during
   the period of this study. It was further noted that pesticides and plant
   families identified varied across sampling time, but not across
   landscapes.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The relative intensity of facilitative effect among coexisting plant
   species is frequently affected by soil water and nutrient availability,
   such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and organic
   fertilizer. However, to date, the general pattern of nutrient gradient
   effects on plant-plant interactions remains inconsistent or even
   opposite in the intercropping systems. To address this issue, we
   performed a global meta-analysis and three experiments to investigate
   the production efficiency of intercropping along fertilizer input
   gradient (low vs. high) by assessing the land equivalent ratio (LER).
   Trial 1 included five P gradient in the maize-grass pea intercropping
   system. Trial 2 consisted of two N gradient in the maize-wheat,
   maize-soybean and wheat-soybean intercropping systems. Trial 3 contained
   two water and three P gradients in the same intercropping systems as
   Trial 1. The meta-analysis result indicated that the average LER for
   yield (LERY), biomass (LERB), N uptake (LERN), and P uptake (LERP) were
   1.49, 1.25, 1.35, and 1.66, respectively. It implied that intercropping
   would save 49 \%, 25 \%, 35 \% and 66 \% lands to achieve the same
   yield, biomass, N and P uptake amount as monoculture, respectively.
   Also, high fertilizer inputs significantly decreased the relative
   productivity and nutrient uptake. Average effect sizes of high inputs on
   LERY, LERB, LERN, and LERP were up to - 0.0505 (-0.0550 to -0.0461), -
   0.0267 (-0.0303 to -0.0230), - 0.0321 (-0.0395 to -0.0247) and - 0.0237
   (-0.0370 to -0.0103), respectively. These negative values demonstrated
   that the LER markedly declined under the high-nutrient conditions. On
   the other hand, the results of Trial 1 confirmed that the LERY, LERB,
   LERN, and LERP tended to decrease significantly with increasing P
   addition. In Trial 2, the LERY of intercropping systems tended to
   significantly decrease with increasing N application. In Trial 3, the
   LERY, LERB, LERN, and LERP also displayed a descending trend with
   increasing P addition and soil water availability. Collectively, the
   three trials confirmed the reliability and universality of the
   meta-analysis conclusions. This study provided a broad support for the
   hypothesis of the nutrient-dependent relative benefits in intercropping
   systems.},

Title = {Bumblebees are more efficient than honeybees to facilitate wind-blown
   pollen dispersal of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)},

Abstract = {An understanding of the visiting behavior of the pollinator on a crop
   and the affecting factors on gene flow would help to predict the
   potential gene flow risk and develop the strategies to limit gene flow.
   In alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), pollination requires a tripping
   mechanism by a pollinator to release the pollen. This typical
   pollination method implies that the variations in tripping efficiency
   among bee species may directly or indirectly affect alfalfa pollen
   dispersal and gene flow. The objective of this study was to quantify and
   compare the difference in the formation of alfalfa pollen cloud density
   resulting from the two distinct bee species, honeybees (Apis mellifera
   L.) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris L.), and their indirect effects on
   the promotion of wind-blown pollen dispersal under turbulent or
   non-turbulent weather conditions. In this study, pollen collection using
   rotorod pollen collectors under caged or uncaged alfalfa plots indicated
   no alfalfa pollen released from the source in the absence of insects. In
   contrast, pollens detected within, and beyond the alfalfa pollen source
   evidenced the necessity of tripping the flowers by bees for pollen
   release. Bee species greatly affected the visiting duration of a single
   alfalfa flower and the number of tripped flowers min(-1). At the current
   experimental scale, although worker bees of bumblebees were less
   abundant than honeybees, they generated a significantly greater alfalfa
   pollen cloud density (mean across sampling times, dates, and weather
   conditions: 566 pollens m(- 3 )h(-1)) than that of honeybees (416
   pollens m(- 3) h(-1)), which was closely correlated with the higher
   number of tripped flowers by bumblebees (8.8 flowers min(-1)) relative
   to honeybees (3.1 flowers min(-1)). While the similar patterns of
   wind-blown alfalfa pollen density negatively correlated with the
   distance observed for the two bee species, the pollen density generated
   by bumblebees at the same distance from the pollen source was greater
   than the values by honeybees. Additionally, a directional wind effect
   was detected with the greater pollen density always observed at downwind
   sites. The developed model predicted that alfalfa pollen cloud density
   reached 95\% reduction of maximum potential value at 31.6 m (10 pollens
   m(- 3 )h(-1)) from the source edge, providing the reference value to
   understand the wind-blown alfalfa pollen dispersal and create isolation
   distance. Thus, the results will be helpful to understand the factors
   affecting the visiting behavior of pollinating bees associated with the
   flowers tripping, predict the gene flow risk, and develop management
   strategies to mitigate gene flow in alfalfa.},

Title = {Non-host habitat at local and landscape scales promotes overwintering
   success of a specialist insect pest},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Incorporating non-crop habitats around cropping fields is often promoted
   to enhance biodiversity and deter crop pests. However, few studies have
   investigated how these habitats influence the overwintering success of
   pest populations. In this study, we investigate how a specialist insect
   pest, the asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi, Coleoptera:
   Chrysomelidae), uses local and landscape resources for overwintering. We
   surveyed beetles in 2019-2020 at 11 asparagus farms in Michigan, USA,
   and conducted experiments to compare overwintering survival of adult
   beetles in five substrates commonly found in asparagus agroecosystems.
   We compared the overwintering number of beetles across three habitat
   types: asparagus field, weedy margin, and woodlot. Overwintering
   asparagus beetle abundance was highest within sites with deciduous
   leaves and decomposing asparagus stalks. We found a negative
   relationship between the abundance of dead trees in adjacent woodlots
   and adult beetle abundance. We then expanded beyond the woodlots with a
   landscape analysis conducted at multiple spatial scales. Landscape
   analysis indicated that deciduous forest within 1250 m of sites
   increased beetle abundance in focal asparagus fields, while asparagus
   production at spatial scales greater than 1500 m suppressed their
   populations. Our findings indicate that certain specialist pests, like
   asparagus beetles, depend on host resources for overwintering, but
   non-host habitat from the surrounding landscape is also important to
   their success. Practically, removal of host and non-host debris (leaf
   litter) from asparagus fields may lead to decreased survival and lower
   pest pressures. In addition, crop-dominated landscapes may not require
   in-field habitat management of overwintering substrates to the same
   extent as more diverse landscapes with higher proportions of non-host
   habitat (deciduous forest). Ultimately, we argue that the net positive
   and negative impact of increasing nonhost habitat at the landscape level
   should be considered when developing integrated pest management
   strategies for specialists at the local scale.},

Title = {Hummingbirds, honeybees, and wild insect pollinators affect yield and
   berry quality of blueberries depending on cultivar and farm?s spatial
   context},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The contribution of wild pollination service to global agriculture is
   increasingly recognized. Still, biotic polli-nation demand is mainly
   covered by managed species, whereas implementing ecological
   intensification practices to promote wild pollination service remain
   less common. In this study, we evaluated (i) the effect of wild and
   managed pollinators and the richness of pollinator functional groups
   (RPFG) on production quality (i.e., fruit size) and quantity (i.e., crop
   yield), of two southern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)
   cultivars, and (ii) how wild pollinator service and crop production
   correlate with farm's land cover. We found that pollination service
   supply and the spatial context interact with the blueberry cultivar to
   determine yield and fruit size. The abundance of big-sized wild bees and
   hummingbirds positively affected fruit size and crop yield, but the
   re-lationship's significance was cultivar-dependent. In contrast, the
   increase in honeybees visitation rate was detrimental to the average
   fruit size of blueberries, but the effect was not generalizable between
   cultivars. The amount of forested area affected positively wild
   pollinator abundance and RPFG only in one cultivar, whereas grassland
   and hedgerow had adverse effects for pollinators in the other.
   Consistently, the relation between blueberry fruit size and the farm's
   land cover was subordinate to the cultivar. That is, despite all
   significant relations had the same sign between cultivars, their
   coefficients were statistically different. Our results support the idea
   that wild pollinators contribute to producing higher yields and larger
   berries in blueberry crops. Moreover, we found that the retention of
   natural forest at a 200 m radius within the farm may increase
   polli-nation service supply. However, the significance of every effect
   was contingent on the blueberry cultivar. This cultivar-dependent
   response points out that a robust assessment of pollinator benefits not
   only should include multiple production metrics, but also must
   incorporate within-crop variation, particularly in systems where growers
   use a mosaic of cultivars with different pollination requirements.},

Abstract = {Managing agricultural land to maximize the supply of natural pest
   control can help reduce pesticide use. Tools that are able to represent
   the relationship between landscape structure, field management and
   natural pest control can help in deciding which management practices
   should be used and where. However, the reliability and the predictive
   power of generic models of natural pest control is largely unknown. We
   applied an existing generic model of natural pest control potential
   based on landscape structure to nine sites in five European countries
   and tested the resulting values against field measurements of natural
   pest control. Subsequently, we added information on local level factors
   to test the possibility of improving model performance and predictive
   power. The results showed that there is generally little or no evidence
   of correlation between modeled and field -measured values of natural
   pest control. Moreover, we found high variability in the results,
   depending on the associations of crops, pests and biocontrol agents
   considered (e.g. Oilseed rape-Pollen beetle-Parasitoids) and on the
   different case studies. Factors at the local level, such as conservation
   tillage, had an overall positive effect on natural pest control, and
   their inclusion in the models typically increased their predictive
   power. Our results underline the importance of developing predictive
   models of natural pest control which are tailored towards specific
   associations between crops, pests and biocontrol agents, consider local
   level factors and are trained using field measurements. They would serve
   as important tools within farmers' decision making, ultimately
   supporting the shift toward a low-pesticide agriculture.},

Title = {Severe drought rather than cropping system determines litter
   decomposition in arable systems},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Litter decomposition is a fundamental process in soil carbon dynamics
   and nutrient turnover. However, litter decomposition in arable systems
   remains poorly explored, and it is unclear whether different management
   practices, such as organic farming, conservation agriculture can
   mitigate drought effects on litter decomposition. Thus, we examined the
   effects of a severe experimental drought on litter decomposition in four
   cropping systems, i.e., organic vs. conventional farming, each with two
   levels of tillage (intensive vs. conservation tillage) in Switzerland.
   We incubated two types of standard litter (tea bags), i.e., high-quality
   green tea with a low C:N ratio and low-quality rooibos tea with a high
   C:N ratio. We assessed litter decomposition during the simulated drought
   and in the post-drought period during three years in three different
   crops, i.e., pea-barley, maize, and winter wheat. Subsequently, we
   assessed whether decomposition in the four cropping systems differed in
   its resistance and resilience to drought. Drought had a major impact on
   litter decomposition and suppressed decomposition to a similar extent in
   all cropping systems. Both drought resistance and resilience of
   decomposition were largely independent of cropping systems. Drought more
   strongly reduced decomposition of the high-quality litter compared to
   the low-quality litter during drought conditions regarding the absolute
   change in mass remaining (12.3\% vs. 6.5 \%, respectively). However, the
   decomposition of high-quality litter showed a higher resilience, i.e.,
   high-quality approached undisturbed decomposition levels faster than
   low-quality litter after drought. Soil nitrate availability was also
   strongly reduced by drought (by 32-86 \%), indicating the strong
   reduction in nutrient availability and, most likely, microbial activity
   due to water shortage. In summary, our study suggests that severe
   drought has a much stronger impact on decomposition than cropping system
   indicating that it might not be possible to maintain decomposition under
   drought by the cropping system approaches we studied. Nevertheless,
   management options that improve litter quality, such as the use of
   legume crops with high N concentrations, may help to enhance the
   resilience of litter decomposition in drought-stressed crop fields.},

Title = {Batting for rice: The effect of bat exclusion on rice in North-East
   India},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Insectivorous bats are gaining increasing attention for their potential
   as biological agents of pest suppression. Studies around the world have
   demonstrated their tendency to track and hunt agricultural pests over
   time and space, and thus to have a positive impact on reducing plant
   damage and protecting yield of agricultural crops. We documented the
   effect of insectivorous bats on the health and yield of a rice crop in
   Assam, India. Using six sets of paired experimental and control plots
   (of which five were analysed), where bats were selectively excluded from
   the experimental plots, we collected two measures of plant damage and
   one measure of total yield to assess the impact of bats on the crop. In
   parallel, bat activity at the six sites was recorded over the rice
   growing season using passive acoustic recorders. Our results show that
   the exclusion of insectivorous bats causes an increase in the degree of
   defoliation suffered by rice plants. We also report non-significant
   differences in the degree of yellowing of rice and of the total yield
   between the experimental and control plots. Bat activity levels showed a
   mono-or bi -modal peak in activity over the growing season, which
   broadly tracked the maturity of rice, a pattern also seen in many insect
   pests. Our results strongly suggest that bats have suppressive impact on
   pest action in rice fields. The general trend in activity levels, as
   well as the significant difference in plant damage, would indicate that
   bats are hunting insect pests and that the non-significant difference in
   final yield was likely the result of methodological limitations. These
   findings suggest that bats add significant ecological and economic value
   to Indian rice eco-systems and hold great potential to be used in
   integrated pest management (IPM) strategies aimed at suppressing pests.},

Title = {Cover crops and N fertilization affect soil ammonia volatilization and

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Introducing cover crops in monocropping systems to improve soil health
   has been broadly adopted worldwide. However, the impacts of different
   cover cropping systems on soil emissions and related soil fractions and
   their regulatory mechanism remain elusive. In this study, four cropping
   systems, i.e., relay intercropping with Orychophragmus violaceus
   L./cotton (OvC), Vicia villosa Roth/cotton (VvC), a cover crop mixture
   (Ov and Vv)/cotton (MSC) and a fallow field-cotton (FFC) system, were
   combined with four N application rates in a two-rotation cycle
   (2019-2021) to evaluate the effects on soil greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   emission, ammonia (NH3) volatili-zation, and labile carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) fractions and their relationships. Compared with the FFC
   system, the cumulative NH3 volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions of OvC are noticeably reduced 13\% and 58\%, respectively, and
   those of VvC are comparable, while those of MSC are markedly increased
   by 15\% and 24\%, respectively. N fertilization significantly affects
   soil NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions, and a higher N rate results
   in more gaseous N emissions. In addition, NH3 volatilization and N2O
   emission are positively correlated with the soil microbial biomass N
   (MBN), dissolved organic N (DON), NH4+-N and NO3--N but nega-tively
   correlated with microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved organic C (DOC).
   OvC system decreased gaseous N emission by high soil MBC/MBN ratio, Vv
   as cover crop indirectly promote soil N2O emission through increased
   soil MBN, DON and MBC content, while cover crop mixtures increase soil
   labile C and N fractions and enhance gaseous N emission ultimately.
   Overall, application of N fertilizer and cover crop mixture both
   promoted soil NH(3 )and N2O emissions; the relay intercropping nonlegume
   cover crop Ov noticeably mitigates N2O and NH3 emissions through an
   increase in the soil MBC and reduce in the labile N, while introduction
   of the legume cover crop Vv increases N2O emissions but reduces soil NH3
   volatilization due to a lower soil MBC/MBN ratio.},

Title = {Edaphoclimatic drivers of the effect of extensive vegetation management
   on ecosystem services and biodiversity in vineyards},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Vineyards are a very important perennial woody crop globally, but they
   are also among the most intensively managed agroecosystems. This has
   resulted in biologically impoverished and highly eroded vineyards.
   Environmentally-friendly inter-row vegetation management, particularly
   the use of cover crops, could contribute to avoid erosion and regenerate
   soil biodiversity in vineyards. In this study, we updated a global
   meta-analysis on the effects of inter-row extensive vegetation cover
   management, particularly through the use of cover crops, on ecosystem
   services, including supporting, regulating and provisioning services,
   and biodiversity in vineyards. We also analyzed the role of
   environmental variables (climate, including precipitation- and
   temperature-related bioclimatic variables and soil properties, including
   pH and texture) and irrigation in modulating these effects. The presence
   of extensive vegetation cover consistently increased biodiversity, as
   well as supporting ecosystem services in irrigated vineyards and
   regulating services in rainfed vineyards. Provisioning services, which
   were evaluated as grape yield, were slightly negatively affected in
   rainfed vineyards, but not in irrigated ones. The effects of vegetation
   cover on ecosystem services varied depending on the climate and edaphic
   characteristics of vineyards. For example, supporting ecosystem services
   were favored in acidic soils and were also positively related to the
   precipitation of the wettest quarter, whereas regulating services were
   particularly enhanced in alkaline soils and in locations with lower
   temperatures of the wettest quarter. Biodiversity was especially favored
   in locations with lower precipitation seasonality. Taken together, our
   study indicates the importance of developing strategies for the adaptive
   management of extensive vegetation covers tailored to the climatic and
   edaphic conditions of each vineyard. This adaptive management, combined
   with irrigation and potentially other locallytailored adaptive
   strategies, could also contribute to further mitigate potential negative
   effects of vegetation cover on grape production while maximizing other
   ecosystem services such as provisioning and supporting services and
   biodiversity.},

Title = {The response of soil physical quality parameters to a perennial grain
   crop},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Soil physical quality is paramount for root growth, water and air
   movement, and for its subsequent effects on chemical and biological
   processes in the soil. Management practices and their legacies can
   impact soil physical quality, and perennial grain cropping has been
   proposed as a solution to maintain or improve soil physical quality in
   agroecosystems due to their provision of year-round ground cover and
   increased root growth. An alfalfa-brome perennial forage crop, a
   perennial rye crop (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum L.), and an annual
   rye crop (S. cereale L.) were evaluated at two sites in Central Alberta
   with contrasting management histories (Edmonton and Breton) over 3 years
   to determine the effects on soil physical and hydraulic properties.
   Compared to the annual crop, the perennial forage crop reduced the bulk
   density of the uppermost soil depth sampled (5-10 cm depth increment) (p
   < 0.05) at the Edmonton site and increased soil macroporosity (p < 0.05)
   and pore connectivity (p < 0.05) in the deeper subsurface soil layer
   (25-30 cm depth increment) at both sites. While moderate improvements in
   soil physical and hydraulic properties manifested under the perennial
   rye crop when compared to the annual rye crop, they did not do so to the
   extent of the perennial forage crop. We attribute this to the inclusion
   of tap-rooted alfalfa in the perennial forage, and the overarching
   beneficial influence of root mass density on soil properties. Root mass
   density from highest to lowest consistently ranked as perennial forage >
   perennial rye > annual rye for both sites. Root mass density was
   negatively correlated with bulk density at both Breton (r =-0.77, p <
   0.05) and Edmonton (r =-0.69, p < 0.05) sites. Furthermore, at Breton,
   root mass density positively correlated with macroporosity (r = 0.88, p
   < 0.01). Notably, the perennial rye crop enhanced soil carbon mass
   density relative to the annual rye crop in the clayey topsoil of the
   Edmonton site (p < 0.05), but treatment effects were muted at the Breton
   site due to the influence of previous land use. Despite moderate
   improvements in soil physical quality, our results suggest that 3 years
   of perennial rye monocropping falls short of the major improvements seen
   under a perennial alfalfa-brome forage crop over the same timeframe.},

Title = {Non-native fallows hold high potential for restoration through
   agroforestry in a Pacific Island ecosystem},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},

Abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment affects millions of hectares of cultivated
   lands globally. While ending cultivation can lead to spontaneous
   reforestation and ecological benefits, the resulting landscapes often
   have lower social and agricultural benefits than the native forests and
   agricultural systems they replace, especially when non-native species
   dominate successional pathways. This is the case in many Pacific Islands
   including HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, where approximately 45 \%
   of agricultural lands are unmanaged and non-native forests make up
   nearly 40 \% of total forest cover. Agroforestry systems that integrate
   native and non-native culturally important plants present a potential
   pathway to increase social and ecological benefits of unmanaged
   agricultural lands; however, under-standing what the restoration
   potential is of different agroforestry systems remains a question. We
   collaborated with a Native Hawaiian-led, community-based organization to
   explore this potential. We asked, 1) does the composition of
   agroforestry species planted (i.e., treatment) affect restoration
   success, and if so, do other factors mediate the effect of treatment,
   and 2) how do ecological conditions two years after starting restoration
   compare to conditions pre-restoration? We set up ten 12 x 15 m
   restoration plots and one reference plot on former pasture land
   regenerating as non-native forest. Then, we used a functional
   trait-based approach to select two agroforestry species mixes. Both
   mixes had high cultural value and each had traits to address a different
   primary ecological goal: erosion control and early successional
   facilitation. We monitored the plant communities before restoration and
   at six months, one year, and 1.5 years post-planting. We used
   multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze
   the differences between treatments over time. We found that measures of
   restoration success did not vary significantly between treatments but
   did change from baseline. Results of the SEM indicated that understory
   weed cover was a significant driver of understory cover of agroforestry
   species, but that vari-ability in agroforestry cover was primarily a
   result of management factors not tested in the model. This study
   provides a first step in documenting what non-native forest to
   agroforest transitions can look like. Our findings suggest that
   non-native fallows have a high potential for restoration through
   agroforestry in Pacific Island ecosystems.},

Title = {Seasonal effects reveal potential mitigation strategies to reduce N2O
   emission and N leaching from grassland swards of differing composition
   (grass monoculture, grass/clover and multispecies)},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Multispecies pastures containing grasses, N-fixing legumes and forage
   herbs can maintain high herbage dry matter (DM) yield, while reducing
   the need for fertiliser N inputs thus potentially reducing harmful N
   losses such as nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and nitrate (NO3-) leaching
   to the wider environment. However, our understanding of these processes
   in grassland swards of contrasting composition is still very limited. A
   lysimeter experiment was carried out over 12 months to test the
   hypotheses that (1) cumulative and (2) seasonal N2O emission and N
   leaching would be highest from the Perennial Ryegrass only (PRG, 250 kg
   N ha(-1) yr(-1)) treatment compared to three other treatments; Perennial
   Ryegrass and Low White Clover (PRG+LWC, 90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)),
   Perennial Ryegrass and High White Clover (PRG+HWC, 0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1))
   and Perennial Ryegrass, White Clover and Ribwort Plantain (PRG+WC+P, 45
   kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and (3) that the soil N cycling pathways
   (nitrification/denitrification) linked to these N losses would be
   different between treatments. Cumulative N2O emissions (2.74-3.25 kg
   N2O-N ha(-1)), leached N (10.91-13.70 kg N ha(-1)), DM yields (5083-5493
   kg DM ha(-1) yr(-1)) and N uptake (122-169 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were not
   significantly different between treatments. Nitrogen yield scaled N2O
   emissions were significantly lower from all other treatments compared to
   the high fertiliser N input PRG monoculture. A significant interaction
   between treatment and season showed that in Spring, N2O emission was
   significantly higher from PRG (1.39 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) and PRG+LWC (1.19
   kg N2O-N ha(-1)) than PRG+HWC (0.81 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) and PRG+WC+P (0.85
   kg N2O-N ha(-1)). This result was linked to a numerically lower fraction
   of nitrification (FN) for PRG+WC+P potentially indicating that
   biological nitrification inhibition associated with ribwort plantain
   could lessen N2O emissions. This study demonstrates some of the
   environmental benefits of grassland management systems that require less
   intensive chemical fertiliser N input.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate if and to what extend honey bees (Apis
   mellifera) might present competition against other pollinators,
   particularly other species of bees. In our comment we reanalyze data
   from Weekers et al. (2022) on bee pollinators of apple, collected in an
   impressive large-scale study in Western Europe. We challenge one of
   their findings related to competition as we disagree with correlating
   {[}bee] species richness (\# species in a sample) and honey bee
   dominance (the percentage of honey bees in the same sample). We show
   that according to this way of data transformation even computed datasets
   without any correlations inevitably result in a negative relationship.
   As honey bee dominance increases towards 100\%, the species richness
   will approach one. Only one species will be present, that is the honey
   bee, because the values for wild bee and honey bee values are not
   independent. This explains why they report a negative relationship,
   though we found no correlation reanalysing their raw data. We hope this
   comment facilitates our understanding of this important topic and
   advances future research, as well as supports informed decisions for
   policy makers.},

Title = {Influence of landscape composition on wild bee communities: Effects of
   functional landscape heterogeneity},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Landscapes dominated by conventional agriculture reduce and simplify
   natural habitats, with negative consequences for ecosystem regulating
   services. We examined differences in structure and composition of bee
   com-munities across biotic and abiotic gradients to investigate how
   these communities respond to land-use changes associated with
   agriculture. Studies like ours which evaluates the relative effect of
   different components of spatial heterogeneity remain uncommon and are
   important to conserve pollinator fauna. The diversity of floral
   resources and habitat richness including the configuration and
   composition of landscape heterogeneity have been shown to influence the
   diversity of wild bees on a landscape scale. In this study, we examined
   how wild bee communities respond to landscape heterogeneity in a
   semi-arid productive region of Entre Rios Argentina. We modeled the
   effect of landscape heterogeneity on wild bee community abundance,
   species richness, and Chao-1 diversity. We sampled bees using pan traps
   in four common land-uses in the region (forest plantations, pasture/
   croplands, mixed use areas and native espinal savanna) for five months
   in the spring-summer of 2014-2015. We identified 96 bee species among
   3407 bees collected in the four habitat types. Pasture/croplands along
   with native espinal savanna supported the highest abundance, richness,
   and diversity of bees. Species composition of wild bee communities
   differed between land uses, with numerous species unique to each land
   use. Across all land use types, diversity of flower resources
   consistently supported more abundant and diverse wild bee communities.
   The richness of habitats along with the diversity of floral resources
   acted synergistically over wild bee com-munities. Our findings further
   clarify the relationship between land-use and wild bee communities,
   which provide valuable pollination services to crops and native plants.
   Continued expansion of large-scale monoculture forest plantations will
   likely come at the expense of the native floral resources, which are a
   key component to support regional bee species richness. Promoting
   landscapes with a diversity of crops and flower resources are important
   for the conservation of pollinators that are key for the functioning of
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Combination of cattle urine and dung patches synergically increased
   nitrous oxide emissions from a temperate grassland under wet conditions},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {During grazing, some of the nutrients ingested by cattle are returned to
   grassland as urine and dung patches and can be lost as greenhouse gases.
   Sites where cattle congregate are more likely to have overlapping
   excreta patches favouring enhanced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
   However, there is no consensus about the magnitude of these or
   simultaneous methane (CH4) emissions or potential mitigation options.
   This study investigated the effect of combined cattle dung and urine
   depositions on N2O and CH4 emissions, compared with emissions from
   separate depositions, under different weather conditions. Local emission
   factors (EFs) were then calculated for both gases. A quantitative
   assessment of published studies was also performed to search for N2O
   emissions drivers. Two field experiments were performed during two
   98-day trials under dry and wet conditions in Tandil, Argentina.
   Treatments included fresh excreta patches of urine (0.75 L), dung (2.50
   kg), dung + urine (2.50 kg + 0.75 L) from Holstein dairy cows, and a
   control (without excreta). Soil and excreta properties were analysed,
   and N2O and CH4 fluxes from the patches were measured using the static
   chamber technique. Patches containing dung were shown to be localised
   CH4 hotspots. Urine applied to soil, and the addition of urine to dung
   patches had a negligible effect on CH4 fluxes. Urine, dung and combined
   patches were found to be localised N2O sources. Adding urine to dung
   patches under wet weather had a significant synergetic effect (threefold
   increase) on cumulative N2O emissions compared with the theoretical sum
   of separate excreta patches. Adding urine to dung patches under dry
   conditions gave an additive effect on N2O. These findings suggest that
   preventing overlapping excreta patches under wet conditions can help
   mitigate N2O emissions from temperate managed grazed pastures. The
   effect of combining excreta patches was also evident in the EF values
   obtained. That for CH4 was consistent with the default IPCC value (0.75
   g CH4 kg(-1) VS), while N2O (EF = 0.03-0.39\%) was lower than the
   updated IPCC 2019 value of 0.6\%.},

Title = {Residential and agricultural soils dominate soil organic matter loss in
   a typical agricultural watershed of subtropical China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) loss in agricultural watersheds driven by
   hydrology threatens the aquatic environ-ment, and increases the risk of
   greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic systems, and will be detrimental
   to both the green development of agriculture and the achievement of the
   national ``carbon peaking and carbon neutrality `` goal of China.
   Consequently, we explored the use of delta 13C, 615N, and the carbon to
   nitrogen ratio (C/N) as end-members and combined this with a Bayesian
   stable-isotope mixed model to quantitatively estimate the contribution
   of typical land-use types (i.e., forest, rice, vegetable, tea, and
   residential soils) to sedimentary organic matter in a typical
   agricultural watershed in subtropical China. The results indicated that
   there was significant spatial variation of 613C, 615N, and the C/N in
   the target sediment mixture and its sources. The range of sediment 613C
   (-26.2\%o to-23.8\%o) and 615N (3.9-7.9\%o) were within the ranges of
   the sources, with 613C and 615N ranges of -29.3\%o to -20\%o and -1.2\%o
   to 9\%o, respectively. The average C/N of sediment was 11.1 \& PLUSMN;
   0.52, which was significantly higher than all source samples. The
   spatial distribution of 613C and 615N indicated that SOM loss in this
   catchment may primarily be attributed to vegetable and residential
   soils. According to the qualitative identification from dual fingerprint
   mark composite graphs of the C/N and 615N, as well as 613C and 615N, the
   sedimentary SOM in the Tuojia watershed was mainly derived from sewage.
   Furthermore, Bayesian stable-isotope mixed model analysis indicated that
   residential soil was the main contributor to the SOM loss in the
   watershed, with a contribution rate of 75.8 \%, followed by agricultural
   land (rice and vegetable soils) with a combined input of 12 \%. The
   findings highlight that anthropogenic life and agricultural production
   have a vital impact on the carbon and nitrogen cycle in this
   agricultural catchment, and improving the rural habitation environment
   may play a key role in the control of SOM loss in subtropical
   agricultural watersheds.},

Title = {Determining the primary sources of groundwater bacterial communities in
   a large-scale plain area: Microbial source tracking and interpretation
   for different land use patterns},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Groundwater quality has been profoundly affected by human activities,
   especially in large-scale plain areas with high population density.
   However, it remains unclear how groundwater has been influenced,
   especially at the microbial community level. Here, a metagenome-based
   microbial source tracking (MST) technique was used to track the sources
   of groundwater microbial communities associated with land use patterns
   in three-dimensional space in a large-scale plain area in the middle of
   the Yangtze River Basin. Although groundwater and surface water
   bacterial communities were different, there was considerable evidence of
   bacterial seeding from surface water to groundwater. Furthermore, the
   aquaculture pond was found to be the main contributor to the groundwater
   microbial community (similar to 41.0 \% interpretation rate in both
   rainy and dry seasons). The contribution of farmland to the groundwater
   microbial community (39.2 \%) was similar to that of the aquaculture
   pond during the rainy season, while it was higher than that during the
   dry season (29.9 \%); however, the contribution of microbes from the
   lake to groundwater was low (6.9-8.7 \%). Further, antibiotic resistance
   genes (ARGs) and bacteria co-occurrence networks of aquaculture ponds
   and groundwater were more alike than those of other investigated aquatic
   systems. In addition, aquaculture ponds could bring non-negligible
   negative impacts to groundwater, such as pathogen infiltration and ARG
   enrichment. This work highlights the importance of the use of MST
   combined with land use patterns to reliably track the sources of
   groundwater microbial communities in large-scale plain areas and
   provides a deeper insight into the sources of groundwater pollution and
   protection of groundwater from a microbial perspective.},

Title = {Semi-natural habitats support populations of stink bug pests in
   agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Semi-natural habitats are considered fundamental for biodiversity
   conservation and the provision of biological control services in
   agroecosystems. However, crop pests that exploit different types of
   habitats during their life cycle might thrive in complex landscapes.
   Understanding how crop pests use a range of resources across the
   agroecosystem is fundamental to plan sustainable crop protection
   strategies. Here we explored the effects of local habitat type (i.e.,
   annual crop, perennial crop, dry grassland and forest) and landscape
   composition (increasing cover of forest and dry grassland) on stink bug
   pests in Mediterranean agroecosystems. Stink bugs (Hemiptera:
   Pentatomoidea) are polyphagous and highly mobile organisms considered a
   serious threat for numerous crops worldwide. To better understand how
   stink bugs used different habitats, we sampled active adults and
   juveniles in spring and summer, and overwintering individuals in autumn
   and winter. Our results showed that semi -natural habitats supported
   more abundant stink bug populations, potentially providing alternative
   feeding, reproduction, and overwintering sites. Specifically, we found
   more active adults and juveniles in dry grasslands, while forests hosted
   greater numbers of overwintering individuals. Moreover, forest cover in
   the landscape was positively related to active stink bug abundance in
   all sampled habitats. Finally, we found complex landscapes rich in
   overall semi-natural habitats to support higher abundance of
   overwintering individuals in both forests and dry grasslands, while
   perennial crop might provide suitable overwintering sites in highly
   simplified landscape. These results have important implications for pest
   management as crop fields situated in complex landscapes might be more
   susceptible to pest infestation. Effective control strategies may
   require a landscape-based approach.},

Title = {Changes in Cu accumulation and fractionation along soil depth in acid
   soils of vineyards and abandoned vineyards (now forests)},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {This study investigated changes in copper accumulation and fractionation
   based on the depth of soils obtained from active and abandoned
   vineyards. Soil samples were collected at different depths in three
   areas with active and abandoned vineyards, and the concentrations of
   total copper and copper fractions were measured in these soil samples.
   Results revealed that in active vineyards, total copper accumulation was
   the highest in the first layer of soil (depth = 0-2 cm), with
   concentrations (193-892 mg kg(-1)) considerably higher than those in the
   deepest soil layer (depth = 40-50 cm; concentration = 63-71 mg kg(-1)).
   This accumulation was significantly correlated with the total carbon
   concentration in the soil. However, the total copper concentration in
   abandoned vineyards (84-374 mg kg(-1)) was the highest in the subsurface
   layers (depth = 10-15 cm) and was not significantly correlated with the
   total carbon content. Moreover, the percentage of available copper was
   lower in abandoned vineyards than in active vineyards. In terms of
   copper fractionation, the main fraction in active vineyard soil was
   copper bound to organic matter, whereas the main fraction in abandoned
   vineyard soil was residual copper. Therefore, vineyard abandonment and
   its transformation into forest changed the distribution and
   fractionation of copper based on soil depth, thus decreasing the amount
   of available copper and improving the soil quality, which could enable
   new ecosystems.},

Title = {Diffusive nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes across the
   sediment-water-atmosphere interfaces in aquaculture shrimp ponds in a
   subtropical estuary: Implications for climate warming},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from
   aquaculture remain a large knowledge gap in the global N2O budget. The
   water column and the sediment of aquaculture ponds present very
   different environmental conditions, but their relative contributions to
   N2O production and emission are poorly resolved. We sampled three
   aquaculture ponds in the Min River Estuary in southeastern China monthly
   throughout the farming season. Based on the dissolved N2O concentrations
   within the water column and in sediment porewater, we calculated the
   diffusive N2O fluxes across the water-atmosphere interface (WAI) and
   sediment-water interface (SWI). The diffusive N2O flux averaged 216.9
   nmol m- 2 h-1 across WAI and 16.0 nmol m- 2 h-1 across SWI. The
   estimated N2O production rate under steady-state condition was 0.13 nmol
   L-1 h-1 in the water column and 1.07 nmol L-1 h-1 in sediment porewater.
   Hence, the water column compartment and the sediment compartment of the
   aquaculture ponds played different roles in N2O dynamics. Based on our
   data, it is calculated that China's coastal aquacultural ponds would
   emit 0.2 Gg N2O yr- 1, or less than 1\% of all aquaculture N2O emission
   in China. Therefore, coastal shrimp aquaculture has a relative minor
   climate impact compared to other aquaculture operations. Future studies
   should examine the role of N-cycling functional genes on N2O production
   and the mechanisms regulating N2O emission from aquaculture ecosystems.},

Title = {Configurational landscape heterogeneity: Crop-fallow boundaries enhance
   the taxonomic diversity of carabid beetles and spiders},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Arthropod biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is favoured by high
   levels of compositional and configurational heterogeneity. In terms of
   composition, the high value of non-crop habitats is firmly established.
   In contrast, the causes underlying positive effects of configurational
   heterogeneity, i.e. patch size and boundary length, are less well
   understood. We here test the hypothesis that boundaries comprise
   valuable habitats in its own right by enhancing the taxonomic diversity
   of carabid beetles and spiders. We used pitfall traps placed along
   transects running from the interior of wheat fields across the habitat
   boundary to the interior of unmanaged grassland fallows. Taxonomic
   diversity was highest around the boundaries due to (1) spillover effects
   but also (2) species showing a distinct preference for edge habitat. For
   carabids, habitat boundaries harboured distinct species assemblages.
   Grassland fallows had, especially in spiders, positive effects on the
   taxonomic diversity of crop fields close to the boundary, while no
   negative effects of crop fields on adjacent fallows could be found.
   Overall, taxonomic diversity was higher in grassland fallows than in
   crop fields, though differences were surprisingly small. The high
   taxonomic diversity found for boundaries suggest that these may comprise
   valuable habitats in its own rights, which in turn may causally underpin
   positive effects of configurational heterogeneity on arthropod diversity
   in agroecosystems. Thus, increasing configurational heterogeneity, e.g.
   by promoting small field sizes and high edge density, seems an important
   tool for preserving farmland biodiversity.},

Title = {Land use intensification significantly reduced CH4 emissions while

Abstract = {Land use intensification is becoming increasingly common in China's
   Taihu Lake region because of economic interests. Frequent
   intensification is the conversion from natural wetlands (NW) to
   conventional rice-wheat rotation fields (RW), and from conventional RW
   to greenhouse vegetable fields (GH). However, the impact of land use
   intensification on greenhouse gas emissions in this area is still
   unknown. In our study, we chose typical NW, RW, and GH to compare and
   measure methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the three
   land use types through two-year in-situ field experiments. The results
   showed that land use intensification signifi-cantly reduced CH4
   emissions, and NW, RW, and GH emissions were 970.66 +/- 100.09, 896.71
   +/- 300.44, and-71.23 +/- 63.62 kg C ha-1. Land use intensification
   significantly increased N2O emissions, and NW, RW, and GH emissions were
   3.35 +/- 0.44, 14.38 +/- 4.09, and 81.62 +/- 4.89 kg N ha-1. The global
   warming potential of CH4 and N2O under different land use types was in
   the order of RW (28,137.98 +/- 9077.12 kg eq-CO2 ha-1) > NW (27,123.76
   +/- 2703.34 kg eq-CO2 ha-1) > GH (20,360.44 +/- 2651.51 kg eq-CO2 ha-1).
   Overall, we observed that the comprehensive greenhouse effect of CH4 and
   N2O was enhanced by conversion from NW to RW and weakened by conversion
   from RW to GH. Our study provides a predictive understanding of how land
   use intensification changes greenhouse gas emissions in the Taihu Lake
   region and in regions with similar land use types.},

Title = {An integrated straw-tillage management increases maize crop
   productivity, soil organic carbon, and net ecosystem carbon budget},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Soil carbon sequestration is widely considered to improve soil quality,
   safeguard food security, and mitigate climate change. However, the
   effect of best management practices like conservation tillage on soil
   carbon sequestration remains unclear. A 3-year field experiment was
   conducted to explore the effect of integrated straw -tillage systems
   (conventional rotary tillage, CT; no-tillage, NT; CT with straw
   retention, CT-SR; NT with straw retention, NT-SR) on maize productivity,
   soil organic carbon (SOC), and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) in
   Southwest China. The results indicate that the CT-SR achieved the
   highest grain yield (9.1 Mg ha(-1)) and aboveground biomass (19.0 Mg
   ha(-1)). Averaged grain yield and aboveground biomass of the two systems
   without straw retention, CT and NT, were, respectively, 4.5 \% and 4.1
   \% lower than those with straw retention. The NT -SR and CT-SR achieved
   the highest SOC concentration, 12.3 g kg(-1) and 11.9 g kg(-1),
   respectively, as well as the highest SOC stock and the annual increase
   in SOC and SOC stock. The highest NECB was observed in NT-SR, which was
   not significantly different from those of CT-SR and CT, but was higher
   than that of NT by 13.1 \%. Higher SOC sequestration was the major
   contributor to the NECB of NT-SR, while higher gross primary
   productivity and harvest carbon removal contributed mostly to NECB of
   CT-SR and CT. A combination of straw retention and NT was more positive
   than that with CT for the continued rise in SOC sequestration. The NT
   system was inferior to others for improving the system productivity and
   NECB, especially when comparing with CT-SR. In summary, the integrated
   straw retention and rotary tillage (CT-SR) achieved the highest system
   productivity, while the NT-SR was superior for SOC sequestration and
   NECB than other systems for maize production in the Southwest China. An
   integrated straw-tillage management is therefore an efficient and
   feasible way to maintain high maize productivity and carbon
   sustainability.},

Title = {Amending soil with insect exuviae improves herbivore tolerance,
   pollinator attraction and seed yield of Brassica nigra plants},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {To promote circularity in agriculture, the residual -streams from the
   production of insects as feed and food, such as insect exuviae (moulted
   skins), can be a sustainable novel organic soil amendment for crop
   production. Organic soil amendments can influence soil composition by
   providing nutrients and stimulating the growth of beneficial
   microorganisms. Soil composition significantly impacts plant growth and
   resistance against herbi-vores. However, little is known about the
   effect of soil composition on flower visitors and seed production. Here,
   black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) exuviae was added to soil to
   investigate the effects on plant growth, plant resistance against two
   insect herbivores, and the consequences for attraction of pollinators
   and seed yield. Brassica nigra seeds were sown in field soil or in field
   soil mixed with powdered BSF exuviae. Three-week-old plants and the soil
   of each pot were planted in a common garden. The effects on vegetative
   and flower traits, interactions with flower visitors and seed yield were
   quantified. In addition, the performance of the leaf-chewing larvae of
   Pieris brassicae and the piercing-sucking aphid Brevicoryne brassicae
   were assessed. Brassica nigra plants grown on soil amended with BSF
   exuviae showed increased growth, had more flowers and flower visitors,
   and higher seed production. Herbivory neither affected number of flowers
   nor seed production, suggesting tolerance and compensatory growth
   responses to herbivory compared to plants growing in soil without the
   addition of BSF exuviae. After five weeks fewer aphids were found on
   plants growing in amended soil. Our findings show that BSF exuviae added
   to soil can positively affect tolerance to herbivory and seed production
   of B. nigra, an insect -pollinated plant species. Moreover, adding
   insect exuviae as soil amendment in the field benefits plant-pollinator
   mutualism and seed yield even during herbivore attack in the field. Use
   of by-products from insect production as soil amendment can contribute
   to sustainable agricultural practices along with the conservation of
   ecosystem services.},

Title = {Differences in arthropod communities between grazed areas and grazing
   exclosures depend on arthropod groups and vegetation types},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Livestock grazing is one of the most common management practices for
   grasslands and can greatly affect their biodiversity. However, arthropod
   diversity response patterns to grazing regimes are difficult to predict.
   We conducted a short-term grazing exclusion experiment in traditionally
   managed alkali grasslands in Hungary to investigate differences between
   grazed and ungrazed vegetation for different arthropod groups. The
   experiment was laid out in a full factorial design, with twelve 50 x 100
   m short-term grazing exclosures in vegetation types with high (alkali
   wet meadow) and low productivity (alkali steppe). We sampled ground
   beetles and spiders with pitfall traps and true hoppers by sweep
   netting. We used vegetation type (wet meadow vs dry steppe), man-agement
   (grazed vs ungrazed) and their interaction as fixed effects in mixed
   models. We found higher species richness and activity density of spiders
   and ground beetles in the more productive wet meadow vegetation, where
   the community structure of each arthropod group also shifted toward
   hygrophilous species. Significant interactions between vegetation type
   and management indicated a dependence of management effects on
   vegetation types: arthropod community structure shifted towards
   hygrophilous species in ungrazed meadows, but not in ungrazed steppe
   sites. True hopper abundance was higher in grazed meadow sites, but
   lower in grazed steppe sites, compared to ungrazed sites. True hopper
   community structure shifted toward generalist herbivores in ungrazed
   sites, regardless of vegetation type. We concluded that vegetation types
   determine arthropod communities and modulate the effects of grazing on
   arthropods. Our results suggest that moderate disturbance from
   low-intensity grazing has a positive or neutral effect in wetter, more
   productive vegetation, but a negative or neutral effect in drier, less
   productive vegetation, depending on the arthropod group. Herbivorous
   insects that dwell on plants are particularly affected by management
   because they are more susceptible to direct impacts, such as
   unintentional predation by grazing cattle, and because of asymmetrical
   competition between mammalian and insect herbivores.},

Title = {Climate induced phenological shifts in pears - A crop of economic
   importance in the UK},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Phenological advancements in flowering have been well documented in many
   food crop, ornamental, and native plant species. However, there is lack
   of information on how flowering times in crop species, especially fruit
   trees will react to future climate scenarios. This is important as
   changes in phenology could have significant implications for ecosystem
   services and function, biological interactions and agronomic outputs.
   Using 60 years of data from pear (Pyrus communis L.) orchards in two
   research organisations in Kent, UK we explored temporal changes in
   flowering phenology, identified the weather variables driving this
   change, and predicted how flowering times may be altered by 2080 with
   respect to future emissions scenarios. We show pear flowering
   (1990-2020) in the last 30 years has advanced 11.44 days compared to
   historical data (1960-1989). Furthermore, we highlight this advancement
   is apparent in all twelve pear cultivars and the four phenological
   stages analysed, including Conference, the most common UK pear cultivar.
   Our results indicate that this advancement in flowering began after
   1982; that air temperature and frost days significantly impact pear
   flowering; and this change in flowering phenology is likely to continue
   under future climate scenarios. Four Representative Concentration
   Pathways from the UK Climate Projections 2018 report were used to model
   the impact of future climate, including low, medium, medium-high and
   high emission scenarios. Under all scenarios a phenological advancement
   in flowering time was predicted by 2080 with the greatest advancement in
   flowering time observed under the high emission scenario. Earlier
   flowering and budburst could result in phenological mismatches between
   plant and pollinators, alter agricultural spraying regimes, increase
   risk of frost exposure and exacerbate impacts of pest populations within
   an agroecosystem, thus it is vital to monitor advancements in flowering
   phenology.},

Title = {Effect of intercrops complexity on water uptake patterns in rubber
   plantations: Evidence from stable isotopes (C-H-O) analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Rubber monoculture plantations are expanding but may cause environmental
   problems, and rubber-based agroforestry can provide ways of more
   environmentally friendly rubber cultivation. The general objective of
   this study was to investigate plant soil water uptake in different
   rubber agroforestry systems with water stable isotopes (delta H-2 and
   delta O-18), and water use efficiency with leaf delta C-13. We studied
   rubber trees in a monocultural plantation, and in three agroforestry
   systems which were mixed with (a) orange trees, (b) tea trees, and (c)
   both orange and tea trees, respectively. The results indicated that soil
   water content was enhanced in the agroforestry systems, especially for
   rubber-tea and rubber-orange-tea agroforesty systems. The soil water
   uptake of rubber trees varied seasonally, and exhibited significant
   different among the cultivation systems. Rubber trees in agroforestry
   systems seemingly absorb water from deeper soil horizons more than
   monocultural plantations. We also found that rubber trees adjusted their
   water source according to their growing stage: they increased their
   uptake of water from deeper soil horizons to meet water requirements
   during their leaf flushing stage. For the soil water uptake of
   intercrops, we found that they use a shallow soil horizon as their
   primary source of water uptake, with little seasonal variation in
   vertical water extraction patterns. Changes in leaf delta C-13 values
   indicate that rubber trees adjusted their water use efficiency
   seasonally, which helps to cope with seasonal drought and growth
   requirements. However, neither intercrops nor rubber trees' delta C-13
   values differ with sites, indicating that intercropping has little
   influence on intercrops and rubber trees' water supply. In conclusion,
   rubber trees have a flexible water use strategy, as intercropping shaped
   the soil water uptake patterns of rubber trees without apparent
   consequences on water use efficiency. These findings provide valuable
   insights into agroforestry systems' interspecific water use patterns
   that can help intercrop selection for rubber agroforestry systems in
   this region.},

Title = {Response of the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker) and its
   parasitoid assemblage to landscape composition},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {The rice stem borer (RSB), Chilo suppressalis (Walker), is an
   economically important pest of rice in subtropical Asia. Up till
   present, it remains unknown how pest abundance and parasitoid-mediated
   biological control are modulated by landscape composition. In this
   study, 20 rice fields with varying proportion of non-crop habitat in
   (2000 m radius) landscape sectors were selected in China's Jiangxi
   province. RSB infestation levels were highest in agriculture-dominated
   landscapes. Meanwhile, parasitism rate increased with pest pressure but
   was not related to landscape-level non-crop habitat cover.
   Landscape-level responses of parasitoids were species-specific and
   likely modulated by functional traits. The specialist parasitoid Cotesia
   chilonis (Munakata) responded negatively to non-crop habitat, while
   positive responses were recorded for the generalists Eriborus sinicus
   (Holmgren) and Microgaster russata (Haliday). Our work unveils the
   occurrence of a bottom-up cascade in which spatiotemporal rice cropping
   patterns shape pest pressure and parasitism dynamics, with more diverse
   land-scapes experiencing lower RSB infestation levels. Non-crop habitats
   within the landscape matrix equally retained parasitoid species with
   varying feeding modes and attack strategies. Hence, despite its
   (globally) inconsistent impacts on biological control, agricultural
   landscape diversification can directly benefit pest suppression and thus
   remains a valuable component of the ecological intensification toolbox.},

Title = {The effect of chamber placement site on N2O emission under different
   fertilizer regimes from maize field},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Static chamber method has been used to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emission from agricultural soils. When monitoring GHG emission in rice
   or wheat systems, all the plant stems can be covered in the top chamber.
   Under this situation, both nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from the root
   free soils and the root area soils can be estimated. However, in maize
   field, most of the studies placed the chamber within the maize row due
   to the difficulty to cover the whole maize stalk. N2O emission from the
   root area was not estimated since the majority of maize roots were
   excluded in the chamber. This may lead to a under estimation of global
   N2O emission from maize cultivation. To evaluate the spatial variability
   of N2O emission from maize field, a two-year field experiment was
   conducted. N2O emissions from three sampling sites including inter-rows,
   within-rows and root area were monitored under five different
   fertilization regimes. Results showed that chamber placement site had a
   significant effect on the N2O emission during the maize growing season.
   Placing the chamber in inter-rows either overestimated or underestimated
   N2O emission. In 2018, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 69 \%
   higher than the root area on average of the five treatments; whereas, in
   2020, N2O emission rate in the inter-rows was 2.5 times lower than the
   root area. N fertilization regimes had a significant effect on N2O
   emission. On average of chamber sites, N2O emission under N fertilizer
   broadcasting was around 2 times lower compared to nest-applied. The
   highest N2O emission rate was observed when both basal and dressing N
   fertilizer were applied in a nest, which was 1.1-3.2 times higher than
   the other N fertilizer placement regimes. The N2O emission rate from the
   within-rows was close to the average value of the three sampling sites.
   Our results suggested that placing chamber in the center of two
   neighboring maize plants could represent the average area-scaled N2O
   emission in maize field.},

Abstract = {Balancing water quality and food production is a global challenge due to
   complex nutrient cycle and previous soil accumulation. This study
   investigated crop-livestock integration from watershed perspective,
   while agricultural and environmental benefits of fertilizer and manure
   application were quantified through numerical experiments at two spatial
   scales. The optimal ratio of replacing chemical fertilizer with manure
   was found at the watershed scale and the spatial configuration of
   crop-livestock integration at large scale was suggested. Results showed
   that the period of basic fertilizer was more beneficial to crop yield
   and the effects of replacing chemical fertilizer with manure on water
   quality were prominent. Numerical simulation showed that specific
   threshold existed to balance water quality protection and agricultural
   production from watershed perspective. Then, by extending the threshold
   to regional scale, spatially explicit crop-livestock integration could
   be found. This study balances agriculture production and environment
   protection, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of
   croplivestock integration.},

Title = {Meta-analysis of the impacts of phosphorus addition on soil microbes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {340},

Abstract = {Soil microbes play a crucial role in myriad ecological processes in
   terrestrial ecosystem. With increasing nitrogen (N) loading, phosphorus
   (P) may become more limiting for soil microbes and these processes.
   However, it re-mains unclear to what extent P addition impacts soil
   microbial communities and respiration at global scale, especially under
   different N loadings. Therefore, we used a global meta-analysis to
   examine the effects of phosphorus addition on soil microbes based on
   2293 paired observations from 129 studies in the world. Overall, P
   addition increased significantly total as well as fungal, bacterial, and
   actinomycete (ACT) phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), together with Gram+
   bacteria (G+) and Gram-bacteria (G-) abundance regardless of N input or
   not. The increments were more pronounced under higher P addition rate or
   places with higher mean annual temperature or mean annual precipitation.
   Moreover, the fungi: bacteria ratio significantly decreased along
   elevational gradients. Furthermore, higher P addition frequency tended
   to have significantly more ACT PLFAs, as well as higher G+:G-, but
   significantly lower fungi: bacteria ratio (F:B). However, the responses
   of P addition on bacterial PLFAs and F:B were larger in forest than
   grassland, and cropland and varied with P fertilizer forms. In addition,
   the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents was positively
   correlated with those of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and bacterial
   PLFAs, and all these three parameters, in addition to fungal PLFAs,
   correlated positively with the response of soil respiration (Rs). Our
   results suggest that phosphorus addition had globally positive effects
   on soil microbes with different N loadings, and the positive effects of
   soil microbial abundance tended to promote heterotrophic respiration
   (Rh) and Rs. These results deepen our understanding of soil microbial
   community structure and function dynamics under increasing P deposition.
   They also provide extensive evidences and bases for parameterization of
   soil carbon cycling models incorporating microbial re-sponses under
   global climate change.},

Title = {How diverse are sun-grown coffee plantations? Local and landscape
   heterogeneity drives Andean rove beetle diversity},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Compared to shade coffee plantations, sun-grown coffee is not considered
   very biodiversity-friendly, but little is known about how the management
   practices for this crop and landscape characteristics affect species
   diversity. Some predatory staphylinids (rove beetles) are important
   biological control agents in many agricultural systems, but have not
   received much attention in tropical agroecosystems or in coffee
   plantations. After collecting 2074 individuals belonging to 126 species
   of staphylinid collected from 27 sampling sites in a region dominated by
   sun-grown coffee in the Colombian Andes, we evaluated how local and
   landscape heterogeneity affect the di-versity, abundance and composition
   of staphylinids. We found that both local and landscape variables had
   effects in different directions and of different magnitudes depending on
   the community attribute evaluated. At the local scale, rove beetle
   diversity increased with the density of herbaceous plants and coffee
   plant cover. At the landscape scale, species richness decreased with
   increasing forest cover, while the number of forest patches had a
   positive effect. We also found a high degree of species turnover within
   and between coffee plantations, and this was explained by farmland
   habitat structural differences between the coffee plantations and also
   the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. Our results indicate
   that the Andean sun-grown coffee plantations still host diverse and
   taxonomically dissimilar staphylinid communities. Therefore, properly
   managed local vegetation structure and the preservation of forest
   remnants on the landscape contribute to maintaining high diversity in
   this coffee production system. Promoting biodiversity conservation and
   the provision of ecosystem services by agroecosystems-even in intense
   production systems-requires that environmental heterogeneity on several
   scales be taken into account.},

Title = {Soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions as affected by straw and
   nitrogen management on the North China Plain},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Straw incorporation and nitrogen (N) application play crucial roles in
   regulating soil carbon (C) and N storage and availability. However,
   their effects on soil C and N fractions and microbial community
   composition, as well as the relationships between microorganisms and
   soil organic C (SOC) and soil organic N (SON) fractions remain largely
   unexplored. Here, arable soils following 5-year straw (NS, nonamended
   controls; AS, wheat and maize straw incorporation) and N (0, 150 and 250
   kg N ha(-1) applied for each crop) management were collected to
   determine the organic C and N fractions and microbial community
   composition. Compared to NS, AS significantly increased the contents of
   SOC and total nitrogen (TN) by 36.26 \% and 24.12 \%, respectively,
   mainly by increasing the contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   particulate organic carbon (POC), hydrolysable unknown-N (HUN) and acid
   insoluble-N (AIN). Under straw incorporation, N addition significantly
   improved total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), the contents of TN,
   DOC, amino acid-N (AAN), active SON and stable SON, and the ratios of
   POC/SOC and DOC/SOC. However, there was no significant difference in SOC
   pool, organic C and N fractions (except for AAN and active SON) and
   microbial community composition between the N150 and N250 levels under
   AS. Compared to straw removal, straw incorporation significantly changed
   the microbial community composition by increasing the accumulations of
   SOC, DOC, POC, and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC). Regression
   analysis indicated that high relative abundances of fungi and
   gram-positive bacteria (GP) were more conducive to stable SON
   accumulation. Collectively, straw incorporation coupled with 150 kg N
   ha(-1) per crop growing season was a sustainable field management
   practice for effectively improving soil fertility on the North China
   Plain.},

Title = {Perennial woodlands benefit parasitoid diversity, but annual flowering
   fallows enhance parasitism of wheat aphids in an agricultural landscape},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Agriculture intensification poses serious threats to natural enemy
   biodiversity and associated ecological services. The conservation or
   reestablishment of semi-natural habitats is used to counteract negative
   effects of agriculture intensification on natural enemies. Understanding
   specific functions of different habitats for natural enemies from a
   landscape perspective is an important step needed for the development of
   sustainable agriculture. Here, focusing on parasitoids of wheat aphids,
   we examined effects of the proportion and connectivity of two main
   semi-natural habitats (woodlands and fallows) present in landscapes,
   measured within circular buffer radii of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 km
   around sampling sites, on parasitoid (mummy) density, biodiversity
   (Shannon diversity) and associated services (parasitism rate) in 35
   wheat fields. We also compared local vegetation communities of these two
   semi-natural habitats to test whether plant characteristics can shed
   light on the potential mechanisms driving parasitoids responses to
   different landscape habitats. We found that the parasitoid diversity was
   much higher in landscapes dominated by woodlands, while fallows in the
   landscape promoted parasitoid density and parasitism. Woodlands
   connectivity at larger scales (such as 1.5 or 2.0 km) displayed positive
   effects on para-sitoid activities, fallows connectivity at the smaller
   scale (0.5 km) had a positive effect on the hyperparasitism rate. In
   terms of vegetation characteristics, fallows provided more flowering
   plants and floral resources, while woodlands suffered less disturbance
   across years. Local vegetation composition of the semi-natural habitats
   indeed help explain their different effects on parasitoids at larger
   landscape scales. We suggested that future research should investigate
   the role of different types of semi-natural habitats. Conservation
   management should combine different habitats, such as perennial and
   annual habitats, to promote the functional complementarity for
   beneficial organisms. Based on results from local vegetation survey, we
   also suggested native flowering plants such as Capsella bursa-pastoris
   L., Lagopsis supina Steph., and Calystegia hederacea Wall. in fallows
   could be used as functional plants to conserve wheat aphid parasitoids.},

Title = {Field-aged biochar enhances soil organic carbon by increasing
   recalcitrant organic carbon fractions and making microbial communities
   more conducive to carbon sequestration},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Biochar has been widely proposed for carbon (C) sequestration, but its
   residual effects on soil organic C (SOC) accumulation and microbial
   characteristics are unknown. Herein, we investigated the content and
   components of organic C, and the abundance and community characteristics
   of microbes in a fluvo-aquic soil, after 4 years of biochar application
   at rates of 3, 6 and 12 t ha(-1). Biochar application increased the
   contents of SOC and recalcitrant organic C fraction by 11.02-22.13 \%
   and 18.41-32.31 \% at 6 and 12 t ha(-1), respectively, and the increased
   proportion for recalcitrant organic C fraction was greater than that for
   SOC. Among C functional groups, aryl C content was increased by
   26.50-95.41 \% at all rates, compared with 23.83-56.73 \% for phenolic C
   at 6 and 12 t ha(-1), and both increases were higher than that for SOC.
   Biochar application decreased bacterial abundance by 9.25-35.77 \%, and
   altered bacterial community structure by increasing the relative
   abundance of Chloroflexi phylum, members of which have a low C
   mineralisation rate and strong C fixation ability. Dissolved organic C
   was the most critical factor of bacterial abundance and community
   structure. By contrast, 12 t ha(-1) biochar application decreased fungal
   diversity by 12.45 \%, and altered fungal community structure by
   increasing the relative abundances of Sordariomycetes and
   Tremellomycetes classes, both of which favoured SOC formation. The C/N
   ratio was the most important variable affecting fungal diversity and
   community structure. Overall, our results suggest that field-aged
   biochar, especially at a high-dose rate, accelerates organic C
   accumulation by increasing aryl and phenolic C functional groups of
   recalcitrant organic C fractions and shifting microbial communities more
   conducive to C sequestration in the fluvo-aquic soil.},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Cover crop mixtures of functionally distinct species may increase
   multiple ecosystem services, depending on their productivity and
   composition. We assessed how unique management legacies, and resulting
   soil fertility properties, influenced the functions provided by a cover
   crop mixture. We used the Kellogg Biological Station's long-term Main
   Cropping Systems Experiment to test the legacy effects of four
   management systems (ranging from conventional to organic) on the
   production and function of crimson clover and cereal rye cover crops
   grown alone and in mixture, with a focus on their potential for
   improving agroecosystem N retention and supply. We applied bromide as a
   conservative tracer of solute flow in the soil profile to assess
   management legacy and cover crop treatment effects on potential anion
   leaching. A history of ecological nutrient management practices,
   including long-term cover crop use, increased soil fertility. Higher
   soil fertility, in turn, increased spring cover crop biomass and mixture
   evenness, and percent recovery of bromide, an estimate of soil anion
   retention. Mixture evenness was positively related to higher cover crop
   C/N ratios, N retention in corn biomass, and percent of clover N from
   fixation. In legacies with lower soil fertility, clover was more
   competitive than rye in the mixtures. Our results show that the benefits
   from cover crop mixtures depend on the management context into which
   they are adopted. In lower fertility soils with higher nutrient leaching
   potential, we suggest increasing crop functional diversity by including
   single species cover crops at different points within a crop rotation to
   build soil fertility. Once background soil fertility has been developed,
   farmers could include mixtures in their agro-ecosystems to maximize the
   functions provided by cover crops.},

Title = {Integrated effects of plastic film residues on cotton growth and field
   carbon sequestration under drip irrigation in arid oasis regions},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Mulched drip irrigation is the primary irrigation technology for cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. In
   recent years, the increasing amount of residual plastic film (RPF) in
   mulched cotton fields has posed a more significant threat to soil
   quality and the sustainability of agricultural production. However, the
   relationship between different soil RPF amounts and cotton growth,
   yield, and carbon balance in cotton fields is unclear. In this study,
   six RPF amounts, namely RPF0 (0 kg ha(-1)), RPF5 (146.18 kg ha(-1)),
   RPF10 (228.03 kg ha(-1)), RPF15 (309.88 kg ha(-1)), RPF20 (391.73 kg
   ha(-1)), and RPF25 (473.58 kg ha(-1)), were set in a two-year
   (2020-2021) field experiment to investigate their effects on cotton
   growth, yield, field CO2 emissions, and carbon sequestration. Results
   showed that cotton growth indicators (Plant height, stem diameter, leaf
   area index, biomass of each organ) at different growth stages and yield
   indicators (Single boll weight, per plant bolls number, seed cotton
   yield) were significantly negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with the soil
   RPF amount. The RPF25 treatment showed yield decreases of up to 33.4\%
   and 43.2\% in these two years, respectively, compared with the RPF0
   treatment. Surprisingly, the presence of RPF in soil reduced the rate
   and cumulative CO2 emissions from cotton fields during the growth and
   fallow periods, but carbon sequestration in cotton fields decreased
   significantly with increasing RPF amounts (15.05\%similar to 60.98\% in
   2020 and 17.38 similar to 76.81\% in 2021). RPF inhibited cotton root
   growth, reducing plant biomass accumulation, decreasing seed cotton
   yield, and weakening cotton fields' carbon sink. When the RPF amount in
   the soil was less than or equal to 228.03 kg ha(-1), cotton economic
   benefits and field carbon storage were not unduly weakened. The
   second-year indicators of cotton fields with the RPF were significantly
   lower than the first year, and the permanent residue of soil RPF also
   created a more hostile crop growing environment. We concluded that the
   RPF amount in fields should be reduced as soon as possible and that more
   environmentally friendly and carbon-reducing mulching materials should
   be used instead of plastic film.},

Title = {Adjacent forest moderates insect pollination of oil palm},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Natural habitat plays a role in many agroecosystems as a source of
   pollination services and other ecological spillover, but these effects
   are largely unquantified in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a globally
   important crop linked to deforestation. In a field experiment in
   Sumatra, Indonesia, we manipulated floral visitor access to female oil
   palm inflorescences over a 100 m distance gradient from forest into oil
   palm and sampled insects with sticky traps placed above male and female
   inflorescences. Full exclusion of floral visitors decreased mean oil
   palm fruit set to 12\%, demonstrating that insect pollination was
   necessary to maintain favorable fruit set and yield. Treatment group
   means of fruit set under open pollination (62\%) and when excluding
   large (>1.4 mm diameter) organisms (72\%), did not differ significantly
   from open pollination augmented with hand pollination (61\%), suggesting
   no difference in pollen limitation. In contrast, when we examined change
   in fruit set with distance from forest, we found a significant trend of
   higher fruit set in oil palms closer to the forest when large organisms
   were excluded, which increased estimated fruit set at the forest edge to
   87\%, compared to open-pollinated palms (70\%). This trend with distance
   from forest was absent when we fully excluded floral visitors, showing
   that the effect of forest was not likely due to an abiotic gradient
   (e.g., changing soil nutrients). Of the arthropod taxa collected from
   sticky traps, Drosophilidae (Diptera) and Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera)
   decreased and increased with distance from forest, respectively. The
   taxa Elaeidobius kamerunicus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Gelechiidae,
   and the families Thripidae and Phlaeothripidae (Thysanoptera) were
   abundant on both male and female inflorescence sticky traps. Elaeidobius
   kamerunicus, an introduced oil palm pollinator, had the only significant
   relationship with fruit set. Our results confirm pollination by insects
   as a key ecosystem service for oil palm production. Although further
   work is needed to clarify the relationship between fruit set,
   biodiversity, and distance from forest, we speculate that excluding
   large organisms could have increased fruit set closer to forest by
   mediating interactions between pollinators, forest predators, and farm
   mesopredators. Understanding the relationships between nearby forest and
   pollination services could better connect oil palm production to its
   landscape context and associated biodiversity. This would be important
   for landscape-scale conservation planning that considers both the
   ecosystem service needs and ecological impacts of oil palm agriculture.},

Title = {Impact of crop exposure and agricultural intensification on the
   phenotypic variation of bees},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {In a context of rapid global change, understanding how environmental
   stressors can impact phenotypic variation, and which phenotypic traits
   are predominantly affected can be particularly relevant. Indeed,
   potential phenotypic modifications could affect the functionality of
   traits from taxa that are in decline but that are keystone species in
   many ecosystems. In this study, we assessed the impact of environmental
   drivers and agricultural intensification on two crucial pollinator
   species: the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the buff-tailed bumblebee
   (Bombus terrestris). Among eight countries representing four major
   European biogeographical regions {[}i.e., Boreal (Sweden and Estonia),
   Atlantic (Ireland and United Kingdom), Continental (Germany and
   Switzerland) and Mediterranean (Spain and Italy)] and two type of crops
   (i.e., apple orchards and oilseed rape) we assessed how landscape
   structure, latitude and pesticide management could impact their wing
   morphology. Two sampling sessions were conducted: the first one when the
   hives/nests were settled on the field (T0) and a second sampling session
   after the potential effect of agricultural intensification (T1). Using a
   dataset of more than 7238 wings, we measured the wing size, shape and
   asymmetry. We observed that, in several countries, a shift in most of
   the morphological traits occurred between T0 and T1. When focusing on
   the drivers of phenotypic variation in T1, the levels of significance
   for some potential drivers were sometimes high, while most of the
   variation remained unexplained. The latitude and, more rarely, grassland
   cover were found to partly explain the wing modifications. In light of
   these results, we conclude that phenotypic shifts can occur in a very
   short period, after encountering new field conditions. Further studies
   should be conducted to better understand which alternative drivers could
   explain morphological changes in the agro-ecosystem after crop
   exposition, as well as the potential consequences of these changes on
   foraging performance or pollination efficiency.},

Abstract = {Substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic amendments is an
   important practice for promoting soil phos-phorus (P) transformation and
   alleviating excessive P accumulation in greenhouse vegetable production,
   yet little research has comprehensively investigated the effects on
   functional traits of P cycling microorganisms. Here, we integrated
   metagenomics and genome binning to explore 24 soil microbial P cycling
   traits in a 10-year field experiment including four treatments (equal
   NPK input): chemical fertilizer (CC), half of chemical N substituted
   with manure (CM), straw (CS), or manure plus straw (CMS). Compared with
   the CC treatment, organic substitution fertilization (CM, CS, and CMS)
   increased microbial taxonomic and functional diversity. Among P
   cycling-related genes, organic substitution fertilization significantly
   reduced the relative abundance of the phoU and increased the absolute
   abundance of gcd, ppx, and phoD (fluorescence quantitative PCR). Among
   microbial taxa containing gcd and phoD genes, organic substitution
   fertilization significantly increased the abundance of
   Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which were the most
   important predictors of soil Olsen P. Long-term organic substitution
   fertilization increased the microbial P solubilization and
   mineralization capacity by increasing soil C:P and N:P ratios and
   decreasing the pH. The gcd, ppx and phoD genes were positively
   correlated with labile P and Olsen P. The 12 reconstructed bacterial
   genomes harbored P solubilization genes, and the abundances of most
   genomes were higher under organic substitution fertilization than under
   CC treatment. Overall, organic substitution fertilization mainly
   increased the microbial P solubilization and mineralization capacity for
   P availability and also promoted microbial P immobilization, reducing
   losses to the environment in greenhouse vegetable production.},

Abstract = {The sole effect of crop straw incorporation or film mulching on soil
   organic carbon (SOC) content, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and crop
   yield is well documented in the literature; however, the combined
   effects of biodegradable film mulching coupled with straw incorporation
   on these aspects is not yet studied in detail. We conducted a field
   experiment expanding over five years to evaluate the influence of
   different film mulching with straw incorporation treatments: (i)
   double-ridge furrow sowing with full film mulching plus straw
   incorporation (DS), (ii) double-ridge furrow sowing with full film
   mulching (D), (iii) conventional tillage plus straw incorpo-ration (S),
   and (iv) conventional tillage (CK) on organic carbon contents (SOC), GHG
   emissions and maize productivity. An average of the results of five
   years revealed that DS, as compared to CK, increased grain and
   biological yield by 74.06 \% and 29.47 \% (P < 0.05), followed by D and
   S (except for 2017). With every pro-gressing year, DS significantly
   increased the organic carbon content in the 0-20 cm soil layer with an
   approx-imately increase of 17.60 \% from 2015 to 2020. A maximum total
   organic carbon storage of 130.99 Mg C ha-1 in 0-100 cm soil profile was
   recorded for DS, which was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than other
   treatments. Conversely, compared with CK, DS increased CO2 and N2O
   emissions by 34.38 \% and 33.95 \%, respectively, but significantly
   reduced the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity
   (GHGI) by 41.96 \% and 64.91 \%, respectively. It is concluded that the
   use of biodegradable mulch coupled with straw incorporation could be an
   efficient strategy leading to improved maize yield and organic carbon
   content, and reduced net global warming potential (NGWP) and GHGI in
   semi-arid rainfed areas.},

Title = {Liming modifies greenhouse gas fluxes from soils: A meta-analysis of
   biological drivers},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Acidic soils cover about 30\% of the world's land. Liming is a
   management practice applied worldwide to reduce the negative effects of
   acidification on soil fertility and plant growth. Liming also affects
   the biotic and abiotic soil properties controlling the production and
   consumption of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous
   oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Although our understanding of how liming
   regulates net GHG emissions is increasing, the impact of liming on soil
   biological drivers of GHG emissions has not been quantitatively
   synthesized. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis using 1474 paired
   observations from 124 studies to explore the responses of GHG emissions
   to liming, with a focus on soil biological factors. We show that the N2O
   mitigation capacity of liming could be linked to (i) increases in
   bacterial abundance of N2O reductase genes (NosZ) and decreases in
   fungi:bacteria ratio, both contributing to a lower N2O:N-2 product ratio
   of denitrification; and (ii) reductions in soil mineral nitrogen (N) via
   stimulation of plant N uptake. The limited evidence available indicates
   that liming reduced CH4 emissions and the abundance of methanogens, but
   it had no effect on CH4 uptake and abundance of methanotrophs.
   Liming-induced increases in soil CO2 emissions can be explained by
   higher heterotrophic and/or autotrophic respiration. The strong coupling
   between liming effects on GHG emissions and on soil microbial
   communities involved in GHG production and consumption can be used to
   identify strategies to reduce GHGs in response to liming, and to improve
   process-based models for better pre-dictions of soil GHG emissions.},

Title = {High-resolution tracking data highlight the importance of fallow land
   during a seasonal habitat bottleneck for a steppe-land specialist},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Farmland ecosystems are seasonally dynamic habitats shaped by
   meteorological fluctuations and anthropogenic land-use changes. Farmland
   birds may be seasonally constrained with limited foraging and breeding
   resources (so-called ``resource bottlenecks ``), especially when there
   is a loss of natural and semi-natural habitats. During spring, the
   growth of cereal crops makes a large proportion of arable land
   unsuitable for specialist steppe birds with narrow vegetation structure
   requirements. We investigated the existence of a seasonal bottleneck of
   suitable habitats for steppe birds using the endangered Pin-tailed
   sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata) as a model species. We used for first
   time lightweight GPS tags to study habitat selection and movement
   patterns throughout the cereal crop cycle during three years in
   north-eastern Spain. We also evaluated if conservation measures
   promoting suitable vegetation structures for steppe birds (Targeted
   Fallow Management, TFM) influenced habitat selection. Sandgrouse avoided
   cereal crops when cereal vegetation was high, resulting in a 30\%
   reduction of suitable habitat area at the start of the breeding season.
   This proved the existence of a spring habitat bottleneck when sandgrouse
   only selected open natural habitats and fallows. Sandgrouse similarly
   selected TFM and conventionally managed fallows during and after the
   bottleneck, possibly because of their similar vegetation structure and
   the scarcity of alternative suitable habitats. Halting the ongoing loss
   of fallow land is paramount for the conservation of steppe birds like
   sandgrouse because they constitute a key refuge to buffer the impacts of
   seasonal habitat bottlenecks.},

Title = {Soil Acidification caused by excessive application of nitrogen

   review and field trials},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},

Abstract = {Modern high input-based intensive cropping systems often lead to the
   deterioration of the soil environment, which is one of the main driving
   factors for the build-up of soil-borne pathogens. However, soil chemical
   properties are complex and variable, and it is important to clarify the
   main factors driving soil-borne pathogens. In this study, meta-analysis
   and field experiment were used to determine the key soil chemical
   factors affecting soil-borne diseases. Our data demonstrated that a
   decrease in the soil pH was the key soil chemical factor that aggravated
   soil-borne diseases. Among the complex soil chemical factors, the
   increase in available nitrogen (AN) caused by excessive application of
   nitrogen fertilizer and the accumulation of phenolic acids were the main
   driving factors for the decrease in the soil pH value. Field experiments
   on Panax notoginseng, which is susceptible to nitrogen and suffers from
   serious soil-borne disease, showed that a high level of AN (>= 350 mg
   kg-1) in soil caused by overuse of nitrogen fertilizer could decrease
   the pH and aggravate soil-borne disease. However, exogenous quicklime
   (600-1200 kg hm-2), calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer (600-1200 kg
   hm-2), and organic fertilizer (1050-1500 kg hm-2) in acidic soil could
   effectively increase the soil pH value and alleviate soil-borne disease.
   Our results highlight that soil-borne disease can be aggravated by
   overuse of nitrogen fer-tilizer and can be alleviated by modifying soil
   to a suitable pH level.},

   national Epiphyt dataset (part of the national epidemiological
   monitoring service) was used to assess the relative importance of
   weather and landscape drivers on the between-region variability in the
   level of occurrence of some agricultural pests. Using a regional
   resolution, we analysed the proportion of occurrence of slugs, cereal
   aphids and oilseed rape pests over 181 small agricultural areas
   ('regions') across France in 2018. The mean proportion of occurrence per
   region was 0.17 for slugs, 0.25 for cereal aphids and 0.61 for oilseed
   rape pests. Weather variables were more explanatory than landscape ones
   for the proportion of occurrence of slugs and oilseed rape pests while
   the two types of variables had a similar level of explanation for the
   regional proportion of aphid occurrence. Slugs were favoured by high
   winter temperatures, high soil wetness index and important proportions
   of hedgerows in the region but negatively influenced by high winter
   rainfalls. Cereal aphids and oilseed rape pests were negatively
   influenced by the regional proportion of grassland. Additionally, the
   winter air humidity and the proportion of perennial crops in the region
   decreased the proportion of occurrence of oilseed rape pests. We
   detected no effect of the proportion of host crop or the proportion of
   organic farming in the region. This study emphasises that, in line with
   findings derived from more local studies, weather characteristics are an
   important driver of the regional level of pest occurrence in arable
   fields; it also highlights that the proportion of grassland at the
   regional scale could be a key tool to design insect-pest suppressive
   landscapes.},

Title = {Favourite plants of wild bees},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Flower strips are a commonly used tool for improving agricultural
   landscapes for pollinators. The plant composition of the seed mixtures
   employed is based on logistic decisions, e.g. costs or seed
   availability, the literature and expert opinion, and only rarely on
   direct information about bee-plant interactions. We combined two
   datasets on bee-plant interactions involving 460 bee species. The first
   consisted of 23,864 bee-plant in-teractions, recorded in twenty
   locations in Germany from 2018 and 2019, whereas the second consisted of
   86,509 bee-plant interactions sampled across multiple sites in southwest
   Germany over more than 30 years. We explored three objectives. (1) Which
   plant species attract the greatest number of wild bee species and
   individuals across plant communities within and across seasons of bee
   activity? (2) Do the most attractive plant species also support
   threatened and specialized wild bees? (3) Do seed mixtures contain
   attractive plant species? High attractiveness was defined as a
   consistently high interaction frequency and number of visiting bee
   species to a plant species across the sampled communities. Our results
   identified 34 herbaceous key plant species that were highly attractive
   for wild bees independently of plant abundance and across locations.
   Further, we identified a large number of plant species for which the
   attractiveness for wild bees depended on the sampled community. The
   identified key plant species attracted between 2\% and 32\% of
   oligolectic or red-listed bees present in our datasets. Although some of
   these plant species, such as Centaurea cyanus or C. jacea, are commonly
   found in seed mixtures, others, such as Stachys recta or Carduus nutans,
   are not. These large-scale and robust interaction data highlight key
   plant species that provide an attractive core for herbaceous floral
   strips aimed at supporting high numbers of wild bee species.},

Title = {Forage species composition influenced soil health in organic forage
   transitioning systems},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The demand for organic forage is increasing while information on
   appropriate forage species that influence soil properties and forage
   productivity is scarce. This study was conducted to understand the
   response of soil health to a diverse forage species in the transitioning
   stage of low-input organic forage systems. Soils were collected for two
   years after the forage establishment to analyze soil health indicators.
   Results showed that perennial mixtures generally had greater total
   nitrogen (N), mineral N, soil organic carbon (SOC), and microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC), while similar pH, extractable phosphorus (P),
   extractable potassium (K), and wet aggregate stability (WAS), compared
   to monocultures. Mean values of perennial mixtures vs. monocultures at
   0-5 cm were 2.1 vs. 1.9 g kg -1, 21.1 vs. 16.2 mg kg -1, 21 vs. 19 g
   kg-1, 352 vs. 290 mg kg-1 for total N, mineral N, SOC and MBC,
   respectively. Among perennial mixtures, tall fescue (Schedonorus
   arundinaceus Schreb.)-legume mixtures showed higher pH, total N, mineral
   N, MBC, and soil quality index (SQI). Tall fescue-white clover
   (Trifolium repens L.) mixtures had highest pH (6.34 and 6.45), total N
   (2.09 and 1.69 g kg -1), and mineral N (25.4 and 21.3 mg kg -1) at 0-5
   and 5-15 cm, respectively. The SQI in tall fescue-alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa L.) was higher than bermu-dagrass {[}Cynodon dactylon (L.)
   Pers.]-alfalfa mixture (77 vs. 71). Compared to perennials, the annual
   system had comparable or greater total N, mineral N, SOC, MBC, WAS, and
   SQI. In the 0-5 cm stratum, annual systems from two research sites had
   2.01 and 2.21 g kg-1 total N, 17.9 and 29.9 mg kg-1 mineral N, 20.0 and
   22.5 g kg-1 SOC, 337 and 227 mg kg-1 MBC, 72 \% and 80 \% for WAS, and
   74 and 72 for SQI. However, the annual system had lower or comparable
   pH, P and K, compared to most perennial mixtures. After two-years of
   organic management, most treatments increased soil moisture, pH, MBC,
   and extractable P compared to the baseline data, while some treatments
   decreased SOC, mineral N, and K. This study suggested perennial
   mixtures, especially tall fescue -legume systems, had the greatest
   potential in improving soil health at the early stage of low-input
   organic pasture establishment. Despite the short-term management,
   low-input organic pastures improved some impor-tant soil properties such
   as moisture, pH, MBC, and extractable P. Long-term monitoring is needed
   to understand the full spectrum of ecosystem benefits when organic
   management is implemented in forage production systems.},

Abstract = {Using soil inoculants containing naturally occurring beneficial
   microorganisms has become a popular practice in sustainable agriculture.
   However, an understanding of the environmental variables that affect
   plant-microbe interactions and the benefit of using commercial inoculum
   is relatively sparse. To address this, we examined the efficiency of
   three different methods to inoculate AMF (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi)
   in organic vegetable farms in south Texas: cover cropping, application
   of farm-produced (indigenous) AMF inoculum, and use of commercially
   available AMF inoculum. We examined these different application methods
   on growth of jalapeno pepper (Capsicum annuum), and bunching onions
   (Allium fistulosum). We found that abundance of AMF could be
   significantly augmented using cover crops such as sunn hemp (Crotalaria
   juncea), sorghum (Sorghum drummon-dii), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)
   during the summer fallow periods. These cover crops were associated with
   a 2.5-3-fold increase in spore abundance in the rhizosphere. In
   addition, on-farm produced inoculum had a higher root colonization rate
   in cash crops compared to the commercial inoculum. Pepper plants treated
   with indige-nous AMF flowered and produced fruits 5 days earlier on
   average compared to the commercial inoculum and control, but there was
   no significant difference in the total yield across the different
   treatments. However, for bunching onions, plants treated with on-farm
   produced indigenous AMF resulted in bigger plants, with about 5 g more
   total biomass, resulting in higher yield, and with no significant
   difference between commercial AMF treatment and control. Taken together,
   our study shows that the on-farm produced inoculum has the potential to
   provide greater agronomic benefits than commercial AMF inoculum in
   organic agriculture systems.},

Abstract = {Straw return is an effective conservation tillage measure that improves
   soil properties, increases crop yields, and is an efficient means of
   reusing agrobioenergy by-products. Straw return has been shown to affect
   nitrogen (N) cycling and related functional microbes in agricultural
   soils. However, the relationship between nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
   and N-related functional genes under different straw return strategies
   in wheat-corn double cropping systems remains elusive. Here, we
   conducted a short-term field study to investigate the response of N2O
   emissions driven by N cycling functional genes (bacterial and archaeal
   amoA genes and nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes) to different straw return
   patterns in a wheat-corn double cropping system in the North China
   Plain. Three treatments were established, namely, both wheat and corn
   straw return (CWSR), only wheat straw mulch return (WSR), and no straw
   return (NSR). Over the wheat-corn season, the total N2O emissions
   significantly increased by 31.74\% and 12.37\% in CWSR and WSR-treated
   soils, respectively. Straw return increased nitrifying and denitrifying
   functional gene abundances, thus stimulating N2O emissions. Correlation
   analysis showed that AOA (r = 0.262, p < 0.05) and AOB (r = 0.703, p <
   0.01) were strongly and positively correlated with NO3--N
   concentrations, indicating that AOA and AOB were involved in
   nitrification under straw return. Both nirS (r = 0.287, p < 0.05) and
   nirK genes (r = 0.252, p < 0.05) were positively correlated with N2O
   emissions, while nosZ genes (r =-0.266, p < 0.05) were negatively
   correlated with N2O emissions. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis
   further revealed that straw return indirectly affected N2O emissions by
   influencing the abundances of AOB-amoA (r = 0.324, p < 0.05), nirK (r =
   0.417, p < 0.05), and nosZ (r =-0.388, p < 0.001) genes. Overall,
   short-term straw return increased N2O production in a wheat-corn double
   cropping system, mainly through increased AOB-amoA and nirK gene
   abundance, which stimulated N2O production, and reduced nosZ gene
   abundance, which inhibited N2O reduction.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The eutrophication caused by nitrogen loss from sloping farmland is a
   serious concern, especially in the context of increasing frequency of
   extreme rainfall events. The relative importance that the surface runoff
   and interflow processes govern the nitrogen loss under extreme rainfall
   events, however, is ambiguous. Moreover, this ambiguity could be further
   enhanced by conservation practices on sloping farmland, such as straw
   returning and contour tillage. To better understand these ambiguities,
   five simulated rainfall experiments at the intensity of 100 mm h(-1)
   under four treatments including downslope tillage (DT), cross-slope
   tillage (CT), cross-slope tillage with whole straw returning (CT + WR),
   cross-slope tillage with crushed straw returning (CT + CR), were
   con-ducted in 2 years' maize season on a typical purple sloping farmland
   in the hilly area of Sichuan, China. Results showed: 1) Compared with
   DT, straw returning and cross-slope tillage significantly reduced
   surface runoff and nitrogen load of surface runoff. However the
   concomitant potential increase of the interflow runoff would result in
   the increase of nitrogen loss via interflow, offsetting the benefits of
   conservation practices; 2) The nitrogen loss through interflow is 6.38
   +/- 0.21 kg ha(-1), accounting for 77.9 \% of the total nitrogen loss
   and suggesting that interflow is the dominant process; 3) Dissolved
   organic nitrogen is one of the main nitrogen loss forms, accounted for
   41.06 \% (24.31-57.69 \%) of the total nitrogen loss in surface runoff
   and 32.02 \% (12.28-47.81 \%) for interflow, should not been ignored; 4)
   The results of the three prediction models showed that the nitrogen loss
   caused by interflow drainage under extreme rainfall should not be
   ignored. These findings enhance our understanding of nitrogen exports
   induced by extreme rainfall events and provide references for nitrogen
   loss predictions and control in sloping farmland.},

Title = {Agricultural intensification weakens the soil health index and stability
   of microbial networks},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The stability of soil microbial community plays a key role in nutrient
   cycling, soil organic carbon reservoirs, and plant productivity, making
   them crucial players in agroecosystems. Although the effect of
   agricultural intensi-fication on microbial communities has been
   extensively studied, little is known about the stability of the
   mi-crobial networks. In this study, we examined the changes in soil
   properties and the stability of the microbial networks by combining
   co-occurrence networks and structural equation model under agricultural
   intensification in Qu Zhou, China. The results showed that agricultural
   intensification weakened the stability of the bacterial and fungal
   community networks, the stability of the bacterial network was
   negatively and positively correlated with the relative abundances of
   Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria, and, the stability of the fungal
   network was positively correlated with the relative abundance of
   Glomeromycota and Basimycota and negatively correlated with Ascomycota.
   Bacterial and fungal community compositions were correlated with a range
   of environmental variables including soil organic matter, soil total N,
   C/N and soil health index (SHI), and SHI, which was the only factors
   affecting both bacterial network modules. Structural equation modeling
   combined with correlations between the soil environment and network
   module suggested that SHI played the most direct role in changes in the
   microbial phyla and then indirectly stimulated the stability of the
   microbial networks. Our study highlights the importance of SHI as a
   comprehensive, key element in shaping the microbial community
   composition, leading to enhanced microbial network stability.},

Title = {Conversion from farmland to orchards has minor effects on nitrogen
   biological processes in deep loess deposits},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {High nitrate (NO3--N) accumulation has been observed globally in vadose
   zones due to the overuse of synthetic fertilizer, but its impacts on
   nitrogen (N) biological processes remain poorly understood, especially
   after land use conversion from farmlands to deep-rooted apple orchards.
   In this study, we collected paired soil samples to determine available N
   contents, NO3--N isotopes, and abundances of N functional genes (NFGs)
   in 10-m loess profiles under cultivated farmlands and adjacent apple
   orchards (n = 300). The average NO3--N accumulation under orchards was
   4773 kg N ha (1) (10 times higher than farmlands), with the NO3--N
   profiles resembling a parabolic curve within 0 -4 m below the surface.
   Regardless of excessive fertilizer application and welldeveloped root
   systems, the deep-rooted orchards had minor effects on N sources and
   biological processes in deep loess deposits, as indicated by our
   estimates of isotopes and NFGs abundances. We hypothesized that the
   limited and inactive microorganisms in the subsoil are more resistant to
   environmental disturbances, and that carbon source and ammonium
   substrate dominated the gene expression and occurrence of NFGs-indicated
   biological processes. The limited root biomass per unit depth and the
   inhibition effects of a dry soil horizon on root turnover and exudate
   release likely contributed to the less perturbed N biological processes
   under orchards. As the first study to explore N transformation processes
   in 10-m loess deposits, this study provided insights for complicated N
   biogeochemical cycles in arid regions with deep unsaturated soils and
   intensive agricultural land use.},

Title = {Tree and hedgerow configurations on maize farms are key drivers of
   granivorous passerine bird assemblage patterns},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Granivorous birds are responsible for significant cereal crop losses to
   farmers worldwide. However, how cropland vegetation structural features
   contribute to granivorous birds' presence and assemblage patterns
   remains poorly understood. This study explores how granivorous bird
   distribution in terms of abundance similarities, densities, species
   richness and encounter rates, respond to habitat configuration elements
   and cropping methods across non Bt-maize fields. Here we compare nine
   intercropped to seven monoculture farms within which influence of eight
   vegetation structural features and two general habitat attributes on
   granivorous bird's assemblages were determined across three maize
   growing seasons. Bird abundance similarities were most significantly
   influenced by heights of hedgerows and trees. For assemblage
   composition, whereas bird species richness was unaffected by any habitat
   variable, encounter rates were higher on farms with higher hedges or
   tall trees. On the other hand, bird densities increased on farms with
   abundant large mature trees, large woodlots, high hedgerows or dominance
   of indigenous trees, but diminished with both overall tree density and
   young-tree abundance. These results suggest that keeping hedgerows low,
   minimizing woodlot sizes and maintaining young isolated trees across the
   farm, may significantly contribute to reducing granivorous bird
   aggregation on maize farms thus mitigating potential for maize grain
   losses.},

Title = {Continuous manure application strengthens the associations between soil
   microbial function and crop production: Evidence from a 7-year multisite
   field experiment on the Guanzhong Plain},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {A 7-year multisite field experiment was performed to assess the relative
   importance of climate, soil, and mi-crobial properties of crop
   production in a wheat cropping system under contrasting fertilization
   management (i. e., continuous organic vs. chemical fertilization). The
   results showed that continuous organic application increased the annual
   grain yield and soil organic carbon by an average of 13.2\% and 38.0\%,
   respectively, compared to chemical fertilization. Continuous organic
   application increased the soil pH, which led to a sig-nificant increase
   in bacterial richness (i.e., Chao1) and diversity (i.e., Shannon index).
   Notably, organic appli-cation favored the growth of Proteobacteria and
   Actinobacteria but reduced the abundances of Bacteroides,
   Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria, which ultimately led to a more
   complicated bacterial co-occurrence network. Importantly, organic
   application increased the abundances of functional genes involved in C
   fixation (e.g., sdhD, ACO, and acsB), C degradation (e.g., pulA, celC,
   and CBH2), N fixation (e.g., anfG and amoC) and nitrification (e. g.,
   nifK), as well as P transporters (e.g., ugpQ and phnC). The structural
   equation modeling (SEM) results indi-cated that the annual air
   temperature and soil pH under chemical fertilizer treatment and the
   bacterial com-munity structure and functional gene abundance under
   treatment with organic application were the primary drivers of the yield
   performance. Variance partitioning analysis further revealed that under
   chemical fertiliza-tion, climate, soil, the bacterial community, and
   potential function explained 32.0\%, 26.7\%, 19.9\% and 21.4\%,
   respectively, of the overall variance in crop productivity; however,
   these values shifted to 16.6\%, 8.3\%, 34.5\% and 40.6\%, respectively,
   when organic fertilizer was applied. These findings suggest that
   continuous organic application reduces the contribution of climate and
   edaphic conditions to crop yield compared to chemical fertilization but
   strengthens the associations between soil microbial function and crop
   production. Overall, this work provides new insights into the complexity
   of fertilization-induced climate-plant-microbial interactions and
   highlights the importance of intensified biological interactions for the
   sustainability of cropping ecosystems.},

Title = {Organic farming sustains bats in Mediterranean farmland},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Organic agriculture is often deemed effective in conserving and
   promoting biodiversity, yet most studies have so far only focused on
   farmland in temperate areas and a few taxonomic groups, mainly birds and
   arthropods. Mediterranean agroecosystems host considerable biodiversity,
   and their wildlife likely delivers quantitatively important ecosystem
   services to agriculture, yet information is still limited. Here, we test
   the importance of organic farming and habitat structure for bat activity
   and richness in the Mediterranean. We disentangled the effects of
   organic vs. conventional management and habitat structure by adopting
   acoustic surveys and a matched-pair sampling design. Foraging bats
   preferred organic over conventional farming, with a scale -independent
   effect of local farm management on activity (but not richness),
   consistently across bat species and functional guilds. While fine-scale
   habitat structure had contrasting effects on bat species and guilds, the
   positive influence of linear landscape elements on bat activity was
   consistent and independent of management options. We highlight the key
   role of organic farming in preserving and promoting bat activity in
   agricultural areas, which brings the mutual benefit of sustaining bat
   conservation and emphasising the precious ecosystem services bats
   provide. To increase bat richness, however, appropriate management of
   landscape structure must be secured at larger geographical scales.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient input is one of the greatest causes of freshwater
   and coastal eutrophication worldwide. In many catchments, nutrient
   losses must be reduced to meet the water quality outcomes sought by
   communities and regulators. To achieve this, policy makers must find an
   acceptable balance between the economic value of land use activities and
   sustained health of the receiving ecosystem. Abatement policies for an
   intermittently closed and open lagoon catchment ecosystem in the
   Southland region of New Zealand were evaluated. The objective was to
   assess the cost-effectiveness of different policies aimed at reducing
   nutrient loads entering the lagoon while minimizing reductions in farm
   operating profit by considering production losses and costs of
   mitigations. An economic-environmental optimization model that selects
   farm system (e.g., reduced fertilizer input and stocking rate) and
   edge-of-field (e.g., constructed wetlands) mitigations most suitable to
   each pastoral farm (dairy, dairy support, sheep and beef) was developed.
   Three optimization strategies, either with a focus on nitrogen (N),
   phosphorous (P), or both, were evaluated: a differentiated strategy
   considering nutrient loss and profitability differences between farms; a
   uniform strategy requiring a similar proportional reduction for all
   farms; and a nutrient cap strategy requiring all farms to achieve losses
   below a set cap in kg ha- 1 year- 1. Results indicate that it will be a
   challenge to achieve the currently recommended target of 50 \% reduction
   in the load of both nutrients. When N was the focus, the best outcomes
   achieved around 50 \% and 30 \% reduction in N and P loads respectively,
   but it required a reduction in total farm income, before interest and
   tax, of 22-38 \% (approximately NZ\$5-9 M year- 1 at current prices).
   The catchment-wide differentiated policy was the most costeffective from
   a farmer and economic point of view, but still required land retirement
   for approximately 30 \% of the farm businesses. A double nutrient cap
   strategy of 40 kg ha- 1 for N and 1 kg ha- 1 for P only achieved around
   20 \% reduction in both nutrients at 10 \% reduction in farm income.
   Another option, a nutrient cap strategy of 40 kg ha- 1 for N and 0.8 kg
   ha- 1 for P, resulted in 30-35 \% reduction in both nutrients at around
   17 \% reduction in profit (NZ\$4 M year- 1). The work demonstrates the
   importance of evaluating the cost-efficiency of nutrient loss
   mitigations at farm scale when evaluating different abatement policy
   options at catchment scale. It demonstrates utility for other similar
   sites by showing how the focus can be on individual farm businesses,
   while searching for balanced environmental and economic outcomes at the
   larger scale.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},

Abstract = {Agricultural land use changes are expected to modify the carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks compared to the native ecosystems
   they replace and result in changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. To
   quantify these effects, we measured C-N-P stocks in four land cover
   classes (cropland, grassland, native shrubland and invaded shrubland)
   together with their ecosystem-level CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes for one year
   using the closed-chamber technique, in three locations on Chiloe acute
   accent Island, southern Chile. As a reference, given that most of the
   original ecosystems were derived from forest clearance, we monitored CO2
   fluxes in a native forest site in the same area using the eddy
   covariance technique, and used published data of its C-N-P stocks and
   CH4 and N2O fluxes. We found that compared to the forest, the other land
   cover classes represented a 60 \% loss of total ecosystem C, which was
   explained mainly by the loss of 98 \% in above ground biomass and a 42
   \% reduction in soil C, but with a relatively unchanged N stock and an
   increase in soil P. While croplands were net GHG emitters (901 g CO2-eq
   m(-2) year(-1)), grasslands, native shrublands and invaded shrublands
   were net sinks (-1350, -1154 and-2088 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1),
   respectively). The invaded shrublands (invaded by the N-fixing species
   Ulex europaeus and Cytisus scoparius) showed higher aboveground and root
   biomass compared to the other land cover classes, but somewhat lower
   C-N-P soil stocks, possibly because of lower litter decomposition,
   reduced root turnover/rhizodeposition and/or greater dissolved elemental
   losses, as the invasion occurred on degraded lands. Although the
   invasive shrublands acted as a stronger GHG sink, driven by their higher
   CO2 fixation, this might change in the longer term through the
   additional accumulation of fixed N, with a potential increase in N2O
   emissions.},

Title = {Evaluation of interactions between honeybees and alternative managed
   pollinators: A meta-analysis of their effect on crop productivity},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The productivity of approximately 75\% of crops worldwide depends to
   some extent on insect pollination. However, while global agriculture is
   becoming more dependent on pollinators, wild populations of pollinators
   are declining. For this reason, hives of Apis mellifera (honeybees), the
   most widely used pollinator, are commonly placed in the fields; in
   recent years, alternative managed pollinators (AMPs) such as Bombus spp.
   or Osmia spp. have also been used. Thus, for evidence-based pollination
   management, we need to know whether the pollination service provided by
   AMPs can replace, complement or synergistically interact with that
   provided by honeybees. We asked: Does crop productivity differ between
   fields with honeybees and those with AMPs? Does productivity increase by
   incorporating AMPs in addition to managed honeybees? Do the effects of
   managed honeybees and AMPs interact? We performed a meta-analysis based
   on 28 studies on 20 crops. We estimated effect sizes (ln(R)) for crop
   productivity (fruit/seed set, fruit/seed quality and yield) from 73
   comparisons between honeybees and an AMP, and 21 comparisons between
   honeybees alone and honeybees plus an AMP. Overall, we found no evidence
   of difference in crop productivity between honeybees and AMPs when
   managed separately. However, the productivity of crops pollinated by
   honeybees together with AMPs was 22\% +/- 6 (SE) higher than that of
   crops pollinated only by honeybees. Moreover, we found a weak evidence
   of a positive effect of beehive density on crop productivity when an AMP
   was added, suggesting a synergistic interaction between honeybees and
   AMPs. We conclude that, on average, honeybee performance is similar to
   that of AMPs, and that increasing the number of managed pollinator
   species can improve crop productivity in the short-term, particularly in
   systems with impoverished pollinator faunas. More generally, this review
   confirms the positive effect of pollinator di-versity on pollination
   service, suggesting this can be partly recreated using a suite of
   managed pollinators.},

Title = {Critical role of native forest and savannah habitats in retaining
   neotropical pollinator diversity in highly mechanized agricultural
   landscapes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Increasing food production while preserving natural ecosystem services
   linked to native biodiversity is one of the most important societal
   challenges in the 21st-century. Natural pollination performed by bees
   significantly in-creases yields even in crops that do not strictly
   depend on animal pollination, such as soybean. However, several factors,
   such as habitat loss and degradation, have contributed to the decline in
   abundance and diversity of bees. Here, we assess the effects of the
   type, complexity and amount of native habitats on Neotropical bee
   assemblages within agricultural landscapes. We sampled bees at 43
   landscapes in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, within a region
   encompassing Amazonian rainforests, the drier Cerrado savannahs, and
   transitional vegetation between these biomes. We collected 1359
   individuals representing 134 bee species. Bee species richness differed
   between soybean and core native only in Amazonian forest landscapes,
   while species composition differed in both forest and transition
   landscapes. Overall bee species richness did not differ between the
   three vegetation types, but species composition in forest landscapes
   diverged from those in transition and Cerrado areas. The amount of
   native habitat remaining had a positive effect on both species richness
   and composition. Our results show that the relentless replacement of
   natural ecosystems with soybean monoculture detrimentally affects bee
   species richness, and substantially changes the species composition.
   Pollinator decline has negative consequences for economics and
   biodiversity conservation. Therefore, we suggest that areas of native
   vegetation should be pro-tected and monitored due their crucial
   importance for maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services through the
   landscape. Ideally, we suggest that strategies for the conservation of
   bee diversity consider the amount of native habitats at landscape scale.},

Title = {Long-term N addition accelerated organic carbon mineralization in
   aggregates by shifting microbial community composition},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Nitrogen application in agroecosystem maintains and improves soil
   fertility while affecting organic carbon mineralization (Cmin). Soil
   aggregates play a crucial role in soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover.
   However, the cumulative Cmin and underlying microbial mechanisms
   responses to long-term N addition at aggregate scales remain unclear.
   Hence, a 16-year field N addition field experiment was conducted on
   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at three N levels: 0 (N0), 180
   (N180), and 360 (N360) N ha-1. Overall, long-term N addition
   significantly altered the Cmin, bacterial and fungal community
   composition and bacterial and fungal cooccurrence patterns in four
   aggregate fractions (large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates,
   microaggregates, and silt-clay fractions). Specifically, N addition
   facilitated a more copiotrophic microbial community, with a significant
   increase in the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadota,
   and Ascomycota, and a significant decrease in the relative abundances of
   Actinomycetales, Acidimicrobiales, and Basidiomycota. The addition of N
   led to more complex and tight microbial networks with more nodes, higher
   average degrees, shorter average path lengths, and greater connectivity.
   These microbial changes accelerated Cmin in aggregates; however, the
   main microbial mechanisms varied with aggregate size and Cmin in
   silt-clay fractions was mainly influenced by microbial community
   composition. These results indicate that the spatial heterogeneity of
   resources available in different aggregate sizes is strongly selected
   for microbial life strategies and influences the distribution of
   microbial communities, thereby affecting the Cmin processes. Overall,
   our study provides a fundamental understanding of the microbial
   regulation of SOC turnover at an aggregate scale and highlights the
   importance of network topological patterns.},

Title = {Response of soil organic carbon fractions to legume incorporation into
   cropping system and the factors affecting it: A global meta-analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Recently, there has been increased advocacy for the adoption of rational
   cropping systems to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and health
   and ensure food security. The intercropping and crop rotation of legumes
   with other crops is believed to improve soil environment and influence
   SOC dynamics. However, a compre-hensive assessment of the effects of
   legume incorporation into cropping systems (LCS) on SOC fractions is
   still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the effects of
   LCS on SOC fractions under different climatic conditions, soil
   properties, and agronomic practices, based on meta-analysis of 85
   publications. LCS significantly increased the concentrations of
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   particulate organic carbon, light fraction carbon (LFC), heavy fraction
   carbon, labile carbon pool, and recalcitrant carbon pool by 21.4 \%, 7.2
   \%, 9.1 \%, 29.6 \%, 6.4 \%, 7.1 \%, and 7.9 \%, respectively, compared
   with cropping systems without legume. LCS-induced increase in the
   contents of SOC fractions was stronger under relatively suitable
   climatic conditions (mean annual temperature > 15 degrees C, mean annual
   precipitation > 1000 mm, and aridity index (AI) > 0.65) and soils with
   more severe nutrient limitation (soil organic matter < 10 g kg -1, pH <
   6.6, and subsoils). Specifically, AI was positively correlated with the
   response ratios of labile organic carbon fractions, whereas initial soil
   pH was negatively correlated with MBC, DOC, and LFC. Additionally, low
   nitrogen fertilizer application rates (< 120 kg ha -1) and intercropping
   favored an increase in SOC fractions under legume culti-vation. Overall,
   these results provide insights into the ecological benefits of legumes
   and highlights the impor-tance of developing site-specific strategies to
   effectively manage SOC dynamics under legume cultivation for sustainable
   agricultural practices.},

Title = {Diversified crop sequences to reduce soil nitrogen mining in
   agroecosystems},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is the primary driver of increased global food supply, but
   has environmental consequences from both under- and over-fertilisation.
   While over-fertilisation and reactive nitrogen release onto the
   environment is widespread in North America and Europe,
   under-fertilisation and soil mining prevail in South American croplands,
   calling for novel nitrogen-balancing strategies. The encroachment of
   soybean-centric, over-simplified cropping systems has eroded ecosystem
   services in South America. Here we compare the current soybean-centric
   system in Argentina with seven crop sequences in two long-term
   experiments started in 2008. Our aim was to identify alternative, more
   diverse crop sequences to maintain productivity and profitability with a
   close to neutral apparent N balance of the agroecosystem in two
   contrasting soils, i.e., a Mollisol and a Vertisol. Crop sequences
   combined locally adapted crops - soybean, maize and wheat for grain,
   field pea as cover crop - in a range from monocultures to complex
   sequences including all four crops. Crop sequence returned a
   2.2-3.1-fold variation in productivity (from 4.7 to 10.9 Mg ha-1 in the
   Mollisol and from 3.4 to 9.9 Mg ha-1 in the Vertisol), 1.5-fold
   variation in profitability (from 0.92 to 2.14), variation in nitrogen
   balance from soil mining at - 35 kg N ha-1 year-1 to excess at 17 kg N
   ha-1 year-1, and a variation in nitrogen use efficiency at crop sequence
   level (NUEs) from 0.7 to 1.2 in both soil types. High soybean proportion
   reduced the NUEs and grain productivity of crop sequences. More complex
   crop sequences, i.e. including three/four crops, showed an N surplus and
   a similar grain yield than maize monoculture in both soils. The
   inclusion of maize into crop sequences with high cropping intensity
   increased both yield and NUEs. We identify new crop sequences that meet
   three conditions: high productivity and profitability, a
   close-to-neutral nitrogen balance, and a high nitrogen-use efficiency.
   These insights allow for alternatives to the current, unsustainable
   trajectories of simplified soybean-based systems that also avoid the
   path of over-fertilisation followed by cropping systems elsewhere.},

Title = {Aquaculture farm largely increase indirect nitrous oxide emission
   factors of lake},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Freshwater aquaculture system is one of the main sources of nitrous
   oxide (N2O) and must be accounted for when reporting indirect N2O
   emissions from agricultural industries. The IPCC based approach
   recommend the indirect N2O emission factors (EF5) to estimate the
   emissions from freshwater. Unfortunately, the EF5 for lake aqua
   -culture, one of the most common freshwater aquacultures, has never been
   reported due to the scarcity of field data. To better understand the
   magnitude of EF5 at lake aquaculture and identify the control factors,
   the EF5 at aquaculture farm and open water (non-aquaculture region) of
   Lake Taihu were investigated based on long-term (2012-2017) in-situ
   field measurements. Our results showed the indirect N2O emission at the
   aquaculture farm (1.52 +/- 0.49 mu mol m-2 d-1) was over one order of
   magnitude higher than at the open water (0.12 +/- 0.49 mu mol m-2 d-1).
   Furthermore, we also found large variability in the EF5, which varied by
   one order of magnitude across time. The EF5 was predicted by nitrogen
   and the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen. The significantly higher mass
   ratio of DOC to DIN resulting from feed application contributed to
   substantial increase in the N2O production efficiency and EF5 at the
   aquaculture farm. The average EF5 at the aquaculture farm and open water
   were 0.0021 +/- 0.0013 and 0.0013 +/- 0.0010, respectively. However, the
   measured EF5 was lower than that IPCC's default value of 0.0025,
   implying IPCC method yielded the overestimated indirect emission, and
   large bias will occur when only use constant value considering the
   dramatic variability of observed EF5.},

Title = {Intercropping flowering plants facilitate conservation, movement and

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Habitat management is an important approach suppressing pest via
   conservation biological control in agricul-tural systems. Intercropping
   flowering plants is a well-practiced habitat management measure,
   supporting predators with shelter, nectar, alternative prey and pollen.
   However, few studies systematically revealed pred-ator's conservation
   performance, transfer process and biocontrol ability by intercropping
   flowering plants in apple orchards. Here, an experimental model of
   intercropping flowering plants in apple orchard was planned for two
   consecutive years to response above questions. Four flowering plants
   conserve a different number and proportions of six main predator species
   (three ladybeetles (Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and
   Hippo-damia variegata), one lacewing (Chrysoperla sinica), one hoverfly
   (Episyrphus balteatus) and one spider (Mis-umenops tricuspidatus)). By
   rubidium (Rb) marking technique, transfer rate of predators C. sinica
   from flowering plant Cnidium monnieri to apple trees were 79.5 \% and
   84.1 \% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Transfer rate of predators H.
   axyridis from flowering plant C. monnieri to apple trees were 74.2 \%
   and 80.1 \% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. By predator exclusion
   trials, the Biocontrol Services Index (BSI) was calculated in sampling
   date, in which the number of aphids on the caged and uncaged branch has
   significant difference in the four flowering plants and untreated
   control plots in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Thus, our results suggest
   that, intercropping flowering plants in insecticide-free apple orchard
   contributed to increase the number of predators and biological control
   of aphid Aphis spiraecola. These findings support that intercropping
   flowering plants as a promising management option could be implemented
   in apple orchards.},

Title = {Zeolite mitigates N2O emissions in paddy fields under alternate wetting
   and drying irrigation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Increasing studies indicate that alternate wetting and drying irrigation
   (I-AWD) can significantly increase water use efficiency in paddy fields,
   whereas this method may also cause high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
   Therefore, effective management strategies are urgently required for
   ameliorating the adverse effect of I-AWD on N2O emissions. Zeolite is
   increasingly used as a potential effective soil conditioner to reduce
   N2O emissions. However, few studies have been conducted to explore the
   effect of zeolite on N2O emissions and rice grain yield as well as the
   associated soil physicochemical properties in paddy fields under I-AWD.
   Here, a two-year field experiment was conducted using lysimeters to
   assess the effect of two irrigation regimes (I-CF: continuously flooded
   irrigation; I-AWD: alternate wetting and drying irrigation) and two
   zeolite management regimes (Z(U): urea alone (non-zeolite control);
   Z(UZ): urea combined with zeolite (15 t ha(-1))) on N2O emissions, rice
   grain yield, and soil physicochemical properties. The results showed
   that I(AWD )significantly increased N2O emissions by 18\% relative to
   I-CF, and Z(UZ) significantly reduced N2O emissions under I-AWD by 9\%
   compared to Z(U). I-AWD had no significant effect on rice grain yield
   compared to I-CF. However, Z(UZ) significantly enhanced rice grain yield
   under I-CF and I-AWD by 11\% and 14\%, respectively, compared to Z(U).
   Accordingly, Z(UZ )significantly decreased yield-scaled N2O emissions
   under I-CF and I-AWD by 13\% and 19\%, respectively, compared to Z(U).
   Increases in soil NH4+-N concentrations and soil pH contribute to the
   N2O mitigation in Z(UZ) under I-AWD. Altogether, our results highlight
   that zeolite combined with urea is likely a sustainable
   resource-efficient approach for mitigating N2O emissions while
   increasing rice grain yield in paddy fields under I-AWD.},

Title = {Net N-2 fluxes from different lowland ponds draining contrasting land
   uses in a hilly catchment: Implications for nitrogen removal and its
   environmental controls},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The lowland ponds, depressional submerged areas that are fed by runoff
   from surrounding uplands and then send overflows to downstream water
   bodies, are recognized as biogeochemical hotspots of nitrogen (N)
   removal. Despite their important role in mitigating N pollution, very
   little is currently known about their potential for N removal,
   particularly for those ponds draining contrasting land uses. Our study
   investigated the variabilities of N removal in different types of ponds
   from a hilly watershed by quantifying gaseous N-2 emission fluxes. The
   mean excess N-2 concentrations relative to its saturations varied within
   0.41-16.44 mu mol L-1, demonstrating that significant N removal occurred
   in all of the ponds. Further estimates of net N-2 fluxes suggested that
   ponds impacted by different land use types exhibited distinct potentials
   for N removal. The ponds that drained tea plantations, which are a
   typical form of agriculture in hilly regions, had the highest N removal
   rate (6.48 mmol N-2 m(-2) d(-1)), equivalent to similar to 2.3, 3.0, and
   5.8 times those drained by residential areas, mixed-landscape, and
   forests, respectively. The levels of dissolved oxygen and nutrient
   supply affected by the different drained land uses were responsible for
   the different potentials of N removal. Our results suggest that there is
   a need for integrated management strategies that not only focus on
   optimization of environmental conditions in ponds but also consider the
   impacts of the land use compositions in their drainages to more
   efficiently promote N removal.},

Title = {Climate change mitigation potential of summer cowpea cover crops in
   Southern Australian cropping systems is limited},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Sequestering atmospheric carbon in soils is considered a key climate
   change mitigation strategy and including cover crops into cropping
   systems is commonly promoted as a management change that can increase
   soil organic carbon (SOC). Projecting SOC changes under climate change
   when cover crops are integrated into a cropping system is important
   because climate is a key driver of SOC dynamics and projected changes in
   climate are un-certain. Further, projecting SOC changes can provide
   landholders with information on the risk associated with the use of
   cover crops to generate carbon credits considering the inherent
   uncertainty in SOC changes under a changing climate. The Agricultural
   Production SIMulator was used to simulate SOC and yields of a typical
   crop rotation, with and without a cow pea cover crop, at 204 sites in
   the Riverina region of Southern Australia. Sowing cover crops reduced
   crop yields and increased SOC relative to the crop rotation without
   cover crops. GHG emissions associated with indirect land use change due
   to reduced crop yields and N2O emissions from the cover crop meant that
   sowing cover crops was unlikely to provide climate change mitigation.
   The number of carbon credits generated by participating in the soil
   carbon method of the Australian government's emissions reduction program
   varied greatly across the region with some sites not generating any
   credits. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to
   climate change mitigation and the risk of entering a SOC trading program
   when costs of compliance are high and the ability to generate carbon
   credits is uncertain.},

Title = {Rationale for field-specific on-farm precision experimentation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Uncertainties in farming necessitate detailed knowledge of the
   production efficiencies to maintain sustainability. To accomplish
   ecologically based agriculture, with the goal of intensification by
   maximizing production and profit as well as minimizing environmental
   impact, we hypothesized that a site-specific knowledge base can be
   efficiently achieved through modern precision agriculture (PA)
   technologies at the field scale. The two goals of this study were to
   quantify the spatiotemporal variation of crop responses and the
   variables driving crop pro-duction, crop quality, and field-scale farmer
   net-return. We conducted on-farm experimentation (OFE) on several fields
   for three years where we varied nitrogen fertilizer rate as a management
   input, to induce changes in crop response. Using a Monte Carlo approach,
   we assessed the probability that crop responses varied across fields and
   between years. To determine the drivers of crop production, quality, and
   net-return, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of
   variation in the environment with the most influence on crop responses
   and farmer profits. Our analysis provided evidence that the degree of
   the response of winter wheat yield and protein content to variable
   nitrogen fertilizer rates are not homogenous across time and space.
   Elevation as a covariate to nitrogen fertilizer rate was the primary
   influence on predicted yields and protein across most fields, yet not
   among all fields and across years in fields. The drivers of net-return
   varied among fields and across years pri-marily between yield and
   protein. However, in some cases the most influential factor was the base
   price received, controlled by the grain elevators that growers sell to,
   indicating that in some fields and years, farmer's net -returns are
   dictated by variables outside of a farmer's control or ability to
   manage. These results provide basic evidence justifying the use of OFE
   for farm management and suggest that management needs to be specific to
   each field and point in time, with recommendations being made
   specifically for a field based on information gathered from that field.
   On-farm experimentation will enable farmers to identify these drivers
   and understand how their inputs influence yield and protein within
   fields. Using information provided by OFE with decision support systems
   can enable farmers to make informed management decisions that maximize
   their profits and increase the efficiency of chemical inputs, such as
   nitrogen fertilizer.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Fencing has been extensively used for the restoration of grassland
   degraded by human disturbance. However, its effects on ecosystem
   functions and services are still controversial. Here, we evaluated the
   response of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) to 7 years of grazing
   exclusion based on ten individual functions, and compared grazing
   exclusion with two common practices (mowing and grazing) in a typical
   steppe in Inner Mongolia. Plant and microbial diversity and three
   edaphic factors (soil pH, moisture and temperature) were also
   investigated to explore the main drivers regulating EMF. Compared with
   continuous grazing, fencing improved EMF mainly by increasing soil
   nutrient contents, including soil organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen,
   nitrate nitrogen and available phosphorus. No significant differences
   were found between fencing and mowing for all ten individual functions
   and EMF. Plant and fungal diversity were comparable between fencing and
   grazing, but were lower than under mowing, and bacterial diversity was
   similar between all three management practices. Soil pH, moisture and
   temperature were also affected by fencing. Structural equation modeling
   showed that EMF was mainly driven by soil moisture in the fencing and
   mowing plots, but by plant and bacterial diversity in the grazing plots.
   Our results suggest that relative to grazing, fencing and mowing are
   both feasible strategies to enhance EMF, and that mowing may be more
   conducive to biodiversity conservation. This study demonstrates that,
   maintenance of soil moisture is critical for the restoration of EMF in
   Inner Mongolia's typical steppe.},

Title = {Optimizing crop rotation increases soil carbon and reduces GHG emissions
   without sacrificing yields},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) while concurrently reducing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and without compromising yield is a
   contemporary challenge for many agricultural sectors across the globe.
   In China, resolving the ``carbon-food{''} nexus is a key pillar of
   government policies aimed at constraining ``Carbon Peak{''} and
   delivering ``Carbon Neutrality{''}. The present study explores the
   potential to increase SOC stocks while reducing GHGs emissions, without
   sacrificing crop yields considering crop rotation optimization under
   different irrigation managements in the North China Plain (NCP) based on
   a 6-year experiment. We found higher crop yields for the irrigated
   treatments compared with the rainfed treatments, demonstrating that
   rainfed crops were constrained by water deficit stress in the region.
   Yield was highest in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation (WM),
   followed by yields of the winter wheat-summer soybean (WS), while the
   average yields of winter wheat-summer maize -spring maize (WMMs) were
   lowest. SOC stocks in the surface soil (0-20 cm) increased for the
   irrigated treat-ments, but soil carbon sequestration (i.e. the rate of
   SOC stocks change over time) for the rainfed treatments decreased for
   all treatments. SOC stocks for WMMs was greatest of all treatments,
   leading to the highest carbon sustainability index (CSI) for this
   treatment. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 23-57\% higher in the
   irrigated treatments than the rainfed treatments for the three
   rotations, which was highest in WMMs and lowest in WS. Carbon footprints
   (CFs) were highest in WS and lowest in WMMs. Overall, we found that
   increasing SOC stocks reduced CFs and increased yield. WMMs with
   irrigation was the most effective treatment for promoting SOC
   sequestration and mitigating GHG emissions with relatively high yield in
   this study, suggesting that crop rota-tions that are (1) more intensive
   and (2) grow more aboveground biomass are more likely to promulgate
   lower CFs and contribute towards national emissions abatement targets,
   such as those aimed at Net Zero.},

Title = {Comammox Nitrospira and AOB communities are more sensitive than AOA
   community to different fertilization strategies in a fluvo-aquic soil},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and
   the newly discovered complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox Nitrospira)
   are responsible for ammonia oxidation, which is the first and rate
   -limiting step of nitrification. A better understanding of the complex
   responses of AOA, AOB and comammox Nitrospira to inorganic and organic
   fertilization regimes is critical to get the whole picture of soil
   nitrification. Here, we investigated the abundances and community
   compositions of AOA, AOB and comammox Nitrospira in a fluvo-aquic soil
   under different fertilization strategies: nitrogen fertilizer reduction
   treatments (CK, PK, 50 \% NPK and 75 \% NPK), conventional fertilizer
   treatment (100 \% NPK), N fertilizer reduction with organic manure
   substitution treatments (25 \% OMNPK, 50 \% OMNPK, 100 \% OMPK and 200
   \% OMPK). The results indicated that 100 \% NPK treatment significantly
   increased AOB abundance, while the abundances of AOA and comammox
   Nitrospira were enhanced significantly by 100 \% and 200 \% OMPK
   treatments. Principal coordinate analysis indicated different
   fertilization strategies had greater effect on the communities of AOB
   and comammox Nitro-spira than those of AOA. Fertilizer application
   (other than CK) decreased the relative abundance of Nitrosospira cluster
   3b of AOB while increased the relative abundance of Nitrosospira cluster
   3a.2. Fertilizer, especially high manure application increased the
   relative abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A.2 but decreased the
   relative abundance of clade B. Both redundancy analysis and mantel test
   showed AOB and comammox Nitrospira communities were regulated by more
   soil factors than AOA community. These results suggested the communities
   of AOB and comammox Nitrospira were more sensitive than AOA community to
   different fertilization strategies in a fluvo-aquic soil of northern
   China.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of ecological functions and economic benefits of
   co-culture models in paddy fields},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The co-culture of rice and poultry/aquatic animals has become a popular
   strategy to ensure the critical ecological functions and economic
   benefits of this ecosystem in recent years. Yet, quantitative synthetic
   effects of co-culture models on ecological functions and economic
   benefits in paddy fields are poorly understood. This study conducted a
   meta-analysis of 4707 observations from 224 published papers on the
   outcomes of co-culture models in paddy fields. On aggregate, co-culture
   models significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 14.8 \% as compared with
   rice monoculture, but did not affect rice yields, N2O emissions, and
   greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). However, significant differences in
   rice yields, CH4 emissions, GHGI, and economic benefits were observed
   among various co-culture models and rice-growing regions. Particularly,
   the co-culture models in East Asia significantly increased rice yields
   (+2.2 \%), reduced CH4 emissions (-22.1 \%), and GHGI (-9.4 \%).
   Importantly, co-culture models improved rice grain quality. Furthermore,
   co-culture models increased soil fertility (7.8-16.2 \%), nutrients
   content in paddy water (26.2-87.0 \%), and net ecological and economic
   benefits (31.7-71.1 \%), while decreasing diseases, pests, and weeds
   (37.0-84.6 \%) in paddy fields. Additionally, we suggest that the
   production of poultry or aquatic animals that alters input and output
   would increase net income, and it is necessary to develop co-culture
   models in paddy fields according to regional differences in the
   agricultural environment. Therefore, our study provides a reference for
   maximizing ecological and economic benefits of suitable co-culture
   models in rice-planted areas.},

Title = {Legacy of landscape crop diversity enhances carabid beetle species
   richness and promotes granivores},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {It is well understood that agricultural expansion and associated loss of
   semi-natural habitat in the landscape are major drivers for the marked
   decline in biodiversity. While conserving remaining semi-natural habitat
   patches is essential to reverse ongoing biodiversity declines,
   increasing focus has also been put on diversifying cropland itself by
   increasing landscape crop diversity as a measure of compositional
   heterogeneity, and reducing field sizes as a measure of configurational
   heterogeneity. Both these cropland diversification approaches have shown
   promise to enhance biodiversity in the year of sampling, but it is
   unknown whether legacies of crop diversity in the landscape promote
   biodiversity by building up arthropod communities over time. We selected
   14 faba bean fields in landscapes dominated by cropland. The fields were
   chosen along three gradients: landscape crop di-versity of the year of
   sampling (2017), landscape crop diversity of the previous year (2016)
   and mean field size in landscapes. Using pitfall traps, we show that the
   carabid beetle species richness is higher in landscapes with higher crop
   diversity in the previous year. Especially, granivorous carabid beetles
   benefitted from legacies of crop diversity. Rove beetles were more
   abundant and genus rich in landscapes with larger field sizes, while
   spiders were not responding to any of the landscape variables. A
   diversity of crops in the landscape and their associated weed
   communities could provide more diverse food resources and shelter
   habitats, which build populations of carabid beetle species over time.
   There is a need to explore the effects of agri-environmental schemes
   across multiple years to better understand legacy effects, and to
   structure sustainable agricultural landscapes.},

Title = {Exploitation of neighbouring subsoil for nutrient acquisition under
   annual-perennial strip intercropping systems},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Little is known how the deep root systems of perennial crops contribute
   to deeper and better resource use when intercropped with annuals in
   arable fields. Therefore, we aimed at measuring the capacity of
   deep-rooted perennials, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and curly dock
   (Rumex crispus L.) to access nutrients located under neighboring annuals
   at 1.0 and 2.5 m of soil depth. Alfalfa and curly dock were able to
   access the tracer sources (N-15 and Cs) placed at a distance farther
   than 0.4 m under the annual crop strips. As a result, the reliance on
   deeper soil layers for nutrient uptake by the crops grown at the borders
   became greater compared with the crops grown in the mid-strips.
   Combination of an annual cereal (winter rye) and a perennial legume
   (alfalfa) having contrasting root systems exhibited higher resource
   complementarity compared with intercroppings having more similar root
   systems or in the absence of legumes. Our results demonstrated that the
   deep-rooted perennials, when intercropped with annuals, can induce
   vertical niche complementarity, especially at deeper soil layers. This
   was assumed to be due to the differences in rooting depth and deep root
   activity the crop components, however, the magnitude of the effects
   depended on choice of crop combinations, and on types of tracers used in
   the study.},

Title = {Nitrogen addition weakens the biodiversity-multifunctionality
   relationships across soil profiles in a grassland assemblage},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The dynamics of multiple ecosystem functions (that is,
   multifunctionality) are closely associated with biodiversity, often show
   positive relationships, but the dynamics of the
   biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship along soil profiles remain
   unclear. Eutrophication significantly affects biodiversity and soil
   functions, whereas the mechanisms underlying the impact of nitrogen
   addition on the biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship are poorly
   understood. Here, we conducted a common garden experiment manipulating
   plant diversity and nitrogen addition to quantify the effects of
   biodiversity on soil multifunctionality in the topsoil and subsoil under
   different nitrogen addition levels. We showed that nitrogen addition had
   a minor impact on soil multifunctionality but weakened the positive
   biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship. We also found that the
   positive plant diversity effect on soil multifunctionality decreased
   with soil depths, resulting in a weaker biodiversity-multifunctionality
   relationship in the subsoil. The weak biodiversity-multifunctionality
   relationship in the subsoil was caused by weakening the relationship
   between aboveground biomass and soil multifunctionality; nitrogen
   addition weakened the biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship
   through the attenuation of the association of aboveground biomass and
   soil microbes with multifunctionality. Our study demonstrates that
   nitrogen addition undermines the biodiversity-soil multifunctionality
   relationship and the relationship is weakened along the soil profiles,
   suggesting that Earth system models must represent these heterogeneous
   soil dynamics to accurately predict future feedbacks to global changes.},

Title = {Dynamics of fungal community structure in a silver birch (Betula pendula
   Roth) succession chronosequence on poor-quality post-arable soil},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Soil fungal communities are critical components in soil ecosystems, but
   experimental researches on their responses to the silver birch
   succession are limited. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and
   glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) - a type of glycoprotein produced
   by hyphae of AM fungi, are highly correlated with soil physicochemical
   parameters and are sensitive to changes in the soil environment. This
   study aimed to analyze the dynamics of a soil fungal community, with
   particular emphasis on the AM fungi and GRSP contents and their
   responses to a silver birch succession on abandoned post-arable land.
   The studies were conducted in central Poland and covered five stands
   that included arable field (AF) and fallow (FA) land, and
   8-year-old/young (YS), 33-year-old/middle (MS), and 40-year-old/old (OS)
   successions of silver birch. The diversity and compositions of the
   fungal communities were examined using ITS high-throughput gene
   sequencing. We found that the dominant soil fungal phylum transitioned
   from Olpidiomycota through Ascomycota to Basidiomycota with the change
   from AF to OS. Silver birch development increased the soil fungal
   diversity and richness compared with that of the AF soil, but these
   decreased compared with the FA soil. The predominant fungi in the soils
   under silver birch development belonged to the families Pezizaceae,
   Russulaceae, and Cortinariceae. The birch succession significantly
   decreased the abundance of potential pathotmphs and increased the
   relative abundance of symbiotrophic fungi. The AM fungi abundance varied
   across the successional stages and was affected by plant cover and N
   content, and positively correlated with the EE-GRSP and T-GRSP contents.
   Additionally, the EE-GRSP and T-GRSP contents positively correlated with
   the TOC, N and SOM content, and Tp, and negatively correlated with Bd.
   Across the successional stages, the YS was devoid of AM fungi and
   characterized by the lowest EE-GRSP T-GRSP (1.89 mg g(-1)), Tp (43.4\%),
   and TOC (7.3 g kg(-1)) and P (11.7 g kg(-1)) contents. In summary, the
   development of young silver birch on generally poor Brunie Arenosols
   tends to have a negative effect on the soil fungal community and
   selected soil properties, but these effects ease over time.},

Title = {Soil health improvements from using a novel perennial grain during the
   transition to organic production},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Organic crop production is a growing part of the agricultural economy.
   The transition from a conventional to an organic cropping system, while
   complying with certification guidelines, is financially and logistically
   challenging for growers. Therefore, it is important to develop
   strategies, perhaps using novel cropping systems, that can both mitigate
   economic challenges and quickly improve soil health. We evaluated the
   impact of perennial and annual cropping systems on soil health during
   the first two years of a three-year organic transition period at three
   research stations in Minnesota distinct in climate and soil conditions:
   Rosemount, St. Paul, and Lamberton. The sites were established in fall
   of 2017 by planting each of six cropping systems including 1) the novel
   perennial grain crop intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), 2) alfalfa, 3) an
   intermediate wheatgrass -alfalfa intercrop (IWGAlfalfa), 4) a winter
   wheat -red clover (WheatRC) rotation, 5) a corn - soybean (SoyCorn)
   rotation and 6) a corn -soybean rotation with a cereal rye cover crop
   (SoyCCorn). We measured root biomass and soil physical, chemical, and
   microbial parameters to evaluate soil health under the different
   cropping systems over time. IWG and IWGAlfalfa were consistently among
   the systems with greater root biomass and larger water stable soil
   aggregates, while SoyCorn systems had the least. Other soil health
   variables had site specific responses, with Lamberton and St. Paul the
   most influenced by cropping systems. At St. Paul and Lamberton soil pH
   increased in IWG and SoyCorn, and soil K decreased under WheatRC and
   alfalfa. Labile C and total C and N were not influenced by the different
   cropping systems. At Lamberton, increases in the biomass of microbial
   groups including bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes were observed in
   IWGAlfalfa. The improvement in some health parameters at one or more
   sites by IWG and IWGAlfalfa after 2 years of the organic transition
   period could translate into building longer-term soil health for
   subsequent organically certified crops, but this is dependent on local
   soil and other characteristics. It will likely require more time for
   cropping systems to affect other important soil health parameters such
   as soil C in the C-enriched loamy soils of Southern Minnesota.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {With the occurrence of extreme events projected to increase under
   climate change, it is critical to assess the risk they pose to food
   security and identify suitable adaptation options. While mechanisms and
   impacts of climatic stressors (e.g. frost, drought, heat or flooding)
   have been studied individually, little is known their combined impacts
   on crops to be expected under actual production conditions. This lack of
   process knowledge is reflected in the few instances of crop models
   considering multiple stressors. Here we provide an overview of the
   repre-sentation of single stressors in process based crop models. From
   this basis, a framework to consider multiple stressors in current models
   is presented, defining four stressor combination types: 1. Single
   exposure; 2. No direct interaction; 3. Known interaction; and 4. Unknown
   interaction. An analytical framework from ecological sciences is then
   presented as an approach to consider when formulating algorithms for the
   4th type of unknown in-teractions. In a final section, we discuss new
   data driven and model based exploration options to support
   un-derstanding multiple stressor interactions in recognition of the
   challenges of experimentation around multiple stressors. We assert that
   process based modeling has a large and largely untapped potential to
   support scientific investigations of the underlying mechanisms driving
   crop response to multiple stressors.},

Title = {Role of Sedum alfredii and soil microbes in the remediation of
   ultra-high content heavy metals contaminated soil},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Ultra-high content of heavy metals (UHHMs) poses a threat to soil health
   and agricultural products safety, in turn causing harm to human health
   through the food chain. Phytoremediation has proven to be an effective
   technique for restoration of soil contaminated with a single or several
   conventional content of heavy metals, whereas the effectiveness of
   phytoremediation for UHHMs-contaminated soil is unclear. In this study,
   we investigated the effectiveness of phytoremediation for
   UHHMs-contaminated soil and the role of soil microbes in the process of
   phytoremediation. Results showed that the Sedum alfredii grew well in
   UHHMs-contaminated soil, although the shoot height, biomass, and
   accumulation of heavy metals were slightly reduced due to the stress of
   UHHMs. Soil microbiome analysis demonstrated that both the number and
   diversity of microbes decreased in UHHMs-contaminated soil. However, the
   dominant species Patescibacteria proliferated to varying degrees under
   the exposure of various UHHMs. Patescibacteria is closely related to the
   functional genes regarding transport of various heavy metals. Given that
   Patescibacteria exhibits a strong migration ability in soil, it is
   likely involved in the transport of various heavy metals from the bulk
   soil to the rhizosphere. This enhanced the availability of heavy metals
   in the rhizosphere, which in turn improved the phytoremediation
   efficiency of the Sedum alfredii. This was further confirmed by
   structural equation modeling analysis and microbial phenotypes
   prediction. Findings suggest that using Sedum alfredii to remedy
   UHHMs-contaminated soil is feasible owing to the facili-tation by soil
   microbes.},

Title = {Grazing intensity gradient inherited from traditional herding still
   explains Mediterranean grassland characteristics despite current
   land-use changes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Grazing is well-known to shape plant populations and plant communities
   and to affect several compartment characteristics of grazed ecosystems.
   Semi-natural grassland conservation depends on the maintenance of
   traditional extensive grazing systems which can exist for centuries,
   even millennia. However, very few studies have concomitantly
   investigated the effect of grazing management on plant, forage, litter
   and soil compartments and the implications of their potential
   interactions for conservation after recent changes in grazing
   practices.This study thus aimed to identify the concomitant effects of
   sheep grazing on the latter compartments of Mediterranean grasslands. We
   further investigated the effects of a recent change from millenia-old
   traditional herding to contemporary fenced free grazing. We also sought
   to determine how this change may impact the agronomic and ecological
   value of these grasslands.Surveys were carried out at 6 different study
   sites paired by the two different grazing practices in a French
   Mediterranean sub-steppic vegetation ({''}Crau{''} plain in Southeastern
   France).Using linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis,
   effects of grazing intensity, grazing practices and their interactions
   were tested on plant community, forage, litter and soil physicochemical
   properties. Our results show that, there was a significant effect of
   grazing intensity on the four studied compartments, with significantly
   higher species richness and evenness at moderate grazing intensity.
   Biomass was also significantly higher at moderate grazing intensity.
   Digestibility of forage, litter quality and soil fertility decreased
   significantly under less intensive grazing. Significant differences were
   also found in the relative size of the areas covered by each plant
   communities. Recent fenced free grazing led to significantly more
   intensively grazed zones, with more mesophilous/nitrophilous vegetation.
   Conversely, in zones traditionally less intensively grazed, the
   contempo-rary free grazing led to higher plant species-richness but
   again with more mesophilous species. Implications for conservation
   management are that the legacy of millennia-old traditional herding
   still compensates partly for the effects of changing practice to
   contemporary fenced free grazing on plant community composition but not
   on their relative sizes. This indicates an increase in grazing intensity
   in the remotest zone which could lead to grassland plant community
   homogenization.},

Title = {Successive corn stover and biochar applications mitigate N2O emissions
   by altering soil physicochemical properties and N-cycling-related enzyme
   activities: A five-year field study in Northeast China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {As the most important source of commodity grain in China, Northeast
   China plays a crucial role in guaranteeing national food security. The
   application of biochar in agricultural ecosystems has shown immense
   potential in ensuring crop yields while mitigating N2O emissions.
   However, the long-term impacts and mechanisms of suc-cessive application
   of corn stover and its derived biochar on soil N2O emission in the corn
   monocropping region, such as Northeast China, remain unclear. A
   five-year field experiment was conducted in Northeast China to fill this
   research gap regarding the soil nitrogen (N) cycle. Three experimental
   treatments were established: a control with no corn stover or biochar
   application (CK), corn stover returned yearly at a rate of 7.5 t ha-1
   (ST), and biochar added yearly at a rate of 2.6 t ha-1 (BC)
   corresponding to 35\% of the stover addition rate in ST. Identical
   mineral fertilizers were applied in all three treatments. The total
   accumulated N2O emissions across five analyzed growing seasons within
   the CK, ST, and BC treatments were 260.2, 184.0, and 151.0 mg N2O m- 2,
   respectively, with significant 29.3\% and 42.0\% decreases observed in
   ST and BC treatments, respectively, compared with the control. Based on
   the annual average from 2013 to 2017, ST and BC treatments significantly
   increased soil pH and total N (TN) content and significantly decreased
   the levels of NO3--N, NH4+-N, and soil bulk density (BD). Additionally,
   BC treatment remarkably lowered the average NH4+-N content than that
   under ST treatment by 24.1\%. Both ST and BC showed a significant
   inhibitory effect on nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR),
   and hydroxylamine reductase (HyR) activities related to denitrification.
   Soil N2O emission was significantly positively correlated with BD,
   NO3--N, NH4+-N, NR, NiR, and HyR activities. Path analysis suggested
   that N2O emissions were primarily driven by NR and HyR activities and
   NO3--N content. Overall, the applications of corn stover and its derived
   biochar are a feasible means of mitigating soil N2O emissions in the
   context of continuous corn cropping systems in mid-latitude regions like
   Northeast China, with biochar being more beneficial than stover
   application.},

Title = {A new air cleaning technology to synergistically reduce odor and
   bioaerosol emissions from livestock houses},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Odor and bioaerosols have serious impacts on the biological safety of
   animal production and the ecological environment. Thus, it is
   particularly important to explore synergistic air cleaning technology to
   solve these problems. In this study, a pilot-scale air cleaning
   equipment were applied to an experimental manure storage house to
   determine the removal efficiency of gaseous pollution using four
   treatments groups. These treatment groups include acid scrubbing +
   caustic scrubbing (AC), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing +
   photocatalytic oxidation (ACP), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing +
   biological scrubbing (ACB), and acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing +
   biological scrubbing + photocatalytic oxidation (ACBP). Results showed
   that ACP can synergistically remove odor and bioaerosol, with ammonia,
   odor concentrations, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, methyl sulfide,
   bacterial aerosol, and fugal aerosol removal efficiencies of 89.1 \%,
   76.3 \%, 100 \%, 94.2 \%, 91.2 \%, 75.6 \%, and 83.6 \%, respectively.
   Furthermore, ACBP has the highest removal efficiency of 79.2 \% for odor
   concentration, but this combination has a low inactivation efficiency (<
   25 \%) for bacterial aerosols. Moreover, adding biological scrubbing
   before photocatalytic can reduce the conversion from aromatic
   hydrocarbons to Oxygenated VOCs. Findings of this study provide a
   theoretical basis and technical support for the application of air
   cleaning technology in livestock houses.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Farm activities contribute to approximately one-third of Greenhouse Gas
   (GHG) emissions. Most of the GHG in the atmosphere comes from carbon
   dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The main
   objective of this research is to investigate direct and indirect GHG
   emission in five different agroecosystems, contrasted by tillage
   agricultural, farm practices (oat and maize-fava and vetch).CO2, N2O y
   CH4 concentrations were measured using two closed static chambers. Total
   biomass and production costs were determined. Indirect emissions were
   calculated from fuel used in producing and packing of synthetic
   fertilizers and herbicide, and sheep manure mineralization. The results
   showed that CO2 was the gas that most contributes to GHG emissions
   followed by the CH4 and NO2. The agrosystem with reduce tillage and
   synthetic inputs had the highest emissions (979 CO2 eq kg ha- 1).
   Agrosystems using synthetic inputs (conventional and reduce tillage)
   showed higher indirect emissions (958 and 856 CO2 eq kg ha \&\#xfffd; 1
   respectively). Maize in monoculture produced more than the systems with
   rotation or intercropping. Reduced tillage with intercropping and
   organic inputs was the most expensive to produce but had the least gas
   emission per dollar invested and per kilogram of biomass produced while
   conventional tillage agrosystems with organic or synthetic inputs stored
   little carbon in the soil, produced less biomass per unit area and
   presented higher CO2 eq emissions per unit of biomass.},

Title = {The impact of shade tree species identity on coffee pests and diseases},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The multifunctional role of shade trees for conservation of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services in natural forests and agroforests is well
   documented, yet we lack insights into the impact of shade tree species
   identity on pest and disease dynamics on agroforestry crops such as
   coffee and cacao, and its implications for management. We conducted two
   surveys on the impact of shade tree species identity and canopy cover on
   pests, diseases and a fungal hyperparasite on Arabica coffee in
   southwestern Ethiopia, which is one of the areas of origin of Arabica
   coffee. One survey was in a commercial plantation, and the other along a
   management gradient from only little managed coffee growing in the
   natural forest to intensively managed commercial plantations. To link
   these findings to current shade tree selection criteria, we complemented
   these surveys by interviews with farmers and managers. Shade tree
   species identity left a weak imprint on insect pest levels, and insect
   pests levels differed strongly in the strength and direction of their
   response to canopy cover. In contrast to the insect pests, the incidence
   of coffee leaf rust and its hyperparasite, as well as coffee berry
   disease, differed among shade tree species, with particularly high
   levels of coffee leaf rust and the hyperparasite underneath the canopy
   of the shade trees Acacia abyssinica and Croton macrostachyus, and
   coffee berry disease underneath the canopy of Acacia abyssinica and
   Polyscias fulva. Smallholder farmers used many criteria for selecting
   shade trees, such as leaf traits and competition for soil moisture, but
   low priority is given to the effect of shade tree species identity on
   pests and diseases. Our findings help to understand spatial variation in
   pest and disease dynamics in natural forests and agroforests, and may
   inform the selection of shade tree species by coffee producers and
   thereby contribute to ecologically-informed pest and disease management.
   Importantly, our finding highlight the potential for using tree identity
   for the sustainable management of pests and diseases, with relevance for
   global agroforestry systems.},

Title = {Declining abundance of pollinating insects drives falls in loquat
   (Eriobotrya japonica) fruit yields in the Pothwar region of Pakistan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Insects perform numerous vital ecosystem services, so widespread reports
   of insect declines are of considerable concern. However, there are huge
   knowledge gaps with regard to the extent and scale of insect declines,
   with most studies being from Europe and North America and very few
   long-term data sets on insect population change in Asia, Africa or South
   America. The current study describes trends in abundance of insect
   pollinators visiting loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) over 13 years
   (2006-2018) in ten widely-spaced orchards in the Pothwar region of
   Pakistan. Results reveal a significant and concerning decline of 89.9\%
   in overall abundance of flower-visitors across the study period. All
   pollinator species declined; for example numbers of Apis dorsata fell by
   97\%, A. mellifera by 96\%, A. cerana by 93\%, and Bombus
   haemorrhoidalis by 84\%. Declines were non-linear, being most rapid in
   2006-2009. In parallel, the average yield per loquat tree fell by 61\%;
   sugar and organic acid content also declined. Total flower-visiting
   insect abundance was a strong predictor of crop yield and quality over
   time and across sites, while pollinator species richness was less
   powerful. Trees that were given supplemental pollination by caging them
   with small honeybee colonies during flowering showed no decrease in
   yield or fruit quality. These results indicate that declines in
   populations of wild pollinators are negatively impacting loquat
   production and the livelihood of the small farmers of the area. Further
   research to identify the cause of these insect declines is urgently
   needed, alongside development of conservation strategies for pollinators
   in this region.},

Abstract = {Grassland is the significant composition of the terrestrial carbon pool.
   Its belowground carbon turnover process is sensitive to land use changes
   and has a huge impact on atmospheric CO2 contents. However, the
   interpretation of the vertical distribution of delta C-13 values of soil
   organic carbon (SOC-delta C-13), the SOC turnover rate (beta value) and
   their changes in the soil profile remain uncertain after fencing
   (grazing exclusion). Grasslands that have been fenced for 39 years and
   grazed (as the control) on the Loess Plateau, China were selected to
   evaluate the vertical distribution of SOC-delta C-13 and beta values and
   their influencing factors across the 0-100 cm soil profile (0-10, 10-20,

   decreased but SOC-delta C-13 overall increased with soil depths. Fencing
   significantly decreased the SOC-delta C-13 in 10-80 cm depth. The SOC
   delta C-13 had a positive correlation with delta C-13 values of
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC-delta C-13), but negative correlations
   with root biomass. Besides, the beta values of 0-60 cm depth were higher
   in fencing grasslands (-2.70) than that in grazing grasslands (-11.38).
   Overall, carbon input, microbial fractionation and soil leaching
   contributed to the increasing trend of SOC-delta C-13 with soil depths,
   and fencing increased the SOC content in the profile but decreased the
   SOC turnover rate in 0-60 cm soils. The results provide direct evidence
   for the change of SOC-delta C-13 and a more comprehensive understanding
   of SOC-delta C-13 and SOC turnover dynamics with long-term fencing
   across the soil profile. The information on SOC dynamics and their
   feedback to long-term fencing can aid in developing reasonable grassland
   management measures.},

Title = {Application rates of nitrogen fertilizers change the pattern of soil
   organic carbon fractions in a rice-wheat rotation system in China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Transferring soil organic carbon (SOC) to the SOC pool fractions is an
   essential process in soil carbon sequestration. How the application of
   nitrogen (N) fertilizers can change the SOC functional groups and affect
   the SOC turnover in the microorganism-driven SOC pool are unclear. A
   4-year field experiment with four application rates of N fertilizers (0,
   120, 240, and 360 kg N ha-1) was conducted in a rice-wheat rotation
   system. Applying N fertilizers markedly increased the phospholipid fatty
   acids of bacteria by 25.3-50.2 \% and actinomycetes by 11.1-29.5 \%,
   with larger variations at a higher application rate of N fertilizers
   compared with no N fertilizer. N fertilization decreased the
   fungi-to-bacteria ratio. The application of N fertilizers increased
   O-alkyl C proportion by 18.0-30.7 \% and labile SOC content
   (carbohydrates by 28.9-50.0 \%, protein by 23.1-43.0 \%, and lipids by
   41.5-53.7 \%) but decreased aromatic C proportion by 16.0-31.3 \%. N
   fertilizers significantly enhanced the SOC stock in the
   intra-microaggregate organic matter (iPOM) by 11.4-43.2 \%. The highest
   SOC stock in iPOM was observed at 240 kg N ha-1. The structural equation
   modeling showed that applying N fertilizers improved the labile SOC
   functional groups and chemical compounds, and promoted the SOC
   sequestration in more stable fractions by improving soil microbial
   abundance.},

Title = {Reproductive tradeoffs in a perennial crop: Exploring the mechanisms of
   coffee alternate bearing in relation to farm management},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Like many perennial crops, coffee exhibits alternate bearing, a pattern
   of reproduction in which high-yielding years are followed by
   low-yielding ones. Alternate bearing threatens farmer livelihoods, yet
   little is known about the underlying mechanisms in coffee or the
   potential for farm management to mitigate it. The resource budget model,
   an ecological theory positing endogenous resource tradeoffs as the
   driver of reproductive variability, could help fill this gap. On three
   coffee farms in Santa Maria de Dota, Costa Rica, we manipulated relative
   fruit load, fertilizer levels, and shade cover to test whether the
   model's core assumptions (i.e., that fruiting depletes resources and
   limits investment in subsequent reproduction) can elucidate patterns of
   alternate bearing in coffee, and to assess whether these patterns are
   impacted by farm management practices. Coffee plants exhibited
   within-year and between-year tradeoffs of a high fruit load that scaled
   from decreased bean size during the same season to fewer fruited nodes
   and fruits per node in both old and new cohorts of branches during the
   subsequent season. Stem nitrogen concentration was also depleted in
   response to high fruit loads and recovered during the subsequent season
   of low fruiting. The findings provide novel evidence that tradeoffs of a
   high fruit load are manifested in several reproductive traits at both
   the branch- and plant-level and offer initial support for the resource
   budget model in the system. While both moderate shade and increased
   fertilizer levels tended to improve reproductive traits, a lack of
   interactive effects between either management treatment and the relative
   fruit load treatment suggests that they do little to mitigate the
   reproductive tradeoffs underlying alternate bearing.},

Title = {A little does a lot: Can small-scale planting for pollinators make a
   difference?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {343},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Insect pollinators are declining globally as a result of the
   anthropogenic pressures that have destroyed native habitats and eroded
   ecosystems. These declines have been associated with agricultural
   productivity losses, threatening food security. Efforts to restore
   habitat for pollinators are underway, emphasizing large-scale habitat
   creation like wildflower strips, yet ignoring the impact of smaller or
   more isolated patch-creation.
   A meta-analysis of 31 independent published studies assessed the effect
   of scale of pollinator planting interventions (herbaceous strips,
   hedgerows, fertiliser/grazing/mowing control). We assessed pollinator
   species richness and abundance against size of intervention and type.
   Pollinator conservation interventions increased species richness and
   abundance in almost all of the studies examined, with the greatest
   increases in pollinator ecological metrics seen from hedgerows covering
   40 m(2) and herbaceous interventions at 500 m(2).
   We then analysed results from a 5-year study that deployed small
   pollinator habitats (30 m(2) at community gardens and farms (<150,000
   m(2)) practicing organic methods in the Pacific Northwest US. Small
   additions to pollinator resources had a significant local impact on
   pollinator abundance, but this effect was lost when these relatively
   small additions were introduced to sites in larger landscapes (>150,000
   m(2)).
   Together, we show that small interventions (similar to 500 m(2)) can
   significantly benefit pollinators, but only when sufficiently densely
   distributed at a landscape level. Though we understand the effects of
   single interventions at various scales, future research is needed to
   understand how these relatively small interventions act cumulatively at
   a landscape scale, and within this context whether larger areas are
   still needed for some species. Nonetheless, these preliminary data are
   promising, and may play an important role in convincing smaller
   landowners to act to preserve insect pollinators.},

Title = {Tree-based land uses enhance the provision of ecosystem services in
   agricultural landscapes of the Peruvian highlands},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Trees can have important impacts on multiple ecosystem services and
   biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. The influence of trees can
   extend beyond forested areas and into adjacent land uses, however, this
   is rarely accounted for in the ecological literature. To better
   understand the influence of trees in Andean agroecosystems, we examined
   alternative landscape scenarios in the community of Quilcas (Junin,
   Peru), where we explored the potential impact of replacing tree-based
   land uses (with crops and pasture) on landscape carbon (C) storage and
   soil biodiversity (soil macrofauna and ground vegetation). Additionally,
   we estimated the influence of tree-based land uses on soil C storage
   (0-20 cm depth) and macrofauna diversity in adjacent croplands and
   pastures. Tree -based land uses were dispersed across the landscape and
   occupied 26 \% of the area, including a mix of forest patches,
   plantations, and hedgerows. Given that above-and belowground C stocks
   were generally higher in land uses with trees versus those without, the
   inclusion of trees in this landscape is estimated to increase the total
   landscape C storage by 153 \%. Macrofauna diversity also varied across
   different land uses, being highest in alder (Alnus acuminata) forests
   and hedgerows, such that the inclusion of trees enhances overall
   macrofauna diversity (Shannon Index) by 25 \% but appears to have a
   slightly negative effect (-6 \%) on ground vegetation diversity. When
   accounting for the influence of trees on adjacent land uses, estimates
   for overall soil C storage at the landscape scale increased by 1.4 \%,
   while macrofauna diversity increased by approximately 5 \%. Our findings
   indicate that the addition of trees can greatly enhance overall C stocks
   and soil macrofauna diversity in agri-cultural landscapes, and that it
   is important to consider spatial interactions between land uses to fully
   quantify and optimize these interactions.},

Abstract = {Developing and implementing improved management practices are necessary
   to enhance the sustainability of organic cropping systems. This study
   examined the effects of various organic cropping systems on soil
   green-house gas (GHG) emissions and crop yields in Que ` bec, Canada.
   Organic cropping systems combining different: (i) crop sequences (barley
   {[}Hordeum vulgare L.]-grain corn {[}Zea mays L.], soybean {[}Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.]-spring wheat {[}Triticum aestivum L.], and grain
   corn-soybean), (ii) nitrogen (N) sources (poultry manure {[}PM] and/or a
   fall-seeded green manure {[}GM] or no applied N), and (iii) primary
   tillage intensities (moldboard plough {[}MP] or chisel plough {[}CP])
   were compared to a perennial forage (PF) and a bare fallow (BF) control.
   During the 2019 and 2020 snow-free seasons, nitrous oxide (N2O) and
   methane (CH4) emissions, soil water content, soil tem-perature, and
   mineral N concentrations were monitored periodically on a sandy loam
   soil. The lowest cumulative N2O emissions were found in CP-GM (0.52 +/-
   0.11 kg N ha-1 in 2019 and 0.47 +/- 0.06 kg N ha-1 in 2020), whereas the
   highest N2O emissions were found in MP-PM in 2019 (3.55 +/- 0.72 kg N
   ha-1) and BF in 2020 (1.44 +/- 0.20 kg N ha-1). For the barley-grain
   corn sequence, the CP-GM treatment generated N2O emissions that were
   40-70 \% lower and yields that were 33-51 \% lower than the MP-PMGM and
   CP-PMGM systems, which showed equivalent N2O emissions and yields.
   Yield-scaled N2O emissions were equivalent for all cropping systems.
   Peak N2O daily fluxes in the PF occurred shortly after cutting in 2020.
   During both years, CH4 emissions varied from -0.65 to + 0.18 kg C ha-1
   with no detectable differences among cropping systems. The CP-GM
   cropping system minimized area-scaled N2O emissions without increasing
   yield-scaled emissions. However, this was a two-year study on a site
   that was recently converted from conventional agriculture, so a
   long-term assessment is still necessary to determine whether the
   benefits associated with these cropping systems change over time.},

Title = {Chamomile plant material effects on soil nitrogen dynamics and
   ammonia-oxidizers to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from maize fields},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Commonly, agricultural practices utilize urea as a nitrogen (N) source,
   which can lead to N losses to the envi-ronment. Application of urease
   inhibitors (UIs) or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can mitigate these
   losses to some extent but not completely. A preliminary study showed
   that 2-Cyclopenten-1-one (CCO), an organic compound derived from
   chamomile (Chamomila recutita L.) can inhibit soil urease activity and
   also nitrification and therefore has the potential to act as a
   dual-function inhibitor for decreasing fertilizer-induced N losses and
   increasing N use efficiency. In this study, a field experiment was
   conducted to evaluate the effect of CCO on N transformations and NH3,
   N2O and CH4 emissions from soil, and monitor changes in the ammonia
   oxidizer amoA gene abundance. Three replicates of five fertilized
   treatments were included: Urea (fertilizer only), thiophos-phoric
   triamide (NBPT) (a urease inhibitor), dicyandiamide (DCD) (a widely used
   synthetic nitrification inhib-itor), NBPT combined with DCD, and CCO,
   along with an unfertilized control.The results indicated that, the
   ability of CCO to reduce N losses and improve maize yield was
   potentially superior to DCD, NBPT, or the combination of DCD and NBPT.
   Compared with the urea treatment, the addition of CCO significantly
   reduced urease activity and nitrification, which subsequently increased
   the content of NH4+-N and decreased the content of NO3--N in the soil
   during the maize growth period. Moreover, the cumulative NH3 and N2O
   emissions, global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity
   (GHGI) of the maize field were lowest from the CCO applied plots during
   the growth season, decreasing by 32.5 \%, 21.94 \%, 7.69 \% and 20.92
   \%, respectively, compared to urea treatment. Notably, CCO application
   significantly reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and
   bacteria in soil. These results suggest that CCO is effective for
   suppressing urease activity and the nitrification rate in soil and has
   the potential to be a novel naturally sourced dual-purpose inhibitor.},

Title = {Eucalyptus plantations alter spatiotemporal relationships of wild
   ungulates},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations, the second most economically important exotic
   tree in Europe, cover circa 1,5 million hectares on this continent.
   However, little is known about their effect on the ecological patterns
   of widely distributed and increasing populations of wild ungulates. This
   lack of knowledge jeopardizes our ability to correctly manage these
   populations in increasingly ubiquitous exotic forests. We aimed to
   understand how exotic forestry plantations influence ungulates spatial
   and temporal dimensions of their niche and determine how the species
   interactions may be changed by these artificial systems. We used roe
   deer and red deer as wildlife models, the Portuguese Eucalyptus
   plantation as standards for forestry plantations, and camera-trapping,
   occupancy modeling, and kernel density estimators as tools to fulfill
   our goals. Eucalyptus plantations had a strong effect on roe deer and
   red deer spatial behavior when compared to areas dominated by native
   vegetation. Both species seem to avoid disturbed areas such as
   agricultural land and Eucalyptus plantations. Even when using
   plantations, they shift their activity to reduce human encounters.
   Furthermore, plantations are not a homogeneous landcover, and thus
   distinct production phases of Eucalyptus plantations affect species
   interactions and activity patterns differently. Our results show that
   the pre-harvesting phases seem to be the more critical period for deer.
   Thus, production forest managers must guarantee that plantation
   structure encompasses areas with different tree ages to minimize this
   effect and fulfill deer's food and cover requirements. Forestry
   activities should avoid dawn and dusk, to minimize disturbance and to
   reduce the negative interaction between sympatric guild members, by
   allowing species to be sparsely distributed (and not clustered in the
   few undisturbed patches). Plantations should include dispersed native
   patches to which animals may move in search of food and refuge,
   therefore creating discontinuities within plantations.},

Abstract = {The replacement of native vegetation by crops and pasturelands
   compromises the functional diversity of plants and negatively influence
   ecosystem functions such as pollination and seed dispersal. Here, we
   investigate the effects of landscape structure on the diversity of
   functional traits in agricultural landscapes in the Brazilian Cerrado.
   We sampled the woody plant community in 49 sites in forests and
   savannas, and analyzed the density and richness of pollination and seed
   dispersal syndromes. We performed model selection using Akaike
   Infor-mation Criterion to test whether landscape variables such as
   habitat amount, percentage of agriculture and pasture, patch and edge
   densities, and compositional heterogeneity at different spatial scales
   influence the density and richness of woody plant functional traits
   related to seed dispersal and pollination syndromes. The amount of
   forest and patch density were the landscape predictors that explained
   most of the diversity of plant functional traits. The amount of
   agricultural and savanna as well as edge density and landscape
   heterogeneity also affected functional traits. Our results suggest that
   habitat amount and configuration in the landscapes drive the diversity
   of functional traits, pointing that maintaining habitats within Cerrado
   agricultural landscapes is determinant for the plant's functional traits
   diversity. Furthermore, a heterogeneous mosaic may favor the density or
   richness of plants pollinated by insects and hummingbirds. The
   continuous loss and fragmentation of habitats may lead to loss of
   ecological functions compromising the provision of ecosystems services
   in agricul-tural landscapes in the Cerrado ecoregion.},

Abstract = {Productivity in continuous rice cropping agroecosystems (RR) is lower
   than in rice-pasture rotation agro-ecosystems with pastures based on
   legumes (RP). This may be attributed to changes in soil carbon (C) and
   ni-trogen (N) levels. However, there is a lack of quantitative
   information about the contribution of the legume crop in RP
   agroecosystems in terms of soil quality indicators. The current study
   analyzed an RR and an RP in order to contribute to the understanding of
   the underlying processes involved in C and N dynamics in the soil-plant
   environment, finding better soil quality indexes in RP than in RR, and
   an interaction between N and C param-eters. The percentage of total N
   explained 90 \% of the C pool index (CPI) variability, and 72 \% of the
   percentage of particulate organic C (\%POC) variability. Furthermore, a
   biological N fixation (BNF) study performed in RP showed that almost 80
   \% of the N content in the aerial biomass of Lotus corniculatus plants
   originated from the legume-rhizobia symbiosis. Taken together, our
   results suggest that the soil N derived from the BNF associated with L.
   corniculatus plants could be a key factor for increasing soil C content,
   thereby improving soil structure.},

Title = {Responses of soil nematode community to yak grazing intensity in an
   alpine meadow},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Livestock grazing dramatically impacts the belowground community in
   grasslands by altering resource input from plants, dung and urine
   return, and soil environments. However, the belowground response pattern
   as well as the alterations in soil resource input and environments
   remain uncertain along a grazing intensity gradient. Here, we examined
   the response pattern of the soil nematode community (abundance,
   diversity, structure and functions) to grazing intensity by performing a
   5-year field manipulation experiment with four levels of yak grazing
   intensities in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Moderate grazing (i.e., 2
   yak/ha) supported the highest abun-dances of all nematodes, plant
   feeders and omni-carnivores, and maintained the most closely
   interspecific in-teractions within the nematode community. Grazing
   intensity may affect the belowground community via compensatory growth
   of forages and bottom-up trophic effects from living roots to the soil
   micro-food web. Furthermore, moderate grazing increased the functional
   metabolic footprint index of the nematode community, activated the root
   energy channel, and maintained the balance between the bacterial and
   fungal channels, which can optimize soil nutrient cycling. The model
   averaging results showed that the response of the soil nematode
   community to grazing intensity was mainly related to the alteration of
   soil moisture, which also showed a hump -shaped response to increasing
   grazing intensity. These results indicate that the soil nematode
   community as well as the soil resource input and environments show a
   hump-shaped response to increasing yak grazing intensity. Our findings
   have strong implications in optimizing ecosystem structure and functions
   of grassland on Tibetan Plateau by managing grazing capacity.},

Title = {Modelling potential natural pest control ecosystem services provided by
   arthropods in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Natural pest control has the potential to reduce pesticide use.
   Therefore, it has an essential role to play in the transition towards a
   more sustainable agriculture. For the prediction of natural pest
   control, it is essential to understand the distribution of the species
   providing this ecosystem service. The presence of pests and natural
   enemies depends on a combination of abiotic and biotic factors, each
   playing a determining role at different spatial scales. We developed a
   hierarchical model composed of environmental predictors including
   bioclimatic and land use variables at the European scale, as well as
   landscape complexity and biotic interactions at the landscape scale.
   This paper presents the predicted distribution of 111 species from seven
   different arthropod families (two pest aphid species and their natural
   enemy species) in an agricultural region in northern Germany. The
   hierarchical framework allows determining the capacity of landscapes to
   support pest control ecosystem services provided by arthropods at the
   local scale and informs on vulnerable areas or potential mismatches
   between natural pest control demand and supply. Thereby it can support
   the design of local scale measures for habitat improvement, biodiversity
   conservation and the increase of ecosystem services supply. The
   hierarchical approach can be adapted to other agroecosystems and leaves
   potential for further adaptations to improve the prediction of pests and
   their natural enemy distribution, dynamics and factors influencing their
   spatial distribution.},

Title = {Melatonin regulates material transport to reduce carbon emissions and

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen metabolism regulates yield formation and greenhouse
   gas emissions in rice. Melatonin can promote stress resistance under
   abiotic stress, but its ability to regulate carbon and nitrogen
   transport remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the response
   mechanism of melatonin in rice under reduced nitrogen application. To
   further understand whether melatonin regulates carbon and nitrogen
   transport to increase production and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. At the heading stage, 100 mu mol L-1 melatonin was sprayed
   under normal fertilization, 85\% nitrogen, 50\% nitrogen, and 0\%
   nitrogen treatments. Physiological detection, metabolomics analysis, and
   gas chromatography were used to study the response mechanism of
   melatonin to carbon and nitrogen metabolism accumulation and transport,
   and its effect on greenhouse gas emissions under different nitrogen
   fertilizer conditions was studied. The results revealed that melatonin
   could improve the genes related to sucrose transporter and nitrogen
   uptake under the condition of a 15\% reduction of normal nitrogen
   application, thereby increasing the content of non-structural
   carbohydrates and nitrogen, promoting their transport to grains, and
   reducing rhizosphere transport to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There
   was no significant difference in yield between the melatonin treatment
   and normal fertilization under 15\% nitrogen fertilizer reduction, but
   methane and nitrous oxide emissions were significantly reduced. The
   results of this study provide preliminary evidence for the response
   mechanism of exogenous melatonin to carbon and nitrogen metabolism in
   rice under different nitrogen treatments.},

Title = {Assessment of greenhouse gases emissions, global warming potential and

   and nitrogen management in an arid region of China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In the context of global warming, water scarcity, and high fertilizer
   costs, identifying proper irrigation and ni-trogen (N) management is
   essential for balancing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), crop
   production, and economic benefits in arid regions. A two-year field
   study was conducted to determine the interactive effects of irrigation
   regimes (I100, 750 mm; I80, 600 mm and I60, 450 mm) and N application
   rates (N100, 300 kg ha-1; N75, 225 kg ha-1; and N50, 150 kg ha-1) on
   GHGs emissions, global warming potential (GWP), greenhouse gas
   in-tensity (GHGI), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) from
   spring wheat field in Northwest China. Our results depicted the lowest
   cumulative GHGs emissions and GWP with low irrigation and low N
   application rates but at the cost of a significant decrease in grain
   yield and NEEB compared to full irrigation and N application. Instead,
   moderate irrigation and N application (I80N75) showed the most promising
   effects by significantly reducing GHGs emissions while improving the
   NEEB and yield benefits. Compared to I100N100, the I80N75 treatment
   decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 43.2 \% and 33.1 \%, CO2 by 28.8
   \% and 26.2 \%, GWP by 46.8 \% and 35.6 \%, and GHGI by 55.0 \% and 43.5
   \% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the I80N75 treatment
   improved the NEEB by 79.3 \% and 78.6 \% and grain yield by 15.2 \% and
   16.1 \% in 2015 and 2016 compared to I100N100, respectively. The wheat
   field acted as a CH4 sink regardless of all the treatments. Soil
   moisture and inorganic N contents were the primary driving factors that
   influenced the GHGs emissions from the wheat field, manifested by their
   significant correlations. Overall, 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg N ha-1
   fertilization is an effective strategy with a good trade-off between
   economic benefits and environmental performance from spring wheat fields
   in the arid region of Northwest China.},

Title = {Nitrate losses in subsurface drainage and nitrous oxide emissions from a
   winter camelina relay cropping system reveal challenges to sustainable
   intensification},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Sustainable intensification strategies seek to increase production while
   decreasing the environmental footprint of agricultural systems. In the
   Upper Mississippi River Basin, relay cropping of a winter oilseed crop
   between corn and soybean has gained interest for its potential to
   increase total yields and revenue while providing the environmental
   benefits of winter cover. In a six-year field study in central Iowa, a
   basic corn-soybean rotation was compared with a corn-winter
   camelina-soybean relay cropping system for crop yields, nitrate losses
   in drainage, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil. Despite
   filling a niche as an overwintering crop with the potential to
   assimilate soil nitrogen, nitrate loads in drainage were not reduced in
   the camelina relay cropping system. Over the course of the study,
   management changes to support the camelina crop tripled cumulative N2O
   emissions during the camelina-soybean phase, from 3.57 kg N2O-N ha(-1)
   in the basic corn-soybean rotation to 12.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the
   camelina relay system. Most of the increased emissions in the camelina
   system were associated with peak emissions events following tillage and
   starter fertilizer application in the fall and during the spring thaw,
   which may point to risks of exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions during
   fall management of a relay crop. Corn and soybean yields were decreased
   in the relay cropping system by 9.8 \% and 23.3 \%, respectively, as a
   result of management changes to the system and interspecific
   competition. However, combined grain dry weight of soybean and the
   camelina oilseed crop were similar to the soybean yield in the basic
   corn-soybean rotation. These findings highlight the need for careful
   evaluation and optimization of sustainable intensification systems to
   ensure environmental and production goals are met.},

Title = {Using fertilization rates in semi-natural grasslands to produce seed for
   ecological restoration},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {To produce seeds of native species for ecological restoration,
   cultivating semi-natural grasslands can be a strategy that avoids the
   environmental impacts of conventional seed propagation and favours the
   conservation of species -rich grasslands. In a lowland grassland in
   northern Italy, the effects of three mineral fertilisation treatments
   (0-0-0, 0-54-108, and 192-108-216 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N, P2O5, and
   K2O; abbreviations: 000, 0pk, and NPK) on seed production were studied
   in a fully randomised block design. Fertile shoots of flowering species
   were collected and analysed for seed content, and species phenology was
   recorded during field observations. The grassland environmental quality
   was described based on soil analyses and indices of natural (plant and
   insect richness) and aesthetic (flower colour) value. NPK produced the
   highest viable seed amount (59,375 m- 2 year(-1)). The seed mixture was
   composed mostly of grasses (97\%) and included the lowest species number
   (34). NPK also had the lowest environmental value. In 0pk, the nitrogen
   from legume rhizobial fixation allowed the production of an intermediate
   viable seed amount (28,485 m(-2) year -1) with an intermediate forb seed
   percentage (14\%) and the highest species number in the vegetation (42)
   and collected as seeds. In 000, the seed amount was the lowest (8310
   m(-2) year(-1)), but the species number (40) and forb percentage in the
   seed mixture (39\%) were high. The natural and aesthetic values did not
   significantly differ between 0pk and 000. The P soil content increased
   strongly in NPK, whereas decreases or insignificant increases in P and K
   were recorded in 0pk and 000. Mineral 0pk fertilisation allows for
   relatively high seed production with high legume and forb richness by
   avoiding the distribution of nitrogen fertilisers that potentially
   impact the environment. This strategy seems to be a good option for
   producing environmentally friendly seed mixtures of many native species
   from semi-natural grasslands.},

Title = {Available nitrogen and ammonia-oxidizing archaea in soil regulated N2O
   emissions regardless of rice planting under a double rice
   cropping-fallow system},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Changing redox conditions in paddy fields due to more frequent events
   govern the soil biogeochemical processes that further affect the
   generation and emission of N2O from soil. However, studies on the effect
   of rice cropping on soil N2O emission under rice-growing seasons and
   relevant mechanisms are scarce. A double rice cropping -fallow (RF)
   field in central China, with rice cropping (RF-CC) and non-rice cropping
   (RF-NC) cultivation, were selected to investigate that effect of rice
   planting on soil N2O emissions and key functional genes related to
   N2O-production and consumption, such as the ammonia-monooxygenase gene
   derived from ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA-amoA) and ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB-amoA) and nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ). The results
   of the static opaque chamber-gas chromatography technique showed that
   seasonal cumulative N2O emissions from RF-NC treatment during the first
   and second rice growing season were 1.02 +/- 0.17 and 2.95 +/- 0.12 kg N
   ha( -1), respectively, and were comparable to those from RF-CC treatment
   (0.82 +/- 0.09 and 2.97 +/- 0.18 kg N ha (-1), respectively), indicating
   rice cropping had no crucial effect on soil N2O emissions. No
   significant difference was found in the abundance of the aforementioned
   genes between two treatments. For both RF-CC and RF-NC treatments, N2O
   fluxes were positively correlated with the soil available nitrogen, such
   as dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and microbial biomass N (MBN), suggesting
   that soil available N was a key factor controlling N2O emissions.
   Increased transcripts of the AOA-amoA gene may facilitate N2O production
   and were confirmed by the positive linear relations between N2O fluxes
   and the abundance of AOA-amoA gene for both treatments. The structural
   equation model (SEM) indicated that both soil available N and AOA-amoA
   gene contributed more than 70\% to their effects on N2O emission for
   both treatments. These results implied that soil N2O emissions during
   the rice-growing period could be regulated by the interaction of soil
   parameters and related functional genes, rather than the effect of rice
   cropping under a RF system.},

Title = {Phenological, morphological and physiological drivers of cereal grain
   yield in Mediterranean agroforestry systems},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change will pose a major threat to food supply worldwide.
   Agroforestry has been proposed as an effective approach to minimize its
   effects on crops. However, to design sustainable and productive
   agroforestry systems, net responses of crops to trees need to be
   clarified, particularly in regions where competitive in-teractions will
   outweigh facilitative ones. The study of plant traits has become a
   useful approach to select best -adapted plants, yet the sensitivity of
   yield components to agroforestry and their relationship with plant
   traits needs investigation. In this experiment, we assess the
   phenological, morphological and physiological responses of shade-adapted
   cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.), growing in an agroforestry system (AF) with walnut trees
   (Juglans x intermedia Mj209xRa), as compared to cereal monocrops (MC).
   Agroforestry reduced the light intercepted by crops by 58 \%, buffered
   extreme temperatures at the crop canopy level and increased air relative
   humidity, advancing plant development for wheat and barley. Major tree
   effects on crops were observed after walnut budburst. Under trees, crops
   increased the relative water content (RWC), Photochemical Reflectance
   Index (PRI) and P content of both wheat and barley leaves, increased
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of barley leaves, and
   reduced leaf mass area (LMA) in wheat and cell membrane damage in both
   species. In agroforestry, crops also reduced plant growth, leaf area
   (LA), leaf area index (LAI) and grain yield in both wheat and barley.
   Drivers of grain yield differed among agroforestry and open conditions
   in both species, showing for the first time that the selection of cereal
   cultivars for specific conditions could be based on plant traits, along
   with the shade tolerance, to establish successful agroforestry systems.},

Title = {Does fire and herbicide benefit cattle production in invaded grassland
   landscapes?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Invasive species management is promoted as a general practice to
   maintain rangeland biodiversity and mitigate livestock performance
   losses (e.g., weight gain) stemming from invasive-species effects (e.g.,
   competitive exclusion of palatable forages). It is hypothesized that
   altering fire-timing (e.g., moving from early to late-growing season
   burning) or integrating herbicide application into fire management
   regimes may lead to more successful reduction of certain invasive
   species without negatively affecting livestock weight gains. However,
   large-scale, replicated experimental evidence linking invasive species
   abundance or management practices to cattle weight gain is mostly
   lacking across grasslands. We manipulated eight large (333 - 766 ha)
   pastures managed with fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory) to test
   how growing (i.e., August-September) and dormant (i.e., March-April)
   season fires, herbicide application, or invasive species abundance
   (namely Lespedeza cuneata) affected yearling stocker cattle weight gain
   - i.e., per head weight gain - from 2018 to 2020. We found that yearling
   stocker cattle gained significantly less weight in pastures burned
   during the growing season, and her-bicide application did not increase
   weight gains overall. Moreover, we did not find a significant
   relationship between L. cuneata abundance and per head yearling stocker
   cattle weight gain. Our results add to a growing line of evidence that
   invasive species management does not always benefit livestock producers.
   The hypothesized negative relationship between invasive species
   abundance and cattle weight gain may be minimal (or neutral) across
   large grassland landscapes, particularly those managed with pyric
   herbivory. To date, pyric herbivory is the only management regime known
   to simultaneously promote biodiversity, and restrict some invasive plant
   species like L. cuneata.},

Title = {Evapotranspiration and carbon exchange of the main agroecosystems and
   their responses to agricultural land use change in North China Plain},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The North China Plain (NCP) plays an important role in food production
   while there is serious groundwater overexploitation in this area. The
   quantified relationship between the variation in evapotranspiration (ET)
   and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and agricultural land use change in
   NCP remains unclear. In this study, based on the eddy covariance method,
   water balance method, and remote sensing data, ET and NEE variations
   were quantified and the impacts of agricultural land use change from
   2002 to 2012 on regional ET and NEE variation were analyzed. The average
   ET and NEE of the winter wheat - summer maize cropland ecosystem were
   714.2 mm yr-1 and -534.3 gC m-2 yr-1, respectively. Correspondingly, the
   above values were 786.2 mm yr-1 and 667.5 gC m-2 yr-1 for the pear
   orchard ecosystem, and 778.6 mm yr-1 and 814.8 gC m-2 yr-1 for the
   vegetable field ecosystem, which had relatively high ET and ecosystem
   productivity. The average annual ET and NEE of the cotton field
   ecosystem were only 592.0 mm and -351.3 gC m-2, respectively.
   Agricultural land area increased by 331.2 x 103 ha over 2002-2012, which
   was caused by the increasing land area of spring maize, forest/fruit
   trees, and vegetables. As a result, the ET and NEE of the agroecosystems
   in NCP increased by 25.6 x 108 m3 and -257.9 x 104 tonC from 2002 to
   2012, which are beneficial for carbon sequestration. However, the
   increase in carbon sink was at the cost of greater groundwater
   overexploitation due to increased regional water consump-tion. The
   planting of crops with high water consumption should be reduced as the
   surpluses of these agricultural products compared to the food demand in
   this region. These results are meaningful for reasonable planting
   structure adjustment of water-adaptive sustainable agricultural
   development in the NCP.},

   fertilizer is one-time applied in crop root-zone, and phosphate (P) and
   potassium (K) are surface broadcasted. In ORZTF, common N, P and K are
   together placed at certain sites in the root-zone. Three rice field
   trials with the methods of conventional surface broadcasting (CSB),
   ORZF, and ORZTF, and a soil incubation experiment with CSB and ORZTF,
   were conducted. In 2018, the treatments comprised CSB with no N (N0),
   with the local N rate (CSB, 195 kg N hm(-2) and 150 kg N hm(-2) for two
   sites, respectively), with higher N (HCSB, 225 kg N hm(-2) and 195 kg N
   hm(-2), respectively), ORZF (195 kg N hm(-2) and 150 kg N hm(-2),
   respectively), and ORZTF (195 kg N hm(-2) and 150 kg N hm(-2),
   respectively). In 2019, the treatments were: N0, CSB, ORZF, ORZTF with
   urea (ORZTF-U), with ammonium chloride (ORZTF-Cl), and with ammonium
   sulfate (ORZTF-S) at 180 kg N hm(-2). In the incubation experiment,
   there're three treatments: N0, CSB, and ORZTF. The rates of P and K were
   the same in all experiments. Compared with CSB, ORZTF and ORZF
   significantly increased the yield, N uptake, N recovery efficiency, and
   N partial factor productivity of rice with the same N input. After 4.5
   months of incubation, 78.5-92.7\% of fertilizer N was reserved in the
   soils with ORZTF, about two-fold that with CSB. In all field and
   incubation experiments, AV loss was negligible when N was one-time
   root-zone applied alone or together with PK, close to that in N0
   treatment. Compared with ORZF, ORZTF seemed to be a more promising
   method in rice fertilization, having the similar effect on N uptake
   increase and N loss reduction, but more convenience. Although the
   benefits of targeting fertilization were not significantly observed in
   the current work, with the idea of `fertilizing the roots but not the
   soil', the method of ORZTF with common N, P and K fertilizers should be
   beneficial for cleaner and more efficient agricultural crop production
   in China.},

Title = {Just and sustainable transformed agricultural landscapes: An analysis
   based on local food actors? ideal visions of agriculture},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Societal and policy trends are leading to major demands on food systems,
   including a transformation towards more sustainable and resilient
   farming systems. Research is increasingly highlighting the importance of
   considering the landscape scale in such transformations, with the
   understanding that such an approach will require agricultural landscape
   design informed through trans-disciplinary approaches. Despite a number
   of sustainability transformations advocated in the scientific
   literature, there may, however, be very different views amongst actors
   of the food chain, from producers to consumers, over what such a
   transformed landscape should look like, leading to potential social
   conflicts and lack of progress towards transformative change. This has
   led authors to suggest a need to understand better the visions of a
   transformed agriculture from the perspectives of food system actors,
   including rural communities and farmers. This paper contributes to this
   debate by analysing stakeholder visions based on a case study in
   Bourgogne Franche-Comte ` (France) with three study sites involving:
   agriculture and water management near Auxerre, apiculture-agriculture in
   the Jura, and viticulture near Macon. Using the results of 55 interviews
   that included a `miracle question' over what an ideal agriculture might
   look like, five ideal visions were identified: a recognised agriculture;
   a diverse agriculture; an anchored agriculture; a predictable
   agriculture; and a technological agriculture. Building on the
   differences and commonalities of the different visions, the results
   allow for the identification of areas of consensus, and also, where
   there are irrec-oncilable values and worldviews underpinning the views,
   how to address them. The process of visioning can be an important
   approach to promote greater understanding of different stakeholders'
   visions and transformation towards greater sustainability, especially
   when the resulting visions become the starting point of participatory
   processes and outcomes at the landscape scale.},

Title = {Low-Cd wheat varieties and soil Cd safety thresholds for local soil
   health management in south Jiangsu province, east China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Wheat is the second most important staple food crop, therefore safe and
   environmentally friendly production of wheat is essential for human
   safety and health. Southern Jiangsu province is a very important wheat
   producing region that is highly industrialized with many soils polluted
   with potentially toxic metals, especially cadmium (Cd). Wheat varieties
   with low Cd bioconcentration factors (BCF) are often used to decrease Cd
   accumulation and increase the safety of products in field practice. In
   addition, the development of local soil safety thresholds, the main
   focus of soil health management, is also necessary to protect
   agricultural soil health and agricultural production. However, there is
   no published literature describing low-Cd-accumulating wheat varieties
   and soil safety thresholds in this region. Field plot experiments and
   field investigations at multiple experimental sites in southern Jiangsu
   province have therefore been conducted for several years to screen
   low-Cd-accumulating wheat varieties and to derive soil Cd safety
   thresholds. The varieties Yangmai 25, Zhengmai 12 and Yangmai 12 had
   stable and low Cd BCF. The deduced safe thresholds of total soil Cd
   concentrations for protecting 95 \% of wheat varieties were 0.17, 0.18,
   and 0.31 mg kg(-1) at 4.5 < pH <= 6.5, 6.5 < pH <= 7.5 and 7.5 < pH <=
   9.0, stricter levels than the Chinese national risk screening values.
   The deduced thresholds were validated to increase the protection rates
   of wheat by field investigations. In conclusion, wheat varieties with
   low Cd BCF and soil thresholds can contribute to local soil health
   management and safe wheat production in southern Jiangsu province.},

Title = {Interactive effects of warming and managements on carbon fluxes in
   grasslands: A global meta-analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The prediction of future carbon(C) dynamics of grassland ecosystems
   requires knowledge of how warming and management practices (e.g.,
   fertilization, grazing, and mowing) interact to affect C fluxes. In this
   study, we synthesized experimental data extracted from 350 observations
   from 64 publications to quantify the direction and magnitude of
   individual and interactive effects between climatic warming and
   grassland management practices on seven variables related to C fluxes.
   Warming significantly enhanced gross primary productivity (GPP) and
   ecosystem respiration (ER) by 9.81\% and 16.43\%, respectively.
   Similarly, fertilization significantly increased GPP, net primary
   productivity (NPP), aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), ER, and
   net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by 29.51\%, 24.79\%, 33.52\%, 21.81\%, and
   33.89\%, respectively. In contrast, grazing and mowing reduced ANPP by
   19.95\% and 22.83\%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of
   warming and fertilization significantly increased GPP and ANPP by
   38.09\% and 22.89\%, respectively. More importantly, the results showed
   that additive interactions dominated the response of most of the studied
   variables, while synergistic interactions were found only for ANPP and
   ER to warming and fertilization. The responses of C fluxes to warming
   and management were strongly dependent on the environmental factors,
   experimental duration, and grassland types. Our meta-analysis highlights
   the importance of the interactions between warming and management on
   ecosystem C exchange. Therefore, incorporating these key interactions
   into future prediction models should enhance the accuracy of prediction
   of future climate change impacts on grassland ecosystems and inform the
   development of sustainable grassland management strategies.},

Title = {Variations of leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations on typical cultivated
   and natural hillslopes in southeastern hilly area of China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Greenhouse gases dissolved in the soil water and transported through
   subsurface flow were poorly understood in comparison to their emissions
   at the soil-atmosphere interface. In this study, leachate CO2 and N2O
   concentrations were monitored on a tea garden (TG) hillslope
   (cultivated) and a bamboo forest (BF) hillslope (naturally vegetated)
   from September 2019 to February 2022 in the south-eastern hilly area of
   China. Leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations ranged from 1.07 to 9.83 mg C
   L-1 and from 0.32 to 11.74 mu g N L-1, respectively, on the TG
   hillslope, while they ranged from 0.64 to 25.95 mg C L-1 and from 0.23
   to 5.68 mu g N L-1, respectively, on the BF hillslope. On both
   hillslopes, leachate CO2 concentrations were the greatest in summer,
   while they were the lowest in winter. On the TG hillslope, the highest
   and the lowest leachate N2O concentrations were observed in spring and
   summer, respectively, while on the BF hillslope, they were observed in
   autumn and winter, respectively. On both hillslopes, soil temperature,
   precipitation during the previous 15 days, and matrix potential were
   positively related to the leachate CO2 concentrations but not related to
   the leachate N2O concentrations. Soil water content was positively
   related to both leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations, while such
   relationships with groundwater table depth were negative. Leachate total
   inorganic nitrogen and soil total inorganic nitrogen concentrations were
   positively related to the leachate N2O concentration on the TG
   hillslope, while such relationships were not observed on the BF
   hillslope. Spatial variations of leachate CO2 and N2O concentrations
   were mainly influenced by land covers, terrain attributes (slope,
   elevation), soil particle size distribution, bulk density and soil
   organic matter content. The findings of this study supplemented the
   knowledge of soil water dissolved CO2 and N2O in the cultivated and
   naturally vegetated land covers. Further researches are needed to
   quantify the CO2 and N2O losses through subsurface flow and their
   contributions to the total soil CO2 and N2O losses.},

   biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision suggests that
   future landscapes will need to be more explicitly designed. Although
   recent research has produced a number of ecological and social
   principles that should form the basis of agricultural landscape design
   process, implementation is still in its infancy. One difficulty is the
   context-dependency of ecological responses and the resulting limiting
   capacity to predict the benefits of landscape transformation for the
   targeted organisms or services. In addition, there is a poor
   understanding of the obstacles to and levers for the implementation of
   collective management at the landscape scale. In this paper, we argue
   that Landscape Monitoring Networks (LMN), i.e. long-term and
   standardized monitoring of ecological and managerial processes within a
   set of replicated regional landscapes, can contribute to tackling these
   issues. We first present the current challenges in designing
   agroecological landscapes before outlining the principles of LMN and how
   these research facilities could help deliver ecological and social
   understanding along a gradient from place-based to generic knowledge. We
   then discuss critical issues that need to be solved to ensure that LMN
   delivers relevant knowledge for landscape design. We illustrate this
   through the experience of an ongoing LMN that was created in France in
   2014 to address biodiversity and pest control services in agricultural
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) retention capacity can influence crop production, soil
   health, and environmental quality, especially in greenhouse
   agroecosystem with multiple cropping and high N application rate.
   However, the key N components and indices for predicting greenhouse soil
   N retention potential and the underlying driving mechanism of soil N
   retention under different agricultural management practices remain
   elusive. Here, a three-year tomato field experiment with mulch-film drip
   irrigation was conducted to investigate the effects of different
   irrigation and N fertilization regimes on soil organic N fractions and
   soil-retained N pools in a greenhouse agroecosystem of Northeast China.
   Three irrigation levels (W-1, high, 25 kPa; W2, moderate, 35 kPa; W-3,
   low, 45 kPa) and three N application rates (N-1, low, 75 kg N ha(-1);
   N-2, moderate, 300 kg N ha(-1); N3, high, 525 kg N ha(-1)) were
   considered. The results showed irrigation, N fertilization, and their
   interactions profoundly influenced soil properties, organic N fractions,
   and soil-retained N pools at 0-30 cm greenhouse vegetable soil layers.
   The dominant forms of greenhouse soil organic N fractions and
   soil-retained N pools were acidolysable amino acid N (AAN) and fixed
   ammonium (FA), respectively. Structural equation modeling and redundancy
   analysis indicated that there were significant direct effects of soil
   properties (SOC, Ntotal, and C/N) on FA, acidolysable ammonium N (AN),
   and AAN; additionally, soil microbial biomass N (SMBN) also exerted a
   significant direct effect on AN. Our results suggest that soil organic N
   fractions are closely correlated with soil-retained N pools and soil
   properties under different irrigation and N fertilization regimes.
   Furthermore, AAN and FA could be the appropriate indicators for
   predicting greenhouse soil N retention potential, and the optimization
   of irrigation and N fertilization application schedule (W(3)N(2
   )treatment: 45 kPa - 300 kg N ha(-1)) is conducive to improve soil N
   retention potential in greenhouse tomato production of Northeast China.},

Title = {Land-use intensification reduces multi-taxa diversity patterns of Small
   Woodlots Outside Forests in a Mediterranean area},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {340},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Land-use intensification exacerbates landscape fragmentation, increasing
   the negative effects on biodiversity. In this context, the biodiversity
   value of Trees Outside Forests (TOF; scattered trees, tree lines and
   small woodlots) is often overlooked by landscape planning and
   conservation programs, which typically focus on protecting larger and
   more intact areas. More empirical studies on taxa inhabiting TOF are
   needed to support and promote their conservation in human-altered
   lands.However, we are not aware of any study focusing on multiple taxa
   living in small woodlots outside forests (SWOFs) in the Mediterranean
   basin. We investigated how diversity patterns of multiple taxa in SWOFs
   respond to a land-use intensification gradient, from natural areas to
   more disturbed ones (agricultural and urban areas), in a Mediterranean
   biodiversity hotspot.We explored the influence of land-use types on
   species richness and composition of vascular plants and six
   ground-dwelling invertebrate groups (pseudoscorpions, spiders, darkling
   beetles, rove beetles, ground beetles, and ants). Species composition
   was more sensitive than species richness to land-use change,
   highlighting the need to consider a suitable measure for interpreting
   ecological processes. We observed a strong influence of land use
   embedding SWOFs on the mean composition and beta diversity of taxa:
   land-use intensification led to a general homogenization of diversity
   patterns, especially among agricultural and urban areas. In our study
   area, vascular plants responded more sensitively to land-use change than
   invertebrates. For most invertebrates: the higher the land-use
   intensity, the lower the species composition dissimilarity due to the
   dominance of good dispersers or disturbance-tolerant species. More
   vagile species and disturbance-tolerant species can move across open
   habitats and colonize new areas, reducing compositional differences and
   potentially boosting species pools. We demonstrated that SWOFs play a
   key role in supporting viable populations of invertebrates, also in
   human -altered lands, underlining the need to promote their conservation
   in this Mediterranean fragmented landscape to avoid homogenization from
   driving a generalized biodiversity loss.},

Title = {Leached nitrate under fertilised loamy soil originates mainly from
   mineralisation of soil organic N},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Animal manures are suspected to be a major source of nitrate leaching
   due to their low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by crops. However, actual
   measurements of nitrate leaching from animal manure under field
   conditions are scarce. In an on-farm field trial in Switzerland over 2.5
   years, we used 15N labelling to trace the fate of N from cattle slurry
   in the soil-plant system and to test whether more nitrate was leached
   from slurry than from mineral fertiliser. The experiment was conducted
   on two neighbouring fields with loamy soil in an agricultural area of
   the Swiss midlands, where nitrate levels in the groundwater are
   persistently high. Both fields followed the same crop rotation (silage
   maize - winter wheat - grass-clover), but shifted by one year. We
   compared three fertiliser treatments: Control (Con), 15N mineral
   fertiliser (Min), and 15N cattle slurry (Slu). In order to provide a
   comprehensive fertiliser N balance over several years, we traced the
   labelled fertilisers into crop biomass, soil, and leached nitrate. In
   the year of application, 15N recovery in crops was 45-47\% for Min, but
   only 19-23\% for Slu. Complementary to this finding, recoveries in soil
   were greater for Slu than for Min, despite greater NH3 emissions from
   Slu. Fertiliser recovery in the succeeding crops was small (< 4.6\% of
   the originally applied fertiliser N in the first residual year and <
   2.4\% in the second) and similar for both fertilisers. Depth
   translocation of fertiliser N was marginal, with the majority of 15N in
   soil still in the top 0.3 m after 2.5 years. Along with higher
   recoveries in soil for Slu, we found significantly more slurry N than
   mineral fertiliser N lost through leaching. However, less than 5\% of
   cumulated amounts of nitrate leaching over the three crops, which
   reached up to 205 kg nitrate-N ha-1, originated from direct leaching of
   the labelled fertilisers. Our findings suggest that most nitrate
   leaching originated from the mineralisation of soil N.},

Title = {Evaluating the impacts of alternative grazing management practices on
   soil carbon sequestration and soil health indicators},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Globally, grazing lands represent a major carbon (C) sink. However,
   improper use of these ecosystems can degrade their soils and their C
   storage capacity. Specifically, prolonged high stocking rates in
   livestock pro-duction can result in significantly less soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and soil fertility in grazing lands. This underlines the
   need to assess key soil health indicators to determine the ecological
   efficacy of grazing management. The objective of this study was to
   identify the impacts of alternative grazing management practices,
   including heavy continuous (HC), light continuous (LC), and adaptive
   multi-paddock (AMP) grazing, on SOC and soil health indicators at the
   ranch and watershed scales in the Lower Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River
   Watershed in Northwest Texas. The stocking rate was the same under AMP
   and HC grazing, and it was reduced by half under LC grazing. The Soil
   and Water Assessment Tool-Carbon (SWAT-C) model was modified and used to
   conduct this assessment over a 40 year period (1979-2018), after a
   900-year spin-up simulation (800 years under natural condition and 100
   years under the HC grazing) to initiate the SOC pool. The simulated SOC
   was validated using observed data from several sampling locations. The
   study results indicated that when grazing management at the study ranch
   was changed from the current AMP grazing to hypothetical HC grazing,
   simulated average annual SOC decreased from 84 to 81.8 Mg/ha (a 2.6\%
   decline). At the watershed-scale, when the grazing management was
   changed from the baseline HC grazing to AMP grazing, the simulated
   average annual SOC increased from 35.6 to 38.3 Mg/ha (a 7.5\% increase).
   The net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), biomass C,
   and soil nitrogen (N) increased, while C losses from runoff, and
   sediment loads decreased under AMP grazing. These results indicate that
   compared to HC, AMP grazing performed better with respect to SOC
   increase, and improvement of soil ecosystem and hydrological functions
   at both the ranch and watershed scales in the study watershed. Our
   findings suggest the need to shift from continuous to AMP grazing in
   order to improve soil health at multiple spatial scales.Data

Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) fertilizer input influences crop yield, soil P cycling,

   of the P-starvation response genes (phoR and phoP), the high-affinity
   phosphate-specific transporter (pst), the inorganic P-solubilization,
   and organic P-mineralization genes (gcd, pqq, and phoD). Long-term P
   inputs increased the abundance of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria but
   decreased the abundance of phosphate-solubilizing fungi and weakened the
   relationship of relevant key soil P genes. Soil total P, inorganic P,
   available P (AP), dissolved organic C contents, and alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP) activity were significantly related to soil P cycle genes and PSM
   community structure. In conclusion, the changes in soil P cycle genes
   and microbial P solubilization capacity under long-term P input
   conditions were mainly regulated by soil AP content and ALP activity,
   while long-term high-P inputs increased soil mineral P immobilization by
   altering the expression of soil P cycle genes and the PSM functional
   profiles. These consequences provide a new view for the study of soil P
   cycles in agricultural ecosystems with P inputs.},

Title = {Landscape-level effects on pollination networks and fruit-set of crops

Abstract = {There is a global concern of pollinator declines and linked ecosystem
   service losses. However, although land-use changes are a primary threat
   to biodiversity, how land-use change affects pollinator communities,
   pollination networks and fruit-set of food crops is poorly understood.
   The impact of land-use changes is especially under-studied in tropical
   systems, even though most tropical crops are highly dependent on animal
   pollination. Using 40 sites to investigate diurnal and nocturnal flower
   visitors in small-scale agroecosystems across land-use gra-dients in
   Thailand and tropical South-western China, we show that habitat
   structure shapes pollinator com-munities at local (floral species
   richness) and landscape level (percentage of tree plantation in a 500 m
   radius and percentage forest in a 5 km radius), influencing both the
   species richness of pollinators and their visitation rates. These, in
   turn, alter plant-pollinator network structure: community-level
   specialization increases with floral species richness and percentage of
   forest cover. However, the specialization decreases with percentage of
   tree plantation, illustrating that natural habitat better supports
   specialized species. Furthermore, fruit-sets of several crops were
   affected by land-use. Notably, fruit-set of mango was positively
   associated with the percentage of forest cover in the surrounding
   landscape. These findings reveal how land-use influence pollinator
   communities and highlight how natural habitats may safeguard ecosystem
   services.},

Title = {Land cover and climate drive shifts in Bombus assemblage composition},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Pollinators play pivotal roles in maintaining agricultural and natural
   plant communities, yet some bee populations are declining. Loss of
   pollinator habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and
   urbanization have reduced bee abundance and diversity. Additionally,
   climate change has affected bee distributions and led to disruption of
   plant-pollinator synchrony, impacting ecosystem processes. However, how
   these factors concurrently influence bee assemblages is poorly
   understood. Therefore, we evaluated bumble bee (Bombus) assemblages in
   relation to the proportion of agricultural, semi-natural, and urban land
   cover and interannual variation in temperature, precipitation, and
   relative humidity in Utah agroecosystems using Bombus captured as
   bycatch in pest monitoring traps from 2014 to 2018. Bombus assemblage
   composition was highest in agricultural sites with increased
   agricultural land cover in the surrounding area, low temperatures, and
   high relative humidity during the growing season; and lowest in sites
   with increased urban land cover, high temperatures, and low relative
   humidity. Functional dispersion did not differ among these groups
   indicating a range of tongue lengths, body sizes, hair lengths, and hair
   types were present within all agricultural sites. Further, high
   beta-diversity, as indicated by unique Bombus assemblages among sites,
   suggests that all agricultural sites in this study have potential
   conservation value for maintaining Bombus communities. Therefore, it is
   important that diverse habitats for pollinators are maintained through
   targeted management techniques. Additionally, our collection of Bombus
   from mid-May to mid-September identified phenological overlap within
   Bombus assemblages, which helps ensure pollination services are provided
   even if a particular species is lost due to environmental disturbances.
   However, while there is overlap in functional traits and phenology,
   considerations should be given due to widespread pollinator declines.
   Overall, evaluating landscape and climate variables together may yield
   more realistic results and better inform effective management and
   land-use planning strategies to prevent ecological homogenization and to
   foster future resiliency of Bombus populations.},

Title = {Patterns of denitrifier communities assembly and co-occurrence network
   regulate N2O emissions in soils with long-term contrasting tillage
   histories},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {339},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Denitrification is reducing nitrate to nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen
   (N-2) under the action of denitrifying microorganisms, which are the
   main source of soil N2O emissions. However, the co-occurrence pattern
   and community assembly process of denitrifier communities have not been
   studied in agricultural soils with long-term contrasting tillage
   histories. Based on a continuous (> 11 yr) conservation experiment, we
   aimed to understand the community assembly process and co-occurrence
   network of nirK-, nirS-, nosZI- and nosZII-type denitrifier communities
   under conservation tillage (i.e., zero tillage (ZT) and chisel plough
   tillage (CPT)) and conventional tillage (i.e., plow tillage (PT)).
   Continuous in situ measurements showed that long-term conservation
   tillage significantly decreased the denitrification potential and N2O
   emission fluxes. CPT and ZT significantly increased the taxonomic and
   phylogenetic diversity of nirK, nosZI, and nosZII type communities,
   whereas consistently decreased the diversity of nirS-type communities,
   compared with PT. Although the assembly of nirK, nirS, nosZI, and nosZII
   type denitrifier communities were dominated by stochastic processes, the
   relative importance of stochastic assembly of denitrifying microbial
   communities was higher in conservation tillage soil. The co-occurrence
   network analyses further revealed clear tillage-induced ecological
   functions of N2O emissions, as evidenced by lower key nodes abundance
   and robustness of nirS and nirK communities network and higher key nodes
   abundance and robustness of nosZI and nosZII communities in conservation
   tillage soils. Variation partitioning analysis further indicated that
   the assembly processes significantly changed soil N2O emission intensity
   by regulating alpha-diversity and the key species abundances in the
   co-occurrence network of denitrifying com-munities. Overall,
   conservation tillage practices increased the diversity and the key nodes
   abundance of nosZI- and nosZII-type communities and decreased the
   diversity and the key nodes abundance of nirS- and nirK-type communities
   by regulating the relative importance of the stochastic assembly process
   of denitrifier communities, which is eventually likely to curb N2O
   emissions by strengthening the capacity of the N2O sink and weakening
   the capacity of the N2O source. These findings provide new insights into
   the formation of dryland microbial communities in agricultural soils
   with long-term contrasting tillage histories. Especially considering
   future climate change, this knowledge would prove useful in improving
   agroecosystem productivity and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal patterns of organic carbon sequestration capacity after
   long-term coastal wetland reclamation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Reclamation significantly affects the dynamics of soil carbon, including
   carbon sequestration, emissions, and storage. In this study, the impact
   of the reclamation time (exceeding 1000 years) and land-use types on the
   carbon sequestration capacity of soil in the coastal wetland of Hangzhou
   Bay was investigated. We found that both pH and electrical conductivity
   (EC) negatively correlated with reclamation time, which was closely
   related to the degree of maturation of the soil and its distance from
   the coastline. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the surface
   soil exhibited an upward trend as reclamation time increased. Total
   nitrogen (TN) and TOC exhibited a positive correlation, with the maximum
   values observed during the reclamation period from 1000 to 1500 CE. The
   land-use type had a significant effect on the TOC content of the surface
   soil. Surface soil TOC concentrations in different land-use types, in
   ascending order, were reed land, wastelands, vegetable fields,
   woodlands. This pattern suggests that the TOC of agricultural soil was
   higher than that of the soil from other land-use types. This increase in
   agricultural soil TOC was attributed to long-term fertilization. Soil
   organic carbon (SOC) content generally decreased with increasing soil
   profile depth. Therefore, in the early stages of reclamation, reasonable
   land management methods should be adopted to reduce SOC loss.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity-friendly farming practices may create a win-win scenario
   for biodiversity and crop production by supporting ecosystem services to
   agriculture. On-farm wildflower plantings and conserving semi-natural
   habitat surrounding farms are two such practices that focus on the
   integration of non-crop components into production systems at the local
   and landscape scale, respectively. Here, we examine the impact of these
   practices on the regulating services of biological control and
   pollination, as well as the provisioning service of crop yield in four
   crops replicated across 22 farms in two US states. Wildflower plantings
   had no effect on pollination while their influence on pest control was
   both dependent on the landscape context and inconsistent across crops.
   In contrast, farms surrounded by higher amounts of semi-natural habitat
   had consistently higher marketable yields for all four crops. Our
   findings suggest a need to account for non-production values of
   wildflower plantings as they provide fewer direct production benefits
   than surrounding semi-natural habitats.},

Title = {Assessing carbon greenhouse gas emissions from aquaculture in China

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food production sectors in the
   world, but many of the small-hold operations are poorly assessed for
   their climate impact. We analyzed the literature data on CO2 and CH4
   fluxes from various aquaculture systems in China. The mean fluxes varied
   in the ranges of 382.45-551.88 g CO2-C m (2) yr (1) and 0.03-565.09 g
   CH4-C m (2) yr (1). Aquaculture system reclaimed from mudflat had the
   highest CH4 emission (54.92 +/- 21.00 g C m (2) yr (1)) but lowest CO2
   emission. Shrimp aquaculture and semiintensive farming tended to yield
   higher CH4 emission. Small and shallow systems had significantly higher
   CO2 and CH4 emissions, with chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen
   concentrations as the main environmental drivers. Management practice
   such as drainage, exposure and desilting during the non-farming period
   significantly decreased CH4 emission. We estimated that aquaculture
   systems in China emitted 181.66 Tg CO2-eq yr (1), offsetting similar to
   7\% of the national terrestrial carbon sink, with most of the emission
   concentrated in coastal provinces and along the major rivers in the
   southeastern quadrant. This study highlights the importance of
   accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from aquaculture to improve the
   accuracy of the regional and national carbon budgets.},

Title = {Long-term tillage, residue management and crop rotation impacts on N2O
   and CH4 emissions from two contrasting soils in sub-humid Zimbabwe},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {341},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The respective contribution of conservation agriculture (CA) principles
   (no-tillage, permanent soil cover/mulch and crop rotations) on
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is still unclear. This study was
   conducted at two long-term experimental sites established in 2013 in
   Zimbabwe, on an abruptic Lixisol at Domboshava Training Center (DTC) and
   on a xanthic Ferralsol at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (UZF). The
   purpose of the study was to unravel the individual and combined effects
   of tillage, mulching and rotation on N2O and CH4 emissions in low
   nitrogen (N) input maize-based cropping systems (< 60 kg N ha -1) and to
   compare emissions within maize rows and between maize rows. We
   hypothesised that integrating no tillage, mulch and cereal-legume
   rotation would enhance N2O emissions. Six treatments, replicated four
   times were investigated: conventional tillage, conven-tional tillage
   with rotation, no-tillage, no-tillage with mulch, no-tillage with
   rotation, no-tillage with mulch and rotation. The main crop was maize
   (Zea mays L.) and treatments with rotation included cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculate L. Walp.). Gas samples were regularly collected using the
   static chamber method in the maize row and inter-row spaces during the
   2019/20 and 2020/21 cropping seasons and during the 2020/21 dry season.
   Soil moisture and mineral N were measured in the 0-20 cm soil depth. In
   2019/20, cumulative total N2O emissions were signif-icantly higher in
   mulch treatments at DTC, while at UZF N2O emissions were higher with
   cowpea rotation. Cumulative total N2O emissions ranged from 215 to 496 g
   N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and from 226 to 395 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr -1, at DTC and
   UZF, respectively. In 2020/21, N2O emissions were much lower and no
   differences were found between treatments on both sites (145 to 179 g
   N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 and 83 to 136 g N2O-N ha- 1 yr- 1 at DTC and UZF,
   respectively). A significant relationship was found between soil nitrate
   and daily N2O emissions. At UZF, highest N2O emissions were observed at
   a water-filled pore space of 60-70\%. There were no significant
   differ-ences in yield-scaled N2O emissions between treatments at both
   sites for the two seasons. DTC was a net source of CH4 (694 g CH4-C ha-
   1 yr- 1 on average), while UZF was a net sink of CH4 (-494 g CH4-C ha- 1
   yr- 1 on average). No evidence was found for in situ CH4 production at
   DTC, and an external source is most likely. Our study in-dicates that
   for low N input cropping systems in the sub-humid tropics, N loss
   through N2O is low.},

Title = {Global meta-analysis of nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency in rice,
   wheat and maize},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {338},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Almost half of global nitrogen (N) fertilizer is applied to rice, wheat
   and maize, but a large proportion is not directly taken up causing
   detrimental effects on the environment. To understand how fertilizer
   management, climate and soil factors influence N fertilizer use
   efficiency (REN) in these three crops, we conducted a meta -analysis
   with 3586 observations from 261 peer-reviewed papers. Across all
   observations, the average REN was (39 \% (95 \% confidence intervals
   38-40 \%) and varied with crop type. Modelled REN was higher for rice
   (42 \%, 95 \% CIs 39-45 \%) and wheat (42 \%, 95 \% CIs 40-45 \%) than
   for maize (36 \%, 95 \% CIs 34-39 \%). Fertilizer type and frequency
   were important factors influencing REN with generally low values for
   organic fertilizer and single applications. REN significantly increased
   with increasing growing season temperature for rice and wheat, but it
   decreased for maize, possibly due to crop differences in plant N demand
   and uptake responses to temperature. Soil factors such as organic carbon
   (SOC) content, pH and clay content also showed important effects on REN,
   but this depended on crop type. For instance, an increase in SOC content
   resulted in a decrease in REN for wheat, but an increase for maize. On
   the other hand, REN decreased with increasing soil clay content for all
   three crops. We observed that a doubling of the global average of the
   REN (or roughly 80 \%) can be achieved under a wide range of N
   fertilizer application rates (20-300 kg ha-1) and there are therefore
   opportunities to improve REN through fertilizer management when adjusted
   to the right environmental and soil conditions for each specific crop.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of evolutionary diversity in Cactaceae show low
   ecological representation within protected areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mapping biodiversity patterns across taxa and environments is crucial to
   address the evolutionary and ecological dimensions of species
   distribution, suggesting areas of particular importance for conservation
   purposes. Within Cactaceae, spatial diversity patterns are poorly
   explored, as are the abiotic factors that may predict these patterns. We
   gathered geographic and genetic data from 921 cactus species by
   exploring both the occurrence and genetic databases, which are tightly
   associated with drylands, to evaluate diversity patterns, such as
   phylogenetic diversity and endemism, paleo-, neo-, and superendemism,
   and the environmental predictor variables of such patterns in a global
   analysis. Hotspot areas of cacti diversity are scattered along the
   Neotropical and Nearctic regions, mainly in the desertic portion of
   Mesoamerica, Caribbean Island, and the dry diagonal of South America.
   The geomorphological features of these regions may create a complexity
   of areas that work as locally buffered zones over time, which triggers
   local events of diversification and speciation. Desert and dryland/dry
   forest areas comprise paleo- and superendemism and may act as both
   museums and cradles of species, displaying great importance for
   conservation. Past climates, topography, soil features, and solar
   irradiance seem to be the main predictors of distinct endemism types.
   The hotspot areas that encompass a major part of the endemism cells are
   outside or poorly covered by formal protection units. The current
   legally protected areas are not able to conserve the evolutionary
   diversity of cacti. Given the rapid anthropogenic disturbance, efforts
   must be reinforced to monitor biodiversity and the environment and to
   define/plan current and new protected areas.},

Title = {Establishing new populations in water-secure locations may benefit
   species persistence more than interventions in water-stressed locations},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The effects of climate and land-use change, coupled with limited
   management resources, mean that managers are increasingly faced with
   decisions to invest in some locations at the expense of others. Given
   their potentially controversial nature, such decisions require
   predictions of likely outcomes under different management strate-gies
   and potential future climates. We develop an approach to prioritise
   management interventions across multiple locations in highly variable
   and uncertain environments, using a stochastic model of population
   dy-namics structured to include the (dynamic) effects of environmental
   conditions on key vital rates. We demon-strate this approach with a case
   study on the endangered Australian freshwater fish, the Macquarie perch
   (Macquaria australasica), assessing the effectiveness of seven
   management interventions under five scenarios of deterministic climate
   change. All management interventions were predicted to improve Macquarie
   perch pop-ulation outcomes (increased abundances, reduced risk of
   quasi-extinction), with the risk of declines lowest when management
   included augmented gene flow and enforcement of fishing regulations. The
   lowest levels of risk occurred in locations with stable environmental
   conditions, which suggests that reintroducing Macquarie perch to large,
   regulated rivers with suitable access to spawning habitat may be more
   beneficial than investment in small, unregulated streams where
   populations were unlikely to persist under any scenario. Population
   reintro-ductions provide opportunities to shift populations from
   water-stressed to water-secure locations where required (e.g. to
   preserve unique genetic diversity). This finding likely applies to many
   aquatic species, and highlights a potential need to supplement threat
   mitigation in water-stressed locations with efforts to establish new
   pop-ulations in water-secure locations.},

Title = {The effect of mining and road development on habitat fragmentation and
   connectivity of khulan (Equus hemionus) in Northwestern China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Habitat use by wild animals may be subject to spatial and temporal
   changes. The Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate Nature Reserve (KNR), inhabited
   by >80 \% of Chinese khulan (Equus hemionus), is one of the most
   important desert ungulate reserves in Northwestern China. However,
   frequent human disturbance caused by mining development and road
   construction in KNR has interfered with or completely blocked their
   movement and access to parts of the reserve. In our study, we assessed
   the distribution of suitable habitat and ecological corridors of khulan
   before the mining development (2005), at the peak of mining development
   (2011), and after ecological restoration and expressway construction
   (2019). The results showed that most of the core habitat and ecological
   corridors of khulan were concentrated in the middle of the reserve and
   on the east side of the road. The habitat of khulan in KNR went from a
   good natural habitat in 2005 to deterioration due to mining development
   in 2011. Then it partially recovered due to ecological restoration from
   2015 onwards. However, in 2019, road con-struction likely hindered its
   recovery to pre-mining levels. The location of corridors accordingly
   varied with the change of core habitat in different years. Nevertheless,
   the corridors intersecting roads generally had higher centrality values,
   indicating their higher importance. Our study revealed the significant
   impacts that mining development and road construction have had on the
   distribution of core habitats, ecological corridors, and movement of
   khulan. These results provide a scientific basis and valuable arguments
   for strengthening habitat connectivity for khulan.},

Title = {Past and present effects of habitat amount and fragmentation per se on
   plant species richness, composition and traits in a deforestation
   hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Worldwide, human activities are rapidly changing land cover and its
   spatial configuration. While it is widely acknowledged that habitat loss
   is a major cause of biodiversity loss, there is less agreement on how
   biodiversity responds to changes in habitat configuration. We assessed
   the effects of forest amount and forest fragmentation per se (the number
   of patches for a given forest amount, an aspect of configuration) on
   woody species richness, composition, and traits in the Dry Chaco forest,
   a global deforestation hotspot. We sampled woody plants in 24 forest
   sites varying in forest amount and fragmentation per se in the
   surrounding landscapes. Using Generalized Linear Modeling we tested
   whether a model with just forest amount was at least as able to predict
   species richness as a model with either patch size or isolation or the
   combination of both. We also tested whether forest amount and
   fragmentation per se influenced species richness, composition, and the
   density of four species traits. Finally, we compared these responses to
   forest amount and fragmentation per se measured in the past (2009) vs.
   in the present (2017) to look for time-lagged responses. We found that:
   1) in support of the habitat amount hypothesis, species richness was
   more strongly related to forest amount than to the size and/or isolation
   of the forest patch containing the sample plot; 2) the positive effect
   of forest amount on species richness was more important than the effect
   of fragmentation per se (also positive); 3) fragmentation per se changed
   species composition such that plots in landscapes with more fragmented
   forest had species with smaller leaves and seeds, and higher wood
   density; and 4) species richness showed a time-lagged response to forest
   amount but not to forest fragmentation per se. Our results suggest that
   preservation of native Dry Chaco forest should be prioritized regardless
   of its fragmentation level, for conserving woody plant species
   diversity.},

Title = {Wildlife migrations highlight importance of both private lands and
   protected areas in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Formally protected areas are an important component of wildlife
   conservation, but face limitations in their effectiveness for migratory
   species. Improved stewardship of working lands around protected areas is
   one so-lution for conservation planning, but private working lands are
   vulnerable to development. In the Greater Yel-lowstone Ecosystem (GYE),
   ungulates such as elk (Cervus canadensis) use both protected areas and
   private lands throughout their annual migrations. We studied patterns of
   landownership, protection, and conservation chal-lenges within the
   ranges of migratory elk in the GYE. We used GPS data from 1088 elk in 26
   herds to define herd -level seasonal ranges, and extracted covariates
   related to landownership and protection, land use, and human
   infrastructure and development. All elk herds used land encompassing >1
   ownership type. Most elk herds (92.3 \% of herds, n = 24) used the
   highest proportion of private land in the winter (mean = 36.2 \% private
   land). Most elk herds' winter ranges contained the highest building
   densities (mean = 1.24 buildings/km2), fence densities (mean = 1.02 km
   fence/km2), and cattle grazing (mean = 1.9 cows/km2), compared to
   migratory and summer ranges. Out of all ranges, 36.5 \% of ranges did
   not have any zoning regulations, indicating the potential for future
   development. Our results show that elk in the GYE rely on habitat
   outside of protected areas, and face landscape -scale conservation
   challenges such as habitat fragmentation from human development,
   particularly in winter ranges. Future conservation strategies for
   wildlife in this system need to encompass coordination across both
   public and private land to ensure migratory connectivity.},

Title = {Expanding the biocultural benefits of species distribution modelling
   with Indigenous collaborators: Case study from northern Australia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urgent calls for biocultural conservation highlight the need to engage
   with Indigenous peoples, whose lands cover some of the most biodiverse
   regions on Earth. In these places, Indigenous knowledge can be strong,
   especially for culturally significant species; however, this knowledge
   tends to be overlooked and deemed incompatible with dominant Western
   systems of conservation decision-making. The practical mechanics of how
   Indigenous and Western knowledge systems can be respectfully synergized
   to inform species conservation decision-making on a regional scale are
   not well documented. In collaboration with Yolqu Indigenous rangers from
   northern Australia, we used a `multiple evidence based' approach to
   synergize knowledge from senior Yolqu custodians with Western scientific
   species distribution modelling (SDM) to explore distribution shifts and
   bio-cultural knowledge of two culturally significant, near threatened
   (critical weight range) mammals: wan'kurra, (Northern Brown Bandicoot,
   Isoodon macrourus) and marrLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu/rupu (Common
   Brushtail Possum, Trichosurus vul-pecula). Historical Yolqu species
   sightings and seasonal observations and the SDM revealed spatial
   contractions of both species to the northern and mesic regions of the
   Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area over the last 50 years. Knowledge
   custodians were concerned about the loss of these species and associated
   cultural knowledge in younger generations. Such cross-cultural knowledge
   gathering can guide biocultural conservation decision -making and
   facilitate intergenerational knowledge transmission of threatened
   cultural knowledge. This approach to collaborative cross-cultural fauna
   research can be applied globally, and we argue is imperative in contexts
   where: species and cultures are under threat, and where Indigenous
   knowledge and peoples can provide insight to inform inclusive
   biocultural conservation strategies.},

Title = {Environmental DNA as a management tool for tracking artificial waterhole
   use in savanna ecosystems},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Game parks are the last preserve of many large mammals, and in savanna
   ecosystems, management of surface waters poses a conservation challenge.
   In arid and semi-arid regions, water can be a scarce resource during dry
   seasons and drought. Artificial waterholes are common in parks and
   reserves across Africa, but can alter mammal community composition by
   favoring drought intolerant species, with consequences for disease
   dynamics, and population viability of drought-tolerant species. Analysis
   of waterborne environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to inform
   conservation of rare and invasive species, and conduct large-scale
   biodiversity assessments. To explore the reliability of eDNA as an
   indicator of mammal waterhole use in savannas, we compare eDNA
   metabarcoding and camera traps for documenting artificial waterhole use
   in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, a global hotspot for mammal
   diversity. We show that eDNA metabarcoding can recover the majority of
   mammal species detected by camera traps, including a number of
   endangered species, but DNA signatures of mammal visitation are
   temporally limited, with best performance when tracking water-dependent
   large bodied mammals visiting within two days of sampling. Our results
   highlight limitation of eDNA based monitoring in these systems,
   including the lack of long-term eDNA persistence in small and highly
   utilized waterholes, and variability in detection rates among species.
   However, we demonstrate that eDNA-based approaches can be used to track
   mammals of conservation concern, and reflect patterns of recent
   waterhole use and co-occurrence across water-dependent species, both of
   which are crucial for making evidence-based decisions regarding water
   management and provisioning.},

Title = {The decline of large carnivores in Africa and opportunities for change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large carnivore populations are in decline across the globe due to the
   destruction of their natural habitat and targeted persecution by the
   human species. Africa is home to one of the last remaining intact guilds
   of terrestrial mega-carnivore taxa and includes species that occupy a
   unique role in ecosystem function and in human evolutionary history. The
   rapid disappearance of large carnivores from the African landscape is
   therefore particularly alarming and several species are predicted to
   soon be extirpated outside of protected areas. Developing solutions
   addressing the drivers of decline are complex due to Africa's rapid
   human population growth and land use patterns, cultural and traditional
   values among rural communities, and regulations gov-erning lethal
   control programs and the trophy hunting industry. There is also a
   critical need to consider the intrinsic value of the carnivore guild in
   the discourse as having a value beyond that which benefits humans.
   Lessons can be learned from a few programs that combine good governance
   and regulation, effective law enforcement, strong community
   participation and sustainable funding mechanisms to conserve carnivores
   at landscape scales. Integrating these criteria into a workable model
   and employing an evidence-based and adaptive approach is central to
   implementing long-term solutions for carnivore-human coexistence. Africa
   can become a global leader in the conservation of biodiversity by
   demonstrating resilience, collaboration and ingenuity to reverse the
   current trend, and restore and protect these charismatic carnivore
   species for the benefit of the planet as a whole.},

Title = {Identifying long-term stable refugia for dominant Castanopsis species of
   evergreen broad-leaved forests in East Asia: A tool for ensuring their
   conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Identifying and protecting refugia is a priority for conservation
   management under projected anthropogenic climate change. We have two
   main objectives: the first is to explore the spatial (East Asia) and
   temporal (Last Glacial Maximum to year 2070) distribution patterns of
   dominant Castanopsis species of evergreen broad-leaved forests, also the
   relation with their niche breadths; the second is to identify long-term
   stable refugia for preserving these species and provide a framework of
   conservation strategies. We find that there is an extraordinary richness
   with 32 dominant Castanopsis species, and they form both a
   geographically and climatically almost unbroken connection from ca. 5
   degrees N to 38 degrees N, having thus ecological significance. During
   the Mid-Holocene and, particularly, the Last Glacial Maximum, the
   predicted suitable areas of the species as a whole were larger than
   those in the present. By 2070, potentially suitable areas with high
   richness of dominant Castanopsis species will be reduced by 94.5 \% on
   average. No correlation between species niche breadths and distribution
   ranges is found, which could be due to regional climate stability.
   Mountains of southwestern and southern Yunnan in China are identified as
   climatically long-term stable refugia for 7-9 Castanopsis species. We
   recommend that these refugia have the highest priority of conservation
   to prevent their extinction. Our suggested urgent measures include
   improving the effectiveness of currently protected Castanopsis species
   and expanding the network of protected areas to cover a larger fraction
   of the refugia, as well as ensuring Castanopsis species natural
   regeneration potential in fragmented and natural secondary forest areas.},

Title = {Biological, structural and functional responses of tropical forests to
   environmental factors},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As compared to temperate and boreal forests, the majority of tropical
   forests are biodiverse, structurally-complex and high-functioning
   ecosystems, yet their potential attributes are vulnerable to
   anthropogenic disturbances and environmental factors. Here, we
   hypothesize that the biological, structural and functional attributes of
   tropical forests respond to water-related climatic and soil
   nutrient-related factors. Thus, we quantified 27 forest attributes and
   20 environmental factors across 189 plots of Sri Lankan tropical
   forests. Our results suggest that environ-mental conditions were
   characterized by both water-related and temperature-related factors, and
   as such, both coarse-textured and compacted-structured soils determined
   soil conditions. Forest conditions were characterized by high
   species-functional diversity, structural complexity and aboveground
   biomass-related functions. We found strong positive effects of
   water-related climatic factors (particularly mean annual precipitation)
   followed by temperature-related climatic factors (i.e., growing degree
   days) but negligible positive to negative effects of textured-related
   (i.e., gravel contents) and nutrient-related (i.e., bulk density) soil
   factors on most of the bio-logical, structural and functional
   attributes. Overall the biodiversity and carbon stocks of Sri Lankan
   tropical forests are likely to increase with water-energy balance and
   improved soil conditions, and thus, studied forests could offset a
   substantial quantity of anthropogenic carbon emissions to achieve carbon
   neutrality which can have both regional and global significance if
   protected from anthropogenic disturbances. Broadly, this study suggests
   that conservation practices should consider multiple environmental and
   biotic attributes of the tropical forests during forest management which
   can have a win-win situation for biodiversity conservation and climate
   change mitigation.},

Title = {Considering behavioral state when predicting habitat use:
   Behavior-specific spatial models for the endangered Tasmanian
   wedge-tailed eagle},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Effective planning for species conservation often requires an
   understanding of habitat use. The resources an animal selects within the
   landscape relate to its behavioral state and, therefore, incorporating
   behavior into habitat selection analyses can help inform management of
   threatened species. Here we present an approach for developing
   behavior-specific spatial habitat-use models using large quantities of
   GPS telemetry data. Using hidden Markov models, we first characterize
   231,478 GPS fixes from 22 recently fledged endangered Tasmanian
   wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax fleayi) as reflective of either
   perching, short-distance flight, or long-distance flight. We then use a
   multivariate habitat selection ratio to develop spatial models
   predicting where these behavioral states occur. Recently fledged
   Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles selected for areas close to forest edges
   during perching and short distance flights, whereas they selected more
   strongly for areas with steep topography (slopes > 15 degrees) and
   further from forest edges for longer flights. Models using distance to
   forest edge and topo-graphic slope effectively predicted where eagles
   engaged in long flights (R2 > 0.91, rs > 0.90) in each of six regions,
   whereas the performance varied by region for models describing perching
   (R2 = 0.43-0.97, rs = 0.80-0.97) and short flights (R2 = 0.34-0.93, rs =
   0.63-1.00). Our study provides a detailed understanding of habitat use
   by young Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, which has multiple applications
   in the ongoing conser-vation of the population. Our method illustrates a
   framework for spatially explicit and behavior-specific habitat selection
   analyses that can be applied to other species of conservation concern.},

Title = {Drowning in data, thirsty for information and starved for understanding:
   A biodiversity information hub for cooperative environmental monitoring
   in South Africa},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The world is firmly cemented in a notitian age (Latin: notitia, meaning
   data) - drowning in data, yet thirsty for information and the synthesis
   of knowledge into understanding. As concerns over biodiversity declines
   escalate, the volume, diversity and speed at which new environmental and
   ecological data are generated has increased exponentially. Data
   availability primes the research and discovery engine driving
   biodiversity conservation. South Africa (SA) is poised to become a world
   leader in biodiversity conservation. However, continent-wide resource
   limitations hamper the establishment of inclusive technologies and
   robust platforms and tools for biodiversity informatics. In this
   perspectives piece, we bring together the opinions of 37 co-authors from
   20 different departments, across 10 SA universities, 7 national and
   provincial conservation research agencies, and various institutes and
   private conservation, research and management bodies, to develop a way
   forward for biodiversity informatics in SA. We propose the development
   of a SA Biodiversity Informatics Hub and describe the essential
   components necessary for its design, implementation and sustainability.
   We emphasise the importance of developing a culture of cooperation,
   collaboration and interoperability among custodians of biodiversity data
   to establish operational workflows for data synthesis. However, our
   biggest challenges are misgivings around data sharing and
   multidisciplinary collaboration. We recommend a system that is free,
   user friendly, functional, stable, integrative and designed to cater for
   different data access agreement levels. Sharing data through this
   pipeline will directly advance the science and practice of conservation,
   giving multiple stakeholders and decision-makers access to valuable
   biodiversity data to support research and biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Rural livelihoods, community-based conservation, and human-wildlife
   conflict: Scope for synergies?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Halting biodiversity loss is a major contemporary challenge. Nature
   protection can help conserve biodiversity, but increasing wildlife
   numbers inside protected areas and shrinking habitats intensify
   interactions between humans and wildlife, potentially causing
   human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Contemporary narratives of HWC highlight
   detrimental effects on households' socioeconomic outcomes. Despite a
   wealth of literature on HWC, many studies remain descriptive and little
   inferential evidence has been provided. Here we identify the
   determinants and effects of reported HWC on household outcomes using
   spatial predictors and an original farm-household dataset collected in
   Namibia's share of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.
   In addition to dependence on agriculture, we find that community-based
   conservation, the share of a community's area set aside for
   conservation, and habitat connectivity are key drivers of HWC. Contrary
   to contemporary narratives of HWC, we find that reported conflicts did
   not have strong negative effects on household income and livelihood
   diversity. Conversely, community-based wildlife conservation increases
   income and livelihood diversity among participating households. It is,
   however, also associated with food insecurity concerns. Such concerns
   may be driven by comparatively higher restrictions related to land use
   planning and zoning that constrain productive land uses, such as
   agriculture. Our findings suggest that community-based conservation can
   create development synergies for households in favorable environments,
   despite increasing HWC risks. However, potential trade-offs including
   non-material costs warrant further research.},

Title = {Prohibiting spearfishing boosts conservation outcomes for partially
   protected areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Partially Protected Areas (PPAs) are a ubiquitous management tool, yet
   their ecological effects are often poorly understood. Here, we compare
   conservation outcomes for two different kinds of PPAs (allowing limited
   line fishing, but with or without spearfishing) on sheltered and exposed
   sides of coral reefs of the southern Great Barrier Reef. Compared with
   No-Take Marine Reserves (NTMRs), Conservation Park Zones (CPZs;
   spearfishing allowed), had lower biomass and density of primary
   fisheries targets. Conversely, Special Management Areas (SMAs;
   spearfishing prohibited) had similar biomass and density of primary
   targets to NTMRs, and had greater densities of coral trout (a key
   fishing target), compared to CPZs. No zoning patterns occurred for
   non-target species. Both PPA zones supported greater biomass of targets
   compared to less regulated Habitat Protection Zones, which have more
   allowable fishing activities. These results indicate that partial
   protection measures limiting fishing activities can create conservation
   outcomes for targeted fishes. In particular, we provide evidence to
   support the premise that prohibition of spearfishing can significantly
   boost conservation outcomes for PPAs. Zoning outcomes did not differ
   between exposed and sheltered sides of reefs, despite exposed sites
   consistently supporting a greater biomass and density of fishes. The
   success of PPAs, and in particular SMAs, in the region is likely due to
   a combination of factors including: strong enforcement and subsequent
   compliance of fishing restrictions, the presence of adjacent effective
   NTMRs, and a long duration of protection. Our results highlight the
   valuable contributions that PPAs can make to conservation outcomes in
   well managed MPAs.},

Title = {Importance of grassy and forest non-crop habitat islands for
   overwintering of ground-dwelling arthropods in agricultural landscapes:
   A multi-taxa approach},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Non-crop habitats are supposed to provide valuable resources to
   beneficial arthropods inhabiting agricultural landscapes during both the
   growing and winter seasons. Unfortunately, studies focused on the
   performance of non-crop habitats during the winter period are much less
   abundant, despite their importance for efficient biodiversity
   conservation measures. In this study, we assessed the distribution of
   ground-dwelling arthropods overwintering on arable land as well as the
   boundaries and interiors of neighbouring grassy and forest non-crop
   habitat islands. Myriapods, spiders, carabid and rove beetles were
   collected using a combination of quadrat sampling (soil sampling) and
   pitfall trapping. Our results revealed the importance of both non-crop
   habitat islands for overwintering arthropods, though slightly higher
   abundance and species richness were recorded in forest compared to
   grassy islands. Abundance and species richness of overwintering
   arthropods were lower on arable land for all the investigated taxa.
   Carabid and rove beetles overwintered more on non-crop boundaries than
   interiors, whereas spiders and myriapods used both boundaries and
   interiors. Landscape composition had stronger effects on carabids and
   myriapods collected with pitfall traps, which were benefitted in
   landscapes with high non-crop habitat cover. Grassy and forest non-crop
   habitat islands hosted different assemblages of myriapods, carabids and
   rove beetles, highlighting the complementarity of both non-crop habitat
   types for grounddwelling arthropods. We recommend to preserve all
   existing non-crop habitat patches and to create new permanent non-crop
   habitat patches in intensively managed agricultural landscapes, as even
   relatively small noncrop habitat islands within the cultivated land can
   play a relevant role for overwintering arthropods.},

Title = {Biodiversity data synthesis is critical for realizing a functional

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework currently is under
   development as part of the Convention of Biodiversity's aim to prevent
   global biodiversity losses by 2050, but targets can only be effectively
   developed and assessed if the data used for them are fit for purpose.
   The monitoring framework has been discussed at length and ensuring
   appropriate data use is critical to target effectiveness, enabling the
   monitoring of global biodiversity trends and assessment of target
   success. We outline a vision for how conservation data resources can be
   improved via automation and other routes to greatly enhance both ease of
   use and effectiveness for conservation. Synthesis across different types
   of data is urgently needed and could be enabled by a unified data system
   and automated workflows for cross-validation between data types, with
   downstream products such as grades for expert range maps that reflect
   their underlying bases and data quality and reliability to determine
   their fit for analysis, as well as automated preliminary IUCN
   assessments to expedite conservation. Capacity building and
   collaboration rooted in international agreements will be necessary for
   these initiatives to effectively function globally to enable new global
   targets to be achieved for effective conservation and targeted resource
   mobilization at all scales.},

Title = {The fate of giant panda and its sympatric mammals under future climate
   change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Assessing the vulnerability of biodiversity under global climate change
   is one of the major tasks in ecology and conservation biology. Although
   species' vulnerability to climate change depends on habitat exposure,
   species sensitivity and adaptability, multifaceted studies on the
   impacts of climate change on biodiversity are still lacking. The aim of
   this study was to fill this gap by assessing the vulnerability of giant
   panda with its sympatric mammal species in Sichuan province of China,
   through the climate niche factor analysis. We found that species
   sensitivity plays a greater role than habitat exposure in determining
   the vulnerability of these species under future climate change, which
   doesn't closely match their current conservation status. Besides, these
   mammals were predicted to be more vulnerable at lower altitudes or
   latitudes. In particular, Daxiangling and Liangshan mountains emerge as
   the most vulnerable places to climate change. The conservation gap
   analysis demonstrated that the current protected area network covers no
   more than 5 \% of the most vulnerable areas. Together, these results
   highlight the importance of using multifaceted analyses by integrating
   species sensitivity and habitat exposure to assess climate-related risks
   to better inform biodiversity conservation and management.},

Title = {What influences spatial variability in restoration costs? Econometric
   cost models for inference and prediction in restoration planning},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Habitat restoration efforts are often conducted under limited budgets
   and information. Explicitly incorporating data on project costs can
   improve the effectiveness of restoration investments but gathering
   precise data for future projects is often infeasible at the planning
   stage. We demonstrate econometric and machine learning methods for
   improving the accessibility of cost information for restoration
   planning. Using geospatial matching methods, we combine 15 years of
   spatially explicit project records for over 1200 culvert fish passage
   barrier restoration worksites across the Pacific Northwest of the United
   States with data layers of hypothesized drivers of construction costs.
   We distinguish between two objectives in analyzing cost data: inference
   to identify cost drivers and prediction of future project costs. For
   inference, we multiple linear regression and find that the variables
   channel bankfull width and slope, road speed class, developed and
   agricultural land covers, and proximity to privately managed industrial
   land are associated with culvert restoration costs and may serve as
   strong proxies in a planning setting. For prediction, we use boosted
   regression trees to make out-of-sample projections of restoration costs
   for over 27,000 barrier culverts documented in state inventories. The
   distribution of these cost projections over space and across
   jurisdictions reveal higher, and more heterogeneous, culvert restoration
   costs in the Puget Sound region than in other nearby areas. Our results
   are directly applicable for resource managers making fish passage
   restoration decisions and serve as a template for the use of
   econometrics and machine learning to analyze costs recorded in
   restoration project databases in other contexts.},

Title = {When money meets tradition: How new cash incomes could be risky for a
   vulnerable ecosystem},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Economic incentives to simultaneously address poverty and biodiversity
   loss may fail if they do not align with local values or norms. Grazing
   livestock across the Tibetan Plateau's vast but fragile grasslands is
   often characterized as the area's primary driver of habitat degradation.
   China's grassland restoration policy provides ecocompensation subsidies
   for herders, with the assumption that providing extra cash income will
   help alleviating grazing pressure. We investigated potential impacts of
   this supplementary income, in combination with caterpillar fungus, a
   major local cash income source, on the pastoral livelihood on the
   Tibetan Plateau. Through field livestock census in seven communities and
   household livelihood interviews with 153 households we found that at
   both household and valley levels, eco-compensation didn't have the
   intended effect of reducing grazing pressure, while caterpillar fungus
   income has significant positive relationships on grazing intensity.
   Meanwhile, we found significant decrease of above-ground plant biomass
   after policy implementation was linked with lowelevation pastures with
   most intensive grazing, which indicated a negative impact of grazing on
   grassland condition at our study sites. Further, based on herdsmen's
   perceptions on different cash income sources we suspected those
   non-pastoral incomes might have even subsidized pastoralism. We
   suggested future economic incentives related to grassland restoration
   should be more targeted towards villages with low cash income and
   overgrazed grasslands, with clearly stated responsibilities and
   obligations, instead of standardized cash payment.},

Title = {Conserving karst cavefish diversity in Southwest China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Subterranean aquatic biodiversity loss has exceeded that of surface
   aquatic systems, and cavefish are a predominant indicator of
   biodiversity loss. The karst subsurface environment and its biodiversity
   are generally considered to be fragile and extremely sensitive to
   environmental disturbances such as hydroelectric projects. Subterranean
   biodiversity is faced with several threats, such as: hydrostation
   mining, domestic wastewater etc., and protecting and managing these
   unique and endemic species presents several challenges of wild
   population survive and monitoring population dynamic. The impact of
   infrastructure policies on cavefish species in China is used as an
   example to analyse the current and potential threats to cavefish species
   and karst subterranean habitats in China. Any strategy employed to
   conserve cavefish in China should include strengthening research on
   cavefish, including formal descriptions of taxa and listing these
   species on the IUCN Red List, as well as national and local lists of
   species for conservation. Such knowledge can be used to establish a
   conservation strategy for cavefish and subsurface biodiversity.},

Title = {Strong phenological shifts among bumblebee species in North America can
   help predict extinction risk},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biological responses to climate change can affect species' survival
   prospects, and failures to track favourable climate conditions can
   increase extinction risk. Two predominant strategies to mitigate climate
   change are spatial and temporal shifts, however the trade-offs between
   these responses for vital pollinator taxa are unknown. Also, the
   phylogenetic pattern of climate-driven phenology shifts is poorly
   understood. Here, we analyze emergence and peak phenology for 20 Bombus
   species across Canada and the United States during baseline (1954-1970)
   and modern (2004-2012) periods to assess whether Bombus phenology varies
   with spring onset. We find that bumblebee species which maintain
   phenological synchrony with spring onset demonstrated an improved
   persistence probability during the modern period compared to the
   baseline. Climate strongly explained variation in emergence and/or peak
   colony abundance phenology in 15 of 21 species included in the study.
   Phenology shifts were not found to be phylogenetically structured. This
   approach serves as a guide to analyzing spatio-temporal responses to
   climate change on a large scale across taxa.},

Title = {Cannabis de-domestication and invasion risk},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Cultivated plants provide food, fiber, and energy but they can escape,
   de-domesticate, colonize agroecosystems as weeds, and disrupt natural
   ecosystems as invasive species. Escape and invasion depend on traits of
   the species, type and rate of domestication, and cultivation context.
   Understanding this ``de-domestication invasion process `` is critical
   for managing conservation efforts to reduce unintended consequences of
   cultivated species in novel areas. Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) is an
   ideal case study to explore this process because it was one of the
   earliest plants to co-evolve with humans, has a crop to weed history,
   and has been introduced and cultivated globally. Moreover, recent
   liberalization of cannabis cultivation and use policies have raised
   concerns about invasion risk. Here, we synthesize knowledge on cannabis
   breeding, cultivation, and processing relevant to invasion risk and
   outline research and management priorities to help overcome the research
   deficit on the invasion ecology of the species. Understanding the
   transition of cannabis through the de-domestication-invasion process
   will inform policy and minimize agricultural and environmental risks
   associated with cultivation of domesticated species.},

Title = {Habitat amount is a driver for biodiversity, but not for the carbon
   stock in post-logging natural regenerating areas in Tropical Atlantic
   Forest},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Natural regeneration has been considered an important strategy for
   improving large-scale forest restoration to revert the losses resulting
   from the fragmentation of tropical landscapes in recent years. However,
   local, regional, and spatial factors can influence the dynamics of
   regeneration, thereby affecting its efficiency. We investigated how time
   after disturbance, landscape characteristics, and climate gradients
   affect the efficiency of natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest. We searched for studies that addressed the post-logging
   regenerating of forests throughout the biome. For each included study,
   we extracted the forest age, species richness, and basal area (used as
   an estimate of carbon). Additionally, for each studied site (total 100
   sites) we used land use maps to extract the landscape metrics and
   obtained bioclimatic variables from the global dataset. Further, we used
   forest age, landscape metrics, and bioclimatic variables to build models
   and predict forest species richness and carbon stock. Our results showed
   that species richness was positively affected by habitat amount
   (evaluated through patch area and perimeter-area ratio), isothermality,
   and forest age. Carbon stock was positively affected only by the forest
   age. These findings show that natural regeneration will yield the best
   results in terms of conserving the biodiversity among landscapes with a
   large number of habitats. Conversely, a landscape with a predominance of
   mature forest will be more efficient as carbon stock. We conclude that,
   when planning the restoration of large-scale landscapes, natural
   regeneration must be considered along with other strategies to ensure
   that multiple objectives are achieved.},

Title = {Scientists' warning of an imperiled ocean},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In 2017, more than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries signed a second
   warning letter to humanity to caution against our continued wholesale
   destruction of global ecosystems (Ripple et al., 2017). Here, we
   reaffirm their message with a similar warning specifically focused on
   the ocean: humanity must immediately and significantly alter our harmful
   trajectory in order to avoid irrevocably damaging our oceans in multiple
   ways that will further affect ocean health for both us and future
   generations. The ocean is the world's largest realm, housing an
   astonishing array of biodiversity that provides critical ecological
   functions that ultimately support life on Earth. In this paper, we
   outline some of the significant ongoing and imminent activities that
   degrade ocean health, including destructive fishing practices, oil and
   natural gas extraction, seabed mining, coastal development, shipping,
   pollution, and greenhouse-gas emissions. We end by offering potential
   avenues to mitigate these impacts, including the cessation of
   particularly harmful activities, restoration of damaged habitats, strong
   protection of key and representative ecosystems, reduction in waste and
   emissions, and global policy shifts that prioritize ecosystem health.},

Title = {Developing cost-effective monitoring protocols for track-surveys: An
   empirical assessment using a Canada lynx Lynx canadensis dataset
   spanning 16 years},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Management agencies need statistically robust, cost-effective monitoring
   programs to effectively conserve and manage wildlife. However, this
   requires pilot studies to assess the monitoring protocol's ability to
   detect meaningful changes in the state variable of interest. This is
   more challenging for elusive mammals due to low detection rates and the
   costs associated with fieldwork. A key knowledge gap concerns how
   spatio-temporal dynamics in species occupancy and detection rates alter
   the cost-effectiveness of sampling protocols. To fill this gap we used a
   dataset spanning 16 years on Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) track surveys
   conducted in Maine, USA, and developed optimal monitoring protocols that
   empirically assess the cost-effectiveness of these protocols under
   different scenarios. We surveyed 96 townships and detected 949 track
   intercepts, which were converted to detection histories under a
   spatially-replicated occupancy design. By combining occupancy modeling
   and power analyses, we estimated the sampling effort required to detect
   declines in occupancy from 10 to 50 \%. Calculating the monetary cost of
   these protocols indicated that detecting subtle changes in occupancy
   (<10 \%) is very expensive even within high suitability habitats and may
   often be unrealistic. However, protocols that detected medium (30 \%) to
   large (50 \%) declines required similar budgets and were consistent with
   the observed shifts in occupancy during our study period (34 \%),
   suggesting that a modest budget increase would pay large dividends in
   population assessment efficacy. Our results provide important guidance
   on how to implement robust and cost-effective monitoring programs with
   snow track surveys - a popular survey method used by many conservation
   agencies.},

Title = {Using derivative thresholds to resolve conflicting habitat management
   strategies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Habitat management efforts for multiple species with contrasting habitat
   requirements can be challenging, particularly on small landscapes where
   large-scale heterogeneity may not be a viable solution. We sought to
   utilize derivative functions from species-response curves to identify
   thresholds along an environmental gradient for two species with
   differing responses to juniper cover. We estimated percentages of
   one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) cover around loggerhead shrike
   (Lanius ludovicianus) and gray vireo (Vireo vicinior) nests in central
   New Mexico in 2016-2020 to better understand tolerance of juniper
   expansion for these two species of con-servation concern.
   Species-response curves were derived from generalized additive
   mixed-effect models, with year as a random effect and a local regression
   smoother. Loggerhead shrike nests were more likely to occur in areas
   without junipers at the 170-m radius spatial scale. Nest-site selection
   declined as percent juniper cover increased. Gray vireo nests were most
   likely to be found in areas with approximately 11 \% juniper cover at
   the 100-m radius spatial scale. Derivative functions were used to find
   juniper percentages where the rate of change in species' response was
   most negative for loggerhead shrikes and most positive for gray vireos.
   The rate of change in nest-site selection decreased the fastest at 13 \%
   and increased the fastest at 4 \% juniper cover for loggerhead shrike
   and gray vireo, respectively. These results suggest that maintaining
   juniper percentages between 4 and 13 \% at relatively broad spatial
   scales would likely increase available nesting habitat both species. We
   demonstrate how derivative functions can be used to estimate the rate of
   change of species' response to environmental gra-dients and an
   application of such thresholds to resolve conflicting habitat management
   for two species of con-servation concern.},

Title = {Strengthening protected areas for climate refugia on the Tibetan
   Plateau, China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are at the forefront of efforts to conserve and
   restore biodiversity, while climate change can risk compromising the
   ecological benefits of PAs. Therefore, targeting conservation and
   adaptation efforts necessitate a well-understand of the relationship
   between PAs and climate refugia, defined as the regions can buffer the
   impact of climate change. Recent attempts to identify climate refugia
   were primarily based on terrain -mediated features or climatic velocity,
   ignoring the ecosystem's internal processes. This work identified
   climate refugia on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an amplifier of drastic
   global climate warming, based on environmental diversity, phenology
   stability and climatic velocity, highlighting the capacity to cope with
   extreme weather events, synchronization with plant growth cycles and
   future climate adaptation, respectively. The results show the
   distribution of climate refugia using different environmental diversity
   indicators (e.g., vegetation and topography) vary slightly but differs
   substantially from the priorities using phenology stability and climatic
   velocity. For instance, the high distribution probability of climate
   refugia derived from environmental diversity and climatic velocity is
   mainly concentrated at low (<3000 m) or high elevations (>6000 m), while
   the one using phenology stability is mainly observed at 3000 m-3800 m.
   The inconsistent distribution of different types of refugia weakens the
   potential of functional complementarity. The existing nature reserves,
   the primary type of PAs in China, have critical conservation gaps in
   different types of climate refugia, indicating the urgency of
   incorporating climate refugia into PAs conservation planning on TP. Our
   work could help inform local conser-vation policies and improve the
   effectiveness of PAs.},

Title = {Building up a network of genetic conservation areas-A comprehensive
   approach to select target sites for the preservation of genetic
   variation in wild plant species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Genetic conservation areas (GCAs) have been proposed as a useful tool to
   preserve genetic variation of plant populations and communities in situ.
   Most current strategies to establish GCAs have focused on crop wild
   relative species and proposals have been made mainly for single species
   or habitats. Moreover, the analysis of current genetic variation was
   rarely included as a crucial part in the process of selecting target
   sites for GCAs. To close this gap, we collected data on the genetic
   variation in three grassland habitats of three species per grassland
   type to develop a new approach for the selection of target sites for a
   network of GCAs. First, we used AFLPs to calculate genetic diversity and
   genetic differentiation at the target sites. Then we determined how many
   and which populations represent the highest genetic variation within the
   study region and should be included in a GCA network. The species
   differed in the number of populations required and the most suitable
   target sites were not uniform across species. The species showed
   different patterns of genetic differentiation among populations. This
   underlines that the inclusion of further sites is necessary, when aiming
   at the establishment of GCA networks for multiple species. However, in
   practical nature conservation genetic variation is not the only relevant
   parameter for the establishment of a GCA network, we suggest a detailed
   decision-making process for the establishment of the GCA network,
   including further important factors such as property situation, funding
   availability, target species or habitat, land use history or landscape
   structure.},

Title = {Species-tailored sampling guidelines remain an efficient method to
   conserve genetic diversity ex situ: A study on threatened oaks},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To safeguard species so they can adapt to environmental change, ex situ
   collections must represent a sufficient amount of species' wild genetic
   diversity. Because of sampling constraints such as time and cost,
   conservation biologists have worked to recommend minimum sample sizes
   that efficiently capture genetic diversity. However, the minimum number
   of individuals that should be sampled for ex situ collections may vary
   according to species biogeography, reproductive and dispersal biology,
   and history. Using simulations, we first aimed to establish minimum
   sample sizes for 14 IUCN Red List threatened oak species and determine
   if one minimum sample size can capture the genetic diversity of these
   closely related species with similar biology and dispersal, but
   different population sizes and ranges. We found that the answer is
   no-minimum size ranged from 81 to over 500. Second, we addressed a
   common concern with simulations-that their predictions may be too
   dependent on assumptions and may neglect uncertainty. We varied some
   parameters used for modeling each species in simulations to determine if
   the minimum sample size changed when this parameter was changed. We
   determined that the variation in minimum size due to parameter
   uncertainty was moderate compared to variation due to species'
   characteristics. Based on this, we propose that simulations may be
   reliable tools for practical use for many species, even when there is
   uncertainty in the parameters used for modeling. We conclude that one
   minimum sample size cannot be recommended to fit all 14 species, but
   that simulations can help create sampling guidelines tailored to each
   species.},

Title = {A multifaceted index of population health to detect risk-prone
   populations and underlying stressors in wildlife},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Local declines of wild populations represent the most visible part of
   biodiversity loss, and their detection often relies on long-term
   surveys. An alternative to identify risk-prone populations is to use
   indicators informing on their general health (i.e., their general
   fitness and ability to cope with changing environment) based on simple
   and complementary parameters estimated from snapshot sampling. However,
   most studies on wildlife population health focus on one or only a few
   parameters, yielding potentially biased conclusions for conservation.
   Here, we developed a multifaceted index of population health by
   combining 3 complementary indicators, namely path-ological, ecological,
   and genetic indicators, based on an integrative approach traditionally
   used to assess ecosystem multifunctionality. We investigated their
   complementarity and relevance for detecting brown trout (Salmo trutta)
   risk-prone populations at a large spatial scale, and the underlying
   environmental stressors. The multifaceted health index properly
   represented the individual indicators' complementary information. It
   iden-tified a cluster of moderately risk-prone populations and raised
   the alarm for one population. Each indicator was individually associated
   with distinct environmental stressors relevant for brown trout
   requirements. The multifaceted health index highlighted surrounding
   agricultural land and oxygen concentration as the most impacting
   environmental factors for the general health and sustainability of brown
   trout populations. The implementation of such integrative index can be
   transferred to a wide range of species and contexts. This index
   therefore provides to environmental managers and conservationists a
   snapshot and easily operated tool to identify risk-prone populations and
   areas to restore or conserve.},

   rates and may thus lead to overcrowding and subsequently to the
   degradation of protected areas. This study addresses the question of how
   Instagram users perceive and evaluate these potentially detrimental
   impacts on protected areas in Austria, Germany, or Switzerland. We
   conducted an online survey among Instagram users and measured their
   personal knowledge and perceptions of nature protection issues, their
   activities on Instagram and their perceptions of environmentally
   negative behaviours associated with Instagram usage. The results show
   that the respondents do have personal knowledge about nature protection.
   However, they do not want social media to teach them about
   nature-protection-related topics and do not consider Instagram a good
   source for such information. When partici-pants were presented with a
   typical example of an environmentally negative behaviour in a protected
   area (such as off-road motorbiking) that some people perform while
   presenting themselves on Instagram, respondents' sentiments changed from
   indifference towards favouring nature protection. The results of this
   study provide useful information for better communication on
   conservation issues in protected areas and the improved incorporation of
   nature protection content into Instagram users' feeds (e.g. via
   conservation marketing approaches).},

Title = {Conservation gaps for Neotropical vipers: Mismatches between protected
   areas, species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The continuous decline in biodiversity despite global efforts to create
   new protected areas calls into question the effectiveness of these areas
   in conserving biodiversity. Numerous habitats are absent from the global
   protected area network, and certain taxonomic groups are not being
   included in conservation planning. Here, we analyzed the level of
   protection that the current protected area system provides to viper
   species in the Neotropical region through a conservation gap analysis.
   We used distribution size and degree of threat to set species-specific
   con-servation goals for 123 viper species in the form of minimum
   percentage of their distribution that should be covered by protected
   areas, and assessed the level of protection provided for each species by
   overlapping their distribution with protected areas of strict
   protection. Furthermore, using species richness and evolutionary
   distinctiveness as priority indicators, we conducted a spatial
   association analysis to detect areas of special concern. We found that
   most viper species have <1/4 of their distribution covered by protected
   areas, including 22 threatened species. Also, the large majority of
   cells containing high levels of species richness were signifi-cantly
   absent from protected areas, while evolutionary distinctiveness was
   particularly unprotected in regions with relatively low species
   richness, like northern Mexico and the Argentinian dry Chaco. Our
   results provide further evidence that vipers are largely being excluded
   from conservation planning, leaving them exposed to serious threats that
   can lead to population decline and ultimately extinction.},

Title = {Troubled waters: Water availability drives human-baboon encounters in a
   protected, semi-arid landscape},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Most animal habitats are affected by humans. While some species tolerate
   and even benefit from these changes, others suffer. Understanding when
   and how human-altered landscapes affect animal behavior, health,
   repro-duction, and survival is essential to species management in a
   human-dominated world. Here we use 27 years of data on human-baboon
   encounters in a protected, semi-arid ecosystem in Kenya to: (i) identify
   spatial, envi-ronmental, and group-level predictors of baboon encounters
   with pastoralists; (ii) test whether human-built water sources alter
   baboon ranging patterns; and (iii) test if human encounters are linked
   to baboon survival, reproduction, and health. We find that the primary
   driver of human-baboon encounters is water availability. During dry
   periods, pastoralists migrate into baboon rangelands, leading to
   frequent human-baboon encounters, especially near water wells. Further,
   the baboons shift their ranges to encompass newly built wells and move
   away from abandoned, dried-up wells. Since 2006, a third of adult baboon
   deaths were linked to violent en-counters with humans or their dogs.
   Human encounters were also linked to high infant mortality and parasite
   diversity in females (but this effect could not be disentangled from
   seasonal confounds). For wild baboons, life in protected, pastoralist
   conservancies presents a double-edged sword: human-built wells enable
   the baboons to access water during dry periods, but these wells lead to
   encounters with humans, which have become a common source of baboon
   mortality. Together, our results serve as a comprehensive case study of
   anthropogenic effects on wild primates, highlighting the complex
   interactions between humans and wildlife in protected areas.},

Title = {Challenges and bottlenecks for butterfly conservation in a highly
   anthropogenic region: Europe's worst case scenario revisited},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The recent decline in insect diversity and abundance and the
   consequences for associated ecosystem functioning and services have
   attracted growing attention. Especially highly anthropogenic regions are
   affected by rapid biodiversity changes including significant losses. Two
   decades ago, we suggested that Flanders (northern Belgium) was Europe's
   worst case scenario for butterfly diversity loss with habitat
   destruction, fragmentation and nitrogen deposition as major causes (Maes
   and Van Dyck, 2001). To analyse changes since the second half of the
   20th century, we used >2.5 million distribution records to calculate
   trends in distribution during the last three decades. By linking these
   trends to the species' ecology using multi-species indicators for a set
   of ecological and life-history traits, we determined the most important
   drivers policy makers and nature managers should focus on. Species
   showing the strongest expansion are woodland specialists and polyphagous
   species. On the other hand, sedentary species of nutrient-poor biotopes
   such as heathlands and semi-natural grasslands showed a decreasing
   trend, despite the ongoing policy focus and conservation efforts. We
   discuss our results with regard to challenges and bottlenecks for the
   conservation of butterflies and other insects in anthropogenic regions.},

Title = {Application of expert elicitation to estimate population trajectories
   for species prioritized in Australia's first threatened species strategy},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many global and national conservation initiatives have objectives
   relating to reducing or reversing the rate of biodiversity decline but
   few have specific targets. In 2015, the Australian Government
   implemented a Threat-ened Species Strategy that aimed to improve the
   population trajectory of a set of 71 species (20 mammals, 21 birds and
   30 plants) by 2020, relative to the trajectory before 2015. To assess
   the extent to which this objective had been achieved, and because there
   was no or limited monitoring for many of the species, we used structured
   expert elicitation to estimate population size for every species at
   2005, 2015, 2020, and predict population size at 2025, 2035 and 2045.
   Elicitation was informed by a consistent collation of information for
   every species, including on threats, management actions, and available
   monitoring. Experts estimated that the population trajectories of 15
   species had improved significantly (at p < 0.05, or 24 species at p <
   0.1) over the period 2015-20 (the period coinciding with priority
   attention under the Threatened Species Strategy) relative to 2005-15,
   and 13 species had deteriorated significantly (at p < 0.05, or 15 at p <
   0.1). The lack of recovery for a substantial component of the set of
   priority species was likely due to the short (5-year) period considered
   over which deeply ingrained threats may not be ameliorated, the impacts
   of drought and wildfire in this period, and the relative ineffectiveness
   of some management actions to mitigate the most important threats.
   Assessment of population trajectories was least confident and most
   inconsistent among experts for species with least monitoring effort.
   Experts predicted ongoing future declines with cessation of conservation
   management actions, but some longer-term recovery for most plant and
   mammal species with ongoing conservation management. Elicitation helped
   provide a consistent approach towards inferring population trends, but
   more ideal would be to monitor populations for all threatened species.},

Abstract = {Species differ in their biological susceptibility to extinction, but the
   set of traits determining susceptibility varies across taxa. It is yet
   unclear which patterns are common to all taxa, and which are
   taxon-specific, with conse-quences to conservation practice. In this
   study we analysed the generality of trait-based prediction of extinction
   risk across terrestrial (including freshwater) vertebrates,
   invertebrates and plants at a global scale. For each group, we selected
   five representative taxa and within each group we explored whether risk
   can be related to any of 10 potential predictors. We then synthesized
   outcomes across taxa using a meta-analytic approach. High habitat
   specificity was a consistent predictor across vertebrates, invertebrates
   and plants, being a universal predictor of risk. Slow life-history
   traits - large relative offspring size, low fecundity, long generation
   length -, and narrow altitudinal range were also found to be good
   predictors across most taxa, but their universality needs to be
   supported with additional data. Poor dispersal ability was a common
   predictor of extinction risk among invertebrate and plant taxa, but not
   consistently among vertebrates. The remaining traits (body size, micro
   -habitat verticality, trophic level, and diet breadth) were useful to
   predict extinction risk but only at lower tax-onomical levels. Our study
   shows that despite the idiosyncrasies among taxa, universal
   susceptibility to extinction exists and several traits might influence
   extinction risk for most taxa. Informing conservation prior-itization at
   lower taxonomic scales should however include taxon-specific trait-based
   predictors of extinction risk.},

Title = {Riding the elevator to extinction: Disjunct arctic-alpine plants of open
   habitats decline as their more competitive neighbours expand},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Major displacement of arctic-alpine species towards higher elevations
   and latitudes is anticipated under climate warming. Disjunct plant
   populations persisting on mountains at the limits of their species'
   distributions may have a reduced capacity for migration, and therefore
   offer a particularly sensitive indication of climate change effects. The
   flora of Scotland's mountains is of international significance because
   it contains populations of climate relicts which are isolated
   geographically and located at the rear edge of their global range. We
   used a unique long-term monitoring dataset recording vegetation change
   at a mountain outpost site in the Scottish Highlands to identify
   divergent population trends in ten rare plant species over the last 30
   years. Three arctic-alpine specialists (Sagina nivalis, Sabulina rubella
   and Saxifraga cernua) have suffered severe declines of over 50 \% of
   their population size since the mid-1990s, and have been extirpated at
   their lowest altitude locations. These species are undergoing
   elevational range contractions and Sagina nivalis is now considered
   Endangered in Britain. Their open, gravelly snowbed habitats have been
   affected by vegetation encroachment, landslip and rockfalls. Population
   changes across all species studied were also significantly related to
   altitude. Species with stable or increasing population sizes occur at
   lower altitudes, are taller and have less reliance on sparsely vegetated
   habitats. These results can be contextualised within broad trends of
   thermophilization, biotic homogenization, mountain greening and snow
   cover declines. Our work demonstrates that disjunct low-latitude
   arctic-alpine plant populations already situated at maximum local
   elevational gradients could face ``mountaintop extinction ``, with
   implications for the conser-vation of regional biodiversity.},

Title = {Marine protected areas provide unfished reference information to
   empirically assess fishery status},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fisheries stock assessments typically determine stock-status using
   estimates of unfished biomass generated from fisheries dependent data.
   Due to limitations and biases in these data, modelled unfished estimates
   are reliant on assumptions regarding stock ecology. This can lead to a
   high degree of uncertainty in estimates of unfished biomass and can
   compromise sustainable management. We propose using the biomass of
   exploited species in no -take marine protected areas (marine reserves)
   as a proxy for unfished biomass to empirically assess stock status.
   Marine reserves provide contemporary examples of exploited populations
   in the absence of fishing under current conditions. Using lobster (Jasus
   edwardsii) potting and diver-based survey data from 2018 and 2019 we
   calcu-lated fisheries relevant metrics from inside and outside two
   north-eastern New Zealand marine reserves. Based on marine reserve
   reference points, we found spawning stock catch rates and biomass of
   lobster in adjacent fished areas were 3 \% and 2 \% of unfished levels.
   Comparability of potting and dive survey estimates validates using dive
   survey data to estimate stock status, while differences in population
   information between survey methods highlights the limited ability of
   catch data to accurately inform on sub-legal abundances. Overall, our
   fisheries -independent approach suggests the fished population is at
   lower levels than latest estimates for the wider fishery and
   demonstrates how marine reserves can provide information on key
   parameters which can be incorporated into traditional stock assessments.
   Planning for future marine reserves should consider the value of such
   areas as tools to help manage fisheries in addition to protecting
   exploited species.},

Title = {Wipe out highly hazardous pesticides to deter wildlife poisoning: The
   case of carbofuran and aldicarb},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Deliberate wildlife poisoning with pesticides is widely reported
   worldwide, regardless of whether the toxic compound is authorized, of
   restricted use, or banned. Due to their high toxicity, Highly Hazardous
   Pesticides (HHPs) are of special concern in this regard, with
   international calls claiming for concerted action to effectively address
   their severe impacts on the environment and public health. Continuous
   wildlife poisoning episodes with carbofuran and aldicarb across the
   globe illustrate how partial regulations are insufficient to address the
   adverse environmental impacts of HHPs. Carbofuran and aldicarb are
   restricted in 83 and 125 countries, respectively, including total bans
   in EU, where they are still responsible for wildlife poisoning.
   Remaining stocks in countries where banned may contribute to their
   short-medium term use, but the absence of a global ban leaves room for
   manufacturing, allowing in turn a continuous illegal trade and use over
   time. Following FAO's proposal to eliminate HHPs by 2030, and
   considering the decreasing presence in ecosystems of the few pesticides
   already banned or severely restricted at global scale, a total ban must
   be implemented to effectively deter the use of carbofuran, aldicarb and
   other HHPs in wildlife poisoning on the medium-long term.},

Title = {Witnessing mass extinction: What?s invisible, what?s visible, what?s
   possible},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We are living in the time of the Sixth Mass Extinction. While many
   details elude us, we know that a mass extinction is underway from
   comparisons between background and current extinction rates, precipitous
   drops in wildlife populations, the shrinking of wild places, and the
   critical endangerment of biodiverse ecologies such as grasslands,
   tropical forests, wetlands, rivers and lakes, coral reefs, and
   continental shelves. This paper dissects the underpinnings of the Sixth
   Mass Extinction, with the intention of joining many other activists and
   thinkers to disrupt its seeming inevitability. First, I discuss what has
   been invisible about anthropogenic mass extinc-tion-the event itself-and
   the factors of silence, ignorance, and denial underlying its
   invisibility. Then I turn to the visible dimension of the Sixth Mass
   Extinction, namely, the action orientation of ``entitled
   instrumentalism{''} that is driving it; I describe entitled
   instrumentalism as the wholesale assimilation of the natural world into
   a human-owned domain. I end with considering the possibility of humanity
   charting an altogether different course. We must recognize mass
   extinction as the inevitable upshot of nature colonization and awaken to
   the need to restore and preserve Earth's cosmic wealth.},

Title = {Small floral patches are resistant reservoirs of wild floral visitor
   insects and the pollination service in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Small floral patches that coexist with crops in agricultural landscapes
   can function as biodiversity reservoirs. However, the influence of the
   landscape context and agricultural management on the capacity of these
   small green infrastructures to support diversity is poorly understood.
   Here, we evaluate the effect of landscape simplification, agricultural
   intensification in the neighbourhood, and quality of the floral habitats
   on the success of these patches to support flower-visiting insect
   communities as well as the pollination service they provide.To this aim,
   we sampled floral patches located in 18 paired olive farms with
   contrasting herb cover man-agement (intensive vs. low-intensity),
   distributed along a wide gradient of landscape complexity at the
   regional scale of South Spain. We conducted surveys of flower-visiting
   insects in 36 multi-floral stands and 36 mono-floral stands of Sinapis
   alba Linnaeus (1753) within these floral patches. Mono-floral stands
   were used to evaluate variations in the pollination service through
   number of viable seeds and seed set.Results revealed that the abundance
   and diversity of flower-visiting insects respond to the quality of the
   floral patch (diversity of flowers) but not to landscape context nor
   agricultural management around it. Moreover, the pollination service was
   similar and high (seed set ca. 100 \%) in all floral patches regardless
   of their context.Our findings highlight the importance of even small
   floral patches that function as reservoirs of diversity of
   flower-visiting insects and the pollination service. They also show the
   high resistance of these patches to agri-cultural intensification and
   simplification in olive grove landscapes.},

Title = {Effects of fragmentation on grassland plant diversity depend on the
   habitat specialization of species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Evaluating the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation is essential
   for biodiversity conservation. However, an understanding of how habitat
   loss and fragmentation interact and affect biodiversity is limited.
   Based on 134 landscapes in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China
   selected by a stratified random sampling approach, we used a structural
   equation model to evaluate the direct effects of habitat loss and its
   indirect effects (via habitat fragmentation, including edge density,
   patch density, mean patch area, and mean nearest-neighbor distance) on
   grassland plant species richness (including specialists and weeds) at
   the landscape scale. Our results show that habitat loss had a direct
   negative effect on overall species richness and grassland specialist
   richness but a positive effect on weed richness. Meanwhile, the increase
   in patch density caused by habitat loss had a positive effect on overall
   species richness and grassland specialist richness. These results
   indicate that the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation can differ
   for habitat specialists and generalists. Increasing the number of
   habitat patches in the landscape could increase the species richness of
   habitat specialists. Our findings emphasize the importance of the
   management of adding habitat patches in fragmented landscapes for
   conserving habitat specialists.},

Title = {Habitats, agricultural practices, and population dynamics of a
   threatened species: The European turtle dove in France},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agricultural changes in recent decades have led to a widespread loss of
   biodiversity, with habitat loss considered as the main factor in the
   decline. The European turtle dove is one of the farmland birds that has
   declined markedly in Europe, leading the IUCN to downgrade its status in
   2015 from ``Near Threatened `` to ``Vulnerable ``. Knowledge of how
   habitat factors and agricultural practices influence the turtle dove
   population is crucial for the conservation of this species through the
   implementation of targeted measures. Here we investigate how foraging
   and nesting habitats influence the abundance of turtle doves at national
   and regional scales, using a 23-year dataset from point counts carried
   out throughout France, a stronghold country for this species during the
   breeding season. We found that turtle dove abondance was positively
   affected by fallow lands, both at national and regional scales. Turtle
   dove abundance was also negatively affected by fodder crop area at
   national scale, but the effect was detected in only four of the 13
   French regions. We also showed that an increase in hedgerows length had
   a positive effect on turtle dove abundance. On the other hand, forest
   edges length showed a bell -shaped trend, suggesting that an increase in
   forest edges length may have a favourable effect on turtle dove
   abundance only up to a given threshold. We suggest that targeted
   conservation measures combining an increase in fallow lands and
   hedgerows length could allow the stabilisation or even an increase in
   turtle dove abundance in France, but also in European countries with
   similar landscapes.},

Title = {Economic value of nature via healthcare savings and productivity

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Economic values of mental health benefits from nature can provide a new
   conservation tool. Here we calculate valuations from increased workplace
   productivity and reduced healthcare spending. Visiting national parks
   buffers workplace productivity against mental health losses. In
   Australia, for visits at least monthly, productivity increases are up to
   11 \%, with weighted mean 4.6 \%. Total contribution across all visit
   frequencies is similar to 1.8 \% of GDP. In Australia, visiting
   protected areas improves individual mental health by up to 17 \%, with
   weighted mean effect 1.80 \% for mentally healthy and 4.44 \% for
   mentally unhealthy visitors. These effects reduce direct healthcare
   costs by a further similar to 0.6 \% of GDP. Scaling up worldwide via
   GDP, with adjustments for park visitation rates, per capita healthcare
   costs, and distributions of mental health indicators, yields an
   estimated global health services value of protected areas, via
   productivity and healthcare costs alone, of similar to US\$2.1 trillion
   per annum. During 2020-2022, nature deprivation reduced mental health
   worldwide. Employers and health insurers would gain from increase
   budgets for national parks. There are mental healthcare programs relying
   on parks in at least 6 nations. Research priorities include mechanisms
   and duration of health benefits, cf components and intensity of nature
   experiences, including biodiversity.},

Title = {Fine-scale associations between wandering albatrosses and fisheries in
   the southwest Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bycatch is a conservation concern for marine biodiversity, including
   seabirds. Analyses of spatio-temporal overlap are an important tool for
   identifying areas and periods where birds are most at risk, but until
   recently were only possible at coarse scales using aggregated data on
   fishing effort. Here, we integrated data from loggers that record GPS
   positions of birds at sea and scan the surroundings to detect
   vessel-radar transmissions, with the positions of fishing vessels
   obtained from the automatic identification system, to identify areas,
   gear types and flag states representing most bycatch risk for wandering
   albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) of different life-history stages and
   sexes. We recorded 157 foraging trips of adult breeders, and 34 tracks
   of sabbatical breeders, 29 immatures and 31 juveniles. Overall, 55 \% of
   birds encountered and 43 \% of birds visited fishing vessels (i.e. were
   within 30 km and 5 km, respectively). Fine-scale overlap was
   particularly high for breeders during incu-bation and post-guard
   chick-rearing when birds travelled to the Patagonian Shelf break. Only
   23 \% of all en-counters involved vessel visits. Our study found the
   greatest overlap was with set (demersal) longliners, particularly those
   from South Korea but also including the Falkland Islands, United Kingdom
   and Chile, and to lower extents, trawlers flagged to Argentina and
   Uruguay, and drifting (pelagic) longliners flagged to Brazil, Portugal
   and Taiwan. These fleets vary greatly in terms of bycatch rates. This
   study highlights the importance of covering the full range of
   life-history stages, and the advantages of vessel-detecting loggers and
   fine-scale ana-lyses for improving risk assessments.},

Title = {Charisma failure: Understanding differences in support for conservation
   of Asian elephants compared to tigers and African elephants},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The disproportionately high support for conservation of charismatic
   species is well-documented. However, available data demonstrate
   substantial discrepancies in funding for conservation even among
   charismatic spe-cies, and these differences are poorly understood. We
   use two survey experiments to explore explanations for differences in
   demand for conservation between charismatic species by comparing Asian
   elephants (Elephas maximus) with tigers (Panthera tigris) in India and
   with African elephants (Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis)
   globally. Through social media, we collect data from conservation
   enthusiasts to measure (a) relative demand for conservation, (b)
   awareness about conservation status, (c) relative favourability, and (d)
   perception of which species faces greater conservation challenges
   ({''}risk perception{''}). Overall, respondents allocated significantly
   more funds to the species/taxon they perceive to be more at risk and
   41-54 \% more to the species/ taxon they say they like more (though
   about 70 \% of respondents claimed to like both species/taxa presented
   equally). On average, respondents in India allocated 5.6 \% more for
   tigers than Asian elephants, a far smaller discrepancy than found in
   public data from key real-life funders. Internationally, respondents
   allocated 14 \% more funds for African than Asian elephants (despite
   there being fewer Asian elephants) and generally over-estimated how
   endangered African elephants are compared to Asian elephants. Our study
   suggests (i) conser-vation enthusiasts wish to donate more to more
   endangered charismatic species but are sometimes misinformed about the
   level of endangerment of even very well-known species, and (ii)
   discrepancies in actual funding levels across charismatic species appear
   to be greater than conservation enthusiasts believe they should be.},

Title = {Protected area network insufficiently represents climatic niches of
   endemic plants in a Global Biodiversity Hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Protected Areas (PA) play a pivotal role in conservation biology.
   Climate change challenges the concept of static PAs as species may not
   find suitable climatic conditions in the PAs designed to protect them in
   the future. Here, we assess this emerging mismatch for the endemic
   mountain flora of the Iranian Plateau, the main part of the
   Irano-Anatolian global biodiversity hotspot. We compare the climatic
   requirements of each of 1277 endemic plant species with the climatic
   conditions offered by those parts of the Iranian PA network that are
   within the dispersal range of each species. We undertake this comparison
   for current climatic conditions and the conditions predicted for the
   years 2050 and 2070 under the climatic scenarios RCP4.5 und RCP8.5. We
   find that 50 \% of the species climatic niche space is represented in
   the PA network under current conditions. Depending on the cli-matic
   scenario and time frame, representation will decrease to 15-25 \% in the
   future. Species of lowest and highest elevations, and, in particular,
   species with narrow ranges, are predicted to face the most pronounced
   losses of climatic representation in PAs. We conclude that the
   contribution of the current Iranian PA network to protecting the rich
   endemic flora of the country under climate change is limited. The
   network overrepresents climatically homogenous desert ecosystems and
   neglects endemism hotspots of high mountain chains. Efficient
   conservation planning in this biodiversity hotspot should focus on
   expanding elevational gradients within PAs and prioritize the protection
   of narrow range, low and high elevation species.},

Title = {Amateurs can be experts: A new perspective on collaborations with
   citizen scientists},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Observations made by citizen-scientists are highly regarded in many
   fields of biology. Public participation in research leads to increased
   environmental stewardship, greater data-acquisition, and
   multi-disciplinary ad-vances. However, to date, there is a paucity of
   literature that acknowledges the professional benefits we, as
   scientists, gain through open consultation and two-way collaboration
   with interested parties. Citizen scientists often have specialised
   interests in particular taxa or habitats. They spend much time observing
   their subjects/s of interest, becoming accustomed to subtle nuances in
   appearance, behaviour, or dynamics that are challenging to detect
   without a high level of familiarity. In a world where professional
   researchers must increasingly balance competing demands on their time,
   and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of their research, we stand to
   benefit by acknowledging the specific expertise of amateurs and the
   value their experience brings to observations. We use marine ornithology
   as an exemplar of this discussion - reasoning that data quality can be
   greatly improved by collaboration with expert amateurs, concomitantly
   improving the outcomes from research for conservation and management. We
   encourage researchers surveying wildlife, plant life, and other
   organisms to consider where their information and skills may come from,
   and close the loop between citizens and science to make the most of what
   amateur naturalism has to offer.},

Title = {Issues with species occurrence data and their impact on extinction risk
   assessments},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species extinction risk status is critical to support conservation
   actions. However, full assessments published on the Red List are slow
   and resource intensive. To tackle assessments for mega-diverse groups,
   gains can be made through preliminary assessments that can help
   prioritize efforts toward full assessments. Here, we quantified how
   incomplete data collation and errors in the taxonomic, spatial, and
   temporal dimensions of species-occurrence data translate into
   misclassifications of extinction risk. Using a dataset of >30 million
   records of terrestrial plants occurring in Brazil compiled from nine
   databases we conducted preliminary risk assessments for similar to 94 \%
   of the 6046 species assessed by the Brazilian Red List authority. We
   found that no unique database contained data sufficient to perform
   extinction risk assessment of all species; e.g., the risk of 78 \% of
   species can be assessed using data from GBIF. The overall accuracy
   (66-75 \%) and specificity (89-98 \%, correct prediction of
   nonthreatened species) were less affected by incomplete data collation
   and issues in species-occurrence records. Sensitivity rates (correct
   prediction of threatened species) were commonly low to moderate and
   strongly affected by incomplete data collation (13-47 \%) and spatial
   issues (38 \%). Our results demonstrate that species' preliminary risk
   assessments have high accuracy in identifying non-threatened species,
   even when data collection is low and in the presence of issues in
   species occurrence data highlighting that such an approach can be used
   to efficiently prioritize species for full Red List assessments. In
   addition, caution is needed before declaring a species as threatened
   without considering data collation intensity and quality.},

Title = {CITES makes a measurable difference to the trade in live marine fishes:
   The pioneering case of seahorses},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Seahorses set precedent as the first marine fishes added to CITES
   Appendix II and taken through CITES processes. Although the vast
   majority of seahorses are traded dead for traditional medicine, the live
   trade for ornamental display was the main pressure on some populations.
   We investigated changes in the international trade in live seahorses
   over time, exploring the influence of CITES listing and its compliance
   process (called Review of Significant Trade or RST).
   Globally, reported exports of live seahorses from key trading Parties
   declined notably in the first years after the CITES listing, and yet
   more after RST, to just 7 \% of historic levels. These changes are
   explained first by a decline in wild sourcing after the listing and then
   by a decrease in the number of captive born seahorses (from wild-sourced
   parents) after RST. Almost all live seahorses in international trade are
   now captive bred (F2 generation or more). Consequently, there are now
   fewer wild sourced species in trade, from fewer countries and more
   tank-raised species, from more countries.
   In summary, the CITES listing for seahorses appears to have reduced
   pressure of international trade on some wild populations - those
   involved in live trade. This gain is, however, tiny in the context of
   the vast trade in dried seahorses, most of which are now smuggled across
   borders. The difference probably lies in the small volume and relatively
   high value of the aquarium trade. CITES Parties still need to determine
   how changes in live trade are affecting wild seahorse populations.},

Title = {Protecting prey by deceiving predators: A field experiment testing
   chemical camouflage and conditioned food aversion},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Complicated conservation problems may arise if predator numbers increase
   beyond their natural boundaries due to anthropogenic influence. For
   example, dramatic declines in ground-nesting birds are linked to
   increased nest predation by alien or human-subsidized mammals. While
   predator control can be temporarily effective, it is often laborious and
   carries ethical issues. Thus, we need alternative, non-lethal methods
   for reducing predator impact on their prey. We performed a
   landscape-scale experiment to study whether two non-lethal methods could
   protect ground-nesting waterfowl from nests predation. We spread either
   non-rewarding waterfowl odour (chemical camouflage) or eggs containing
   an aversive agent (conditioned food aversion) in the surroundings of
   study wetlands located in southern Finland. Predation of artificial
   waterfowl nests by red foxes decreased in sites with chemical
   camouflage, while there was no effect on predation by invasive raccoon
   dogs. Food aversion created less obvious effects than the chemical
   camouflage, but both methods indicated potential for reducing nest
   predation. Based on wildlife-camera data mesopredator observations did
   not, however, decrease near treatment wetlands. This suggests that
   treatments did not reduce predator activity, but affected foraging
   behaviour of predators and reduced their ability to find the nests. We
   conclude that managers considering non-lethal methods should carefully
   consider the effectiveness of different methods and potential
   species-specific responses. Nevertheless, our study support calls for
   wider use of non-lethal methods in reducing predator impacts on prey.
   These methods offer ethical and potentially effective approaches which
   keep native predator fauna intact, but create protection for vulnerable
   prey.},

Title = {Griffon vultures, livestock and farmers: Unraveling a complex
   socio-economic ecological conflict from a conservation perspective},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An unexpected human-wildlife conflict between vultures and livestock has
   emerged in Europe during the last two decades. Farmers attributed
   changes in vulture behavior, due to food shortages caused by sanitary
   regulations, to increasing livestock interactions ('vulture attacks').
   To disentangle this conflict, we analyzed 683 farmer complaints between
   1996 and 2020 in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) and investigated the
   eco-anthropological factors driving their frequency. We also assessed
   farmers' perception through 127 interviews. Most complaints (80 \%)
   occurred during the birthing season, mainly involving cattle (76.5 \%),
   followed by horses (14.9 \%) and sheep/goats (8.6 \%). From 2008 to
   2020, vulture-livestock conflicts cost the government (sic)192,000
   (similar to 22 \% of claims compensated). The frequency of complaints
   was positively associated with extensive livestock density, griffon
   vulture Gyps fulvus abundance (breeding and non-breeding), shorter
   distances to landfill sites and, to a lesser extent, to supplementary
   feeding stations. In contrast, there was a negative relationship between
   complaints and the number of griffon vulture breeding pairs, suggesting
   that long-distance foraging movements by both breeding and non-breeding
   individuals may play a major role in determining the occurrence of
   conflicts. Farmers (88 \%) said that vultures attack livestock and that
   attacks had increased in recent years because of significant vulture
   population increases and food shortages due to sanitary regulations.
   They considered government policies and compensation ineffective. We
   highlight the critical need for mitigation in areas with high extensive
   livestock numbers, particularly during birthing times. Scientific
   assessments and interdisciplinary awareness campaigns on the coexistence
   of vultures and livestock are necessary to harmonize biodiversity
   conservation and agro-pastoral practices in rural economies.},

Title = {Density-dependent habitat selection varies between male and female
   African elephants},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Habitat selection models are the basis of an increasing number of
   conservation and management programs. Decision-makers rely on accurate
   models to assess animal distribution over space and time, and to
   recommend suitable actions that can alleviate human-wildlife conflicts.
   Despite a rapidly growing number of field studies on habitat selection,
   there remains a paucity of empirical evidence that selection is a
   density-dependent process that can impact males and females differently.
   Based on 11 years of monitoring, we demonstrate that the response of
   African elephants (Loxodonta africana) to land-cover types varied with
   population size, and that density -dependent adjustments differed
   between sexes. Specifically, our longitudinal follow-up of GPS-collared
   ele-phants revealed that elephants gradually decrease their selection
   for open woodlands and forests, as the popu-lation increased and the
   availability of palatable browse species decreased. Both sexes - though
   males more strongly - increased their travel rate together with their
   relative probability of selection of roads for travel. Also, elephants
   displayed a density-dependent increase in their selection of
   infrastructures, a response that was stronger for males than females.
   The risk of human-elephant conflicts thus increased with population
   size, with males being particularly prone to be involved in such
   conflicts. Overall, we provide rare empirical evidence that
   density-dependence in fine-grain habitat selection can differ between
   sexes. This information can be critical to accurately forecast potential
   human-wildlife conflicts, and for taking targeted and effective
   conservation and management actions.},

Title = {New methods to derive sea turtle nester abundance from nest counts:
   Ground truthing and the bias of current approaches},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Abundance is a key parameter for characterizing animal populations of
   conservation concern. In sea turtles, annual clutch counts represent the
   most common population index. When the number of annual nesting females
   (ANF) is sought, clutch frequency (CF; average number of clutches laid
   per female) is used as a conversion factor. Here we assess the
   performance of five current methods for estimating ANF and of two new
   methods based on the interdependence of nesting activity parameters,
   investigated through a Monte Carlo approach with generalized additive
   models. All methods were evaluated on virtual populations and on a
   unique case of empirical data from a sea turtle population with a known
   ANF based on genetic identification of clutches (Caretta caretta,
   Northern Recovery Unit, USA). Results show that current methods produce
   errors often greater than the simple count of nesting females directly
   encountered, except for a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) model. One of the
   new methods takes advantage of both nest count and CMR data and shows
   the best performance at a wide range of detection probabilities. The
   second new method is based on nest count data only and can provide at
   least an approximate estimate of ANF where no CMR data are available.
   Our findings can dramatically improve sea turtle population abundance
   estimates worldwide. We recommend abandoning the use of any CF estimate
   as a direct conversion factor in favor of implementing the CMR model and
   the new methods to improve current estimates and to provide estimates
   where limited data have prevented doing so previously.},

Title = {Is livestock grazing compatible with green peafowl (Pavo muticus)
   conservation? Potential chance of peafowl-human coexistence},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Establishing adequate nature reserves and managing them effectively
   requires an enormous amount of resources, and is particularly
   challenging when species and communities are believed to have diverse
   needs. Decision -makers need to understand how wildlife survives in
   human-disturbed habitat and how they can coexist with anthropogenic
   activities. Forest livestock grazing is one of the main sources of
   income for many local commu-nities in Yunnan Province, China, but its
   association with endangered green peafowl (Pavo muticus) is largely
   unknown. We linked our field survey data with satellite imagery and
   conducted occupancy modeling and diel activity analysis to examine the
   spatio-temporal response of green peafowl to free-ranging livestock in
   Yubaiding Nature Reserve. Although it is widely believed that many
   grazing practices should be prohibited in green peafowl habitat, we
   found that green peafowl occurrence probability was positively
   associated with moderate cattle and goat abundance. Our temporal
   analysis also showed that green peafowl did not avoid livestock grazing
   or in-dividual people. In contrast to green peafowl tolerance to
   ordinary human activities, we found significant negative associations
   between green peafowl and major infrastructure. Our findings show that
   limits on grazing intensity are a possible management strategy for
   conserving green peafowl habitat instead of an outright grazing ban. Our
   study will contribute immediately to green peafowl conservation planning
   in China. Our study also has implications for the conservation plans for
   other species in other locations, because our findings convey that
   conservation targets can promote the synergy between species
   conservation and human activity.},

Title = {How 30 years of land-use changes have affected habitat suitability and
   connectivity for Atlantic Forest species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Land-use changes have severely degraded natural landscapes around the
   world, constituting the primary driver of biodiversity loss. In recent
   decades, agriculture expansion and the lack of effective conservation
   policies have mainly eroded tropical forests. Here, we built multi-scale
   habitat suitability models to investigate how land-use changes in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest over the last 30 years (1989-2019) have
   impacted habitat suitability and connectivity for six globally
   threatened or near-threatened species. We also assessed how the cover of
   highly suitable forests by protected areas has changed over the study
   period. We found an average reduction of 10\% of suitable forests for
   the target species. Our models estimated a loss of up to 37\% of highly
   suitable forests, with more range-restricted species experiencing the
   greatest declines. Today, forests still cover most highly suitable areas
   found in 1989, however they show reduced suitability due to landscape
   degradation. Pasture, agriculture, and forest plantations were the main
   land uses that replaced highly suitable forests. The land-use changes
   also deteriorated the connectivity network for most species. Although
   the total area protected more than doubled in the Atlantic Forest, we
   showed that the highly suitable forests under some level of protection
   covers only 0.6-2.5\% of species extent of occurrence. Our study
   demonstrates how unplanned land-use changes can erode forest quantity,
   quality, and connectivity for threatened species, challenging their
   long-term persistence. Our findings reveal the need to expand and
   improve the protected area network of the Atlantic Forest and highlight
   the critical role of land-use planning for protecting biodiversity.},

Title = {Size requirements of intact forest landscapes for effective biodiversity
   conservation under regional fire regimes and climate change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conserving large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) is one forest
   management strategy to mitigate industrial impacts on the environment.
   Measuring the IFL inventory at national scales has also been proposed as
   a means of assessing the conservation status at global scales. This
   paper explores the relationship between fire regimes and the size of
   intact forest landscapes required to meet specific conservation targets.
   In this paper, we demonstrate that variation in fire regimes results in
   changes in the minimum size of IFL required to meet habitat targets. In
   addition, minimum IFL size is also dependent on the nature of the
   habitat targets. Larger IFLs are required to improve likelihood of
   providing sufficient older habitat. There is significant risk of not
   meeting older forest age -class targets at higher annual area burned
   (AAB) rates, especially under climate change. In general, there is more
   risk of not meeting habitat targets associated with smaller IFLs, higher
   annual area burned (both due to spatial differences and between
   historical and projected burn rates under climate change), and for
   provision of older forests. We used habitat age-related targets as
   outlined in the recovery strategy for woodland caribou as an example to
   demonstrate the usefulness of this type of simulation experiment and
   risk curves to identify appro-priate IFL size along a gradient of
   natural disturbance intensity.},

Title = {The importance of negative density dependence for rare species
   persistence},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Determining the predictors of extinction risk is a major goal of
   conservation biology. Theory suggests that population characteristics
   such as low abundance and declining trends should equate to high
   extinction risk. However, rare species persist and account for nearly
   half of all species across global communities. Here we employ the
   Chicago Botanic Garden's long-term, rare species monitoring dataset to
   investigate population dynamics and hypothesized predictors of
   extinction risk of 73 populations of 43 rare species. Specifically, we
   ask how important negative density dependence is for rare species
   persistence and how well population size, population trends, life cycle
   duration, and clonality predict estimates of extinction risk in rare
   species. Extinction risk was estimated using density-dependent and
   density-independent population viability analyses. Based on our
   simulations, we found that only 33 of our populations had concerning
   extinction risks (>20 \%). The key to these relatively low extinction
   risks for so many rare, listed species was negative density dependence.
   Population size, population trends, life cycle duration, and clonality
   were not good predictors of extinction risk based on our modeling
   efforts, though their relationships to extinction risk did agree with
   theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the potential importance
   of negative density dependence for rare species persistence and the
   importance of incorporating density dependence in population projection
   models for extinction risk assessment.},

Title = {Traditional human practices protect diversity of open forests threatened
   by ticking nutrient time bomb},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Open forests are among the world's most species-rich ecosystems but
   these are now suffering from strong environmental pressure. With the
   increasing frequency of drought events accompanying climate change, open
   forests are now at high risk of canopy openness, an associated increase
   in nutrient load, and a consequent reordering of the plant community.
   Based on an 11-year field manipulative experiment, we examined whether
   the reintroduction of traditional forest uses, in particular the regular
   removal of litter which has been practiced for many centuries in Europe,
   may mitigate eutrophication and protect the ancient plant diversity of
   open forests. We examined vascular plant composition in 64, 3 x 3 m
   plots in 32 randomized blocks, each consisted of one litter-removal and
   one control plot in a subcontinental thermophilous oak forest dominated
   by Quercus petraea (Czech Republic, Central Europe). We analyzed how
   regular litter removal influenced the changes in topsoil nutrients and
   diversity and abundances of perennial, short-lived monocarpic and open
   oak forest plant species after eleven years of the annual application of
   this management. The regular litter removal significantly miti-gated
   eutrophication by a reducing total nitrogen, and significantly decreased
   the amounts of base cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the topsoil. The studied
   plant species groups responded differently. Perennial and open oak
   forest species significantly increased their richness and abundances in
   the litter-removal plots and at the same time their diversity did not
   change significantly depending on inter-annual weather conditions. In
   contrast, litter removal negatively affected abundances of short-lived
   monocarpic species, whose richness was also considerably influenced by
   weather conditions (decreased the most in years with spring droughts).
   Moreover, we have found a protective effect of regular litter removal on
   drought-sensitive open oak forest species that survived in the litter
   -removal plots, whereas some completely disappeared from control sites
   during the period of repeated drought events. Our study thus
   demonstrates that litter removal is a tool with high potential in
   maintaining biodiversity in open forests affected by climate change.},

Title = {Big changes in backyard birds: An analysis of long-term changes in bird
   communities in Australia's most populous urban regions},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban environments are increasingly acknowledged as a priority for
   biodiversity conservation. Birds in particular are capable of
   persisting, and sometimes thriving, in cities and towns globally.
   However, the process of urbanization results in the loss of many bird
   species due to the resulting changes in habitat conditions. Urban
   expansion and densification present a threat to both urban bird
   biodiversity and bird conservation more broadly. Australian urban areas,
   including suburban and peri-urban areas, currently support moderate bird
   species richness, but the rapidly changing urban landscape threatens
   these communities. Unfortunately, many bird species' population trends
   are not actively studied, resulting in a poor understanding of species
   persistence in urban environments. Here, we used bird survey data from
   long-running citizen science databases in a Bayesian List Length
   Analysis to determine changes in bird species prevalence (the
   probability of observing a species in a given survey event) over time in
   Australia's four most populous urban regions. We found that introduced
   species, historically prominent in Australian urban bird communities,
   are decreasing in prevalence in all four regions, while a small group of
   native urban exploiters are becoming more prevalent. Our results also
   show that many species perceived to be ``iconic{''} or ``common{''} are
   experiencing declines in prevalence in urban areas, highlighting the
   importance of monitoring and conservation action in urban areas.},

Title = {Centres of neo- and paleo-endemism for Chinese woody flora and their
   environmental features},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Separating centres of neo-and paleo-endemism on the clade level from the
   tree of life could infer their evolu-tionary history and further
   pinpoint conservation priorities. Yet, centres of neo-and paleo-endemism
   in mega-biodiversity China are controversial as their environmental
   features are unclear. Here, we used a comprehen-sive species occurrence
   dataset (4509 woody endemics with 158,028 occurrences) and phylogenetic
   approach categorical analyses of neo-and paleo-endemism (CANAPE) to
   identify endemic centres of woody flora in China. A total of 22 major
   and several minor centres of endemism have been successfully identified,
   covering 13.36 \% of China's total land area, yet capturing 89.60 \% of
   woody endemics. They were roughly in accordance with the previously
   known centres of endemism. New areas with conservation importance such
   as northern Xinjiang, eastern Heilongjiang, and western Himalayas were
   identified. Different centres of endemism presented their preferred
   environmental features. Centres of neo-endemism were associated with
   higher elevation, concentrated in central-southeastern Himalaya,
   southwestern Hengduan ({''}evolutionary front{''}) and the northern
   Altai Mountains. In contrast, centres of paleo-endemism preferred
   favorable climates (high temperature and precip-itation) and long-term
   climate stability. They were concentrated in southernmost China, in
   coincidence with one of the world's biodiversity hotspots (Indo-Burma).
   Centres of mixed-endemism were regarded as a transition type of neo-and
   paleo-endemism, concentrated in areas with moderate temperature and
   precipitation. Therefore, highlighting those centres of paleo-endemism
   should be considered as conservation priority areas due to dominating by
   old lineages with important evolutionary history and vulnerability to
   global drought.},

Title = {Using biodiversity indicators to identify priority areas for freshwater
   conservation in the African ``Mediterranean Basin{''} biodiversity
   hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The conservation of freshwater biodiversity is a global challenge for
   conservation biologists. The loss of fresh-water biodiversity in the
   Mediterranean basin is particularly concerning given its biodiversity
   hotspot status and that its landscapes have been subject to
   anthropogenic modification and pressures for millennia. Most research on
   this region has focused on the conservation of the European region of
   the hotspot while knowledge regarding the north African part of the
   basin is much more limited. Recent research on aquatic insects has
   indicated that considering the combined richness of mayflies
   (Ephemeroptera) and aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) at the genus level is
   an effective surrogate for wider freshwater biodiversity within
   Mediterranean areas. For the first time, we use Ephemeroptera and
   aquatic Coleoptera biodiversity (using richness, rarity complementarity
   and irreplace-ability) to identify freshwater biodiversity conservation
   priority areas in the African sector of the Mediterranean Basin global
   biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we undertake a gap analysis to
   determine how effective protected areas are in conserving the areas
   identified. Freshwater biodiversity conservation priority areas were
   mainly located in mountainous areas in the north of Morocco, Algeria and
   Tunisia, close to the Mediterranean Sea. Surprisingly, almost 80 \% of
   these areas are currently unprotected. These results indicate the urgent
   need for policies and international agreements to protected North
   African freshwater biodiversity.},

Title = {Private landowners' childhood nature experiences affect their feelings
   of connectedness-to-nature and land stewardship as adults},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Achieving land conservation goals cannot be accomplished with policies
   aimed at public lands alone but criti-cally depends on private land
   stewardship. Therefore, understanding what motivates private landowners
   to engage in land stewardship is vital. Connection with nature is a more
   recently developed construct that provides additional explanations for
   pro-environmental behaviors, next to more established
   social-psychological con-structs. We investigated the interactions
   between childhood experiences in nature as well as adults' connection
   with nature and environmental concerns, and how these affect private
   landowners' stewardship behaviors. We collected data with a large survey
   of 1200 Ontario landowners and analyzed the 598 responses with
   structural equation modeling. We conducted additional analyses to
   investigate possible effects of landowner demographic characteristics
   using bootstrap validation. Our results suggest that childhood
   experiences in nature affect adults' connection with nature and land
   stewardship behaviors, but not their environmental concerns. In turn,
   connection with nature may affect private land stewardship behaviors
   indirectly through environmental con-cerns as well as directly. Some of
   these relationships were modified by landowner employment status,
   income, participation in conservation programs, and political
   orientation. We speculate that landowners' engagement with environmental
   topics, their perception of personal responsibility for environmental
   issues, and their exposure to environmental degradation, influence
   social-psychological relationships that precede the enactment of private
   land stewardship behaviors. Reduced childhood experiences in nature may
   be a contributing factor that is limiting private land stewardship
   behaviors and constraining the achievement of land conservation goals.},

Title = {Floral resources predict the local bee community: Implications for
   conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Flowering plants provide critical resources for wild bees. Consequently,
   enhancing flowering plant communities through hedgerows or flower strips
   has become a common recommendation to support native pollinator
   populations. Meta-analysis finds that enhancements are associated with
   higher local bee diversity. However, many studies have also examined the
   impacts of unmanipulated (i.e., existing, naturally occurring) plant
   communities on the local bee community. These studies have typically
   been excluded from meta-analysis, leaving a partial picture of how local
   plant communities influence bees. We compiled studies of either approach
   that looked for an association between bee abundance and/or diversity
   and local floral resources, measured as floral abundance and/or
   diversity. From literature surveys, we discovered 60 relevant studies,
   from which we extracted 133 different effect sizes. Then, using
   meta-regression, we examined four relationships between floral community
   traits (i.e., floral abundance and diversity) and bee community traits
   (i.e., abundance and diversity). Overall, we found strong associations
   between the plant community and the bee community, regardless of study
   design, or ecosystem type. To ensure the support of abundant and diverse
   wild bee populations, our results indicate plant enhancements should be
   designed to optimize both floral diversity and abundance.},

Title = {Macroevolutionary perspectives on Anthropocene extinction},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A great deal of macroevolutionary research on extinction has focused on
   large-scale processes, particularly mass episodes. In contrast, many
   recent conservation studies focus on Anthropocene dynamics at the
   population level. We discuss three ways in which a synthesis between
   these perspectives might illuminate hidden assumptions of value and
   reveal promising agendas for conservation biology. First, some lineages
   may have been on extinction trajectories before global change commenced.
   While it may be difficult to quantify this directly, the potential for
   pre-existing net-negative diversification rates in lineages or terminal
   declines in species may have a strong impact on our ethical valuations
   of biodiversity and consequent management decisions. Second, it is
   worthwhile to quantify the shape and scale of the Sixth Extinction
   relative to previous mass extinctions and we outline and model several
   relevant parameters, including the initial magnitude and subsequent
   change in diversification rates contributing to recovery. Placing recent
   estimates of Anthropocene extinction rates into a historical
   macroevolutionary context may suggest more precise frameworks for
   interpreting and extrapolating present-day patterns. Third, focusing on
   recovery dynamics from previous mass extinctions may be valuable, as
   quantitative models of present-day extinction portend various scenarios
   for future re-diversification. In this context, ``con-servation{''} is
   less about preserving past or existing states, but rather creating and
   promoting novel starting points for the near-term function and future
   evolution of biodiversity, differing from pre-human trajectories.
   Integrating historical and present-day perspectives on extinction
   promises a synergistic research program holding potential insights for
   macroevolution, conservation, and environmental ethics.},

Title = {Spatial heterogeneity and socioeconomic transformation challenge the
   prevention of illegal wildlife consumption in China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wildlife can be viewed as a renewable resource at ecologically viable
   levels, but illicit consumption is a major threat to global
   biodiversity. Using data from crime cases is an emerging new tool for
   assessing the motives and drivers of wildlife offenders. This approach
   can be used with behavior change frameworks to devise more effective
   conservation strategies. We used data from 20,145 online judgments
   published between 2014 and 2019 to determine the spatial distribution of
   different wildlife crime and illegal consumption patterns across China,
   and used multiscale modeling to test the effects of socioeconomic,
   geographic, and demographic correlates. The results indicated that
   geographic indicators and agricultural practices had a broad and
   positive impact on wildlife consumption, implying wildlife availability
   was a powerful incentive for wildlife crimes. In addition, urbani-zation
   and industrial structure were regionally sensitive in predicting
   convictions for wild meat, traditional medicine, and human-nature
   conflicts. Given the socioeconomic transformation in modern China, we
   predict that functional approaches of wildlife utilization will decrease
   in the coming years, but the illegal consumption characterized by
   financial and spiritual demand is unlikely to diminish. As a response,
   the prevention strategy should strengthen law enforcement on
   non-functional consumption and enhance nature education campaigns among
   youths across the country.},

Title = {Ethics in biodiversity conservation: The meaning and importance of
   pluralism},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Addressing the global extent of the current biodiversity crisis requires
   engaging with the existence of multiple equally legitimate values, but
   also with diverse ethical perspectives underpinning conceptions of right
   and wrong actions. However, western monist positions have mostly
   explicitly or implicitly directed conservation strategies by defining
   the space of legitimate arguments, overlooking solutions that do not fit
   neatly the chosen approaches. As ignoring diverse ethical positions
   leads to injustices and reduces the potential of conserving
   biodiversity, there is a need to recognise and navigate the ethical
   landscape. Ethical pluralism may provide opportunities to do so.
   However, the ethical underpinnings of pluralism have not been fully
   considered in biodiversity conservation. In this article, we elaborate
   the meaning, importance and limits of ethical pluralism while
   highlighting opportu-nities and challenges that the position may entail
   in biodiversity conservation science and practice. We argue that ethical
   pluralism allows recognising not only the existence of incommensurable
   plural values, but also that moral conflicts should embrace intra and
   inter-cultural criticism and the legitimacy of agonism and dissent, as
   opposed to monistic and relativistic approaches. We conclude by
   discussing how grounding ethical pluralism in envi-ronmental justice and
   environmental pragmatism may contribute to navigating the ethical
   landscape in biodi-versity conservation. Particularly, we highlight
   opportunities to: i) promote (non-anthropocentrically understood)
   recognition and environmental justice in biodiversity conservation and,
   ii) move beyond theoretical debates seeking the single best ethical
   theory and focus on ethical diversity as a common source of possible
   solutions.},

Title = {A review of two decades of government support for managing alien plant
   invasions in South Africa},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large sums of money are spent globally on invasive alien plant control
   projects, but their effectiveness in the medium to long term is seldom
   reported. Here we review the cost, extent and effectiveness of the
   management of plant invasions by South Africa's ``Working for Water{''}
   program between 1998 and 2020. We use a broad framework of indicators
   for assessing the inputs, outputs, and outcomes of alien plant control
   interventions at a national level. Our study is based on (1) spatially
   explicit data on efforts that targeted selected sites and species for
   control; (2) surveys of the extent of invasion; and (3) case studies of
   control effectiveness. An average of ZAR310 million (adjusted to 2020
   values) was spent annually, creating the equivalent of 8113 full-time
   jobs, with expenditure rising rapidly between 1998 and 2003 and again
   between 2009 and 2015, dropping more recently. Control efforts were
   directed at 178 species, with 15 taxa receiving two thirds of the total
   expenditure. Control was conducted on similar to 76,000 sites covering
   2.7 million ha, which is similar to 14 \% of the estimated invaded area.
   Over a quarter of the control was not in priority areas for biodiversity
   and/or water conservation. The effectiveness of control operations has
   not been monitored regularly, but a few studies at local scales have
   found reductions in alien plant cover, and it is likely that ``Working
   for Water{''} has had a role in limiting invasion. Nonetheless, national
   surveys suggest that plant invasions have continued to grow-the problem
   is too large to expect that control can be achieved everywhere. We
   recommend that, to bring plant invasions under control at priority
   sites, a national strategy should be based on conservation triage,
   focussing on clearly defined priority sites, improving planning and
   monitoring, and increasing operational efficiency.},

Title = {Understanding the diversity of values underpinning forest conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Values are the motivational goals that underpin individual and group
   decisions, attitudes, and behaviours, and often influence the success of
   conservation. Existing studies have provided insight into the
   perceptions and attitudes of stakeholders towards forest conservation
   values. However, there are still contentions among different
   stakeholders regarding the values underpinning conservation policies and
   programs. It is still unclear what values matter most to people in
   forest conservation. Moreover, the specific values that can motivate and
   empower people to participate in conservation remain poorly understood.
   We examined these issues using the human value orientation lens, a
   framework that captures the features of human relationships and
   interactions with forests and with other forest users. Given the need
   for conservation policies and programs to align with the priorities of
   local people, characterising multiple stakeholder perspectives can help
   us to better understand and untangle the conflicting interests and
   diverse motivating values influencing conservation policies and
   programs. Working in Nigeria, a country with one of the highest rates of
   global deforestation, we use the Q-methodology to capture and describe
   the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders regarding the values that
   underpin forest conservation. We identify three factors representing
   these values, and show heterogeneity in the viewpoints held by different
   stakeholders. The first factor explained 24 \% of the study variance and
   identified environmental and management values as essential. This
   viewpoint was largely held by hierarchical stakeholders, forest experts,
   and forest staff. The second factor explained 12 \% of the study
   variance, and identified cultural values that were predominantly held by
   forest users. The third factor explained 13 \% of the study variance,
   and identified economic values that were mostly held by forest experts
   and forest users. Our study shows a diversity of value types held for
   forest conservation and that there are broad differences between
   stakeholders regarding their viewpoints. To enhance conservation
   success, in addition to focussing on consensus values, decision- and
   policymakers should better differentiate value types that target the
   specific needs of stakeholders.},

Title = {Science learning in biodiversity citizen science: Inputs from the
   analysis of online social interactions within a contributory project for
   pollinators' monitoring},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Biodiversity citizen science projects are both valued for their
   contribution to scientific research and for their impact on
   participants' science learning and engagement towards the environment.
   In this paper, we assess the impact of participation in a biodiversity
   citizen science project (the Spipoll, dedicated to pollinators'
   monitoring) through the analysis of online interactions within the
   program's data sharing platform. By drawing on a previous qualitative
   analysis of the comments exchanged by the participants within this
   platform, we focus on those comments which share items on aspects of
   biology and ecology related to the Spipoll program. This sample gathers
   2009 comments from 2010 to 2018. We first classified the different
   constitutive elements from these comments into seven categories
   following the topics they deal with. We then studied the temporal change
   in occurrence of each of these topics from 2010 to 2018. We show that
   long-term participation is associated with the growing expression of
   scientific procedural skills: formulation of hypothesis and explanation,
   proposition of new research questions. To our knowledge, our study is
   the first one that detects the acquisition of such pro-cedural skills in
   biodiversity citizen science. We also show that long-term participation
   is associated with the growing attention to natural seasonal cycles.
   This study finally illustrates the value of the online traces of citizen
   scientists' activities to analyze participants' outcomes of citizen
   science. Consequently, it should encourage the development of such
   online communication spaces within contributory projects, without
   restricting them to online citizen science.},

Title = {Landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in mixed
   farm-forest landscapes of Northern Europe: Clear-cuts do not compensate
   for the negative effects of plantation forest cover},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To assess the biodiversity consequences of contemporary land-use trends
   in Northern Europe, where agriculture is being replaced by forestry, we
   need a better knowledge of the contributions of constituting habitats to
   biodiversity. Here, we use purposefully collected data from 87 sites to
   model how agricultural habitats, including semi-natural pastures, sown
   temporary grassland (leys), cereal crops, and forest habitats comprising
   both mature production forests and clear-cuts, contribute to
   landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in
   boreonemoral Sweden. At the local scale, species richness was highest in
   semi-natural pastures, intermediate in cereal crops and leys and lowest
   in forest. In clear-cuts, species richness was similarly high to that in
   semi-natural pastures. Countryside species-area models show that at a
   landscape scale, the high local richness in clear-cuts was more than
   offset by the low species richness encountered in forest. At landscape
   scale, semi-natural pastures, and in the case of plants also cereal
   crops, were major contributors of unique species. Leys and semi-natural
   pastures were both important contributors to bumblebee diversity. The
   effect of the surrounding landscape composition on local diversity was
   weak, suggesting that area-based approximations of landscape-scale
   species richness were reasonable. We conclude that clear-cuts constitute
   habitats for open-land species but cannot maintain landscape -scale
   diversity in the face of agricultural abandonment when open land is
   replaced by even-aged production forests. Maintaining farmland, in
   particular semi-natural pastures but also cereals and leys, is therefore
   critical to maintaining the landscape-scale species richness of plants
   and insects in forestry-dominated areas.},

Title = {Human-induced deforestation increases extinction risk faster than
   climate pressures: Evidence from long-term monitoring of the globally
   endangered Milne-Edward's sifaka},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures continue to drive the decline of animal
   populations and loss of ecosystems they inhabit, as is the case for many
   nonhuman primates. Climate change can significantly exacerbate ongoing
   human pres-sures and therefore mitigating actions are urgently needed if
   we are to avert impending extinctions. Quantitative extinction risk
   assessments of threatened species are crucial but rarely done due the
   lack of long-term monitoring of populations in the wild. We assessed the
   risk of decline and extinction for the endangered Milne-Edward's sifaka
   (Propithecus edwardsi) - a primate endemic to southeastern Madagascar
   experiencing deforestation of its habitat which is also affected by
   cyclones and drought. We built stochastic population models for the
   species using 34-year population demographic data together with
   climatologies of cyclones and drought from the same period and the
   information on anthropogenic pressures within its range. Our results
   revealed that human -induced deforestation is the most influential
   variable affecting species decline over the next two decades, with the
   species becoming more susceptible to cyclones and drought towards the
   end of the 21st century. Against this backdrop, forest law enforcement,
   community forest management and economic incentives for community-based
   conservation must be implemented to tackle proximate deforestation
   causes. We additionally found that expansion of protected areas could
   support the recovery potential of Milne-Edward's sifaka from
   anthropogenic pressures, and therefore further investment in protected
   area establishment and management, with explicit consideration of the
   wellbeing of local communities, must be a priority.},

Title = {Mapping habitats sensitive to overgrazing in the Swiss Northern Alps
   using habitat suitability modeling},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Unsuitable livestock farming is considered as a main driver of
   biodiversity loss. In the high elevation areas across the world, many
   subalpine and alpine natural herbaceous communities are highly sensitive
   to sheep overgrazing. Such habitats of high biogeographic and
   conservation value are refugia for slow-growing, locally rare, and cold
   -adapted species. However, at a regional scale, no maps of these
   sensitive habitats exist that the authorities could refer to for
   regulating grazing. We therefore studied the possibility of using
   habitat suitability modeling (HSM) to map five selected habitats that
   are potentially threatened by overgrazing in the Northern Alps of the
   Swiss canton of Fribourg. For each habitat, we defined a group of
   characteristic species and gathered their occurrences from national data
   centers. These occurrences were pooled within each group and used as
   presences to calibrate the HSM. High-resolution predictors (10 m) were
   used to achieve fine-scale modeling. The models predicted accurate and
   ecologically relevant distributions for three of the habitats: alpine
   swards and heaths on exposed ridges and peaks, unstable calcareous
   screes and vegetated snow patches. These results show that habitats that
   are topo-graphically and environmentally well-defined can be finely
   predicted by HSM using distributions of character-istic species for use
   in spatial conservation planning. In the context of summer pasture
   management, this helped us to translate the Swiss legal basis onto maps
   of authorized grazing pressure.},

Title = {A comprehensive socio-economic assessment of EU climate policy pathways},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The European Green Deal aims to put the EU on track towards climate
   neutrality by 2050. One of the key elements is a more stringent
   greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 55\% below 1990 levels by
   2030. We analyse the socio-economic consequences of alternative policy
   pathways to reach that target, either relying more on regulatory
   standards, on carbon pricing, or a mix of both. We develop a modelling
   framework that captures macro-economic and sectoral impacts and closely
   aligns economic and energy system modelling. We further decompose
   aggregate labour market outcomes into skill and occupation types, and
   downscale representative household results to micro-level household data
   to evaluate the distributional effects across income groups with
   heterogeneous expenditure patterns. By combining models and datasets,
   our framework enables incorporating a high degree of technological
   detail while revealing socio-economic aspects of the transition that may
   go unnoticed in coarse, aggregate assessments. In particular, our
   results highlight the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy across
   sectors, worker skill types and income groups, which may require
   particular attention in climate policy design and corresponding
   complementary measures to ensure a fair transition to a low-carbon
   economy.},

Title = {The adoption of green public procurement practices: Analytical
   challenges and empirical illustration on Swedish municipalities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the determinants of the
   adoption of green public procurement (GPP) practices at the local
   authority level. A conceptual contribution of the paper is an analytical
   framework, which acknowledges that the adoption of green criteria in
   tenders should be modelled as a conditionally independent decision from
   the decision to rely on GPP strategies (guidelines). This approach can
   help provide novel insights into how various political, organizational,
   and individual characteristics influence GPP. The paper provides an
   empirical illustration by concentrating on the role of organizational
   size. This analysis is based on survey responses from civil servants
   representing 140 Swedish municipalities. The results are based on the
   bivariate ordered probit estimator and suggest that large municipalities
   are more likely to rely on GPP strategies but also less prone to adopt
   green criteria in tenders when controlling for the presence of such
   strategies. In large organizations, the centralization of the
   procurement implies efficiency gains, but it will often be accompanied
   with longer organizational distances between the procuring and the
   environmental departments. The paper also highlights the wider
   implications of the proposed framework, including how future research on
   GPP practices could approach the role of various political and
   individual factors.},

Title = {Would energy poverty affect the wellbeing of senior citizens? Evidence
   from China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Energy poverty is a serious problem worldwide that negatively impacts
   the subjective well-being of elderly residents. This paper aims to
   explore this relationship. Firstly, based on 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018
   data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS)
   launched by Peking University for 125 prefecturelevel cities,
   representing 32,490 observations, this paper effectively and
   multidimensionally measures the level of individual energy poverty.
   Secondly, a mediating model is adopted to study the causal effect
   between energy poverty and subjective well-being through the OLS and
   2SLS methods using carefully selected instrumental variables to overcome
   potential endogeneity. Finally, through a variety of robustness tests,
   the stability of the above causal effects is verified. The results show
   that energy poverty negatively affects senior citizens' subjective
   well-being. Health, depression level, and household food expenditure
   level can be used as the micro mechanism between the two variables. The
   above factors have a greater impact on those senior citizens with low
   educational backgrounds, from relatively low-income families, living
   alone, and having an urban household registration.},

Title = {Beyond climate stabilization: Exploring the perceived sociotechnical
   co-impacts of carbon removal and solar geoengineering},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The scientific literature on the co-impacts of low-carbon energy
   systems-positive and negative side effects-has focused intently on
   climate mitigation, or climate adaptation. It has not systematically
   examined the prospective co-impacts of carbon removal (or negative
   emissions) and solar geoengineering. Based on a large sample of diverse
   expert interviews (N = 125), and using a sociotechnical approach, in
   this study we identify 107 perceived co-impacts related to the
   deployment of carbon removal and solar geoengineering technologies.
   Slightly less than half (52) were identified as positive co-impacts (38
   for carbon removal, 14 for solar geoengineering), whereas slightly more
   than half (55) were identified as negative co-impacts (31 for carbon
   removal, 24 for solar geoengineering). We then discuss 20 of these
   co-impacts in more depth, including positive co-impacts for naturebased
   protection, the expansion of industry, and reduction of poverty or heat
   stress as well as negative coimpacts for water insecurity, moral hazard,
   limited social acceptance and path dependence. After presenting this
   body of evidence, the paper then discusses and theorizes these
   co-impacts more deeply in terms of four areas: relationality and
   risk-risk trade-offs, co-deployment and coupling, intentional or
   unintentional implications, and expert consensus and dissensus. It
   concludes with more general insights for energy and climate research,
   and policy.},

Title = {Are citizens willing to accept changes in public lighting for
   biodiversity conservation?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Light pollution has significantly increased in recent years, in concert
   with urban sprawl. Light pollution consequences for nocturnal wildlife,
   human health, and energy consumption are numerous but are poorly tackled
   in urban policies. The regulation and mitigation of light pollution is
   possible, but requires an important shift in the lighting paradigm,
   including in public lighting often managed by local authorities. One of
   the main sources of reticence of local authorities to regulate light
   pollution is the potential rejection by citizens of lighting changes. In
   this article, we investigate citizens' willingness to accept the
   transition to more sustainable lighting regimes. We use a discrete
   choice experiment in a large French metropolis to measure the relative
   weight of different characteristics of public lighting - light
   intensity, light extinction, light colour - in respondents' decisions.
   We show that respondents are globally open to public lighting shifts,
   but their preferences in terms of the changes are highly heterogeneous.
   By incorporating socioeconomic variables of respondents into our
   econometric models, we characterise the main profiles of preferences
   regarding lighting changes. This provides practical information to urban
   and environmental planners allowing them to match the municipalities
   where the need for light pollution control is a priority with those
   where measures seem socially acceptable by citizens.},

Title = {The practical feasibility of working time reduction: Do we have
   sufficient data?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Working time reduction may be one of the great achievements of the 21st
   century, potentially delivering environmental, social, and economic
   benefits. However, implementation at the level of organizations is not
   straightforward. Reliable data on working hours are needed to track
   changes, so the limited availability or poor quality of data may prevent
   certain types of reductions. Here we explore the factors that influence
   data quality in different contexts on the basis of 28 expert interviews.
   We list more than ten interrelated factors that matter, including
   descriptors of the work context, the motivations and functions of
   measurements, definitions of working time applied, as well as approaches
   and tools of measurements. For each of these factors, we highlight cases
   when data quality can be expected to be high and low. At the micro
   level, this facilitates the implementation and assessment of reduction
   programmes. At the macro level, it is a first step towards more
   realistic models, which helps to establish policy priorities concerning
   the role of direct regulation as opposed to cultural and institutional
   changes driving reductions in working hours.},

Title = {The potential impact of fishing in peruvian marine protected areas
   (MPAs) on artisanal fishery poverty during El Nino events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {202},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Peru, the fishing sector, particularly artisanal fishing, is one of
   the most impacted by El Nin similar to o phenomenon. One possible
   adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative economic effects of El Nin
   similar to o is the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This
   study measures the effect on poverty of artisanal fishers of being able
   to fish in Peruvian MPAs in the face of the El Nin similar to o.
   Therefore, using propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of
   the El Nin similar to o 2015 event on the income of fishers by comparing
   the poverty levels of fishers with and without access to the MPAs. The
   study estimated no significant effect of the MPAs on probability of
   poverty reduction in two out of three MPAs but a 29\% (17\%;42\%) was
   detected at one MPA. The results indicate that fishing in Peruvian MPAs
   could reduce the vulnerability of artisanal fishers to El Nin similar to
   o. Additionally, this study concludes that the estimated impact in
   reducing the effects of El Nin similar to o on the poverty depends
   largely on the participation of fishers in its management and highlights
   the importance of taking a transdisciplinary and cross sector approach
   to MPA design and management to ensure the potential benefits of MPAs
   can be realised.},

Abstract = {Sustainable consumption is a growing niche with an increasing number of
   initiatives aimed at lowering domestic environmental consumption
   footprints. Third-party assured product eco-labelling has emerged as a
   key governance mechanism to promote sustainable consumption. However,
   does the purchasing of eco-labelled products really support a transition
   towards more sustainable consumption? In this paper, we explore
   eco-labelling through the lens of the rebound literature. While
   theorizing of the rebound effect originated in energy economics and has
   long been centred on eco-efficiency, we extend its rationale to products
   that are associated with a price premium in return for added
   environmental quality attributes. Reporting on two inter-related studies
   into the link between purchasing of environmentally friendly products
   and different types of environmental resource consumption, we find that
   eco-labelled products flourish in more affluent economies that are
   characterized by higher levels of overall resource consumption; and that
   willingness to consume environmentally friendly products is positively
   related to higher individual carbon, water and material footprints.
   Hence, we argue that ecolabelling in its current form is inextricably
   linked to higher - rather than lower - levels of resource consumption.
   Consequently, the governance mechanism that underpins eco-labelling is
   associated with an indirect behavioural consumer rebound effect.},

Title = {Diagnostic, regenerative or fossil-free- exploring stakeholder
   perceptions of Swedish food system sustainability},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In an analysis of food system sustainability challenges and solutions
   among Swedish food system actors using Q -methodology, five perspectives
   were identified. One of the main three perspectives placed the highest
   priority on reduced meat consumption, food waste, and climate impact in
   agriculture, but downplayed strategies highlighted in the national food
   strategy and social aspects, and can be interpreted as a diagnostic
   climate mitigation-oriented perspective that does not reflect current
   negotiated policy processes or `softer' values of food. In an
   alternative regenerative perspective, industrialized large-scale farming
   and lack of internalization of external costs were regarded as the main
   problems, and diversity, soil health, and organic farming as the main
   solutions. Proponents of a third perspective regarded phasing out fossil
   fuels, increased profitability of companies, increased meat production,
   and self-sufficiency as high priorities. These contrasting views can be
   a major barrier to transforming the Swedish food system. However, a
   number of entry points for change (i.e. aspects highly important for
   some and neutral for others) were identified, including focusing on
   healthy diets and increased production of fruit and vegetables. Focusing
   on these can build trust among stakeholders before moving to discussions
   about the larger and more sensitive systemic changes needed.},

Title = {Coping with increasing tides: Evolving agglomeration dynamics and
   technological change under exacerbating hazards},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {202},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {By 2050 about 70\% of the world's population is expected to live in
   cities. Cities offer spatial economic advantages that boost
   agglomeration forces and innovation, fostering further concentration of
   economic activities. For historic reasons urban centers cluster along
   coasts, which are prone to climate-induced flooding and sea level rise.
   To explore trade-offs between agglomeration economies and hazards
   increasing with climate change, we develop an evolutionary agent-based
   model with heterogeneous boundedly-rational agents who learn and adapt
   to a changing environment. The model combines migration decision of both
   households and firms between safe Inland and hazard-prone Coastal
   regions with endogenous technological learning and economic growth.
   Flood damages affect Coastal firms hitting their labour productivity,
   capital stock and inventories. We find that the model is able to
   replicate a rich set of micro- and macro-empirical regularities
   concerning economic and spatial dynamics. Without climate-induced
   shocks, the model shows how lower transport costs favour the Coastal
   region fueling the self-reinforcing and path-dependent agglomeration
   processes. We then introduce five scenarios of floods characterized by
   different frequency and severity to study the complex interplay of
   hazards with agglomeration patterns affecting the performance of the
   overall economy. We find that when shocks are mild or infrequent, they
   negatively affect the economic performance of the economy. If strong
   flood hazards hit frequently the Coastal region before agglomeration
   forces trigger high levels of the waterfront urbanization, firms and
   households can timely adapt and migrate landwards, thus averting the
   adverse impacts of climate shocks on the whole economy. Conversely, in
   the presence of climate tipping points where the frequency and magnitude
   of flood hazards abruptly intensifies, we find that economic activities
   remain trapped in the hazardprone region, generating lock-ins and
   leading to a harsh downturn of the overall economy.},

Title = {The role of public agricultural extension services in driving fertilizer
   use in rice production in China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fertilizer overuse causes serious environmental degradation, and it is
   important to identify the influencing factors of fertilizer use. To feed
   the largest population worldwide, China has adopted a productivity-led
   agri-cultural policy regime and established the largest public
   agricultural extension system. Given that China is the largest consumer
   of fertilizers, understanding the role of public agricultural extension
   services (PAES) in the context of the productivity-led agricultural
   policy regime can provide a new insight for policy-makers to take
   measures to reduce fertilizer use. Using survey data of 1002 rice
   farmers in 2018, this study employs the treatment-effect model to
   examine the effect of PAES adoption on fertilizer use and its
   heterogeneity. The results show that about 22\% of rice farmers adopt
   PAES. After addressing the endogeneity issue, farmers' PAES adoption
   raises total fertilizer use, nitrogen fertilizer use and fertilizer
   expenditure in rice production by 242.96 kg/ha, 109.37 kg/ha and 1400
   Chinese yuan per hectare (CNY/ha), respectively. The effects of PAES
   adoption on fertilizer use are heterogeneous in different provinces.
   These results indicate that moves should be directed towards altering
   the productivity-led agricultural policy regime, reinforcing the
   development of socialization agricultural service system, and altering
   the contents and approaches of agricultural extension services.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We develop a travel-cost random utility model to estimate the value of
   recreational ecosystem services provided by more than 170 outdoor sites
   located on the island of Maui (Hawaii, USA). Particular emphasis is
   placed on the role of coastal ecosystems by combining recent fine-scale
   data on coral cover and fish biomass with information on almost 3000
   recreation trips taken by Maui's residents. Our approach is grounded in
   economic theory and provides estimates that are directly applicable to
   inform a wide array of coastal management questions. Our results show
   that the 2014-2015 coral bleaching event caused losses in the order of
   \$25 M per year to Maui's residents. We also identify the areas where
   coral reef restoration would maximize welfare gains. Impacts can vary up
   to a factor of 1000 across locations, demonstrating the need to
   carefully consider such heterogeneity in spatial prioritization. Our
   simulations also show how access fees or green taxes can raise funds for
   financing conser-vation measures aimed at bolstering coral reefs
   resilience to climate change.},

Title = {Does circular economy mitigate the extraction of natural resources?
   Empirical evidence based on analysis of 28 European economies over the
   past decade},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Moving towards a circular economy (CE) has become one of the main
   strategic initiatives on a global scale in the search for sustainable
   economic systems. However, the conceptual relationship between
   sustainable develop-ment and the circular economy is a matter of ongoing
   debate. In particular, the extent to which CE initiatives are
   contributing to the mitigation of resource extraction seems to be a
   still unclear topic. This paper investigates the relationship between
   the extraction of natural resources and the CE, and also analyses the
   effects of critical socioeconomic drivers such as economic and
   population growth and economic structures. The analysis is based on a
   panel data covering 28 European countries during the period 2010-2019.
   Results confirm that promoting a shift towards more circular economic
   systems can reduce the extraction of primary resources. However, the
   mitigating effect of CE initiatives remains rather marginal when
   compared to the impact of economic growth. Namely, estimates show that
   the primary resources extracted annually linked to economic growth are
   roughly four times the resources saved by CE initiatives. The findings
   provide evidence that the circularity of economic systems should be
   approached from a systemic perspective that includes both production and
   consumption as well as waste management. In particular, complementary
   measures addressing behavioural consumption are needed if we want to
   achieve a sustainable development.},

   of these consequences. Recent studies question the role of deliberate
   ignorance in environmental contexts. Participants did not avoid
   information regarding the negative consequence of their choices on a
   pro-environmental organization. In addition, the option to remain
   ignorant of this information did not affect their proenvironmental
   behavior. We argue that the procedure that should be followed in order
   to remain ignorant plays a critical role in shaping this decision. We
   employ a binary dictator game where the recipient is a nonprofit
   environmental organization, and manipulate the procedure that dictators
   have to follow to remain ignorant of the recipient's payment. We find a
   significant effect of the applied procedure on both the tendency to
   remain ignorant and the subsequent proenvironmental behavior.},

Title = {Improving the genuine progress indicator to measure comparable net
   welfare: US and California, 1995-2017},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {202},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper argues that important improvements in the Genuine Progress
   Indicator (GPI) can be made by directly calculating the loss of natural
   resources, the benefits of leisure, and adjusting for inequality using a
   global norm, rather than using local, historical benchmarks. Local
   benchmarking is an obstacle to the standardisation and comparability of
   the GPI. We provide alternative methods for the five components that
   have used benchmarking in the standard GPI. We present empirical
   estimates for the GPI of the United States and California over the
   period 1995 through 2017, calculated with and without the alternative
   methods. Using our alternative methods, we show that some differences
   between the GPI of CA and the U.S. are artefacts of the benchmark
   methods. Implementing the alternative methods narrows the gap between
   the CA and the U.S. GPI as it reduces the U.S. environmental costs, and
   removes the artificial differential between CA and the U.S. in the cost
   of inequality. However, we find that the GPI provides insight into net
   welfare not reflected in GDP, both with and without the benchmarking
   methods. Overall, we suggest that the GPI can be significantly improved
   with these high priority revisions without changing the fundamental
   approach or theoretical framework.},

Title = {The evolution and decoupling of in-use stocks in Beijing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Environmental problems have become increasingly serious, with the
   exploitation of global resources, accelerated by increasing population,
   economy and the expansion of the built environment. Understanding in-use
   stocks can help alleviate urban environmental problems, for it describes
   the exchange, storage and transformation of re-sources between
   environment and city, which is the key to urban sustainable development.
   This study estimates the historical evolution of Beijing's in-use stocks
   by bottom-up analysis for 19 sub-types and 117 end-products, including
   buildings, infrastructures, equipment, vehicles, and consumer durables.
   And this study explores the decoupling of in-use stocks and economic
   development using the constructed LMDI-Tapio model and identifies the
   decoupling mechanism of in-use stocks and economic development. Results
   of bottom-up analysis demon-strate that, during 1949-2019, in-use stocks
   expanded almost 80-fold, increasing from 33.92Tg to 2750.30Tg. Buildings
   stocks take the majority of in-use stocks (79.28\%) and non-metallic
   stocks are the largest category (95.54\%). Results of LMDI-Tapio show
   that the in-use stocks and economic development are still in
   Weak-decoupling. Economic growth (179.53\%) and population (32.20\%)
   affect decoupling negatively impacts. Technology (111.73\%) can promote
   the decoupling, but it still needs to be improved. The technological
   effect is less than the economic effect, but it can have an impact
   faster. To achieve the sustainability of the decoupling of in-use
   stocks, the government can improve the technology while optimizing
   economic growth.},

Title = {Slouching or speeding toward net zero? Evidence from COVID-19
   energy-related stimulus policies in the G20},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the size and nature of green fiscal stimulus in the
   G20 countries in response to the COVID-19 crisis, with a focus on the
   energy-related policies. We exploit a new dataset, the Energy Policy
   Tracker (EPT), with detailed information on countries' policies since
   the start of the pandemic. Between January 2020 and December 2021, G20
   countries enacted 913 stimulus measures that have direct impacts on
   energy supply and demand. The average country spent \$395 USD per person
   on energy-related policies. Only 30\% of this amount, on average, is
   devoted to low-carbon measures, mostly in the transit and buildings
   sectors, with considerable variation across countries. To properly
   compare countries' efforts in aligning their COVID-19 stimulus with
   climate goals, we construct a new index, the Green Energy Policy Index
   (GEPI), using principal components analysis, taking into account both
   ``green{''} and ``brown{''} stimulus measures. The GEPI varies
   considerably across countries. We find that on average, countries with a
   ``greener{''} energy-related stimulus are wealthier and have a lower
   emission intensity. On average, countries that have experienced the
   crisis more acutely, both in terms of deaths and gross domestic product
   (GDP) loss, have ``greener{''} stimulus packages. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for future research and climate energy
   policy-making.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We investigate if Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified Norway
   lobster fishing vessels in Sweden got higher prices and sold larger
   quantities after certification was introduced in 2015. Using detailed
   daily panel data and exploiting the fact that the same fishing water
   contains both certified and non-certified vessels, we use a
   difference-in-difference model for analysing demand effects of
   MSC-certification. We find a price premium the first months after the
   launch of the certification scheme for the initial adopters. However,
   this price premium dissipates over time and is mainly found for trawler
   vessels. For trawlers, we also find a negative effect on sold quantities
   the first months after certification but a positive effect a few years
   after certification. Creelers, on the other hand, got a positive effect
   on quantities sold both immediately after certification and after a few
   years. No general effect of MSC certification is found on neither prices
   nor quantities when the entire period January 2012 - January 2018 is
   investigated.},

Title = {Improving acceptance of natural capital accounting in land use decision

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Environmental issues are becoming more urgent. Biodiversity loss,
   climate change, extreme events and global pressures on resources place
   increasing importance on decision making about how natural resources
   should be managed. Natural capital accounting (NCA) is gaining
   popularity as a systematic approach to recognise the full value of
   natural resources such as soil, vegetation, animals, water, and
   biodiversity. To understand perceptions and opportunities for awareness
   and behaviour change relating to the use of NCA, we conducted a
   discourse analysis of 57 interviews with stakeholders across Australia.
   Our aim is to promote discussion and reflection about perceptions of
   natural resources as forms of capital, and the role of NCA to underpin
   management practice change and support sustainability. We identify four
   key areas of contestation that relate to values, complexity, digital
   technology, and the desired future vision of NCA in society. Findings
   include conflicting views around whether NCA should have a diversity of
   tailored approaches or a consistent approach for all and that digital
   technology has and will continue to shape the way NCA is conducted. To
   our knowledge, this is the first paper to take a discourse analysis
   approach to perceptions of natural capital accounting.},

Title = {Needs must? Fair allocation of personal carbon allowances in mobility},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Personal carbon allowances have been of considerable interest in
   environmental research in the last decade, yet no policy implementations
   have been adopted, partly due to uncertainty around the political
   acceptability of equal allowances. We tackled this issue by surveying
   public perceptions of fairness in carbon allowance allocation in urban
   mobility. Qualitative and quantitative inquiry data of 304 respondents
   were analysed statistically and thematically. Three distributive
   principles according to equity perceptions of equality, equity by
   capability, and equity by responsibility, were examined. The
   distribution of personal carbon allowances, which is sensitive to
   differing needs and capabilities, was perceived fairer than the other
   proposed options. The allocation preference differed according to
   isolationist and integrationist approaches, where both equity by
   capability and equity by responsibility evoked talk of benefits and
   burdens that could be produced by emission rights, while those who
   alluded to equality were interested in the distribution of emission
   rights as such. Prioritising needs and capabilities demonstrated that
   questions of managing the daily life still edge ahead of climate
   questions in many citizens eyes. Therefore, policy propositions should
   focus more on the shared mobility practices of everyday life and how
   they could be supported and incentivised towards sustainability. We
   concluded that due to the lack of absolute distributive consensus,
   policies gain legitimacy by procedural equity, and including citizens in
   decision making.},

Title = {A review of socioeconomic indicators of sustainability and wellbeing
   building on the social foundations framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Monitoring progress towards key social and economic goals requires a
   comprehensive understanding of the social, cultural, and economic
   aspects of sustainability and the indicators available to track their
   performance. Through a systematic review of 84 studies focusing on
   socioeconomic indicators of human development, we compiled a
   comprehensive database of 1389 socioeconomic indicators and examined how
   they were used, the data required to apply them, and their overall
   contribution to measuring socioeconomic dimensions of sus-tainability,
   including a comprehensive coverage of wellbeing as viewed from a human
   needs perspective. We mapped the identified indicators against two
   established frameworks, the social foundations of the safe and just
   operating space for humanity, and the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) to assess alignment and oppor-tunities for extension. We
   identified socioeconomic indicators of sustainability not fully aligned
   with existing social foundations and classified these into three new
   social foundations: Family and Relationships, Perception of Self, and
   Social Security. Many indicators, especially those related to measuring
   happiness, hopes and dreams, personal progress, ethnicity and cultural
   background, physical appearance, or intelligence, were also absent from

Title = {Financial profitability of diversified farming systems: A global
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Diversified farming systems are promoted as a pathway to more
   sustainable agricultural production. Yet wide -scale adoption may be
   slow because of uncertainty about the viability of farmer livelihoods on
   diversified farms and entrenched perceptions that monocultures are key
   to making farming profitable. Here, a global meta-analysis of 3192
   effect sizes from 119 peer-reviewed articles provides evidence that
   diversified farming systems are at least as profitable as simplified
   farming systems. Our study showed that, on average, total costs, gross
   income and profits (net income, or gross margin) were higher in
   diversified systems relative to simplified ones, while the benefit-cost
   ratio was equivalent. These results held in developed and developing
   countries and across geographic regions. From a subset of 43 articles
   reporting labour inputs, we found that labour costs increased in
   diversified farming systems, but so did gross incomes leading to farm
   profits equivalent to those in simplified systems and dispelling myths
   that higher labour requirements undermine the viability of
   diversification. Our global meta-analysis provides compelling evidence
   that diversified farming systems are not only viable but actually
   economically preferable to simplified systems in the wide range of
   contexts represented in this study. Policies, markets, investments, and
   value chains need to align with this evidence and promote diversified
   farming systems for the benefit of farmers and rural economies.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},

Abstract = {Public acceptability appears an essential condition for the success of
   low-carbon transition policies. In this paper, we investigate the role
   of self-interest on citizens' preferences for the distribution of costs
   and environmental benefits of energy efficiency policies. Using a
   discrete choice experiment on nationally representative household
   samples of Sweden, Italy, and the United Kingdom, we first investigate
   preferences for national burden-sharing rules and for the distribution
   of environmental benefits accruing primarily in rural and/or urban
   areas. We examine the role of self-interest and self-serving bias in a
   correlational manner by looking at the effects of income and location of
   residency on preferences for these policy attributes. Moreover, we
   investigate the effect of self-serving bias on preferences for
   burden-sharing rules in a causal manner by experimentally priming
   randomly assigned groups of participants to feel either rich or poor.
   Our results suggest that the accountability rule is the most popular and
   the equal-amount rule the least popular burden-sharing rule. Further,
   policies with environ-mental benefits accruing primarily in rural areas
   are least preferred. We find some evidence for self-interest, especially
   through our correlational approach. Finally, across country samples, our
   results reveal heterogene-ity in preferences for policy attributes and
   in the prevalence of self-interest.},

Title = {The costs and benefits of conservation versus logging of old-growth
   native forest: A case history},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pureora Forest Park is one of the largest remaining and most
   ecologically and culturally significant areas of the native forest that
   once clothed almost all the North Island of New Zealand. Systematic
   logging and the estab-lishment of sawmilling villages began in the
   Pureora area in the late 1940s. Concern about the effects of logging of
   virgin forest on native fauna accelerated until 1978, when a widely
   publicised tree-sitting protest led to a forced moratorium. The
   settlement that followed stopped the logging, closed the sawmills, and
   caused mass local unemployment and social conflict. The long-term
   solution required an integrated approach, reconciling the needs of
   economic resource utilisation with those of social welfare and
   biodiversity conservation. This paper describes the processes leading up
   to the unprecedented financial settlement that saved the forest, plus
   the details of the compensation package paid to timber companies for
   broken contracts, and the consequent benefits for conser-vation and
   tourism.},

Title = {Can sedentarization decrease the dependence of pastoral livelihoods on
   ecosystem services?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seasonal migration is a widely distributed livelihood strategy in
   pastoral regions worldwide. To improve live-lihood levels and prevent
   grassland degradation, sedentarization has been broadly adopted.
   However, the dependence of pastoral livelihoods on ecosystem services
   after settlement has scarcely been studied. Here, we develop a new
   framework to visualize the contributions of grassland ecosystems,
   farmland ecosystems and so-cioeconomic systems to pastoral livelihoods
   and take Fuyun County, a typical pastoral county in northwestern China,
   to analyze whether sedentarization decreases the dependence of pastoral
   livelihoods on ecosystem ser-vices by comparing the livelihoods of
   different household types. Settled households derive less income from
   ecosystem services than household types that practice grazing. However,
   settlement has not necessarily reduced the share of income from
   ecosystem services. Settled household types still rely on grassland
   ecosystems, espe-cially sedentary farming households. Although
   pastoralists have undergone tremendous livelihood transitions, livestock
   have always been the main medium by which pastoral households rely on
   ecosystem services and the main source of income. Our results emphasize
   the importance of monitoring pastoral livelihood dynamics and
   implementing matching development strategies after settlement to
   reconcile pastoral livelihoods and ecosystem conservation.},

Title = {Representing human decision-making in agent-based simulation models:
   Agroforestry adoption in rural Rwanda},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Advancing the transition towards more sustainable agriculture requires
   policy interventions that support farmers' adoption of sustainable
   practices. Models can support policy-makers in developing and testing
   interventions. For these models to provide reliable support, their
   underlying assumptions need to reflect reality and hence adequately
   represent human decision-making. This study compares several approaches
   that represent human decision-making. The comparison is applied to
   farmers' decision to adopt agroforestry. An agent-based simulation model
   is calibrated to a case study in rural Rwanda, where socio-economic
   survey data was collected from 145 small-scale farmers. Of these
   farmers, 72 were randomly selected to participate in a roleplaying game,
   during which the players decided about adopting agroforestry. The game
   was conducted to validate the tested decision-making approaches. The
   simulations show that the decision-making approaches predict
   significantly different agroforestry adoption rates. Compared with the
   role-playing game, the Theory of Planned Behaviour exhibits the highest
   validity. Rational choice theory and the econometric approach
   overestimate implementation. Bounded rationality approaches
   underestimate the share of adopters. The results highlight the
   importance of adequately representing farmers' adoption decisions in
   models for providing reliable forecasts and effective policy support.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Policy makers, regulators, and banking supervisors are increasingly
   assigning significant financial resources to change consumption,
   production, and business models to be more environmentally friendly.
   Effective climate risk management and sustainable economic development
   both require the full involvement of an economy's financial system,
   particularly in countries with both a well-developed banking system and
   a high rate of vulnerability to climate change. How can an economy
   efficiently use the financial system to help tackle climate change? What
   choices are the banks making to combat climate risks while protecting
   the interests of stakeholders? How can these decisions be properly
   assessed? Our analysis offers a unique approach to addressing these
   concerns by using empirical data to create a spectrum of climate risk
   standards that allows us to assess the strategic position of each bank.
   The result is a positioning map of Italian banks on the strategic and
   organizational choices they have made for climate risk management is
   displayed. These results confirm the need for seeking greater
   organizational efforts in particular areas of financial management that
   can strengthen the fight against climate change. These results also
   offer useful insights for policy and managerial orientations to better
   protect the interests of stakeholders.},

Abstract = {In Japan, fishers plant trees in upstream watersheds, known as ``fishery
   forests,{''} to improve coastal environments and secure fishery
   production. Based on observation and experience, fishers have
   traditionally believed that their practices are fit for their intended

   to budget constraints caused by a recent decline in coastal fisheries.
   As such, they are currently faced with the dilemma of deciding whether
   to restore watershed forests to improve the coastal environments or
   minimize expenses in an effort to secure financial sustainability. This
   draws attention to further issues: whether or not fishers can obtain a
   net return on their efforts, and if so-when. To this end, we examine the
   economic value of the traditional ecological knowledge using data of
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Hiroshima, Japan. The results show
   that, while fishery forests mostly pay their costs in the long run, the
   costs are higher than the benefits for the first several years because
   of the initial costs of afforestation. With the aim of contributing to
   holistic watershed management, we propose policy instruments that could
   be employed to alleviate front-loaded costs so that fishers can engage
   in traditional ecological knowledge-based practices.},

Title = {An economic analysis of a zero-deforestation policy in the Brazilian
   Amazon},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This work aims to evaluate alternatives to conciliate economic growth
   and the Amazon preservation. For this, we measured the economic costs to
   preserve the Brazilian Amazon by simulating a zero-deforestation policy.
   We also evaluate the scenario of deforestation in Brazil in the last
   decades. We observed a marked growth in deforestation starting in 2014.
   However, in the last two years, such growth has been even more
   expressive, which shows the urgency of thinking in multiple ways for the
   problem of deforestation in the Amazon Biome. Through an eco-nomic model
   for Brazil, we simulated a shock on land use, which shows that there are
   negative effects on economic dynamism in the Amazon region and that,
   through a spillover effect, there may be even higher rates of greenhouse
   gas emissions. This work also shows that the problem of deforestation in
   the Amazon does not mean only the issue of reducing deforestation rates,
   but that it must be accompanied by a serious and plural policy aiming to
   reduce regional inequalities. Finally, a public and private effort is
   needed so that sustainable practices become more widespread and
   information about the importance of maintaining the forest standing and
   conserving the biome can be disseminated.},

Title = {Designing agri-environmental schemes to cope with uncertainty},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are part of the main tools used by
   decision makers to trigger a transition in agricultural practices but
   one of the factors that discourages farmers from enrolling is the
   uncertainty of the costs and benefits associated with the adoption of
   the new practices. In this study, we distinguish between the ``in-ternal
   uncertainty{''} that is related to the characteristics of the farmer and
   his/her parcels and ``external uncer-tainty{''}, which is related to the
   occurrence of external events. We propose three innovations to better
   account for uncertainty in AES design: the possibility to suspend the
   conditions of the contract for one year, an opt-out option after three
   years and the opportunity for farmers to share their experience in
   peer-groups. We test their attractiveness through a choice experiment
   and analyze our results using a mixed logit model. We find that
   proposing AES that allow suspending the conditions of the contract for
   one year enhances participation.},

Title = {A microeconometric analysis of wildfire suppression decisions in the
   Western United States},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Full suppression strategies remain the dominant option in wildfire
   management, despite a large body of research demonstrating the
   ecological and economic benefits of allowing unplanned wildfires to burn
   under favorable conditions. Consequently, empirical research identifying
   and understanding the factors that contribute to these decisions within
   public land management agencies has become of critical importance in
   efforts to improve management outcomes. This paper assesses the
   importance of a set of institutional and socioeconomic factors with a
   random utility model of incident commander suppression decisions. We
   compare the importance of these factors on chosen strategies before and
   after an update to federal fire policy implementation guidance and an
   associated change to federal fire budgeting policy implemented in Fiscal
   Year 2010. We find that while the update to federal fire policy guidance
   may have been effective at increasing the probability that managers
   adopted a strategy other than full suppression, the subsequent increase
   in suppression budget allotments offset this impact, rendering no true
   difference in probabilities after the policy change.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most challenging problems affecting the
   marine environment of our time. Based on a unique dataset covering four
   European seas and eight European countries, this paper adds to the
   limited empirical evidence base related to the societal welfare effects
   of marine litter management. We use a discrete choice experiment to
   elicit public willingness-to-pay (WTP) for macro and micro plastic
   removal to achieve Good Environmental Status across European seas as
   required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Using a
   common valuation design and following best-practice guidelines, we draw
   comparisons between countries, seas and policy contexts. European
   citizens have strong preferences to improve the environmental status of
   the marine environment by removing and reducing both micro and macro
   plastic litter and implementing preventive measures favouring a
   pan-European approach. However, public WTP estimates differ
   significantly across European countries and seas. We explain why and
   discuss implications for policymaking.},

Title = {Do livestock environmental regulations reduce water pollution in China?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {China has implemented the world's most robust regime of livestock
   environmental regulations (LERs) to control water pollution caused by
   livestock production. However, little is known about the effectiveness
   of LERs on water pollution and its cost-benefit. This article delves
   into the treatment effects of LERs on water pollution in China by using
   a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator based on manually collected
   LERs data from 101 counties in China during 2006-2017. The results show
   that LERs reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) by an average of 17.82\%,
   but have no continuous dynamic effect on COD reduction. Several
   robustness checks justify this finding. The heterogeneity analysis finds
   that the effect of LERs on water pollution is greater for counties in
   upstream and developed areas, and with high initial pollution levels. A
   back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the total health benefit
   from reduced mortality and morbidity as a result of LERs amounts to
   \$73.27 billion-\$219.53 billion, which is 2.99-8.96 times of the cost
   of LERs from decreased farmers' income.},

Abstract = {Starting in 2013, China's pollution information disclosure program
   raised public awareness of air quality. This study seeks to analyze the
   impact of information disclosure on college desirability. To that end, I
   assemble comprehensive dataset on admission scores for all colleges in
   China for eight years. In an event study setting, I find pollution
   information increases cutoff scores for colleges in clean cities by
   0.3\% for the arts track and 0.6\% for the science track, equivalent to
   20 thousand and 30 thousand high school graduates per year. While
   first-and second-tier colleges see large and robust effects, third-tier
   colleges are not affected by this amenity information shock. The effect
   is more prominent for journalism, economics and environment-related
   majors. My findings confirm the importance of environmental information
   and are consistent with people's avoidance behavior against pollution.},

Title = {A discrete-time bioeconomic model of free-roaming cat management: A case
   study in Knox County, Tennessee},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Unowned free-roaming cats are a global problem due to predation on
   wildlife and the spread of infectious diseases. Programs such as Trap,
   Neuter, and Return (TNR) and Trap-Euthanize (TE) have been used to
   manage cat populations. We present a bioeconomic model using data from
   Knox County, Tennessee, U.S., and some parameters from literature that
   weighs benefits and costs of free-roaming cat management pro-grams. A
   benefit of a management program is the reduction in wildlife killed by
   free-roaming cats, illus-trated in the model by placing a value on
   wildlife. The economic management costs include the costs of trapping
   and neutering, and the procedural and emotional costs of euthanasia. We
   highlight two key factors that determine which management strategy is
   most cost effective. The first is whether cat caretakers cooperate with
   management by decreasing food available for cat groups. The second is
   the value attributed to saving the lives of wildlife and free-roaming
   cats. Based on plausible cat and wildlife values, TNR was the most cost
   effective when caretakers cooperated, but TE was the most cost-effective
   when caretakers did not cooperate. When the model is adjusted for the
   local goals, effort, and information, it can be used as a tool for
   management.},

Abstract = {Understanding the developments of energy efficiency in the context of
   the global energy network is key to advance energy regulation and fight
   climate change. We develop a global panel dataset on energy usage
   accounts based on territorial production, final production and
   consumption over 1997-2014. We apply structural decomposition analysis
   to isolate energy efficiency changes and study the effectiveness of the
   European Union Energy Services Directive {[}2006/32/EC] on energy
   efficiency. The effectiveness of the Directive is mixed. The different
   dynamics found among the European Union members result from differences
   in the ambition of national energy policies and from the structure of
   their supply chains. The observed trends towards energy efficiency gains
   and increases in renewable energy shares are not specific to the
   European Union, but are common among highincome countries. Energy
   policies in high-income countries are less effective for energy
   footprints. Our findings are indicative of energy leakage. Energy
   regulation should account for global supply chains.},

Title = {Inequality and Environmental Impact - Can the Two Be Reduced Jointly?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Deterioration of the natural environment and economic inequality are
   profound concerns in many societies. To avoid adverse environmental side
   effects when implementing policies to reduce inequality, an
   understanding of potential conflicts of objectives is required.
   Different theoretical considerations suggest reducing effects of
   inequality on environmental impact, but also increasing ones. This paper
   provides empirical evidence on the environmental impact of inequality
   through a panel data set of 116 countries over 55 years. The
   multidimensionality of environmental impact is accounted for by relying
   on the six subindices of the Ecological Footprint. Results are discussed
   based on an innovative, graphical approach that allows for the
   assessment of effects of inequality on environmental impact based on a
   country's initial location within the entire observed inequality and
   income range. They suggest that reducing inequality levels increases
   carbon footprints. For surface sealing and the use of forest land, a
   conflict of objectives exists only in relatively rich and egalitarian
   countries, while there is room for jointly reducing environmental
   impacts and inequality in relatively poor and initially unequal
   countries. All results are highly robust to the estimation procedure. We
   conclude that, especially in richer countries, policy measures to reduce
   inequality need to be accompanied by policies that limit harmful
   environmental impacts of income redistribution in order to reduce
   inequality and environmental impact jointly.},

Title = {Macro-level economic and environmental sustainability of negative
   emission technologies; Case study of crushed silicate production for
   enhanced weathering},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Enhanced weathering (EW) involves application of crushed silicate rocks
   on croplands to capture CO2. Although research on EW is gaining
   traction, the missing elements in the literature however are the supply
   chain sustainability impacts associated with large-scale production and
   deployment of crushed silicates for EW purposes. The need to conduct
   sustainability assessments for EW systems in addition to validated
   technical feasibility remains a relevant research gap. In this work, the
   potential economic and environmental impacts associated with production
   of crushed silicates is assessed for eight countries, belonging to two
   separate groups: emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)
   and developed economies (USA, UK, France, and Germany). A total of six
   economic and environmental impact categories are included in the
   assessment; gross domestic product (GDP), gross operating surplus (GOS),
   imports, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and material use. The
   input-output model is used to estimate the economy-wide and macro-level
   sustainability impacts derived from producing crushed silicates.
   Findings show developed economies have relatively high levels of
   positive economic benefits and may experience less negative
   environmental impacts within their national boundaries by `leaking' such
   impacts via imports. Imported consumption for crushed silicate
   production in developed countries were found to be substantially higher
   than that of emerging economies. For the emerging economies, imported
   consumption associated with crushed silicate production constitutes on
   average, less than 10\% whereas for developed economies, imported
   consumption averages 20\%. The UK mining and quarrying sector has the
   highest imported consumption at approximately 30\%. The results of the
   study provide insightful outlook into the opportunities and challenges
   surrounding EW sustainability and is important in informing both
   national and global policy decisions regarding this technique.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {More frequent and punctuated severe events such as dry spells are among
   the more salient manifestations of climate change. Because dry spells
   often co-occur both with heat waves and with longer-term agricultural
   drought and their effects may interact, understanding the effects of dry
   spells and heat waves requires a multi-timescale and multi-stressor
   perspective. Using a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature
   from 1979 to 2016, we provide evidence that 4-5 week dry spells that
   occur during the hottest part of the year depress growth in aggregate
   crop production. The effects of these extreme events are modified by
   existing drought, aridity, and by heat waves. Our findings, focused on
   punctuated events, multiple stressors, and aggregate crop production
   across the globe, complement prior investigations focused solely on
   longer-term phenomena, those that study extreme heat or precipitation in
   isolation, and studies that restrict attention to a small number of
   crops or locations.},

Title = {How much infrastructure is required to support decent mobility for all?
   An exploratory assessment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Decarbonizing transport is crucial for achieving climate targets, which
   is challenging because mobility is growing rapidly. Personal mobility is
   a key societal service and basic need, but currently not available to
   everyone with sufficient quality and quantity. The basis for mobility
   and accessibility of desired destinations is infrastructure, but its
   build-up and maintenance require a substantial fraction of global
   resource use. The question arises, how much mobility and how much
   infrastructure are required to deliver decent, sustainable mobility. We
   explore the relations between mobility levels, mobility infrastructure
   and well-being. We synthesize definitions of decent mobility and assess
   mobility measurements and provide a novel estimate of mobility
   infrastructure stocks for 172 countries in the year -2021. We then
   explore the relations between infrastructure, travelled distances,
   accessibility, economic activity and several `beyond GDP' well-being
   indicators. We find that travelled distances and mobility infrastructure
   levels are significantly correlated. Above levels of -92-207 t/cap of
   mobility infrastructure no further significant gains in well-being can
   be expected from a further increase of infrastructure. We conclude that
   high mobility in terms of distances travelled as well as building up
   mobility infrastructure is only beneficial for well-being up to a
   certain point.},

Title = {Action against invasive species: Charcoal production, beekeeping, and
   Prosopis eradication in Kenya},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prosopis juliflora is an invasive alien leguminous tree introduced as a
   way of combating desertification, deforestation, and improving soil
   fertility. Over time, the tree has reported significant negative
   externalities to farmers. Different strategies such as management
   through utilization and complete eradication have been proposed to
   reduce these externalities. We investigate the various factors
   associated with adherence to these strategies. In the first place, we
   assess the correlates of charcoal production, beekeeping, and
   willingness to completely eradicate Prosopis. We then examine the
   welfare effects of charcoal production and beekeeping. We use survey
   data from 530 smallholder households in the Baringo county of Kenya who
   are currently contending with infestation from the invasive tree.
   Besides other factors, we show that a positive perception about Prosopis
   invasion increases the probability of engaging in charcoal production
   and is adversely related to beekeeping and the willingness to completely
   eradicate Prosopis. Delving into welfare and poverty effects of these
   activities, we find charcoal production to be income increasing. We
   argue that a blend of both management and eradication of Prosopis could
   offer a win-win solution to both improving the welfare and
   socio-economic conditions of households while also ensuring
   environmental and ecological safeguards, with implications for
   broad-based sustainability.},

Title = {Monoculture, crop rotation policy, and fire},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Monoculture farming pollutes the environment by increasing the use of
   inputs, accelerating soil erosion, polluting water resources, raising
   carbon level in the atmosphere, and decreasing biodiversity. Therefore,
   farmers are advised to implement diversified farming systems such as
   crop rotation. However, crop rotation, i.e., planting more than one crop
   in the same field over a given year, may also harm the environment. To
   combat the environmental problems of monoculture, Turkey announced to
   implement a new crop rotation policy in 2020. The government said it
   would not provide support payments if farmers planted the same crop in
   the same plot for three consecutive years. This paper estimates the
   impact of this crop rotation policy on monoculture and shows how
   agricultural fires changed with this policy. We find that Turkey's crop
   rotation policy significantly decreased monoculture practices. Farmers
   decreased their cotton acreages and replaced cotton with wheat as the
   primary and corn as the secondary crop. However, since farmers burn
   their fields after the primary crop is harvested, the number of fires
   tripled after the policy. This environmentally friendly policy
   unexpectedly polluted the envi-ronment. Our paper shows how policies may
   create unintended environmental problems if they do not consider
   farmers' behavioral constraints.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Social media generates a significant amount of information in terms of
   perceptions, emotions, and sentiments. We present an economic analysis
   using the information provided by Twitter messages, describing
   impressions and reactions to wildfires occurring in Spain and Portugal.
   We use natural language processing techniques to analyze this text
   information. We generate a hedonometer estimate on how sentiments about
   wildfires vary with exposure, measured via Euclidean distance from the
   catastrophic event, and air quality. We find that direct exposure to
   wildfires significantly decreases the expressed sentiment score and
   increases the expressions of fear and political discontent (protest).
   Economic valuation of these losses has been computed to be between
   1.49euro-3.50euro/year/Kilometer of distance to the closest active fire.
   Welfare losses in terms of air quality have been computed as
   4.43euro-6.59euro/day of exposure.},

Title = {International expansion of renewable energy capacities: The role of
   innovation and choice of policy instruments},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Which renewable energy (RE) policy instrument is most effective in
   expanding the international diffusion of RE and what is the role of
   innovation? We consider rich policy and patent data for 189 countries
   and territories to investigate these diversely debated questions for
   wind and solar photovoltaic capacities. This allows us, firstly, to
   contribute to the limited evidence on the effect of RE innovation on RE
   diffusion and its interrelated influence with RE support policies.
   Secondly, we can evaluate the disentangled individual policies'
   effectiveness in a broad instrument-country context. Thirdly, we control
   for the inherent endogeneity of policy instruments and inno-vation. We
   find that RE innovation, which appears to be largely policy-induced, is
   among the most promising ways to increase RE capacities. The most
   effective policy instruments tend to be quotas with certificate trading,
   tendering, and fiscal instruments that provide specific investment
   support, i.e. investment tax credits and capital subsidies. Less
   tangible and projectable measures, such as the most commonly implemented
   sales-related tax reductions and RE targets, are least effective. While
   interactions between instruments influence the composition of a
   well-designed policy mix, there are also differences in the policies'
   effectiveness and role of innovation depending on the countries' level
   of development.},

Title = {Valuing Recreation in Italy?s Protected Areas Using Spatial Big Data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Protected areas offer unique opportunities for recreation, but the
   non-market nature of these benefits presents a significant challenge
   when trying to represent value in the decision-making processes. The
   most common techniques to value recreation are based on
   resource-intensive primary surveys which are difficult to perform at a
   large scale or in remote locations. This is true in the case of Italy,
   where a large and diverse network of protected areas suffers from lack
   of data. Here, we offer an alternative data source for the valuation of
   recreation by integrating the metadata of geotagged photographs from
   social media into single-site, individual travel cost models for 67
   Italian protected areas. Count data model results are generally
   consistent with standard economic and consumer demand theory for
   ordinary goods, with a zero-truncated Poisson model returning down
   sloping demand curves for 50 of 67 sites. A significant travel cost
   coefficient was returned for 33 sites (p-value <0.05) for which consumer
   surplus estimates were found in the range between euro6.33 and
   euro87.16, with a mean value per trip of euro32.82. Although not without
   their own challenges, the results presented highlight the possibilities
   of new forms of spatial big data as a novel data source for
   environmental economists.},

Title = {The environmental cost of the international job market for economists},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We provide an estimate of the environmental impact of the recruitment
   system in the economics profession, known as the ``international job
   market for economists ``. Each year, most graduating PhDs seeking jobs
   in academia, government, or companies participate in this job market.
   The market follows a standardized process, where candidates are
   pre-screened in a short interview which takes place at an annual meeting
   in Europe or in the United States. Most interviews are arranged via a
   non-profit online platform, econjobmarket.org, which kindly agreed to
   share its anonymized data with us. Using this dataset, we estimate the
   individual environmental impact of 1057 candidates and one hundred
   recruitment committees who attended the EEA and AEA meetings in December
   2019 and January 2020. We calculate that this pre-screening system
   generated the equivalent of about 4800 tons of avoidable CO2-eq and a
   comprehensive economic cost over euro4.4 million. We contrast this
   overall assessment against three counterfactual scenarios: an
   alternative in-person system, a hybrid system (where videoconference is
   used for some candidates) and a fully online system (as it happened in
   2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Overall, the study can offer
   useful information to shape future recruitment standards in a more
   sustainable way.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A particularly visible aspect of multidimensional approaches to human
   development and ecological boundaries has been the elaboration of
   various types of indicators. But such an activity has often proceeded
   without much scrutiny of: (i) the theory and philosophy that underpins
   the multidimensional conception expressed through those indicators; and
   (ii) the socio-economic structure behind those indicators. This article
   addresses those questions, through a comparison of two authors who
   pioneered multidimensional approaches aimed at a more humane and
   sustainable approach to development: A. K. Sen, who focused essentially
   on human development; and E. F. Schumacher, who also advocated a humane
   approach to development, but within a conception where ecological
   sustainability is at the core of the analysis.},

Title = {Fisher preferences for marine litter interventions in Vietnam},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine litter pollution is a global environmental problem, found in all
   oceans and with substantial impacts on marine ecosystem services,
   maritime economic activity, public health, and aesthetics. To develop
   socially acceptable policies to foster behavioral change, it is
   necessary to understand the perceptions of practical measures to curb
   marine litter pollution by key stakeholders. We employ a Best-Worst
   Scaling approach to investigate preferences of fishers for implementing
   abandoned, lost, and otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) control
   measures to curb marine litter pollution in Vietnam. The results show
   that the perceived effectiveness of proposed measures to address ALDFG
   varies among fishers and between fisheries, implying a ``one size fits
   all{''} approach would not work in this context, though there are areas
   of agreement. While fishers perceive `awareness raising' and `onshore
   collection' to be most effective measures, the use of `biodegradable
   gear' and `gear-lost reports' are perceived least effective in combating
   ALDFG. Our results suggest the improvements of waste facilities in
   ports, on small islands, and in coastal areas to encourage fishers to
   dispose of their unwanted gear appropriately, coupled with targeted
   awareness-raising programs to increase fishers' awareness of ALDFG
   impacts on marine environment.},

Title = {A hybrid and hierarchical stated preference study of freshwater
   restoration in Aotearoa New Zealand},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Freshwater quality is multi-dimensional with many interrelated
   activities, indicators, and demand-relevant values. Environmental
   managers have a regulatory obligation to invoke social values when
   deciding on specific restoration activities to fund and must balance
   values with other criteria. However, it is often difficult to apply
   non-market values to operational decisions because valuation studies are
   either not decision-relevant, ecologically irrelevant, incomplete in
   scope, or not able to be disaggregated to the required spatial scale.
   This paper describes the design, implementation and results of a stated
   preference survey strategically positioned to be relevant to freshwater
   restoration institutions in Aotearoa New Zealand. The study uses a
   hybrid approach with different measurement methods to measure
   preferences for crown restoration activities and decompose those
   preferences by different restoration goals. The recently developed
   Multiple Discrete-Continuous Nested Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model is used
   to analyse budget allocation responses. At the most disaggregated level,
   discrete choice questions are used to evaluate quality and distance
   trade-offs. The hierarchical approach ensures responses are internally
   scope-and-scale consistent.},

Title = {Assessing the economic impacts of forest certification in Spain: A
   longitudinal study},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},
Number = {A},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Forest certification has become a strategic instrument for businesses,
   particularly for accessing sensitive envi-ronmental markets and within
   sustainability commitments. This trend is also visible in Spain, where
   PEFC (Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) certification
   has increased by 91\% in the past five years. However, there is a weak
   understanding of the certification impacts at the level of companies,
   especially when it comes to economic impacts. This study applies a
   longitudinal methodology to measure financial performance before and
   after obtaining PEFC-certification in Spain by analysing treatment and
   selection effects. The results show significant differences in economic
   profitability and turnover between certified and non-certified
   com-panies prior to certification. However, these differences are not
   significant in subsequent periods. Therefore, we could not confirm a
   treatment effect between forest certification and improved financial
   performance. Instead, we find a positive selection effect: companies
   with better financial performance have a greater propensity for
   certification, as has been previously detected for standards such as ISO
   9001/14001. Compared to previous studies that predominantly assess
   economic impacts qualitatively, we use economic-financial data to avoid
   possible distortion emerging from perceptions and opinions. The main
   contribution of this study lies in the quantitative assessment of the
   impacts of forest certification on economic profitability and turnover.},

Title = {Does legislation improvement alleviate the decoupling between welfare
   and wealth in China?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With an increasing decoupling trend between welfare and wealth,
   alleviating the decoupling trend has become a key issue on the agenda of
   sustainable development. This paper verifies the existence of the
   decoupling and examines the effects of legislation on the trend. By
   conducting an analysis on China's 31 provinces from 1986 to 2018, we
   find that legislation improvement can notably alleviate the decoupling
   trend. The effects vary across legislation characteristics as well as
   across socioeconomic circumstances. First, legislations of high legal
   validity have long-term alleviation effects, and legislations of lower
   validity have immediate benefits. Second, legislations issued by higher
   authorities take effect in a larger jurisdiction scope, while those by
   lower authorities can tailor the legislations to satisfy local needs.
   Third, the effects of environmental legislations on remedying the
   decou-pling trend are significantly greater than those of
   non-environmental legislations. Fourth, as an economy de-velops and the
   role of law steps up, the marginal effects of legislation on alleviating
   the decoupling show a generally diminishing trend, so the legislations
   should give priority to emerging sectors. This study offers the first
   quantitative evidence of the effects of legislation on human welfare. We
   offer suggestions on legislation system to improve human welfare.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper we develop a modified production model to calculate
   changes in pollution abatement costs (PAC) when both data on bad outputs
   and information on the inputs assigned to pollution abatement activities
   are not available. To calculate the PAC of reducing bad output, we
   introduce a measure that captures variation in the abatement intensity
   of technologies used to reduce water discharges. We then decompose the
   change in PAC into three components to identify their relative
   contribution to changes in PAC: (1) changes in the level of inputs, (2)
   changes in pollution abatement intensity, and (3) technological change.
   We demonstrate how to calculate PAC and these three components using
   data from 1997 to 2007 on a sample of pulp mills required to comply with
   the effluent limits for dioxin set by the U.S. EPA's Cluster Rule. We
   find regulation-induced technological change is consistently associated
   with declining PAC, while both changes in inputs and abatement intensity
   are associated with increasing PAC.},

   conservation in Colombia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {204},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs exist globally and at
   times shifting behaviors. Unlike protected areas, PES compensate land
   users raising local acceptance of conservation. Yet some worry that if
   payments are temporary, as is often the case, conservation behaviors can
   be reduced by PES, `crowded-out' to be lower after payments than if no
   PES had existed. We conducted lab-in-the-field experiments in Colombia,
   where PES policies are expanding, with individual or collective
   conditional payments to 676 farmers,potential PES participants. Payments
   end, in each experimental session, randomly for all or only for some
   participants. We consistently find that conservation is not lower after
   PES than before. Also, without PES conservation contributions tend to
   fall, over time, in keeping with public-goods literatures. Taken
   together, these results imply that even after our payments end,
   conservation is above the baseline defined by our controls, suggesting
   some form of at least shortrun crowding in},

Title = {The accumulation and substitution effects of multi-nation certified
   organic and protected eco-origin food labels in China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {We conduct a choice experiment to explore Chinese consumer willingness
   to pay (WTP) for milk with multi -nation organic labels. We also
   consider the interaction between these labels and the novel Protected
   Eco-Origin Product (PEOP) certification as well as different brands. Two
   types of multi-nation organic certification are examined: `double
   certification' (i.e., carrying both the Chinese and EU organic labels)
   and `triple certifi-cation' (i.e., carrying Chinese, EU, and U.S.
   organic labels). Compared to the Chinese organic label alone, consumers
   increase their WTP for double and triple organic certification, but the
   marginal WTP decreases for an additional organic label suggesting a
   negative accumulation effect. Meanwhile, organic and PEOP labels are
   substitutes, with the substitution effect stronger for higher number of
   organic labels. Welfare changes with various combinations between
   multiple organic and PEOP labels, as well as consumer preference
   heterogeneity across labels are analyzed, providing implications on
   producer decision-making, policymaking, and consumer benefit analysis
   with respect to organic and ecolabel certification in general.},

Title = {The determinants of non-residential real estate values with special
   reference to environmental local amenities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the
   determinants of non-residential real estate values in Los Angeles
   County. The data base consists of 13, 370 property transactions from
   1996 to 2005. Separate spatial econometric models are developed for
   industrial, commercial, retail and office properties. The study focuses
   on the impact on property values of environmental local amenities. Our
   analytical results provide insights on how local amenities may affect
   non-residential properties values and how the impact may differ across
   property types. Our empirical results offer evidence that explicitly
   modeling spatial dependence is necessary for hedonic non-residential
   property models where there is interest in local amenities. We also show
   that it is important to account for the temporal dimension since
   ignoring it can lead to misinterpretation of the real measure of spatial
   dependence over time. We find that open space, typically an amenity
   considered to be jointly valuable to firms and households, has either
   weak or non-robust effects on non-residential property values. On the
   other hand, the joint amenities coastal access, air pollution, weather
   and crime appear to have stable spatial correlations with property
   values across specifications. In contrast, those amenities that are
   likely only valued by firms, such as transportation access and proximity
   to concentrations of skilled workers, have robust and significant
   correlations with non-residential values.},

Title = {Payments for ecosystem services as an essential approach to improving
   ecosystem services: A review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There remain considerable controversies over payments for ecosystem
   services (PES) as an essential approach to improving ecosystem services.
   This study reviewed various definitions of PES and explored its economic
   nature; then explored previous methods for estimating the PES standard
   and finally proposed possible agendas for future PES research. Results
   suggested the PES and traditional land rent both originate from the
   monopoly of the providers on use rights of land vital to provision of
   certain ecosystem services, therefore PES should be redefined as a
   special kind of land rent for sharing land use rights of the providers
   to guarantee sustainable provision of certain ecosystem services.
   Besides, there has been no universal methods for estimating the rational
   PES standard due to insufficient understanding of the economic cause and
   nature of the PES. Re-imagining and re-designing PES as a system of land
   rights is advantageous to clearing up misunderstanding and disputes over
   the eco-nomic cause and nature of PES and overcoming limitations of
   existing methods for estimating the PES standard. Additionally, it is
   necessary to further improve the PES schemes based on cost-efficiency
   and explore the methods for estimating the PES standard based on the
   land rent theory and interdisciplinary knowledge.},

Abstract = {Wind speed can have multifaceted effects on organisms including altering
   thermoregulation, locomotion, and sensory reception. While forest cover
   can substantially reduce wind speed at ground level, it is not known if
   animals living in forests show any behavioural responses to changes in
   wind speed. Here, we explored how three boreal forest mammals, a
   predator and two prey, altered their behaviour in response to average
   daily wind speeds during winter. We collected accelerometer data to
   determine wind speed effects on activity patterns and kill rates of
   free-ranging red squirrels (n = 144), snowshoe hares (n = 101), and
   Canada lynx (n = 27) in Kluane, Yukon from 2015 to 2018. All 3 species
   responded to increasing wind speeds by changing the time they were
   active, but effects were strongest in hares, which reduced daily
   activity by 25\%, and lynx, which increased daily activity by 25\%. Lynx
   also increased the number of feeding events by 40\% on windy days. These
   results highlight that wind speed is an important abiotic variable that
   can affect behaviour, even in forested environments.},

Title = {Cover crop species alter tallgrass prairie community assembly},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {413-423},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cover crops are increasingly being used in ecological restoration
   projects, and are hypothesized to facilitate establishment of sown
   species by reducing weed abundances without competing with the target
   mix. We tested these predictions and examined the role of cover crop
   species on later species composition and diversity using cover crop seed
   treatments. Treatments included a fall seeding of one annual (Raphanus
   sativus or Avena sativa), one biennial (Oenothera biennis), one
   perennial species (Elymus canadensis), two grass-forb species
   combinations, or nothing as a control. All plots received the same
   diverse tallgrass prairie seed mix in March of the following year. Plant
   communities were sampled through five growing seasons. We found that
   cover crop treatments influenced community assembly, and that cover crop
   species varied in their effectiveness at reducing weed abundances, with
   the perennial grass E. canadensis being especially effective at reducing
   weeds. After 5 years, treatments were neutral in their effects on
   species diversity. However, composition of establishing plants (not
   including the cover crop) differed significantly among cover crop
   treatments on all sampling dates, indicating that treatments had
   long-term effects. Plots containing the C-3 grass E. canadensis had
   greater abundance of C-3 grasses and forbs, and reduced C-4 grass
   abundance compared to other treatments. Our results indicate that cover
   crop species differ in their effects on assembling tallgrass prairie
   communities and that niche modification (i.e., species altering the
   abiotic environment in a way that favors species that benefit from the
   alterations) occurs when the cover crop is a perennial grass.},

Title = {Legacies of precipitation influence primary production in Panicum

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {269-278},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precipitation is a key driver of primary production worldwide, but
   primary production does not always track year-to-year variation in
   precipitation linearly. Instead, plant responses to changes in
   precipitation may exhibit time lags, or legacies of past precipitation.
   Legacies can be driven by multiple mechanisms, including persistent
   changes in plant physiological and morphological traits and changes to
   the physical environment, such as plant access to soil water. We used
   three precipitation manipulation experiments in central Texas, USA to
   evaluate the magnitude, duration, and potential mechanisms driving
   precipitation legacies on aboveground primary production of the
   perennial C-4 grass, Panicum virgatum. Specifically, we performed a
   rainout shelter study, where eight genotypes grew under different
   precipitation regimes; a transplant study, where plants that had
   previously grown in a rainout shelter under different precipitation
   regimes were moved to a common environment; and a mesocosm study, where
   the effect of swapping precipitation regime was examined with a single
   genotype. Across these experiments, plants previously grown under wet
   conditions generally performed better than expected when exposed to
   drought. Panicum virgatum exhibited stronger productivity legacies of
   past wet years on current-year responses to drought than of past dry
   years on current-year responses to wet conditions. Additionally,
   previous year tiller counts, a proxy for meristem availability, were
   important in determining legacy effects on aboveground production. As
   climate changes and precipitation extremes-both dry and wet-become more
   common, these results suggest that populations of P. virgatum may become
   less resilient.},

Abstract = {Understanding the extent to which species' traits mediate patterns of
   community assembly is key to predict the effect of natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem functioning. Here, we apply a
   trait-based community assembly framework to understand how four
   different habitat configurations (kelp forests, Sargassum spp. beds,
   hard corals, and turfs) shape the trophic and energetic dynamics of reef
   fish assemblages in a tropical-temperate transition zone. Specifically,
   we tested (i) the degree of trait divergence and convergence in each
   habitat, (ii) which traits explained variation in species' abundances,
   and (iii) differences in standing biomass (kg ha(-1)), secondary
   productivity (kg ha(-1) day(-1)) and turnover (\% day(-1)). Fish
   assemblages in coral and kelp habitats displayed greater evidence of
   trait convergence, while turf and Sargassum spp. habitats displayed a
   higher degree of trait divergence, a pattern that was mostly driven by
   traits related to resource use and thermal affinity. This filtering
   effect had an imprint on the trophic and energetic dynamics of reef
   fishes, with turf habitats supporting higher fish biomass and
   productivity. However, these gains were strongly dependent on trophic
   guild, with herbivores/detritivores disproportionately contributing to
   among-habitat differences. Despite these perceived overall gains,
   turnover was decoupled for fishes that act as conduit of energy to
   higher trophic levels (i.e. microinvertivores), with coral habitats
   displaying higher rates of fish biomass replenishment than turf despite
   their lower productivity. This has important implications for
   biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, questioning the
   long-term sustainability of ecological processes and fisheries yields in
   increasingly altered marine habitats.},

Abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of climatic and edaphic gradients can
   substantially affect the grassland productivity function. However, few
   studies have tested the importance of species richness and evenness on
   regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and
   edaphic changes. This study examines the complex mechanisms by which
   species richness and evenness regulate productivity in alpine meadow and
   steppe. We used field survey data to explore above-ground productivity
   formation and sensitivity to spatial-scale climatic and edaphic response
   of alpine grassland based on species richness and evenness. Results
   showed that the growing season solar radiation was the main driving
   factor of above-ground biomass and was strongly negatively correlated
   with above-ground biomass. Furthermore, compared with alpine steppe,
   above-ground biomass in alpine meadow was more responsive to climatic
   variables, but less responsive to soil variables. Unexpectedly, we found
   that the regulation patterns of species richness and evenness on
   above-ground biomass were different in both habitats by a structural
   equation model analysis. Our study demonstrated that species evenness
   and richness were both important in co-regulating above-ground biomass
   in alpine meadow, whereas species richness mattered more than species
   evenness in regulating above-ground biomass in alpine steppe. Our
   results offer further support for species richness and evenness
   co-regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and
   edaphic gradients, which helps maintain the benefits of plant diversity
   and alpine grassland ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The ``ecology of fear{''} framework was developed to describe the
   impacts predators have on potential prey and prey populations, outside
   of consumption/predation (i.e. non-consumptive effects, NCEs). This
   framework has recently been extended to symbiotic interactions such as
   host-parasite associations. Although the NCEs of predators and parasites
   on their individual victims can be measured experimentally, it is
   currently not known whether parasites can exert population-level effects
   on potential hosts through their NCEs. Modelling can be a useful tool
   for scaling individual-level NCEs to populations to determine impacts on
   host population growth. In this study, we used previously published data
   on the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of an ectoparasitic mite
   (Macrocheles subbadius) on a fruit fly (Drosophila nigrospiracula) to
   simulate populations experiencing fear (NCEs only), both fear and
   infection (consumption + NCEs) or neither. Population-level models
   indicate that NCEs alone were insufficient to reduce population growth.
   In fact, host populations experiencing NCEs but not infection had
   slightly larger final populations than unexposed populations (by similar
   to 550 flies). This result suggests there is compensation (i.e.
   increased daily reproduction that overcomes shorter lifespans) among
   exposed flies. By contrast, the consumptive effects of parasites
   suppressed the growth of simulated host populations, and this
   deleterious impact grew non-linearly with infection prevalence.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {When investigating relationships between species' niches and
   distributions, niches can be divided demographically, resulting in
   unique niches for different life stages. This approach can identify
   changing substrate requirements throughout a species' life cycle. Using
   non-metric multidimensional scaling, we quantified microsite conditions
   associated with successful recruitment in the tundra landscape and
   successful seed production amongst adult trees of black spruce (Picea
   mariana) at subarctic treeline in Yukon, Canada to assess how life
   stage-specific requirements may impact the distribution of this
   widespread boreal tree species. Treeline ecotones in this region showed
   high heterogeneity in tundra microsites available for establishment.
   Black spruce exhibited changing microsite associations from germination
   to reproductive maturity, which were mainly driven by changes in plant
   community and soil moisture. These associations limit the microsites
   where individuals can establish and reproduce to a subset available
   within the heterogeneous landscape. Overall, we suggest that (1)
   substrates suitable for early recruitment are limited at the range edge;
   and (2) reproductive adults have a narrow niche, limiting successful
   seed production in adults and forming sink populations where suitable
   conditions are limited. Our multivariate assessment of microsite
   suitability can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution
   of a species throughout its life cycle and identify life stage-specific
   constraints to range expansion.},

Volume = {200},

Abstract = {Litter decomposition is a central ecosystem function because dead plant
   biomass plays a critical role in carbon storage, the nitrogen (N) cycle,
   and as food/habitat for animals and microorganisms. In the face of
   global change, interactions between organisms that participate in litter
   decomposition are likely to change due to species loss and N pollution.
   To understand how these global change factors may interact to alter
   litter decomposition, we manipulated the detritivore community and N
   concentrations in a coastal salt marsh for 2 years. We chose to
   manipulate densities of a dominant, detritivorous snail (Melampus
   bidentatus) because its population size is expected to decline due to
   climate change, yet its impact on litter decomposition has not been
   tested in the field. We measured litter decomposition rates, detritivore
   densities, and the N concentrations of sediment and litter. We found
   that endogenous N enrichment (N added live plants before decomposition),
   exogenous N enrichment (N added to decomposing plants) and higher
   densities of Melampus increased litter decomposition rates. Linear mixed
   models further revealed that snails, other detritivores, and soil NH4+
   were the best predictors of litter mass loss in the middle stages of
   decomposition. Notably, exogenous N added to litter already enriched
   with N further increased mass loss but did not increase litter \%N. Our
   study reveals how global change in the form species loss and N pollution
   can have palpable impacts on carbon cycling and ecosystem function.},

Title = {Size-selective mortality fosters ontogenetic changes in collective
   risk-taking behaviour in zebrafish, Danio rerio},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Size-selective mortality is common in fish populations and can operate
   either in a positive size-selective fashion by harvesting
   larger-than-average fish or be negatively size-selective by harvesting
   smaller-than-average fish. Through various mechanisms (like genetic
   correlations among behaviour and life-history traits or direct selection
   on behaviour co-varying with growth rate or size-at-maturation),
   size-selection can result in evolutionary changes in behavioural traits.
   Theory suggests that both positive and negative size-selection without
   additional selection on behaviour favours boldness, while evolution of
   shyness is possible if the largest fish are harvested. Here we examined
   the impact of size-selective mortality on collective boldness across
   ontogeny using three experimental lines of zebrafish (Daniorerio)
   generated through positive (large-harvested), negative (small-harvested)
   and random (control line) size-selective mortality for five generations
   and then relaxed selection for 10 generations to examine evolutionarily
   fixed outcomes. We measured collective risk-taking during feeding
   (boldness) under simulated aerial predation threat, and across four
   contexts in presence/absence of a cichlid. Boldness decreased across
   ontogeny under aerial predation threat, and the small-harvested line was
   consistently bolder than controls. The large and small-harvested lines
   showed higher behavioural plasticity as larvae and developed personality
   earlier compared to the controls. The large-harvested line showed
   increased variability and plasticity in boldness throughout ontogeny. In
   the presence of a live predator, fish did not differ in boldness in
   three contexts compared to the controls, but the large-harvested line
   showed reduced behavioural plasticity across contexts than controls. Our
   results confirmed theory by demonstrating that size-selective harvesting
   evolutionarily alters collective boldness and its variability and
   plasticity.},

Abstract = {Seed and soil microbiomes strongly affect plant performance, and these
   effects can scale-up to influence plant community structure. However,
   seed and soil microbial community composition are variable across
   landscapes, and different microbial communities can differentially
   influence multiple plant metrics (biomass, germination rate), and
   community stabilizing mechanisms. We determined how microbiomes inside
   seeds and in soils varied among alpine plant species and communities
   that differed in plant species richness and density. Across 10 common
   alpine plant species, we found a total of 318 bacterial and 128 fungal
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with seeds, with fungal
   richness affected by plant species identity more than sampling location.
   However, seed microbes had only marginally significant effects on plant
   germination success and timing. In contrast, soil microbes associated
   with two different plant species had significant effects on plant
   biomass, and their effect depended both on the plant species and the
   location the soils were sampled from. This led to significant changes in
   plant-soil feedback at different locations that varied in plant density
   and richness, such that plant-soil feedback favored plant species
   coexistence in some locations and opposed coexistence at other
   locations. Importantly, we found that coexistence-facilitating feedback
   was associated with low plant species richness, suggesting that soil
   microbes may promote the diversity of colonizing plants during the
   course of climate change and glacial recession.},

Title = {Species accumulation in small-large vs large-small order: more species
   but not all species?},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {273-284},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although groups of small habitat patches often support more species than
   large patches of equal total area, their biodiversity value remains
   controversial. An important line of evidence in this debate compares
   species accumulation curves, where patches are ordered from small-large
   and large-small (aka `SLOSS analysis'). However, this method counts
   species equally and is unable to distinguish patch size dependence in
   species' occupancies. Moreover, because of the species-area
   relationship, richness differences typically only contribute to
   accumulation in small-large order, maximizing the probability of adding
   species in this direction. Using a null model to control for this, I
   tested 202 published datasets from archipelagos, habitat islands and
   fragments for patch size dependence in species accumulation and compared
   conclusions regarding relative species accumulation with SLOSS analysis.
   Relative to null model expectations, species accumulation was on average
   2.7\% higher in large-small than small-large order. The effect was
   strongest in archipelagos (5\%), intermediate for fragments (1.5\%) and
   smallest for habitat islands (1.1\%). There was no difference in effect
   size among taxonomic groups, but each shared this same trend. Results
   suggest most meta-communities include species that either prefer, or
   depend upon, larger habitat patches. Relative to SLOSS analysis, null
   models found lower frequency of greater small-patch importance for
   species representation (e.g., for fragments: 69 vs 16\% respectively)
   and increased frequency for large patches (fragments: 3 vs 25\%). I
   suggest SLOSS analysis provides unreliable inference on species
   accumulation and the outcome largely depends on island species-area
   relationships, not the relative diversity value of small vs large
   patches.},

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasing water temperature and intensifying the
   incidence of cyanobacterial blooms worldwide. However, the combined
   effects of increased temperature and microcystin concentrations as
   co-stressors on survival and ecological processes in freshwater species
   are unclear. Here, using purified MC-LR and crude extract of toxigenic
   Microcystis aeruginosa, we tested the individual and combined effects of
   three water temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C) and a range of
   environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved microcystin and
   crude extract (0.01-10 mu g center dot L-1) on survival, growth
   inhibition, grazing and predation rates in three freshwater species:
   phytoplankton (Scenedesmus quadricauda), zooplankton (Daphnia pulex),
   and an invertebrate predator (Ischnura elegans). Purified MC-LR exerted
   a higher growth inhibitory effect on S. quadricauda compared to crude
   extract with the same concentration of MC-LR, while neither treatment
   affected its chlorophyll-a content or survival of D. pulex. Crude
   extract reduced grazing and survival of D. pulex and I. elegans,
   respectively. The combined effect of higher temperature and crude
   extract reduced I. elegans survival by 50\%. Increased temperature
   reduced prey handing time in I. elegans by 49\%, suggesting a higher
   predation rate. However, warming together with higher concentrations of
   crude extract jointly increased zooplankton grazing and reduced
   damselfly predation. Taken together, these results suggest crude
   extract, and not necessarily microcystin, can affect survival and
   productivity in freshwater species, although these effects may vary
   unevenly across trophic levels. Our findings highlight the importance of
   complex ecological mechanisms by which warming can exacerbate toxic
   effects of cyanobacterial bloom extracts on survival and functions among
   species in eutrophic freshwaters.},

Title = {Breeding stage and tissue isotopic consistency suggests colony-level

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Volume = {200},

Abstract = {Organisms must overcome environmental limitations to optimize their
   investment in life history stages to maximize fitness. Human-induced
   climate change is generating increasingly variable environmental
   conditions, impacting the demography of prey items and, therefore, the
   ability of consumers to successfully access resources to fuel
   reproduction. While climate change effects are especially pronounced in
   the Arctic, it is unknown whether organisms can adjust foraging
   decisions to match such changes. We used a 9-year blood plasma delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 data set from over 700 pre-breeding Arctic common
   eiders (Somateria mollissima) to assess breeding-stage and inter-annual
   variation in isotopic niche, and whether inferred trophic flexibility
   was related to colony-level breeding parameters and environmental
   variation. Eider blood isotope values varied both across years and
   breeding stages, and combined with only weak relationships between
   isotopic metrics and environmental conditions suggests that pre-breeding
   eiders can make flexible foraging decisions to overcome constraints
   imposed by local abiotic conditions. From an investment perspective, an
   inshore, smaller isotopic niche predicted a greater probability to
   invest in reproduction, but was not related to laying phenology.
   Proximately, our results provide evidence that eiders breeding in the
   Arctic can alter their diet at the onset of reproductive investment to
   overcome increases in the energetic demand of egg production.
   Ultimately, Arctic pre-breeding common eiders may have the stage- and
   year-related foraging flexibility to respond to abiotic variation to
   reproduce successfully.},

Title = {Hawk owl irruptions: spatial and temporal variation in rodent abundance

Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-43},

Abstract = {Bird irruptions are thought to be triggered by low food availability in
   breeding areas, thereby causing emigration (push factor). However, few
   studies have tested whether emigrating individuals are drawn towards
   areas of high food availability (pull factor). The Northern hawk owl
   (Surnia ulula), a rodent specialist, occurs irruptively to southern
   parts of Fennoscandia. We analysed whether irruption size during
   1980-2020 in southeastern Norway was related to rodent abundance at four
   sites 450-990 km to the north-northeast (potential source areas) and at
   two sites in southeastern Norway to test push and pull dynamics of
   irruptions. Irruptions occurred when rodent abundance in potential
   source areas were low, supporting the push hypothesis. High rodent
   abundance in potential source areas 1-2 years before irruptions
   suggested that irruptions were preceded by high reproduction. Upon
   arrival to southeastern Norway, hawk owls did not encounter high rodent
   abundance in their main habitat (boreal forest). However, hawk owls
   stayed in boreal forest in hills in years with higher microtine rodent
   abundance, but occurred in farmland areas in the lowlands when microtine
   rodents were less abundant. Use of lowlands coincided with higher than
   median numbers of wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) for 87\% of the hawk
   owls settling in the lowlands, thus suggesting support for the pull
   hypothesis. In conclusion, hawk owl irruptions to southern Fennoscandia
   were triggered by low food availability in northern areas (push factor),
   and appeared to be drawn by high food availability in southeastern
   Norway to some degree (pull factor).},

Abstract = {Functional trait-based approaches have provided advances in the
   understanding of community assembly rules. Broad generalisations remain,
   however, limited due to the idiosyncratic nature of taxa and ecosystems,
   especially in tropical regions. We use fine scale resolution (30 m grid)
   environmental variables and community surveys from nearly 100 secondary
   tropical forest sites to study niche-based or neutral assembly
   mechanisms in ground dwelling ants. This provides a unique opportunity
   for understanding fine scale drivers of taxonomic, functional and
   phylogenetic diversity in a region characterized by large topographic
   and climatic differences on a relatively small geographic scale.
   Precipitation emerged as the most consistent environmental correlate, in
   shaping taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional aspects of the
   communities. Functional diversity was weakly associated with topography
   and temperature related variables. The fourth corner model revealed that
   femur, scape and mandible length were key traits in response to
   precipitation, and that communities showed a functional homogenization
   towards shorter appendages at wetter sites. Our results suggest that
   neutral and deterministic assembly processes act in concert to shape the
   taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional aspects of leaf litter ant
   assemblages. The use of multiple complementary metrics and approaches
   along environmental gradients are powerful to reveal the subtilities of
   assembly processes and provide insight into the ways future communities
   might change.},

Title = {Maintenance of a fruit colour polymorphism along an elevational gradient
   in the Southern Alps of New Zealand},

Abstract = {Many plants produce colour-polymorphic fruits. However, the processes
   responsible for the evolution and maintenance of fruit colour
   polymorphisms are poorly understood. We investigated the fruit colour
   polymorphism in Gaultheria depressa var. novae-zealandiae (Ericaceae), a
   predominantly bird-dispersed, alpine shrub from New Zealand, by testing
   whether colour morph frequencies vary geographically to maximise
   fruit-foliage colour contrasts. We also conducted a seed germination
   experiment to test whether fruit colour morphs vary in their
   susceptibility to UV damage. Results showed that `red' fruits were more
   abundant at lower elevations, while `white' fruits were predominant at
   higher elevations. Leaf colours shifted from `green' in appearance at
   lower elevations to `red' at higher elevations. Analyses of
   fruit-foliage colour contrasts showed that `red' fruits were more
   conspicuous at lower elevations, and `white' fruits were more
   conspicuous at higher elevations, which was consistent with the
   hypothesis that colour morph frequencies vary geographically to maximise
   their conspicuousness to dispersers. However, `red' fruits were
   generally more conspicuous than `white' fruits, regardless of elevation,
   indicating that the maintenance of the polymorphism could not be
   attributed to fruit-foliage colour contrasts alone. The seed germination
   experiment showed that `white' fruits were more resistant to UV damage,
   suggesting the preponderance of `white' fruited individuals in the
   landscape results from a greater degree of protection from UV damage.
   The fruit colour polymorphism in Gaultheria depressa var.
   novae-zealandiae therefore appears to be maintained by trade-offs
   between conspicuousness to dispersers and tolerance to UV damage,
   advocating a pluralistic approach to the problem in the future.},

Title = {The effects of Borrelia infection on its wintering rodent host},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {471-478},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In seasonal environments, appropriate adaptations are crucial for
   organisms to maximize their fitness. For instance, in many species, the
   immune function has been noticed to decrease during winter, which is
   assumed to be an adaptation to the season's limited food availability.
   Consequences of an infection on the health and survival of the host
   organism could thus be more severe in winter than in summer. Here, we
   experimentally investigated the effect of a zoonotic, endemic pathogen,
   Borrelia afzelii infection on the survival and body condition in its
   host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), during late autumn-early winter
   under semi-natural field conditions in 11 large outdoor enclosures. To
   test the interaction of Borrelia infection and energetic condition, four
   populations received supplementary nutrition, while remaining seven
   populations exploited only natural food sources. Supplementary food
   during winter increased the body mass independent of the infection
   status, however, Borrelia afzelii infection did not cause severe
   increase in the host mortality or affect the host body condition in the
   late autumn-early winter. While our study suggests that no severe
   effects are caused by B. afzelii infection on bank vole, further studies
   are warranted to identify any potentially smaller effects the pathogen
   may cause on the host fitness over the period of whole winter.},

Title = {Predator-induced transgenerational plasticity in animals: a
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {371-383},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is growing evidence that the environment experienced by one
   generation can influence phenotypes in the next generation via
   transgenerational plasticity (TGP). One of the best-studied examples of
   TGP in animals is predator-induced transgenerational plasticity, whereby
   exposing parents to predation risk triggers changes in offspring
   phenotypes. Yet, there is a lack of general consensus synthesizing the
   predator-prey literature with existing theory pertaining to ecology and
   evolution of TGP. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to the sizable
   literature on predator-induced TGP (441 effect sizes from 29 species and
   49 studies) to explore five hypotheses about the magnitude, form and
   direction of predator-induced TGP. Hypothesis \#1: the strength of
   predator-induced TGP should vary with the number of predator cues.
   Hypothesis \#2: the strength of predator-induced TGP should vary with
   reproductive mode. Hypothesis \#3: the strength and direction of
   predator-induced TGP should vary among offspring phenotypic traits
   because some traits are more plastic than others. Hypothesis \#4: the
   strength of predator-induced TGP should wane over ontogeny. Hypothesis
   \#5: predator-induced TGP should generate adaptive phenotypes that
   should be more evident when offspring are themselves exposed to risk. We
   found strong evidence for predator-induced TGP overall, but no evidence
   that parental predator exposure causes offspring traits to change in a
   particular direction. Additionally, we found little evidence in support
   of any of the specific hypotheses. We infer that the failure to find
   consistent evidence reflects the heterogeneous nature of the phenomena,
   and the highly diverse experimental designs used to study it. Together,
   these findings set an agenda for future work in this area.},

Title = {Composition and structure of winter aphid-parasitoid food webs along a

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {425-440},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {All species interact in complex antagonistic or mutualistic networks
   that may be driven by turnover in species composition due to
   spatiotemporal environmental filtering. Therefore, studying differences
   in insect communities along environmental gradients may improve our
   understanding of the abiotic and biotic factors that shape the structure
   of trophic networks. Parasitoids are interesting models to do so, due to
   their intimate eco-evolutionary relationship with their hosts. We
   explored the differences in cereal aphid-parasitoid food webs during the
   winter among nine localities in Chilean central-south valley, along a
   gradient of 1200 km from north (29 degrees S) to south (40 degrees S).
   We hypothesized that diapause incidence would increase in the coldest
   areas, resulting in a lower number of parasitoid species active during
   the winter. Consequently, network specialization, generality, and
   vulnerability indexes should increase with decreasing latitude, which
   implies fewer and more weakly connected links per parasitoid species
   through an increased fraction of basal host species. Based on the
   severity of winter, three areas along the explored gradient were
   distinguished, but clustering did not follow a clear north-south
   latitudinal gradient. Instead, few differences were observed in
   overwintering strategies, with very low levels of diapause in all
   localities, and no major differences in food-web composition. The major
   differences along the gradient were the relative abundances of the
   different aphid, parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species, with higher
   levels of spatial and temporal variation observed for the less abundant
   species. Our results provide a better understanding of the activity and
   abundance of aphid parasitoids during winter in relation to climatic
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Understanding how intraspecific variation in the use of prey resources
   impacts energy metabolism has strong implications for predicting
   long-term fitness and is critical for predicting population-to-community
   level responses to environmental change. Here, we examine the energetic
   consequences of variable prey resource use in a widely distributed
   marine carnivore, juvenile sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus). We
   used carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify three primary prey
   resource pools-demersal omnivores, pelagic forage, and benthic
   detritivores and estimated the proportional assimilation of each
   resource using Bayesian mixing models. We then quantified how the
   utilization of these resource pools impacted the concentrations of six
   plasma lipids and how this varied by ontogeny. Sharks exhibited variable
   reliance on two of three predominant prey resource pools: demersal
   omnivores and pelagic forage. Resource use variation was a strong
   predictor of energetic condition, whereby individuals more reliant upon
   pelagic forage exhibited higher blood plasma concentrations of very
   low-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These findings
   underscore how intraspecific variation in resource use may impact the
   energy metabolism of animals, and more broadly, that natural and
   anthropogenically driven fluctuations in prey resources could have
   longer term energetic consequences.},

Abstract = {Basic knowledge on dispersal of microbes in pollinator networks is
   essential for plant, insect, and microbial ecology. Thorough
   understanding of the ecological consequences of honeybee farming on
   these complex plant-pollinator-microbe interactions is a prerequisite
   for sustainable honeybee keeping. Most research on
   plant-pollinator-microbe interactions have focused on temperate
   agricultural systems. Therefore, information on a wild plant that is a
   seasonal bottleneck for pollinators in cold climate such as Salix
   phylicifolia is of specific importance. We investigated how floral
   visitation by insects influences the community structure of bacteria and
   fungi in Salix phylicifolia inflorescences under natural conditions.
   Insect visitors were experimentally excluded with net bags. We analyzed
   the microbiome and measured pollen removal in open and bagged
   inflorescences in sites where honeybees were foraging and in sites
   without honeybees. Site and plant individual explained most of the
   variation in floral microbial communities. Insect visitation and
   honeybees had a smaller but significant effect on the community
   composition of microbes. Honeybees had a specific effect on the
   inflorescence microbiome and, e.g., increased the relative abundance of

Title = {Floral scent divergence across an elevational hybrid zone with varying
   pollinators},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Divergence in floral traits attractive to different pollinators can
   promote reproductive isolation in related species. When isolation is
   incomplete, hybridization may occur, which offers the opportunity to
   explore mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. Recent work
   suggests that divergence in floral scent may frequently contribute to
   reproductive barriers, although such divergence has seldom been examined
   in species with generalized pollination. Here, we used two closely
   related Penstemon species, P. newberryi and P. davidsonii, and their
   natural hybrids from an elevational gradient with pollinator communities
   that are predicted to vary in their reliance on floral scent (i.e.,
   primarily hummingbirds at low elevation vs. bees at high elevation). The
   species vary in a suite of floral traits, but scent is uncharacterized.
   To address whether scent varies along elevation and potentially
   contributes to reproductive isolation, we genetically characterized
   individuals collected at field and identified whether they were parental
   species or hybrids. We then characterized scent amount and composition.
   Although the parental species had similar total emissions, some scent
   characteristics (i.e., scent composition, aromatic emission) diverged
   between them and may contribute to their isolation. However, the species
   emitted similar compound sets which could explain hybridization in the
   contact area. Hybrids were similar to the parents for most scent traits,
   suggesting that their floral scent would not provide a strong barrier to
   backcrossing. Our study suggests floral scent may be a trait
   contributing to species boundaries even in plants with generalized
   pollination, and reinforces the idea that evolutionary pollinator
   transitions may involve changes in multiple floral traits.},

Title = {Clinal versus disruptive latitudinal variation in fruit traits of a
   South American mistletoe},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {397-411},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fruit traits have historically been interpreted as plant adaptations to
   their seed dispersers. On the other hand, different environmental
   factors, which vary spatially and temporally, can shape fruit-trait
   variation. The mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus has a latitudinal
   distribution along the South American Pacific rim that encompasses two
   different biomes, the matorral of central Chile and the temperate forest
   that extends south of the matorral. This mistletoe shows contrasting
   fruiting phenology (spring vs summer), fruit color (yellow vs green),
   and seed dispersers (birds vs marsupial) in these two biomes. We
   characterized geographic variation of morphological and nutritional
   fruit traits of T. corymbosus to evaluate which macroecological factor,
   biome or latitude, better explains spatial variation in these variables.
   For each of 22 populations, we obtained environmental data (temperature,
   precipitation, and canopy cover), measured fruit and seed morphology
   traits (size, shape, and weight), and pulp moisture and nutritional
   content (fiber, protein, fat, carbohydrates, ash, and caloric content).
   Patterns of variation for each variable were described by fitting and
   comparing five different simple models varying in slope, intercept or
   both. Fruit morphology showed a clear biome-related disruptive pattern,
   seed morphological traits were unrelated to either biome or latitude,
   whereas nutritional variables showed diverse patterns. Different
   environmental factors seem to affect fruit development and phenology,
   determining the observed fruit characteristics, with seed dispersers
   playing a minor role in shaping these patterns. More generally, the
   contrasting plant-seed disperser associations we addressed can be
   interpreted as the outcome of an ecological-fitting rather than of a
   coevolutionary process.},

Abstract = {Sicyos angulatus is a serious threat to riverine ecosystem functions and
   services worldwide. Here, we studied the effect of species identity and
   diversity on biotic resistance to S. angulatus under two different soil
   nutrient levels (unfertilized vs. fertilized). Soil nutrient levels
   showed no significant effect on invasion by S. angulatus in the control
   treatment, where intervention by native plants was absent. Species
   identity of native plants and its interaction with soil nutrient levels
   had a significant effect on biotic resistance to S. angulatus. For
   instance, Pennisetum alopecuroides and Lespedeza cuneata best resisted
   invasion in fertilized soil, whereas Lespedeza bicolor and Lactuca
   indica best resisted invasion in unfertilized soil. In addition, a
   mixture of four plant species resisted invasion equally as well as the
   monoculture of a species in unfertilized soil, whereas the mixed
   treatment resisted invasion much better in fertilized soil compared with
   unfertilized soil. Structural equation modeling revealed that species
   identity and diversity as well as fertilizer application significantly
   influenced biotic resistance to S. angulatus invasion, while soil
   nutrients did not influence invasion success directly. Based on these
   results, we strongly suggest sowing seed mixtures of various species
   after eradicating S. angulatus plants to prevent re-invasion. Overall,
   these results demonstrate how native plants rely on resource
   availability to resist colonization by an invasive plant, such as S.
   angulatus. This information can be used for the development of improved
   guidelines for plant restoration and invasive species control.},

Title = {Top-down and bottom-up forces explain patch utilization by two deer
   species and forest recruitment},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {229-240},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ungulates play an important role in temperate systems. Through their
   feeding behaviour, they can respond to vegetation by selecting patches
   or modify vegetation composition by herbivory. The degree in which they
   interact with vegetation can either reinforce landscape heterogeneity by
   creating disturbance or reduce heterogeneity in case of overbrowsing.
   This study evaluates how bottom-up (patch quality, structure), top-down
   forces (hunting, distance to village, forest edge) and deer features
   (feeding type, abundance) mediate patch utilization in a temperate
   forest and assess the implications of patch utilization and light on
   forest recruitment. Theory predicts that animals seek to maximize their
   energetic gains by food intake while minimizing the costs associated to
   foraging, such as the energy required for avoiding predators and
   exploiting resources. We focused on two deer species with contrasting
   feeding type: a browser (C. capreolus) and a mixed feeder (C. elaphus).
   We paired camera traps to vegetation sub-plots in ten forest sites in
   the Netherlands that widely ranged in deer abundance and landscape
   heterogeneity. Results showed that patch utilization is simultaneously
   explained by bottom-up, top-down forces and by deer abundance, as
   predicted by the safety-in-numbers hypothesis. Yet, forces best
   explaining patch utilization differed between deer species. Overall,
   higher patch utilization came with higher browsing, lower tree diversity
   and a large difference in forest composition: from a mix of broadleaves
   and conifers towards only conifers. We conclude that these two deer
   species, although living in the same area and belonging to the same
   guild, differentially perceive, interact with and shape their
   surrounding landscape.},

Abstract = {Associational resistance (AR) is a positive interaction in which a plant
   suffers less herbivore damage due to its association with a protective
   plant. Here, we evaluated whether plants with extra-floral nectaries
   (EFNs) can share indirect defenses with neighboring plants. We sampled
   45 individuals of an EFN-bearing liana (Smilax polyantha) and recorded
   whether their support species had EFNs. In S. polyantha, we measured
   foliar herbivory and flower and fruit production. We examined the ant
   species composition and visitation of S. polyantha and whether they
   changed according to the supporting plant type (with or without EFNs).
   We experimentally determined whether S. polyantha supplemented with
   artificial nectaries could share indirect defenses with defenseless
   neighboring plants. Support plants with EFNs indirectly benefited S.
   polyantha by sharing mutualistic ant species. Smilax polyantha supported
   by plants with EFNs had a more specific ant species composition, a
   higher number of visiting ants and ant species richness, and exhibited
   nearly 3 times less foliar herbivory. However, we did not observe
   differences in fruit production between the two groups of S. polyantha.
   Finally, we observed that S. polyantha with artificial nectaries
   increased ant visitation on neighboring plants 2.5 times. We provide
   evidence that interspecific neighbors with EFNs can experience
   reciprocal benefits by sharing indirect defenses. Such local effects
   might escalate and affect the structure of plant communities.},

Abstract = {The social environment is a key factor that influences behavioural
   traits across a wide array of species. Yet, when investigating
   individual differences in behaviour, studies tend to measure animals in
   isolation from other conspecifics-even in social species. Surprisingly,
   whether behavioural traits measured in isolation are predictive of
   individual-level behaviour when in social groups is still poorly
   understood. Here, we repeatedly measured risk-taking behaviour (i.e.
   boldness; 741 total trials) in both the presence and absence of
   conspecifics in a social lizard, the delicate skink (Lampropholis
   delicata). Further, we manipulated food availability during group trials
   to test whether the effect of the social environment on risk-taking
   behaviour was mediated by competition over resources. Using 105 lizards
   collected from three independent populations, we found that individual
   risk-taking behaviour was repeatable when measured in either social
   isolation or within groups both with and without food resources
   available. However, lizards that were bolder during individual trials
   were not also bolder when in groups, regardless of resource
   availability. This was largely driven by individual differences in
   social behavioural plasticity, whereby individual skinks responded
   differently to the presence of conspecifics. Together, this resulted in
   a rank order change of individual behavioural types across the social
   conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the social
   environment in mediating animal personality traits across varying levels
   of resource availability. Further, these findings suggest that
   behavioural traits when measured in isolation, may not reflect
   individual variation in behaviour when measured in more ecologically
   realistic social groups.},

Title = {Species movements within biogeographic regions: exploring the
   distribution of transplanted mollusc species in South America},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 29},
Abstract = {The movement of species is among the most serious environmental threats
   of the new millennium, as the transplantation of species beyond their
   native or historical range has intensified in the last five decades.
   Traditionally, studies on bioinvasions have focused on species that have
   been introduced, deliberately or accidentally, to biogeographic regions
   where they did not previously occur. However, less attention has been
   given to species movement to novel areas within the same biogeographic
   region. Our research group, the South America Introduced Molluscs
   Specialists, analyzed potential cases of native South American mollusc
   species introduced deliberately or accidentally beyond their natural
   range within South America. To achieve this, it is key to differentiate
   between anthropogenic processes and passive responses to environmental
   conditions. We considered the past and current spatial distribution of
   species, analyzed known or putative vectors, and discuss the impacts of
   taxonomic and nomenclatural knowledge. Based on the evidence currently
   available, we propose different scenarios to explain observed changes in
   mollusc distributions within South America. Seventeen transplanted
   mollusc species (TMS) were recognized, considering marine, freshwater,
   and terrestrial environments. Of the 189 South American ecoregions 31
   were occupied by transplanted species, but this proportion varied by
   environment: 10 of 28 marine ecoregions, 12 of 52 freshwater ecoregions,
   and 9 of 109 terrestrial ecoregions. The ecoregions with TMS are
   generally located in the peripheral zones of the continent. Those with
   the highest number of TMS were the Southern Caribbean (three species) in
   the marine environment, the Central Andean Pacific Slopes (three
   species) in the freshwater environment, and the Alto Parana Atlantic
   forests (two species) in the terrestrial environment. The number of
   unintentionally moved TMS is greater than those moved intentionally. The
   transplantation process is similar to the introduction and settlement
   process of non-native mollusc species, and so is their impact.},

Title = {Density-impact functions for invasive house mouse (Mus musculus) effects
   on indigenous lizards and invertebrates},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {House mice are among the most widely distributed mammals in the world,
   and adversely affect a wide range of indigenous biota. Suppressing mouse
   populations, however, is difficult and expensive. Cost-effective
   suppression requires knowing how low to reduce mouse numbers to achieve
   biodiversity outcomes, but these targets are usually unknown or not
   based on evidence. We derived density-impact functions (DIFs) for mice
   and small indigenous fauna in a tussock grass/shrubland ecosystem. We
   related two indices of mouse abundance to five indices of indigenous
   lizard and invertebrate abundance measured inside and outside
   mammal-resistant fences. Eight of 22 DIFs were significantly non-linear,
   with positive responses of skinks (Oligosoma maccanni, O. polychroma)
   and ground weta (Hemiandrus spp.) only where mice were not detected or
   scarce (< 5\% footprint tunnel tracking rate or printing rate based on
   footprint density). Korero geckos (Woodworthia spp.) were rarely
   detected where mice were present. A further 9 DIFs were not
   differentiated from null models, but patterns were consistent with
   impacts at 5\% mouse abundance. This study suggests that unless mouse
   control programmes commit to very low abundances, they risk little
   return for effort. Impact studies of invasive house mice are largely
   restricted to island ecosystems. Studies need to be extended to other
   ecosystems and species to confirm the universality or otherwise of these
   highly non-linear DIFs.},

Title = {Science for social licence to arrest an ecosystem-transforming invasion},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 19},
Abstract = {The primary role for scientific information in addressing complex
   environmental problems, such as biological invasions, is generally
   assumed to be as a guide for management decisions. However, scientific
   information often plays a minor role in decision-making, with
   practitioners instead relying on professional experience and local
   knowledge. We explore alternative pathways by which scientific
   information could help reduce the spread and impacts of invasive
   species. Our study centred on attempts to understand the main
   motivations and constraints of three local governance bodies responsible
   for the management of invasive (wilding) conifer species in the southern
   South Island of New Zealand in achieving strategic and operational
   goals. We used a combination of workshop discussions, questionnaire
   responses and visits to field sites to elicit feedback from study
   participants. We applied a mixed inductive-deductive thematic analysis
   approach to derive themes from the feedback received. The three main
   themes identified were: (1) impacts of wilding conifers and goals for
   wilding conifer control, (2) barriers to achieving medium- and long-term
   goals, and (3) science needed to support wilding conifer control.
   Participants identified reversal and prevention of both instrumental
   (e.g. reduced water availability for agriculture) and intrinsic (e.g.
   loss of biodiversity and landscape values) impacts of wilding conifer
   invasions as primary motivators behind wilding conifer control. Barriers
   to achieving goals were overwhelmingly social, relating either to
   unwillingness of landowners to participate or poorly designed regulatory
   frameworks. Consequently, science needs related primarily to gaining
   social licence to remove wilding conifers from private land and for more
   appropriate regulations. Scientific information provided via spread and
   impacts forecasting models was viewed as a key source of scientific
   information in gaining social licence. International experience suggests
   that invasive species control programmes often face significant external
   social barriers. Thus, for many biological invasions, the primary role
   of science might be to achieve social licence and regulatory support for
   the long-term goals of invasive species control programmes and the
   management interventions required to achieve those goals.},

Title = {Genetics reveals shifts in reproductive behaviour of the invasive bird
   parasite Philornis downsi collected from Darwin's finch nests},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {563-581},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Due to novel or dynamic fluctuations in environmental conditions and
   resources, host and parasite relationships can be subject to diverse
   selection pressures that may lead to significant changes during and
   after invasion of a parasite. Genomic analyses are useful for
   elucidating evolutionary processes in invasive parasites following their
   arrival to a new area and host. Philornis downsi (Diptera: Muscidae),
   the avian vampire fly, was introduced to the Galapagos Islands circa
   1964 and has since spread across the archipelago, feeding on the blood
   of developing nestlings of endemic land birds. Since its discovery,
   there have been significant changes to the dynamics of P. downsi and its
   novel hosts, such as shifting mortality rates and changing oviposition
   behaviour, however no temporal genetic studies have been conducted. We
   collected P. downsi from nests and traps from a single island population
   over a 14-year period, and genotyped flies at 469 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing
   (RADSeq). Despite significant genetic differentiation (F-ST) between
   years, there was no evidence for genetic clustering within or across
   four sampling years between 2006 and 2020, suggesting a lack of
   population isolation. Sibship reconstructions from P. downsi collected
   from 10 Darwin's finch nests sampled in 2020 showed evidence for shifts
   in reproductive behaviour compared to a similar genetic analysis
   conducted in 2004-2006. Compared with this previous study, females mated
   with fewer males, individual females oviposited fewer offspring per
   nest, but more unique females oviposited per nest. These findings are
   important to consider within reproductive control techniques, and have
   fitness implications for both parasite evolution and host fitness.},

Abstract = {Ecological niche models are useful tools for predicting and managing
   biological invasions. However, their reliable implementation and derived
   applications could be biased by niche shifts among native and invaded
   areas and by non-equilibrium dynamics. We calculated bioclimatic niche
   overlap between native and invaded ranges, and tuned species
   distribution models trained on both the native range (native model), and
   the native and invasive ranges (complete model) for the axis deer (Axis
   axis) to assess its invasion risk potential worldwide. Our results
   suggest that the axis deer shifted its realized niche in some invaded
   areas where most of the climatic niche available was contained within
   the environmental conditions from the native range. We found signals of
   non-equilibrium dynamics between native and invaded niches due to
   several unfilled areas in invaded regions. The native and complete
   models are similar in their projection for the equatorial region but
   differ significantly in the tropical regions. The first fails to predict
   areas where the species was successfully established. This difference
   reinforces the idea of using all the occurrences for predicting possible
   invaded areas, and that invasive species can somehow shift their niche.
   The complete model predicted that the most climatically suitable regions
   for the species worldwide were in tropical and subtropical climates,
   particularly the Neotropics and Afrotropics. While the species has been
   already established in the Neotropics, it hasn't in the latter.
   Therefore, our work emphasized the importance of a nuanced understanding
   of the potential distribution of invasive species to inform more
   effective management measures.},

Title = {Invaders responded more positively to soil biota than native or
   noninvasive introduced species, consistent with enemy escape},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {351-364},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms governing biological invasions has
   implications for population dynamics, biodiversity, and community
   assembly. The enemy escape hypothesis posits that escape from enemies
   such as herbivores and predators that were limiting in the native range
   helps explain rapid spread in the introduced range. While the enemy
   escape hypothesis has been widely tested aboveground, data limitations
   have prevented comparisons of belowground mechanisms for invasive and
   noninvasive introduced species, which limits our understanding of why
   only some introduced species become invasive. We assessed the role of
   soil biota in driving plant invasions in a phylogenetic meta-analysis,
   incorporating phylogeny in the error structure of the models, and
   comparing live and sterilized conditioned soils. We found 29 studies and
   396 effect size estimates across 103 species that compared live and
   sterilized soils. We found general positive effects of soil biota for
   plants (0.099, 95\% CI = 0.0266, 0.1714), consistent with a role of soil
   mutualists. The effect size of soil biota among invaders was 3.2x higher
   than for natives, the strength of effects was weaker for older
   conditioning species with a longer introduced history, and enemy escape
   was stronger for distant relatives. In addition, invasive species had a
   weaker allocation tradeoff than natives. By demonstrating that the net
   effect of soil biota is more positive for invasive than native and
   noninvasive introduced species, weakens over time since introduction,
   and strengthens as phylogenetic distance increasing, we provide
   mechanistic insights into the considerable role of soil biota in
   biological invasions, consistent with the predictions of the enemy
   escape hypothesis.},

Title = {Different interaction effects between two invasive harvestmen and a
   native relative in the laboratory},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {551-562},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Interspecific exploitation and/or interference competition may be
   operating when a successful invasion of an animal species leads to
   decrease or disappearance of native relatives, in particular if
   inter-assemblage predation and other interactions are unlikely. The
   harvestman Opilio canestrinii arrived in Denmark around 1980 and quickly
   became a dominant species in urban habitats. This was followed by a
   nearly complete disappearance of the formerly co-dominant species,
   Leiobunum gracile. A second invasive species, Dicranopalpus ramosus,
   arrived in 2007 and is still under population increase. Old forests have
   been a refuge for L. gracile, but both invasive species are now invading
   this habitat. We investigated the effects of exploitative and
   interference competition in relation to limited food resources between
   the three species in the laboratory using pairs of individuals, either
   heterospecific (O. canestrinii/L. gracile; D. ramosus/L. gracile) or
   conspecific (L. gracile/L. gracile). Food resources offered were
   insufficient for both individuals. Opilio canestrinii gained
   significantly more weight than the other species. Leiobunum gracile
   exhibited fewer startle behaviours and a higher contact time with its
   partner in the conspecific than in the heterospecific treatment.
   Overall, O. canestrinii performed better than L. gracile, when faced
   with food scarcity and restricted space, whereas D. ramosus did not.
   Thus, competition (both exploitative and interference) is a possible
   mechanism for explaining the disappearance of L. gracile from urban
   habitats following the successful establishment of O. canestrinii in
   Denmark; additionally, O. canestrinii may be a potential future threat
   to L. gracile in forests.},

   polymorpha) in Central Texas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Dreissenid mussels are successful aquatic invaders which have spread
   rapidly throughout North America following their arrival from Eurasia
   approximately 35 years ago. Reservoirs in central Texas have been more
   recently invaded by zebra mussels and these populations represent the
   southernmost edge of this species' current distribution in North
   America. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution and
   population dynamics (recruitment and mortality) of zebra mussels in
   Canyon Lake and the effect of high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen
   on mortality of zebra mussels in three different Central Texas lakes
   (Canyon, Belton, and Stillhouse Hollow). Recruitment, both larval
   densities and juvenile settlement, varied with temperature within and
   between years. The highest settlement rate and lower mortality were
   associated with lower temperatures (e.g., year or lake with lowest
   number of days >= 30 ?), whereas hypoxia likely caused high mortality at
   greater depths in Lake Belton. Although higher summer temperatures seem
   to limit zebra mussels, their population has continued to increase and
   expand in Canyon Lake since the initial invasion, but at considerably
   lower densities than higher latitude populations This study improves our
   understanding of factors driving and limiting zebra mussel population
   dynamics in low latitude lakes, which will help to inform management
   decisions.},

Title = {Consumption of fire ants, an invasive predator and prey of native
   lizards, may enhance immune functions needed to combat envenomation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 14},
Abstract = {Non-native species invasions are increasing across the globe and are
   affecting native species in many different ways including through
   impacts as novel predators or food sources. We sought to understand how
   eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) are affected by invasive
   red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), which serve as both
   predator and prey to the lizards. These ants have been present in the
   lizards' range for over 70 years and are associated with altered lizard
   immune function as compared to lizards from ecologically similar sites
   not invaded by fire ants. To better assign causation to the correlative
   field patterns of immune function, we experimentally exposed fire
   ant-naive lizards to fire ant venom though ant stings and via
   consumption of non-stinging dead ants and measured the same immune
   outcomes. Fire ant consumption increased lizard immune responses
   relative to lizards stung by fire ants, and two of the four immune
   differences in the field were also seen in lizards fed fire ants (higher
   anti-fire ant IgM and basophils). This may indicate that some
   field-measured immune differences in fire ant invaded populations of
   lizards are directly due to their exposure to fire ant venom by
   consuming fire ants rather than through stinging. These results also
   suggest that consumption of fire ants can bolster immune responses
   needed to combat envenomation through stinging. This adds to growing
   evidence that sub-lethal consumption of poisonous/venomous invasive
   species may reduce deleterious consequences of exposure to these toxins,
   allowing native species to survive and coexist with otherwise deadly
   invaders.},

Abstract = {Molecular data is useful to determine the taxonomic identity and origin
   of invasive species. A reliable identification and a complete reference
   database are key for the adequate management of invasive species. South
   American suckermouth armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys spp.) are
   invasive species that cause severe environmental and socioeconomic
   impacts. Although different species (Pterygoplichthys pardalis and
   Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus), and possibly hybrids, have been
   identified based on ventral spots' patterns, there remains taxonomic
   uncertainty regarding the Pterygoplichthys spp. individuals that are
   becoming invasive. We used genetic data to make inferences about the
   number of invasion events and found that there were one or few
   introduction events, followed by rapid spread and population growth.
   When we analyzed environmental variation of the sampling sites (based on
   physico-chemical properties), we observed both environmental
   differentiation between basins and environmental homogeneity within one
   of the studied river basins. We then analyzed the morphological
   variation between morphotypes and found that in addition to the
   variation in the ventral patterns, we observed size differences between
   individuals from different basins. We amplified the CYTB and COI
   mitochondrial DNA regions and found a unique haplotype which is shared
   across the sampled basins. Finally, we found that all the suckermouth
   armored catfish in the different basins were P. pardalis or of hybrid
   origin, and the lack of diversity in the mitochondrial DNA suggested a
   common origin. Our study highlights that combining genetic,
   morphological and ecological data provides complementary evidence to
   understand the introduction and invasion process.},

   gelatinous species (Mnemiopsis leidyi, Aurelia sp., and Gonionemus
   vertens) in relation with the environment. As part of the ``biological
   survey{''} (2015-2017), an interdisciplinary approach was performed to
   combine field measurements with perception through testimonies of social
   actors across a ``sociological survey{''}. The human ``perception{''}
   and the field ``measurements{''} were linked along the framework of
   risk: Risk = hazard x vulnerability. The invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis
   leidyi was the most abundant species in the Berre Lagoon causing high
   impacts on human activities, in particular on the artisanal fisheries
   the most affected human activity by M. leidyi involving the human (i.e.
   hard work), the technical (i.e. deterioration of fishing nets, clogs
   nets, mutilation of fish), and the economic losses representing 50\% of
   their annual revenue. The clogging of the nets affected not only the
   quantity of fish but also their quality, as they were smothered and
   mutilated. The data collected allowed us to estimate an abundance
   tolerance threshold (similar to 10 ind m(-3)) by social actors, above
   which M. leidyi was considered to be a nuisance. Beach goers accept
   relatively well M. leidyi, mainly because it does not sting. Up to the
   abundance tolerance threshold defined in our study, beach goers escaped
   from the lagoon, favored the sea or the pool. Even if they are highly
   impacted by M. leidyi, the fishermen showed an ability to changed they
   practices by a cohabitation and technical responses (i.e., increase the
   number of trips and the duration of the setting of nets). Finally, the
   recent arrival in 2016 of the stinging invasive hydromedusa G. vertens
   can causes some health issues on fishermen and beach goers in the future
   in the Berre Lagoon.},

Title = {Invasive rodent eradication on islands: assessment and mitigation of
   human exposure to rodenticides},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Use of rodenticides is a common method for eradication of invasive
   rodents from islands, with eradication projects increasingly being
   undertaken on inhabited islands or islands used by people for harvesting
   food. The expansion of eradication projects to inhabited islands will
   require that all real and perceived human health risks from the projects
   are socially acceptable, or effectively mitigated. When broad-scale use
   of rodenticide for eradication is proposed on inhabited islands, it is
   usual for concerns to be raised about the risks of rodenticide exposure
   to people, livestock, pets, game animals, and marine food sources.
   Although risks to humans have been assessed prior to some individual
   island eradications, there are currently no established frameworks for
   consistent and formal approaches to such assessments. To inform the
   focus of future assessments, we synthesized current understanding of the
   potential pathways of human exposure to rodenticides and risk mitigation
   measures associated with island rodent eradication projects. We sought
   to develop this through a literature and database review that identified
   153 inhabited islands where rodent eradication projects had been
   undertaken, of which 95 documented a priori assessments of human risks
   and mitigation measures. We found no reports of adverse effects from
   human exposure resulting from any source during discrete rodent
   eradication programs on inhabited islands, including direct rodenticide
   bait consumption, inhalation, dermal absorption, secondary or tertiary
   exposure. To continue advancing eradications on inhabited islands of
   increasing scale and proactively manage risks and perceptions, we
   recommend engagement processes that integrate island communities into a
   priori risk assessments and mitigation measure selection.},

Title = {Predicting habitat suitability for Amynthas spp. in the United States: a
   retrospective analysis using citizen science data from iNaturalist},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Jumping worms in the Amynthas genus are of great concern as invasive
   species, but tracking new occurrences and predicting suitable habitat
   conditions have been difficult. However, citizen science projects such
   as iNaturalist can be utilized to meet these goals coupled with Species
   Distribution Modeling and publicly available habitat data. Using a
   retrospective approach, this study developed multiple predictive models
   using soil properties and land cover in addition to the standard
   WorldClim climatic variables. Occurrences observed through 2016 on
   iNaturalist were used to build several models in Maxent with different
   predictor combinations which were then assessed by their ability to
   predict occurrences submitted to iNaturalist after 2016. The model built
   using both climatic variables and soil properties greatly outperformed
   models built with climatic variables only and with climatic variables,
   soil properties, and land cover. Precipitation, isothermality,
   precipitation seasonality, and calcium carbonate soil content were all
   important predictors of suitable habitat for Amynthas worms. The
   predictive model suggests several regions in the United States and
   Canada for targeted outreach and prevention efforts. Models built using
   this method should become more accurate over time as additional
   observations are submitted to iNaturalist.},

Title = {Effects of native and non-native earthworms on grassland plant
   communities and abundance of associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Non-native earthworm invasions can greatly alter plant communities
   directly through root consumption, or indirectly, including through
   effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, most invasive
   earthworm research evaluating effects on plants and AM fungi has been
   conducted in historically earthworm-free regions. We assessed effects of
   non-native earthworms on plants and AM fungal abundance in a tallgrass
   prairie in the U.S. Great Plains where native earthworms are present.
   Specifically, we evaluated if abundance of native, non-native, and total
   earthworms were associated with native and non-native plant cover, plant
   biomass and species richness, and relative abundances of intra- and
   extra-radical AM fungi. We identified 68 non-native (all Aporrectodea
   spp.) and 451 native (all Diplocardia spp.) earthworms. Abundances of
   neither native nor non-native earthworms were associated with percent
   total plant cover, plant biomass, plant species richness, or intra- or
   inter-radical AM fungal abundance. However, greater numbers of total
   earthworms were associated with reduced native plant cover and increased
   non-native plant cover. Our study suggests total abundance of
   earthworms, but not of non-native species, influences plant community
   composition in the tallgrass prairie we studied, and that such effects
   may be driven by mechanisms other than alteration of symbiotic
   mycorrhizal fungi. As evidenced by the relatively low proportion of
   non-native individuals, the earthworm invasion in our study area appears
   to be nascent, yet further effects on soil, microbes, plants, and
   ecosystem functions could occur if the invasion intensifies. Continued
   research in tallgrass prairies is crucial for monitoring current and
   future impacts of non-native earthworms on these endangered ecosystems.},

Title = {Population expansion of the invasive sea anemone Metridium senile in the

Abstract = {This article analyses the detection and expansion of the invasive sea
   anemone Metridium senile at spatial meso- and microscale in an exploited
   bed of the edible sea urchin Loxechinus albus, which is part of the
   population monitoring of its fishery in southern Chile. By analysing
   images recorded from video transects between 2014 and 2021, and applying
   geostatistical and multidimensional methods, changes in the presence and
   expansion of M. senile, the biodiversity of the associated community,
   and changes in the sea urchin bed were evaluated. Metridium senile was
   first recorded at this site in 2016 and since then it increased in
   coverage (up to 39\%), presence by area (75\%) and patch diameter (up to
   343 m). The Shannon diversity index of the benthic community decreased
   from 1.43 to 0.016, while non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a
   gradient in species composition and relative year-to-year importance,
   suggesting a transition towards M. senile dominance in the community
   studied. Both the density and patches size of the studied sea urchin bed
   decreased heavily down to 1 sea urchin/10 m(2) and 20 m diameter,
   respectively, between 2019 and 2021. This suggests a shrinking
   subpopulation that may have been displaced due to the expansion of M.
   senile. Based on information available on M. senile in the northern
   hemisphere, it is suspected that its expansion in north-western
   Patagonia is still ongoing. Our results suggest a serious threat to the
   biodiversity of local benthic communities, including species that are
   commercially important to small-scale fisheries. Thus, further research
   on the invasive M. senile expansion, its effects and its potential
   management is a priority.},

Abstract = {Island avifauna suffer high rates of extinction and decline. North
   Island in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia, supports
   one of three populations of the Abrolhos Painted Button-quail (Turnix
   varius scintillans), a subspecies determined to be the 5th most likely
   taxon to become extinct in Australia. T. v. scintillans were last
   recorded on North Island in 2006. Vegetation declines on North Island
   due to introduced tammar wallabies (Notamacropus eugenii derbianus) and
   predation by introduced house mice (Mus musculus) are implicated as
   major threats. Between 2018 and 2021, 12,820 camera trap-nights on North
   Island failed to detect any signs of T. v. scintillans, suggesting local
   extinction. We deployed rodent chew cards at each camera site and
   analysed rainfall and vegetation cover data to identify potential causes
   of decline. Vegetation cover change was related to tammar wallaby
   density and was highly correlated with rainfall (r(2) = 0.75). At the
   time of the last button-quail sighting in 2006, tammar wallaby numbers
   were at their peak, and annual rainfall was near its lowest level.
   Introduced tammar wallabies and house mice in tandem with reduced
   rainfall have likely resulted in degradation of habitat critical for T.
   v. scintillans, which is now confined to just two islands. Preventing
   further introductions of mice, rats and feral cats is a high priority
   for limiting further declines of this subspecies.},

Abstract = {Black Carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) was imported to the USA to control
   aquaculture pond snails. This species has escaped captivity and occurs
   in parts of the Mississippi River, several tributaries, and floodplain
   lakes, which is concerning due to potential competition with native
   fishes and predation on native mussels, many of which are imperiled.
   However, Black Carp captures have primarily been incidental by
   commercial fishers, and evidence of reproduction in the wild is limited.
   The objectives of this study were to assess relative abundance of
   aquaculture-origin and wild Black Carp using ploidy and otolith stable
   isotope analysis, identify spatial extent of natural reproduction using
   otolith microchemistry, assess age distributions of wild and
   aquaculture-source Black Carp to infer years in which natural
   reproduction occurred and timing of aquaculture escapement or
   introductions, and estimate size and age at maturation to assess whether
   recruitment to adulthood has occurred. Results revealed that Black Carp
   are established in parts of the Mississippi River basin based on
   findings that: (1) non-captive Black Carp primarily consist of fertile,
   naturally-reproduced fish, (2) reproduction has occurred in several
   rivers, (3) multiple year classes of wild fish are present, and (4) wild
   fish have recruited to adulthood. Multiple introductions or escapements
   of aquaculture-source fish into the wild, including both fertile and
   functionally sterile individuals, were also inferred. Individual growth
   appears to be rapid, although considerable variation was observed among
   fish. Additional study is suggested to refine understanding of where and
   when Black Carp reproduction is occurring in the Mississippi River
   basin.},

Abstract = {Invasive plants are one of the greatest threats leading to biodiversity
   loss and species extinction worldwide. Understanding the responses of
   liana and tree communities as well as liana-tree interactions to plant
   invasion could be important in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem
   functioning, but there is limited knowledge on this subject matter. We
   therefore sought to determine how the diversity, composition and
   structure of native liana and tree communities and liana-tree
   interaction networks responded to invasion by three tree species
   (Broussonetia papyrifera, Cedrela odorata, Tectona grandis) in two moist
   semi-deciduous forests in Ghana. Effects of plant invasion on native
   liana and tree community structure and liana-tree network structure were
   quantified by sampling liana species with diameter at 1.30 m from
   rooting base >= 1 cm, and tree species with diameter at breast height >=
   5 cm in 20 20 x 20 m plots each in non-invaded and invaded sites. The
   findings of the study showed that plant invasion was associated with
   lower diversity and abundance of lianas and trees as well as shifts in
   species composition of the plants. Our results revealed that plant
   invasion influenced the patterns of liana-tree network structure, and
   tended to cause an increase in network connectance and nestedness, and a
   decrease in network modularity and specialisation. Plant invasion drove
   the topological roles of a few liana and tree species in the invaded
   sites. Generally, species abundance and specificity were important
   correlates of nestedness, and modularity and species roles of the
   networks. We conclude that the invasive tree species drove native liana
   and tree community structure, degree of liana-tree network structure,
   and species topological roles, all of which may have adverse
   consequences on biodiversity in the forests.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, rainfall has become more variable, with a
   worldwide increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events.
   While increases in rainfall variability are expected to significantly
   affect plant species, the effects of precipitation dynamics on plant
   invasions remains understudied. We examined the growth response of
   Alternanthera philoxeroides to varying water availability at the
   community level when grown in a monoculture and mixed community with
   four commonly co-occurring native species. The native species were also
   grown together as a control to compare to the invasive species
   communities. Seven water treatments were applied to each community,
   including a `normal' treatment (based on the average rainfall for the
   area), drought (water was one third of the normal treatment), flood
   (water was double the normal treatment), and other simulated extreme
   events (where water availability was more variable than the normal
   treatment). All plants were measured for growth (e.g., biomass and
   stolon length) and competitive traits (i.e., relative competitive
   dominance and relative interaction indices). Most growth traits in A.
   philoxeroides were enhanced with increased and/or more variable water
   availability in both the monoculture and mixed community. In contrast,
   differences in growth traits in the native plants were mostly
   non-significant across treatments in each plant community. Compared to
   the normal treatment, A. philoxeroides had higher relative competitive
   dominance (RDI) and interaction (RII) indices in response to flooding.
   Conversely, RII in the native species was not significantly different
   among treatments. Overall, our results suggest that A. philoxeroides is
   more responsive to flooding compared to the natives. Our study provides
   useful insights into growth response and competitiveness of A.
   philoxeroides to precipitation variability across different plant
   communities.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are among the leading drivers of global
   biodiversity loss and are responsible for impaired ecosystem structure
   and function. Underpinning the mechanisms and patterns of biological
   invasions, particularly how both exotic invasions and native-weed
   expansion vary across different habitats and variable degrees of
   human-induced disturbances, is a key scientific endeavor at the
   crossroads of conservation biology and ecology. In this study, we
   explored the diversity of both invasive and native weeds across
   different habitat types and levels of tourism at Ruhuna (Yala) National
   Park of southern Sri Lanka. Species richness as well as abundance of
   both invasive and native weeds varied in response to habitat type and
   extent of tourism. The effects of habitat type and tourism were
   modulated by the distance from the nearest safari road. Therefore, no
   habitat type consistently remained either most or least encroached by
   invasive or native weeds. The physical disturbances and variable niche
   opportunities presented by safari roads have a potentially strong but
   non-linear effect on exotic invasions and native-weed encroachment.
   Co-occurrence of invasive and native weeds at plot level was infrequent.
   At the plot level, the type of invasion (native-weed only, invasive-weed
   only, both, none) varied significantly among habitat types as well as
   levels of tourism. Our findings on drivers of biological invasions can
   provide useful insights to implement management actions and biosecurity
   measures in protected areas that are subject to intensive tourism.},

Abstract = {The release from enemies in the introduced range has often been proposed
   as an explanations for the success of invasive species in the ecosystems
   they colonize. The genus Corbicula comprises several conspicuous and
   comparatively well-studied invasive clam species in freshwater habitats
   worldwide, yet parasitological studies on this group are scarce. We
   conducted a thorough parasitological assessment of the two Corbicula
   spp. present in Argentina, using populations from two early colonization
   sites in Rio de la Plata and two sites of recent colonization in Salta.
   Corbicula fluminea and C. largillierti clams from Rio de la Plata were
   found to be naturally infected with C. limnaei oligochaete worm gill
   parasites, while C. largillierti clams from Salta were free of any
   parasites. To evaluate the susceptibility of Salta populations to
   infection, we exposed clams of two sizes to three different oligochaete
   concentrations in the laboratory. At all concentrations tested, we
   obtained infected clams, and both prevalence and mean intensity of
   infection increased with oligochaete concentration. The field and
   laboratory studies showed that small clams from both species reached
   significantly higher worm prevalence than large conspecifics, although
   in the field this effect was population dependent. The present results
   indicate that C. largillierti does not lack natural enemies nor has
   acquired immunity to them in the locations examined. Instead, the worm's
   absence from wild clam populations is likely related with a low
   availability of parasites in the aquatic habitats occupied by C.
   largillierti in northwestern Argentina. The different ways in which
   freshwater invasive bivalves may obtain release from parasites may play
   a role in their collective success as an invasive group.},

Title = {History, control, epidemiology, ecology, and economy of the invasion of

Abstract = {We reviewed existing studies on the European rabbit in Chile regarding
   history, control, epidemiology, ecology, and economic impacts, comparing
   them with Australia's accumulated knowledge about the same topics. We
   focused especially on the resulting gaps and challenges to orient
   efforts toward controlling and managing rabbits in Chile. The European
   rabbit was first introduced to central Chile in the mid-eighteenth
   century and was reported as naturalized by 1884. It is among the seven
   invasive species that most affect Chilean ecosystems and their
   productive uses. The strongest rabbit impacts have been reported on
   Chilean islands and in the mainland's sclerophyllous forest biome.
   Released rabbits colonized both Juan Fernandez Archipelago in 1935,
   becoming a harmful species damaging endemic vegetation and nesting bird
   populations, and Tierra del Fuego Island in 1936, becoming competitors
   for forage with sheep. The sclerophyllous forest in continental Chile is
   one of the five Mediterranean ecosystems of the world and one of the 34
   critical ``hotspots{''} for conserving the planet's biodiversity. Here,
   released rabbits and escapees have changed the spatial distribution of
   native shrubs and herbs, impeding the regeneration of the native
   matorral. Overall, the impacts of this species during the last 70 years
   in Chile have been addressed chiefly from a community-ecological
   perspective, and applied research is lacking for improving public
   policies and efficient management of this invader. It is urgent to
   determine the geographical distribution, population size, and drivers of
   rabbit dynamics to predict their spread and outbreaks. Also, it is
   necessary to better understand their effects on Chilean natural
   ecosystems and agroecosystems to assess their economic impacts on
   biodiversity and production. In addition, it is essential to research
   pathogens such as Myxoma virus or Lagovirus in Chile, toward determining
   their prevalence, virulence, and corresponding rabbit immunity, to
   estimate and potentially harness any contributions such pathogens could

Title = {Variation in defensive traits against herbivores of native and invasive

Abstract = {The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) predicts that the escape from natural
   enemies, such as specialist herbivores, may explain the invasiveness of
   some invasive alien plants, maximizing their investment in growth and
   reproduction. This release from natural enemies might decrease the
   investment in expensive defense mechanisms (i.e., digestibility
   reducers) against the attack of specialist enemies, whilst increasing
   the investment in defenses (i.e., cheap toxins) and tolerance against
   the attack of generalist herbivores, as exposed by the Shifting Defense
   Hypothesis (SDH). To test this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to
   compare morphological and physiological traits of Carpobrotus edulis,
   collected in its native (South Africa) and introduced (Chile and Spain)
   ranges, attacked by the generalist spittlebug Philaenus spumarius and
   the specialist scale insect Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi. Our results
   do not support the ER and SD hypotheses. We found that C. edulis plants
   collected from native and introduced ranges showed no significant
   differences in growth and defensive compounds studied for both controls
   and those plants under attack by the generalist P. spumarius (i.e.,
   showing no increase in biomass or changes in biochemical defenses). In
   contrast, the specialist herbivore P. mesembryanthemi induced the
   production of total phenols and tannins and reduced the growth and
   survival of C. edulis plants. Overall, we found strong evidence that C.
   edulis is negatively affected by the attack of its specialist herbivore,
   but not by that of generalist herbivore, regardless of origin. The
   observed tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing
   possibility of trait selection, allowing C. edulis plants to tolerate
   generalist herbivores more than specialists.},

Abstract = {Detection and monitoring of target species is the primary strategy in

   to detect invasive species are time consuming and cumbersome, with a
   requisite for trained taxonomists for identification of aquatic species.
   Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based molecular methods offer an alternative,
   as they are quick, cost-effective and require minimal manpower. In this
   study, we design and optimize a reliable eDNA-based quantitative PCR
   assay to detect the African Sharptooth catfish, a highly invasive and
   banned species in India. Here, we delineate the step-by-step processes
   involved in the design and optimization of the assay, and show its
   performance through field-testing in selected water bodies in and around
   the city of Hyderabad. The present workflow can be used to design assays
   to detect a wide range of aquatic species.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},

Abstract = {Insects harbor a diversity of microbes that are known to affect their
   host's response to biotic and abiotic stressors. This is important in
   the context of climate change and human-caused habitat alterations,
   during which drastic changes are so rapid that organisms have little
   time to adapt. Symbionts often accompany invading species, and might
   play a role in the success or failure of insect invasions. Yet, few
   studies have examined the evolutionary dynamics and role of
   gut-associated symbionts at different stages of an insect invasion. We
   focus on the family Tephritidae (Diptera), which comprises many invasive
   pest species, and examine how gut-associated bacteria might influence
   their invasion process based on literature review. Based on our review,
   we first summarize the prevalence and diversity of gut-associated
   bacteria harbored by tephritid species. Next, we highlight how those gut
   communities may influence the fitness of invasive species during the
   colonization process. We conclude that gut-associated symbionts are
   highly flexible, and can respond rapidly to changes in biotic and
   abiotic factors and compensate for limited adaptive capacities of their
   hosts to counteract these stressors, through changes in the taxonomic
   composition or prevalence of the community. However, bacteria of
   Enterobacteriaceae are dominant as well as constitute constant and
   stable populations in fruit fly gut under different environmental
   stressors. Our review reveals that this family represents a key bacteria
   group in all studied tephritid species. This review indicates that
   knowledge on symbiont-insect interactions is crucial for understanding
   the success of insect invasion and it should be considered in risk
   analyses, impact modeling and optimizing invasive pest management.},

Title = {Research gaps limit understanding of invasion-fire cycles},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Invasive plants can alter fuels and fire regimes in ways that facilitate
   their spread and dominance through a process known as the invasion-fire
   cycle. This phenomenon can result in considerable fire and ecosystem
   impacts, but mechanisms, habitat susceptibility, and prevalence of
   invasion-fire cycles are poorly understood. Here, we reviewed literature
   on invasion-fire cycles and describe how mechanisms by which and
   habitats in which invasion-fire cycles occur are influenced by invader
   growth form, including woody versus herbaceous and perennial versus
   annual species, among other factors, and highlight research needs to
   better understand invasion-fire cycles. We found evidence that annual
   herbaceous species facilitated more continuous and frequent fires in
   shrublands and deserts by increasing fine fuel continuity, while
   perennial grasses and woody invaders more often facilitated intense and
   vertically continuous fires in forest habitats by increasing fuel loads.
   There was some evidence woody invaders can suppress fires by decreasing
   fine fuels, and both woody invaders and perennial grasses and forbs can
   inhibit fires due to high fuel moisture and low flammability, but
   effects of fire suppression by invaders on native communities were
   ambiguous. Fire suppression and climate change may complicate effects of
   invasions on fire regimes directly, or indirectly through shifting
   abundances of fire prone or fire adapted native plant species. More
   research is needed to understand how propagule pressure, ignitions,
   climate, and resource availability affect invasion-fire cycles, and to
   determine relative importance of invasion-fire cycles in driving plant
   invasions and effects of invader driven changes to fire regimes on
   native communities.},

Title = {Global change drivers synergize with the negative impacts of non-native
   invasive ants on native seed-dispersing ants},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Non-native species invasion, habitat fragmentation and climate change
   individually impose negative impacts on natural systems, but their
   synergistic effects may do more harm than the sum of their parts. We
   examined the combined effects of these global change drivers by studying
   the impacts of experimental warming on seed-dispersing forest ant
   nesting and foraging in the Southeastern U.S. to determine if warming
   and forest fragmentation facilitated non-native ant invasion effects on
   native ants. Spring ant phenology and activities were monitored for two
   years (2019-2020) at weekly bait stations and in artificial nest
   occupancy. We found that, when combined, forest edge habitat and
   experimental warming favored invasive non-native ant frequency, but the
   experimental warming alone did not appear to facilitate non-native ant
   incursion into forested habitat. We did find, however, that experimental
   warming exacerbated the negative effects of non-native ants on native
   ant foraging. Moreover, fragmented edge habitat strongly limited native
   forest ant foraging and experimental warming increased the negative
   effects of non-native ant invaders on native ants. Ultimately, the
   non-native ants displaced native seed-dispersing ants from artificial
   nests, and the displacement progressively increasing with greater
   experimental warming. Our results suggest that global change drivers
   such as warming, habitat fragmentation and species invasion imposed
   negative impacts individually, but their combined effects were worse
   than the sum of their parts. Moreover, our results indicate that
   predicting species reactions to global change poses great challenges
   given that the strongest impacts were the non-additive effects.},

Abstract = {The Gulf of Maine (GOM) has seen an increasing number of introduced
   species, some of which have significantly impacted benthic community
   structure. In 2017, a number of specimens of the European dorid
   nudibranch, Doris pseudoargus, were observed on rocky ledges in waters
   off Cape Ann, Massachusetts. The presence of numerous specimens and egg
   masses suggested the species had been established before 2017.
   Additional field observations and literature searches revealed specimens
   occurring from Nova Scotia to the northern end of the Cape Cod Canal,
   which poses the question, when and where did the initial introduction
   take place and how? Genetic analysis confirmed the species as Doris
   pseudoargus with genomic similarities to specimens from Northern Europe.
   Until this introduction, the GOM had only one species of sponge feeding
   nudibranch, Cadlina laevis, which is a trophic specialist on one genus
   of sponge. Unlike this endemic, stenotrophic feeding dorid, the
   introduction of another large sized, sponge predator known to feed on
   diverse sponge species, that occur from the intertidal to at least 25 m
   in depth has the potential to significantly impact community structure
   over a wide variety of hard bottom habitats.},

Title = {Multiple sources implicated in the red swamp crayfish invasion in
   Michigan, USA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Reducing propagule pressure is critical for preventing the establishment
   and limiting the spread of invasive species. To reduce the risks
   associated with propagule pressure, the relative impacts of potential
   vectors contributing to invasions must be understood. In 2017, the red
   swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) invasion expanded to include two
   new invasion fronts in Michigan, USA. To determine potential sources and
   make inferences about expansion dynamics among introduced populations,
   we developed genomic resources using restriction-site associated DNA
   (RAD) sequencing to genotype 175 red swamp crayfish at 1321 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. Samples included potential wild and industry
   sources and collections within each Michigan invasion front. Results
   based on unsupervised clustering and multivariate analysis indicated
   that multiple, genetically distinct sources founded the Michigan
   invasions, which may include sources from the biological supply trade.
   Results support the recommendation that prevention strategies implement
   a multifaceted approach targeting diverse user groups associated with
   the live trades (e.g., biological supply, live food markets, and pet
   trade). In addition, regulatory frameworks that minimize the presence of
   a live invasive species should be adopted to reduce the risk of
   incidental introductions, geographic and demographic expansion, and
   establishment.},

Abstract = {Non-native salmonids are protected in the Southern hemisphere where they
   sustain aquaculture and lucrative sport fisheries, but also impact many
   native fishes, which poses a conservation conundrum. Legal protection
   and human-assisted secondary releases may have helped salmonids to
   spread, but this has seldom been tested. We reconstructed the
   introduction of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to the Falkland Islands using
   historical records and modelled its dispersal and probability of
   invasion using a generalized linear model and Leave One out Cross
   Validation. Our results indicate that establishment success was similar
   to 88\%, and that dispersal was facilitated over land by proximity to
   invaded sites and density of stream-road crossings, suggesting it was
   human assisted. Brown trout have already invaded 54\% of Falkland
   rivers, which are 2.9-4.5 times less likely to contain native galaxiids
   than uninvaded streams. Without strong containment we predict brown
   trout will invade nearly all suitable freshwater habitats in the
   Falklands within the next similar to 70 years, which might put native
   freshwater fishes at a high risk of extinction.},

Title = {Biotic resistance or invasional meltdown? Diversity reduces invasibility
   but not exotic dominance in southern California epibenthic communities},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {533-549},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {High community diversity may either prevent or promote the establishment
   of exotic species. The biotic resistance hypothesis holds that
   species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion than
   species-poor communities due to mechanisms including greater
   interspecific competition. Conversely, the invasional meltdown
   hypothesis proposes that greater exotic diversity increases invasibility
   via facilitative interactions between exotic species. To evaluate the
   degree to which biotic resistance or invasional meltdown influences
   marine community structure during the assembly period, we studied the
   development of marine epibenthic ``fouling{''} communities at two
   southern California harbors. With a focus on sessile epibenthic species,
   we found that fewer exotic species established as total and exotic
   richness increased during community assembly and that this effect
   remained after accounting for space availability. We also found that
   changes in exotic abundance decreased over time. Throughout the assembly
   period, gains in exotic abundance were greatest when space was abundant
   and richness was low. Altogether, we found greater support for biotic
   resistance than invasional meltdown, suggesting that both native and
   exotic species contribute to biotic resistance during early development
   of these communities. However, our results indicate that biotic
   resistance may not always reduce the eventual dominance of exotic
   species.},

Title = {Boring can get you far: shell-boring Dipolydora from Temperate Northern

   (Mesnil, 1893) (Annelida: Spionidae)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 30},
Abstract = {Two well-known and long-standing global vectors for the dispersal of
   marine species are international shipping and international trade in
   edible seafood. Far less well known is the impact of these interoceanic
   movements on the biogeography of species boring into the calcareous
   substrata (barnacles and tubeworms in vessel biofouling and mollusc
   shells, such as oysters, in the aquaculture trade) that often
   characterize these vectors. We review shell-boring polychaete worms in
   the genus Dipolydora from the Temperate Northern Pacific, seeking to
   elucidate the possible consequences of anthropogenic dispersal on
   selected species. An emphasis is placed on D. giardi (Mesnil in Cr Hebd
   Seances Acad Sci Paris 117:643-645, 1893) which was originally described
   from northern France and later reported worldwide. This species is an
   opportunistic borer of shells of various molluscs and other calcareous
   biogenic substrata. The Bayesian inference analysis of sequence data of
   four gene fragments (2468 bp in total) of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA,
   nuclear 18S, 28S rDNA, and Histone 3 shows that individuals from
   northern and Mediterranean France, Argentina, Australia, Italy, Japan,
   South Africa, South Korea, and the Pacific coasts of Canada and the USA
   are genetically similar and can be considered conspecific. Polydora
   trilobata Radashevsky, 1993 described from the Sea of Japan, Russia, is
   synonymized with D. giardi. We suggest that international shipping and
   the movement of commercial oysters, previously overlooked as key
   processes in creating its global distribution, may have dispersed D.
   giardi to far-flung corners of the world. An identification key to nine
   shell-boring Dipolydora species from the Temperate Northern Pacific is
   provided.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {431-440},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Invasive macrophytes are troublesome in a myriad of freshwater
   ecosystems worldwide. Before causing threats to recipient communities,
   invasive species face abiotic and biotic environmental factors during
   colonization and establishment that may hamper their success. We
   experimentally investigated the separate effects of one abiotic factor
   (sediment organic matter) and two biotic factors (competition and
   herbivory), along with their interactions, on the growth of the exotic
   species Hydrilla verticillata in its invasive range. We found that
   herbivory by the native mollusk Pomacea canaliculata, competition with
   the native macrophyte Egeria najas and high organic matter in sediment
   negatively impacted the performance of the exotic species in terms of
   plant height, biomass production and branching. However, the intensity
   of each limiting factor depends on the presence of a second factor, as
   indicated by significant interactions between sediment type x herbivory
   and competition x herbivory. Our most important finding was that these
   three factors act synergistically, with a disproportional significant
   negative impact on the exotic macrophyte. Because the native competitor
   and herbivore we used occur in lakes with high organic matter in the
   sediment, our findings help to explain why H. verticillata has still not
   colonized several aquatic habitats (i.e., floodplain lakes) in South
   America.},

Title = {Designing a surveillance program for early detection of alien plants and
   insects in Norway},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 14},
Abstract = {Naturalized species of alien plants and animals comprise < 3\% of
   biodiversity recorded in Norway but have had major impacts on natural
   ecosystems through displacement of native species. Encroachment of alien
   species has been especially problematic for coastal sites close to
   transport facilities and urban areas with high density housing. The goal
   of our field project was to design and test a surveillance program for
   early detection of alien species of vascular plants and terrestrial
   insects at the first phase of establishment in natural areas. In our
   3-year project (2018-2020), we sampled 60 study plots in three counties
   in the Oslofjord region of southern Norway. Study plots (6.25 ha) were
   selected by two criteria: manual selection based on expert opinion (27
   plots) or by random selection based on weights from a hotspot analysis
   of occurrence of alien species (33 plots). Vascular plants were surveyed
   by two experienced botanists who found a total of 239 alien species of
   vascular plants in 95 rounds of surveys. Insects and other invertebrates
   were captured with a single Malaise trap per site, with 3-4 rounds of
   repeated sampling. We used DNA-metabarcoding to identify invertebrates
   based on DNA extractions from crushed insects or from the preservative
   media. Over 3500 invertebrate taxa were detected in 255 rounds of
   sampling. We recorded 20 alien species of known risk, and 115 species
   that were new to Norway, including several `doorknocker' species
   identified by previous risk assessments. We modeled the probabilities of
   occupancy (psi) and detection (p) with occupancy models with repeated
   visits by multiple observers (vascular plants) or multiple rounds of
   sampling (insects). The two probabilities covaried with risk category
   for alien organisms and both were low for species categorized as no
   known or low risk (range = 0.052-0.326) but were higher for species
   categorized as severe risk (range = 0.318-0.651). Selecting sites at
   random or manually did not improve the probability of finding novel
   alien species, but occupancy had a weak positive relationship with
   housing density for some categories of alien plants and insects. We used
   our empirical estimates to test alternative sampling designs that would
   minimize the combined variance of occupancy and detection (A-optimality
   criterion). Sampling designs with 8-10 visits per site were best for
   surveillance of new alien species if the probabilities of occupancy and
   detection were both low, and provided low conditional probabilities of
   site occupancy (<(psi)over cap> <= 0.032) and a high probabilities of
   cumulative detection ((p) over cap{*} >= 0.943). Our field results
   demonstrate that early detection is feasible as a key component of a
   national surveillance program based on early detection and rapid
   response.},

Title = {Uncoupled flowering and fruiting phenology as the strategy of non-native
   invasive woody species in seasonally dry ecosystems},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {365-377},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The timing of flowering and fruiting events is an important trait for
   explaining plant invasion. Seasonally dry ecosystems are characterized
   by a restricted growing season which imposes limitations on species
   reproduction. In these ecosystems to succeed, non-native species may
   have one of two phenological strategies. Coupled phenology with natives
   might be a product of an adjustment to environmental filters, exposing
   open flowers altogether, thus increasing the possibility of diluting
   some antagonist interactions but also mutualistic ones. Conversely,
   tolerating a wider range of environmental conditions might generate
   uncouple phenology, due to using a Vacant niche or having longer
   phenological periods. Previous evidence observed that non-natives have
   divergent strategies with natives in these ecosystems; thus, we expect
   to find uncoupled phenology. This uncoupled phenology may be associated
   with changes in the timing or length of the reproductive period. The aim
   of this work was to analyze the flowering and fruiting phenological
   strategies developed by the most frequent native and non-native woody
   species through a multi-year study. We measured the beginning and length
   of flowering and fruiting of sixteen species during four consecutive
   reproductive periods. We found that the phenology of non-native species
   was uncouple with natives. Non-natives showed a delay in flowering and
   fruiting and had a longer fruiting phenology period. Moreover, unlike
   the natives, non-natives fruited out of the growing season. The
   different phenological strategies found in non-native species may
   generate different interactions and windows of opportunities that may
   explain invasion and have profound consequences on ecosystem processes
   and functions.},

Title = {Using semiochemicals to predict biotic resistance and facilitation of

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Invasive species are leading causes of biodiversity loss and economic
   damage. Prevention and management of invasions requires risk assessments
   based on ecological knowledge for species of potential concern.
   Interactions between introduced species and heterospecifics in the
   recipient community may affect the likelihood of establishment through
   biotic resistance and facilitation and are therefore important
   predictors of invasion risk. Experimentally exposing one species to
   another to observe their interactions is not always safe or practical,
   and containment facilities offer artificial environments which may limit
   the number of species and the types of interactions that may be tested.
   To predict biotic resistance and facilitation in a more natural setting,
   we deployed traps with pheromone lures in the field to mimic the
   presence of two potentially invasive spruce bark beetles, the European
   Ips typographus (tested in eastern Canada), and the North American
   Dendroctonus rufipennis (tested in Norway). We identified and counted
   possible predators, competitors, and facilitators that were captured in
   the traps. In eastern Canada, possible predators and competitors
   responded strongly to I. typographus lures, suggesting the potential for
   considerable biotic resistance. In Norway, D. rufipennis lures prompted
   little response by predators or competitors, suggesting that D.
   rufipennis may experience reduced biotic resistance in Europe.
   Dendroctonus rufipennis was also attracted to I. typographus pheromone,
   which may encourage facilitation between these species through
   cooperative mass attack on trees. Our findings will inform
   invasive-species risk assessments for I. typographus and D. rufipennis
   and highlight useful methods for predicting interactions between species
   that rely heavily on semiochemical communication.},

Title = {Wild boar rooting impacts soil function differently in different plant
   community types},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {583-592},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While numerous studies focus on the ecosystem effects of invasive
   mammals, few explore the causal mechanisms of such effects. Wild boar is
   one of the most widely introduced invasive mammal species in the world.
   By overturning extensive areas of vegetation and soil to feed on
   belowground resources, wild boar alter the soil food web and thus many
   microbial-mediated soil processes. Here, we take advantage of a
   long-term, 8-year, wild boar exclosure experiment across three plant
   community types in Patagonia, Argentina to explore how wild boar impact
   soil communities and their potential function. Previous work in this
   experimental system found that wild boar significantly impacted litter
   decomposition in the field, but it remained unclear if this effect was
   mediated through changes in abiotic or biotic soil properties. To
   explore both the abiotic and biotic drivers of decomposition, we
   measured soil moisture, soil temperature, soil bulk density, and soil
   respiration as well as soil micro-arthropod richness and abundance,
   earthworm abundance, and microbial biomass inside and outside of 10
   exclosures in each of three plant community types. To assess potential
   microbial activity, we measured potential decomposition rates,
   substrate-induced respiration, and soil microbial enzyme activity.
   Rooting decreased soil moisture by 18\% across plant communities, and
   soil respiration by 30\% in Nothofagus and Austrocedrus forests.
   Additionally, rooting decreased soil microarthropod richness and
   abundance by similar to 80\% in shrublands. However, rooting had no
   effect on soil potential microbial activity. Together, our results
   suggest that changes in both abiotic and biotic soil factors likely
   mediate observed wild boar impact on decomposition rates. Overall, we
   show that wild boar rooting alters soil functioning, but the pathway of
   impact varies by plant community, suggesting that wild boar impacts on
   native ecosystems can be difficult to predict.},

Title = {The invasion history of Elodea canadensis and E. nuttallii
   (Hydrocharitaceae) in Italy from herbarium accessions, field records and
   historical literature},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 3},
Abstract = {We analysed the invasion history of two North American macrophytes
   (Elodea canadensis and E. nuttallii) in Italy, through an accurate
   census of all available herbarium and field records, dating between 1850
   and 2019, and a rich literature collection describing the initial
   introduction and naturalisation phase that supports the results obtained
   by the occurrence records. Elodea canadensis arrived in Italy before
   1866 and had two invasion phases, between the 1890s and 1920s and
   between the 1990s and 2000s; E. nuttallii, probably arrived in the
   1970s, started invading in 2000 and the invasion is still ongoing.
   Botanical gardens and fish farming played a crucial role in dispersal
   and naturalisation of both species. The current invasion range of both
   species is centred in northern Italy, with scattered occurrences of E.
   canadensis in central and southern regions. River Po represents a
   dispersal barrier to the Mediterranean region and a strategic monitoring
   site to prevent the invasion in the peninsula. The study detects
   differences in the niches of the two species during the introduction and
   naturalisation phase and a habitat switch occurred after 1980 in E.
   canadensis and after 2000 in E. nuttallii, during their expansion
   phases. For E. canadensis the switch corresponds to the second invasion
   round. Further research can clarify whether the second invasion round is
   due to confusion of the recently introduced E. nuttallii with E.
   canadensis, to a cryptic introduction of a new genotype, to
   post-introduction evolution, or just to an increased scientific interest
   in biological invasions.},

Title = {Urochloa arrecta: an African invasive Poaceae in Brazil with low genetic
   diversity},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Poaceae has numerous species that are highly invasive thorough the
   planet. Urochloa, native to Africa, stands out in terms of invasion and
   impacts in South America. However, the correct identification of the
   species included in this genus is complex due to their morphological
   similarity with other species and there is a lack of studies involving
   the genetic variability of some species in Brazil, which is important
   for understanding the invasion mechanisms and planning control measures.
   In this study, we evaluated the genetic variability of the invasive
   exotic Poaceae Urochloa arrecta in different Brazilian regions, by using
   the nuclear marker ITS and the intergenetic chloroplast marker
   trnL-trnF. The sequences obtained were compared with those available in
   GenBank (NCBI). The results indicated a low genetic differentiation
   among the sampled populations. Seven and ten distinct haplotypes were
   identified for ITS and trnL-trnF, respectively, and most specimens
   shared a single haplotype. These results indicate that a limited number
   of propagules were introduced in the invasive range and/or that this
   species reproduces mainly through asexual reproduction. This last
   possibility is suggested by the great regeneration and colonization
   rates of asexual propagules of this species. The data obtained are
   useful for understanding the invasion mechanisms of the group in the
   region.},

Title = {Patterns in spatial use and movement of Silver Carp among tributaries
   and main-stem rivers: insight from otolith microchemistry analysis},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have established
   populations throughout the Missouri River basin. The main-stem Missouri
   River has undergone a multitude of alterations, creating a channel with
   greater mean depths and velocities, limiting optimal habitat for Silver
   Carp. Tributaries to the Missouri River may provide refuge from the
   swift flows within the main-stem Missouri River and, therefore, may play
   a vital role in the life-cycle of Silver Carp throughout the basin.
   Understanding the spatial extent under which these invasive fish
   function in this large, open river system is crucial to inform
   management efforts. Here, we used otolith microchemistry of Silver Carp
   from the Kansas River, a major tributary to the Missouri River, to
   reconstruct environmental histories as a means to assess the proportions
   of resident (individuals who never left the Kansas River system) and
   transient (individuals who at some point occupied the Missouri River)
   individuals. Silver Carp within the Kansas River were predominantly
   residents (adults = 54\%; juveniles = 65\%) with the majority of
   reproduction coming from within the Kansas River itself. These results
   suggest removal efforts in the Kansas River may be effective means of
   managing this invasive fish species. Transient fish exhibited short
   durations of signatures indicative of the Missouri River (mean percent
   of data points for adults = 10\% and juveniles = 36\%), suggesting
   movements into the Missouri River were brief. These results highlight
   the importance of connectivity of tributary habitat among large rivers
   and provides important information for invasive species management.},

Title = {Genetic and morphological comparisons of lesser celandine (Ficaria
   verna) invasions suggest regionally widespread sexual reproduction},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {379-397},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Both asexual and sexual reproduction can provide important keys to the
   success of invasive species. A species with potential for both is lesser
   celandine (Ficaria verna), a European native with multiple subspecies
   that have been introduced in North America as ornamentals and escaped
   cultivation. Asexual reproduction via bulbils is prolific in many
   introduced populations of lesser celandine, with sexual reproduction
   reportedly rare. Although genetic and morphological diversity of
   European celandine has been studied, few have examined invasive North
   American populations. We aimed to document introduced genotypic and
   phenotypic diversity at a regional scale. We first compared
   sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) genotypes of 64
   individuals collected from Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland, OH. In a
   second experiment, we phenotyped 129 individuals from the same regions
   and from Louisville, KY, measuring traits in an outdoor common garden
   experiment. The SRAP markers were highly polymorphic and revealed
   surprising genetic differentiation. Genetic and trait variation were
   both structured across regions, but we also saw high variation within
   regions. Cleveland populations differed the most genetically and
   morphologically. Nearly every individual made asexual bulbils, and many
   individuals that flowered produced expanded achenes. Trait data
   suggested subspecies verna or ficariiformis occur in these regions.
   Genetic admixture within regions and within individuals, along with
   achene expansion, suggests sexual reproduction may be widespread. Sexual
   and asexual propagules may spread by different vectors, and our
   resistance analyses indicated water dispersal and habitat availability
   contribute to genetic structure. These findings suggest that celandine
   has substantial potential for further spread and evolutionary change.},

Title = {The Joro spider (Trichonephila clavata) in the southeastern US: an
   opportunity for research and a call for reasonable journalism},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Trichonephila clavata, also known as the Joro spider, was first
   discovered in Georgia, USA in 2014. Its arrival from Asia and subsequent
   range expansion across the southeastern U.S. has received much media
   coverage, spanning from factual to sensational. Here, we describe T.
   clavata's invasion potential and known invasive range, and review its
   biology, dispersal abilities, potential impacts, and management
   strategies. As of October 2022, T. clavata's range spans at least
   120,000 km(2), occurring across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina,
   and Tennessee, with additional reports in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma,
   and West Virginia. Its pattern of spread suggests it is primarily driven
   by natural dispersal mechanisms, such as ballooning, though
   human-mediated transport cannot be discounted. Like other large-bodied
   orb-weavers, T. clavata captures and feeds on flying insects and
   potentially other small animals, and we suggest thirteen co-occurring
   spider species that should be monitored for competition with T. clavata
   for resources and web-building sites. Since T. clavata is spreading
   across both natural and urban habitats, management options are limited.
   Overall, very little is known about this species in its new North
   American range, especially its impacts within this novel ecosystem.
   Thus, we advise journalists and experts alike against exaggerating its
   potential environmental impact or uncritical acceptance of the spider as
   ecologically harmless. Instead, T. clavata's rapid spread should be
   carefully monitored, and we should take a cautious, evidence-based

Abstract = {Biosecurity is essential to protect against the negative effects of
   non-native invasive species. As part of the government's `Biosecurity
   2025' Initiative to enlist all New Zealanders as biosecurity risk
   managers, Tauranga Moana has been named the `biosecurity capital' of New
   Zealand. The initiative will involve large-scale citizen science, for
   reporting and management of pest and disease threats. In this context we
   measured baseline awareness, perceptions and behaviour around
   biosecurity among two key groups of respondents, the local community at
   Mount Maunganui (surrounding Tauranga's port) and school children. An
   online survey was completed by 324 members of the local community, while
   120 school children completed a survey about their biosecurity knowledge
   and behaviours after using a biosecurity education kit. Results indicate
   that while both groups report a relatively high level of understanding
   about the concept of biosecurity, and acknowledge it as extremely
   important, knowledge of current pest threats and correct biosecurity
   behaviours could be improved. Mount Maunganui community members rate
   their understanding of biosecurity as better than the average New
   Zealander, but are less likely to have taken regular biosecurity action
   in the past year. For school children, improved biosecurity efforts
   could be evidenced by more active pest monitoring, and greater
   discussion about biosecurity outside of school (e.g. with their family
   at home). Key enablers for achieving more impactful citizen science for
   biosecurity among these groups are targeted education, and practical
   advice about what they can do to help.},

Abstract = {Ambrosia beetles of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex are
   emerging tree pests with a broad host range including important
   agricultural crops. Native to Southeast Asia, these species were
   introduced into various countries, where they cause considerable damage
   to many tree species. Here we report several outbreaks of E. fornicatus
   s.l. in Europe. The first individuals were found in 2017 in a palm house
   of a botanical garden in Poznan (Poland) whereas in 2020 an outbreak was
   detected in a tropical greenhouse in Merano (Italy). In 2021, two
   additional outbreaks were detected in two greenhouses in Germany, in
   Erfurt and Berlin. For both cases in Germany it was possible to trace
   back the invasion to a distributor of exotic plants in the Netherlands
   where several infested plants were detected. Molecular analyses show
   that individuals from Poland and Italy are genetically identical but
   belong to a different mitochondrial clade than individuals in Germany
   which are identical to most individuals of two greenhouses in the
   Netherlands. Moreover, in the two greenhouses in the Netherlands we
   found beetles that belong to another haplotype of E. fornicatus and two
   haplotypes of E. perbrevis, a species in the E. fornicatus complex,
   which has not been previously intercepted in Europe. Our study provides
   novel insights into the invasion history of E. fornicatus and the
   eradication measures in Europe. Considering the potential of
   introduction and establishment of Euwallacea ambrosia beetles,
   particular attention should be paid to monitor the presence of these
   pests in tropical greenhouses across Europe.},

Title = {Pattern of infection by honeysuckle leaf blight, a possible accumulating
   pathogen, on invasive Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) shrubs in
   understory and open habitats},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is a widespread invasive species in
   North America with extensive effects on native ecosystems. Since 2012,
   there have been extensive outbreaks of the native leaf fungal pathogen,
   honeysuckle leaf blight (Insolibasidium deformans), on L. maackii. This
   pathogen infects leaves in the late spring/early summer and eventually
   kills the leaves. Our objective was to describe patterns of blight
   occurrence on L. maackii growing in both the forest understory and in
   the open in northern Kentucky, USA. Smaller shrubs had a larger fraction
   of blighted leaves, because they allocated more production to long
   shoots, which are more susceptible to leaf blight. Overall, blight
   occurrence was as high as 8\% on the smallest shrubs, though it was an
   order of magnitude lower on the largest shrubs sampled. Leaf blight
   appears to be an emerging pathogen that fits the Pathogen Accumulation
   Hypothesis. We developed a growth model that suggested small (< 5 cm
   basal diameter) open shrubs would be most affected by blight. Thus,
   future work should focus on comparison of the survival and growth of
   small infected versus uninfected L. maackii plants, as they appear to be
   most affected by the leaf blight.},

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 8},
Abstract = {A fossil Mycetophilidae from the Aptian Crato Formation-Cretomanota
   gondwanica gen. nov., sp. nov.-is described, which is the first
   mycetophilid from the Crato Formation and corresponds to the oldest
   known fossil leiine and only the second Gondwanan fossil mycetophilid
   described so far. Cretomanota gondwanica and both species of Alavamanota
   Blagoderov and Arillo were added as terminals to the data matrix of a
   general phylogenetic analysis of the Mycetophilidae, and both fit into
   the Leiinae. Alavamanota is monophyletic, sister to the clade composed
   by Cretomanota and the extant genus Manota Williston. The biology of the
   extant members of this fungivorous family corroborates the
   reconstruction of the Crato palaeoenvironment as including woodlands
   with humid habitats and microhabitats. The presence of a Cretaceous
   member of the tribe Manotini at low latitudes in South America
   reinforces the hypothesis that the clade with all manotines except
   Leiella Edwards corresponds to a Lower Cretaceous offshoot from a group
   in southern Gondwana expanding its distribution to more northern areas
   into the Gondwana and into Laurasia.},

   roots of phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Willi Hennig's (Beitr. Ent. 1960, 10, 15) Die Dipteren-Fauna von
   Neuseeland als systematisches und tiergeographisches Problem applied a
   phylogenetic approach to examine the distributional patterns exhibited
   by the Diptera of New Zealand. Hennig showed how phylogenetic trees may
   be used to infer dispersal, based on the progression and deviation
   rules, and also discussed the existence of vicariance patterns. The most
   important author who applied Hennig's phylogenetic biogeography was Lars
   Brundin, when analysing the phylogenetic relationships of two taxa of
   Chironomidae (Diptera) and using them to examine the biogeographic
   relationships of Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.
   The relevance of Brundin's contribution was noted by several authors, as
   it began the cladistic or vicariance approach to biogeography, that
   implies the discovery of vicariance events shared by different
   monophyletic groups. Both phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography have a
   place in contemporary biogeography, the former for analysing taxon
   biogeography and the latter when addressing Earth or biota biogeography.
   The recent use of the term ``phylogenetic biogeography{''} to refer to a
   posteriori methods of cladistic biogeography is erroneous and should be
   avoided.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny of the tropical wandering spiders (Araneae,
   Ctenidae) and the evolution of eye conformation in the RTA clade},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Tropical wandering spiders (Ctenidae) are a diverse group of cursorial
   predators with its greatest species richness in the tropics.
   Traditionally, Ctenidae are diagnosed based on the presence of eight
   eyes arranged in three rows (a 2-4-2 pattern). We present a molecular
   phylogeny of Ctenidae, including for the first time representatives of
   all of its subfamilies. The molecular phylogeny was inferred using five
   nuclear (histone H3, 28S, 18S, Actin and ITS-2) and four mitochondrial
   (NADH, COI, 12S and 16S) markers. The final matrix includes 259
   terminals, 103 of which belong to Ctenidae and represent 28 of the
   current 49 described genera. We estimated divergence times by including
   fossils as calibration points and biogeographic events, and used the
   phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to reconstruct the evolution of the eye
   conformation in the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade. Ctenidae
   and its main lineages originated during the Paleocene-Eocene and have
   diversified in the tropics since then. However, in some analyses
   Ctenidae was recovered as polyphyletic as the genus Ancylometes Bertkau,
   1880 was placed as sister to Oxyopidae. Except for Acantheinae, in which
   the type genus Acantheis Thorell, 1891 is placed inside Cteninae, the
   four recognized subfamilies of Ctenidae are monophyletic in most
   analyses. The ancestral reconstruction of the ocular conformation in the
   retrolateral tibial apophysis clade suggests that the ocular pattern of

Abstract = {Vertebrate blood coagulation is controlled by a cascade containing more
   than 20 proteins. The cascade proteins are found in the blood in their
   zymogen forms and when the cascade is triggered by tissue damage,
   zymogens are activated and in turn activate their downstream proteins by
   serine protease activity. In this study, we examined proteomes of 21
   chordates, of which 18 are vertebrates, to reveal the modular evolution
   of the blood coagulation cascade. Additionally, two Arthropoda species
   were used to compare domain arrangements of the proteins belonging to
   the hemolymph clotting and the blood coagulation cascades. Within the
   vertebrate coagulation protein set, almost half of the studied proteins
   are shared with jawless vertebrates. Domain similarity analyses revealed
   that there are multiple possible evolutionary trajectories for each
   coagulation protein. During the evolution of higher vertebrate clades,
   gene and genome duplications led to the formation of other coagulation
   cascade proteins.},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Epistasis is an evolutionary phenomenon whereby the fitness effect of a
   mutation depends on the genetic background in which it arises. A key
   source of epistasis in an RNA molecule is its secondary structure, which
   contains functionally important topological motifs held together by
   hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs. Here we study
   epistasis in the secondary structure of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by examining properties of derived
   alleles arising from substitution mutations at ancestral WC base-paired
   and unpaired (UP) sites in 15 conserved topological motifs across the
   genome. We uncover fewer derived alleles and lower derived allele
   frequencies at WC than at UP sites, supporting the hypothesis that
   modifications to the secondary structure are often deleterious. At WC
   sites, we also find lower derived allele frequencies for mutations that
   abolish base pairing than for those that yield G center dot U
   ``wobbles,{''} illustrating that weak base pairing can partially
   preserve the integrity of the secondary structure. Last, we show that WC
   sites under the strongest epistatic constraint reside in a three-stemmed
   pseudoknot motif that plays an essential role in programmed ribosomal
   frameshifting, whereas those under the weakest epistatic constraint are
   located in 3' UTR motifs that regulate viral replication and
   pathogenicity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of epistasis in
   the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure, as well as
   highlight putative structural and functional targets of different forms
   of natural selection.},

Title = {Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction of the Ribosomal Protein uS8 and
   Reduction of Amino Acid Usage to a Smaller Alphabet},

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Understanding the origin and early evolution of proteins is important
   for unveiling how the RNA world developed into an RNA-protein world.
   Because the composition of organic molecules in the Earth's primitive
   environment was plausibly not as diverse as today, the number of
   different amino acids used in early protein synthesis is likely to be
   substantially less than the current 20 proteinogenic residues. In this
   study, we have explored the thermal stability and RNA binding of
   ancestral variants of the ribosomal protein uS8 constructed from a
   reduced-alphabet of amino acids. First, we built a phylogenetic tree
   based on the amino acid sequences of uS8 from multiple extant organisms
   and used the tree to infer two plausible amino acid sequences
   corresponding to the last bacterial common ancestor of uS8. Both
   ancestral proteins were thermally stable and bound to an RNA fragment.
   By eliminating individual amino acid letters and monitoring thermal
   stability and RNA binding in the resulting proteins, we reduced the size
   of the amino acid set constituting one of the ancestral proteins,
   eventually finding that convergent sequences consisting of 15- or
   14-amino acid alphabets still folded into stable structures that bound
   to the RNA fragment. Furthermore, a simplified variant reconstructed
   from a 13-amino-acid alphabet retained affinity for the RNA fragment,
   although it lost conformational stability. Collectively, RNA-binding
   activity may be achieved with a subset of the current 20 amino acids,
   raising the possibility of a simpler composition of RNA-binding proteins
   in the earliest stage of protein evolution.},

Title = {Bayesian Cross-Validation Comparison of Amino Acid Replacement Models:
   Contrasting Profile Mixtures, Pairwise Exchangeabilities, and

Abstract = {Models of amino acid replacement are central to modern phylogenetic
   inference, particularly so when dealing with deep evolutionary
   relationships. Traditionally, a single, empirically derived matrix was
   utilized, so as to keep the degrees-of-freedom of the inference low, and
   focused on topology. With the growing size of data sets, however, an
   amino acid-level general-time-reversible matrix has become increasingly
   feasible, treating amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies as free
   parameters. Moreover, models based on mixtures of multiple matrices are
   increasingly utilized, in order to account for across-site
   heterogeneities in amino acid requirements of proteins. Such models
   exist as finite empirically-derived amino acid profile (or frequency)
   mixtures, free finite mixtures, as well as free Dirichlet process-based
   infinite mixtures. All of these approaches are typically combined with a
   gamma-distributed rates-across-sites model. In spite of the availability
   of these different aspects to modeling the amino acid replacement
   process, no study has systematically quantified their relative
   contributions to their predictive power of real data. Here, we use
   Bayesian cross-validation to establish a detailed comparison, while
   activating/deactivating each modeling aspect. For most data sets
   studied, we find that amino acid mixture models can outrank all
   single-matrix models, even when the latter include gamma-distributed
   rates and the former do not. We also find that free finite mixtures
   consistently outperform empirical finite mixtures. Finally, the
   Dirichlet process-based mixture model tends to outperform all other
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Codon usage is the outcome of different evolutionary processes and can
   inform us about the conditions in which organisms live and evolve. Here,
   we present R\_ENC', which is an improvement to the original S index
   developed by dos Reis et al. (2004). Our index is less sensitive to G+C
   content, which greatly affects synonymous codon usage in prokaryotes,
   making it better suited to detect selection acting on codon usage. We
   used R\_ENC' to estimate the extent of selected codon usage bias in 1800
   genomes representing 26 prokaryotic phyla. We found that
   Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes
   are the phyla/subphyla showing more genomes with selected codon usage
   bias. In particular, we found that several lineages within
   Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes show a similar set of functional
   terms enriched in genes under selected codon usage bias, indicating
   convergent evolution. We also show that selected codon usage bias tends
   to evolve in genes coding for the translation machinery before other
   functional GO terms. Finally, we discuss the possibility to use R\_ENC'
   to predict whether lineages evolved in copiotrophic or oligotrophic
   environments.},

Abstract = {Troponin T (TnT) is the thin filament anchoring subunit of troponin
   complex and plays an organizer role in the Ca2+-regulation of striated
   muscle contraction. From an ancestral gene emerged similar to 700
   million years ago in Bilateria, three homologous genes have evolved in
   vertebrates to encode muscle type-specific isoforms of TnT. Alternative
   splicing variants of TnT are present in vertebrate and invertebrate
   muscles to add functional diversity. While the C-terminal region of TnT
   is largely conserved, it contains an alternatively spliced segment
   emerged early in C. elegans, which has evolved into a pair of mutually
   exclusive exons in arthropods (10A and 10B of Drosophila TpnT gene) and
   vertebrates (16 and 17 of fast skeletal muscle Tnnt3 gene). The
   C-terminal alternatively spliced segment of TnT interfaces with the
   other two subunits of troponin with functional significance. The
   vertebrate cardiac TnT gene that emerged from duplication of the fast
   TnT gene has eliminated this alternative splicing by the fixation of an
   exon 17-like constitutive exon, indicating a functional value in slower
   and rhythmic contractions. The vertebrate slow skeletal muscle TnT gene
   that emerged from duplication of the cardiac TnT gene has the exon
   17-like structure conserved, indicating its further function in
   sustained and fatigue resistant contractions. This functionality-based
   evolution is consistent with the finding that exon 10B-encoded segment
   of Drosophila TnT homologous to the exon 17-encoded segment of
   vertebrate fast TnT is selectively expressed in insect heart and leg
   muscles. The evolution of the C-terminal variable region of TnT
   demonstrates a submolecular mechanism in modifying striated muscle
   contractility and for the treatment of muscle and heart diseases.},
