Title = {Dye solution experiments for determining solute transport behaviour in
   degraded wetland soils of the Yellow River Delta},

Abstract = {Solute transport behaviour can indicate the efficiency of
   eco-hydrological responses. However, this behaviour has not been
   consider for use in assessing the health of wetland ecosystems. We
   assessed solute transport behaviour in degraded wetland soils using 72
   undisturbed soil columns located in Robinia pseudoacacia (tree) and
   Tamarix chinensis (bush) communities. Soil column tracer experiments
   were conducted under the same initial and boundary conditions using
   Brilliant Blue FCF as a conservative tracer. Solute transport behaviour
   at a soil column scale was described by four measures: steady
   infiltration rate of effluents, concentration of effluents, dye staining
   patterns and cumulative effluents leaching. Numerical modelling by the
   dual-permeability model in HYDRUS-1D was used to simulate the proportion
   of cumulative effluents leaching from soil macropores. These data showed
   that steady infiltration rate of effluents at the tree site decreased
   with increasing soil depth (5.742, 0.716, 0.657, and 0.458 ml/min) but
   at the bush site first increased and then subsequently decreased with
   increasing soil depth (0.336, 0.548, 0.974 and 0.379 ml/min). The
   concentration of effluents at the tree site (0.583, 0.149, 0.147 and
   0.067 g/L) and the bush site (0.281, 0.109, 0.161 and 0.053 g/L)
   decreased nonlinearly with increasing soil depth. Dye staining patterns
   were significantly different between different soil locations. The
   largest dark blue staining domains were from 0 to 10 cm soil depths at
   the tree site and 20-40 cm depths at the bush site. The proportion of
   cumulative effluents leaching from soil macropores ranged from 37.6\% to
   61.1\% at the tree site and ranged from 0\% to 99.9\% at the bush site.
   Understanding the solute transport behaviour in the Yellow River Delta
   is the first step towards the restoration of degraded wetlands.},

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions hotspots and drivers of urban freshwater bodies
   in areas of the Yangtze River delta, China},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {In the modern era, urban freshwater bodies play a significant role in
   global carbon (C) budgeting, therefore, impacting climate change under
   rising global mean temperature. However, the trend, magnitude and
   drivers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these urban freshwater
   bodies of China remain uncertain. This study investigated temporal
   changes in GHG emissions in urban water bodies, including artificial
   lakes, reservoirs, aquaculture ponds and rivers, within a year in
   Nanjing city in the areas of the Yangtze River delta of China. In
   addition, meteorological and hydrochemical parameters were measured to
   elucidate the key drivers of GHG emissions. The results showed that the
   average annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in
   aquaculture ponds was estimated to be 1355.6 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and
   116.6 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), followed by that of artificial lakes were
   1172.2 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 44.1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1), rivers
   reached 775.9 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 23.9 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) and
   reservoirs were 170.1 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and 7.2 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1),
   respectively. The results further suggest that although artificial lakes
   and aquaculture ponds occupied only 23\% of the cumulative area under
   lakes and ponds in the Yangtze River delta, contribute approximately
   43\%, about 27.5 Gg C, of total fluxes. Furthermore, high concentrations
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low dissolved oxygen (DO)
   coincided with the high GHG emissions. The study suggests that DO, DOC,
   temperature and wind speed are the key factors impacting the potential
   of GHG emissions in urban freshwater ecosystems. Strategic mitigation
   measures in the vicinity of the urban freshwater bodies could
   efficiently reduce carbon emissions in the future.},

Title = {Coordinated evaporative demand and precipitation maximize rainfed maize
   and soybean crop yields in the USA},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To understand how climate change affects crop yields, we need to
   identify the climatic indices that best predict yields. Grain yields are
   most often predicted using precipitation and temperature in statistical
   models, assuming linear dependences. However, soil water availability is
   more influential for plant growth than precipitation and temperature,
   and there is ecophysiological evidence of intermediate yield maximizing
   conditions. Using rainfed maize and soybean yields for 1970-2010 across
   the USA, we tested whether the aridity index, that is, the ratio of
   precipitation and potential evapotranspiration seasonal totals and a
   proxy of soil water availability, better predicts yield than growing
   season precipitation total, average temperature and their interaction.
   We also tested for non-monotonic responses allowing for intermediate
   yield-maximizing conditions. The aridity index alone explained 77\% and
   72\% of maize and soybean yield variability, compared with 78\% and 73\%
   explained by temperature, precipitation and their interaction. Yield
   responses were non-monotonic, with yields maximized at intermediate
   precipitation and temperature as well as at intermediate aridity index
   of 0.79 for maize and 0.98 for soybean. The yield maximizing
   precipitation also increased with growing season average temperature,
   faster in maize than soybean. The intermediate yield maximizing
   conditions show that rainfed maize and soybean yields could both
   increase and decrease depending on whether climatic conditions come
   closer to or deviate from the yield maximizing conditions in the future.
   In most counties, during 1970-2010, the precipitation and aridity index
   were lower and temperature higher compared with those maximizing yields,
   suggesting that climate change will reduce yields.},

Title = {Snowtography quantifies effects of forest cover on net water input to
   soil at sites with ephemeral or stable seasonal snowpack in Arizona, USA},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Forested, snow-dominated watersheds provide a range of ecosystem
   services including water supply, carbon sequestration, habitat and
   recreation. While hydrologic partitioning has been well-studied in
   watersheds with stable seasonal snowpack, less is known about watersheds
   with ephemeral snowpack. Furthermore, drought-related disturbances
   and/or management practices are altering vegetation cover in many
   forests, with unknown and potentially different, consequences for stable
   seasonal versus ephemeral snowpacks. This study quantifies net water
   input (NWI) to soil for two sites with contrasting stable seasonal and
   ephemeral snowpacks, respectively, for three water years in Arizona,
   USA. Observations include a network of automated cameras and graduated
   snow stakes (snowtography) deployed across gradients of forest
   structure, airborne lidar maps of topography and forests and SNOTEL
   station records. Given the importance of mixed-phase precipitation in
   ephemeral snowpack watersheds, an algorithm is developed to distinguish
   among snowfall and rainfall that does/does not contribute to snowpack
   mass. Finally, existing canopy interception and snowpack models are used
   to estimate how NWI varies with canopy cover. At the ephemeral snowpack
   site, increasing canopy cover reduces NWI amount and advances its
   seasonal timing less strongly than at the stable seasonal snowpack site.
   Interestingly, canopy reduces NWI duration at the ephemeral site but
   prolongs it at the stable seasonal snowpack site. These effects are more
   important in a cool/wet and average year than a warm/dry year.
   Understanding differences between canopy impacts on amount, timing and
   duration of NWI for areas with ephemeral versus stable seasonal snowpack
   is increasingly important as the number of watersheds with ephemeral
   snowpack grows.},

Title = {Research progress on habitat connectivity in coastal waters: A review},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ecological connectivity, as a research method related to spatial ecology
   and conservation biology, has attracted increasing attention from
   researchers at home and abroad in recent years. Habitat connectivity, as
   a key link in ecological connectivity, is of great significance to
   promote coastal ecological restoration and protection. However, there
   has been less systematic research about habitat connectivity due to lack
   of corresponding theories and practices. Therefore, this paper discusses
   habitat connectivity from three aspects: (1) the concept of habitat
   connectivity is introduced and clarified; (2) the application of
   connectivity in artificial habitat and adjacent waters and its
   relationship with biodiversity conservation are reviewed and illustrated
   with examples; and (3) the future development trends of this research
   direction are summarized and prospected in order to provide a scientific
   basis and useful reference for the related work of coastal restoration
   projects in China. Generally, this paper argues that an increase in
   human behaviour irreversibly destroys the connectivity between marine
   habitats and threatens the spatial and temporal scales of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services. Therefore, the theoretical research results and
   practical experience of ecological connectivity should be fully applied
   to marine ecosystems, and the restoration of degraded ecosystems should
   be encouraged and supported in ways that promote natural recovery.},

Abstract = {The present study emphasizes a multi-scale analysis of an environmental
   dispersionin a fully developed shallow wetland flow under the wind
   effect, based on the momentum and mass transfer equations. From the
   classical momentum equation, the depth-dominated velocity profile is
   derived for the wetland flow. The environmental dispersion is examined
   using Mei's multi-scale analysis on moment equations of concentration in
   wetlands with wind-induced effect. Further, the maximum velocity,
   thickness of separation layer with recirculation and its position are
   obtained. The increase of depth-averaged velocity was observed for the
   larger contribution of conveyance capacity in wetland flows for the
   enhancement of wind direction. Also, the analytical result showed that
   the higher magnitude of environmental dispersion led to intensive
   dispersion process for the depth-dominated wetland flow. Moreover, for
   the hierarchical composition of contaminant constituents, the duration
   and length of influenced region are associated with a certain standard
   water quality level in wetland.},

Title = {From runoff contributor to runoff absorber: Spate irrigation on
   exclosures in Tigray's semi-arid environment (Ethiopia)},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite many years of establishment of exclosures in the semi-arid
   environments of north Ethiopia for rehabilitation of degraded areas, its
   effectiveness is constrained by water deficit. There is lack of
   empirical data on the response of vegetation to additional water (spate
   irrigation) application. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of
   spate irrigation using storm runoff on the growth of trees in
   exclosures. Two exclosures (May Ba'ati and Adi Kolakol), in Dogu'a
   Temben district, Tigray, north Ethiopia, were used for this study. Each
   exclosure was divided in two blocks (irrigated and non-irrigated) to
   allow comparison of change of vegetation using several diversity indices
   as well as contrasts in tree ring widths. The amount of spate irrigation
   water diverted onto the exclosures (762 mm) was in the same order of
   magnitude as the direct rainfall on the sites (645 mm). The results show
   that the irrigated exclosures have larger species richness,
   Shannon-Weaver diversity index, tree density, abundance, evenness and
   basal area than the non-irrigated areas. Following low rainfall (353 mm)
   in 2015, these indices decreased in the non-irrigated area, whereas most
   indices remained much higher in the irrigated area. The findings
   indicate that diverting runoff to exclosures results in an average 15\%
   increase in ring width as compared to non-irrigated trees. In addition,
   there is strong abstraction of storm runoff in gullies in the study
   area. Besides the promotion of forestry in washout semi-arid areas of
   existing spate irrigation systems, we suggest to apply spate irrigation
   to exclosures in order to improve their productivity.},

Title = {Assessing Rangeland Sensitivity to Degradation in North Tibet},
Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-97},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rangelands are the dominant ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau and the
   most critical livestock production resources. However, a large quantity
   of rangelands has degraded in North Tibet, with declined forage yield
   and invaded unpalatable weeds. Thus, identifying potential degradation
   is essential to manage rangelands sustainably in the future. In this
   study, we aimed to use an environmentally sensitive area index (ESAI)
   that integrated the conditions of vegetation, soil, climate, and
   management to assess rangeland degradation in North Tibet and identify
   the major drivers of degradation by the random forest model. The ESAI
   contained 16 indicators of the selected four categories, which were
   input by layers from geographic information system data. The results
   revealed that 33\% of the study area was susceptive to rangeland
   degradation, in which alpine desert-steppes in the west, with the
   highest mean ESAI scores of 1.38, were the most sensitive areas.
   According to the degrees of degradation, only 9\% of rangelands in the
   east had low mean values of ESAI (< 1.22), which were mostly located in
   the alpine meadow. The importance ranking for rangeland degradation
   based on the random forest model indicated that the highest importance
   was vegetation cover type, followed by grazing intensity and aridity
   with more than 60\% mean decrease accuracy. Besides, field measurements
   showed that the adjusted correlation coefficient of multiple regression
   of four vegetation degradation indicators was 0.86, illustrating that
   the assessment as a proxy for rangeland degradation sensitivity is
   feasible. This study provides an important approach to evaluating
   potential rangeland degradation. Therefore, the assessment model is
   recommended for regional-level decision makers to manage rangeland
   degradation with full consideration of local physical conditions. (C)

Abstract = {Clear correlations between human and bird visual assessments of color
   have been documented, and are often assumed, despite fundamental
   differences in human and avian visual physiology and morphology.
   Analyses of plumage colors with avian perceptual models have shown
   widespread hidden inter-sexual and inter-specific color variation among
   passerines perceived as monochromatic to humans, highlighting the
   uncertainty of human vision to predict potentially relevant variation in
   color. Herein, we use reflectance data from 13 Larus gull species as an
   exemplar data set to study concordance between human vision and avian
   visual modeling of feather colors near, or below, the human threshold
   for discrimination. We found little evidence among gulls for sexual
   dichromatism hidden from human vision, but did find inter-specific color
   variation among gulls that is not seen by humans. Neither of these
   results were predictable a priori, and we reassert that reflectance
   measurements of actual feather colors, analyzed with avian relevant
   visual models, represent best practice when studying bird coloration.},

Abstract = {The lichens Erioderma pedicellatum (Hue) P.M. Jorg. and Erioderma
   mollissimum (G. Sampaio) Du Rietz are endangered species in Canada. Both
   species are obligate epiphytes found in forested wetlands near the
   Atlantic Coast. They are thought to be primarily threatened by logging
   and acid pollution, but the influence of these factors has not been
   examined at large-extents or relative to other habitat features.
   Critical habitat for protection has remained difficult to define beyond
   observed occurrences, because of the low accuracy of existing habitat
   models. To facilitate improved recovery planning and understanding of
   their ecology in the province of Nova Scotia, we created high-resolution
   distribution models for both species, incorporating elements of climate,
   forest composition, hydrology, acid pollution, and anthropogenic
   influence using the MaxEnt algorithm and a backwards stepwise selection
   process. The most important predictors were related to rainfall or an
   oceanic moderation of thermal optima. Depth to water table and the

   distance from roads for E. pedicellatum. The putative threats, acid
   pollution and silvicultural treatment, were not important and therefore
   excluded from models. Although both species have highly specific habitat
   requirements, E. pedicellatum appears to be more sensitive to human

Abstract = {Plants are frequently exposed to adverse environments during their life
   span. Among them drought stress is one of the major threats to
   agricultural productivity. In order to survive in such unstable
   environment, plants have developed mechanisms through which they
   recognize the severity of the stress based on the incoming environmental
   stimuli. To combat the detrimental effects of drought, the plants have
   evolved various strategies to modulate their physio-hormonal attributes.
   These strategies that can be modulated by shade and microbes contribute
   to enhancing tolerance to drought and reducing yield loss. Plant
   hormones, such as abscisic acid, auxin and ethylene have a major role in
   the shade- and microbe-associated improvement of drought tolerance
   through their effects on various metabolic pathways. In this process,
   the CLAVATA3/EMBRYOSURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 25 peptide has a major
   role due to its effect on ABA synthesis as shown in our regulatory
   model.},

Abstract = {Wetlands store large amounts of carbon stocks and are essential in both
   global carbon cycling and regional ecosystem services. Understanding the
   dynamics of wetland carbon exchange is crucial for assessing carbon
   budgets and predicting their future evolution. Although many studies
   have been conducted on the effects of climate change on the ecosystem
   carbon cycle, little is known regarding carbon emissions from the alpine
   wetlands in arid northwest China. In this study, we used an automatic
   chamber system (LI-8100A) to measure ecosystem respiration (ER) in the
   Bayinbuluk alpine wetland in northwest China. The ER showed a
   significant bimodal diurnal variation, with peak values appearing at
   16:30 and 23:30 (Beijing time, UTC + 8). A clear seasonal pattern in ER
   was observed, with the highest value (19.38 mu mol m(-2) s(-1))
   occurring in August and the lowest value (0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1))
   occurring in late December. The annual ER in 2018 was 678 g C m(-2) and
   respiration during the non-growing season accounted for 13\% of the
   annual sum. Nonlinear regression revealed that soil temperature at 5 cm
   depth and soil water content (SWC) were the main factors controlling the
   seasonal variation in ER. The diurnal variation in ER was mainly
   controlled by air temperature and solar radiation. Higher temperature
   sensitivity (Q(10)) occurred under conditions of lower soil temperatures
   and medium SWC (25\% <= SWC <= 40\%). The present study deepens our
   understanding of CO2 emissions in alpine wetland ecosystems and helps
   evaluate the carbon budget in alpine wetlands in arid regions.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem apparent quantum yield (alpha), maximum rate of gross CO2
   assimilation (P-max) and daytime ecosystem respiration rate (R-d),
   reflecting the physiological functioning of ecosystem, are vital
   photosynthetic parameters for the estimation of ecosystem carbon budget.
   Climatic drivers may affect photosynthetic parameters both directly and
   indirectly by altering the response of vegetation. However, the relative
   contribution and regulation pathway of environmental and physiological
   controls remain unclear, especially in semi-arid grasslands. We analyzed
   seasonal and interannual variations of photosynthetic parameters derived
   from eddy-covariance observation in a typical semi-arid grassland in
   Inner Mongolia, Northern China, over 12 years from 2006 to 2017.
   Regression analyses and a structural equation model (SEM) were adopted
   to separate the contributions of environmental and physiological
   effects. The photosynthetic parameters showed unimodal seasonal patterns
   and significantly interannual variations. Variations of air temperature
   (T-a) and soil water content (SWC) drove the seasonal patterns of
   photosynthetic parameters, while SWC predominated their interannual
   variations. Moreover, contrasting with the predominant roles of T-a on
   alpha and R-d, SWC explained more variance of P-max than T-a. Results of
   SEM revealed that environmental factors impacted photosynthetic
   parameters both directly and indirectly through regulating physiological
   responses reflected by stomatal conductance at the canopy level.
   Moreover, leaf area index (LAI) directly affected alpha, P-max and R-d
   and dominated the variation of P-max. On the other hand, SWC influenced
   photosynthetic parameters indirectly through LAI and canopy surface
   conductance (gc). Our findings highlight the importance of physiological
   regulation on the photosynthetic parameters and carbon assimilation
   capacity, especially in water-limited grassland ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Grain crop rotations are common in temperate semiarid regions, but the
   effect of long-term tillage and fertilizer-nitrogen (N) rate interaction
   on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench ssp. Bicolor) grain yield in a
   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum-fallow rotation is not well
   understood. This study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 using long-term
   plots established in 1965. Experimental design was randomized complete
   block with split-plot arrangement of treatments. Main plots were
   conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT),
   and subplots treatments were 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg N ha-1. Tillage x N
   rate and year x tillage x N rate interactions had no effect on grain
   yield, but yield was greatest with NT in 2016 and unaffected by tillage
   in other years. The year x N rate had significant effect on grain yield
   because of no response to N fertilizer in 2015 and greater responses
   from 2018 to 2020. Across years and tillage treatments, mean grain yield
   increased quadratically by 52\%, 70\%, and 83\% as N rate increased from
   0 to 45, 90, and 135 kg ha-1, respectively. On average, grain yield, N
   agronomic efficiency (NAE), and grain N recovery efficiency (GNRE) were
   6\%, 20\%, and 15\% greater, respectively, under NT compared with CT and
   RT. Quadratic models explained yield response to N rate and growing
   season pre-cipitation for each tillage practice. Grain yield increases
   per growing season precipitation were 22.9, 14.9, and 11.9 kg ha-1 mm-1
   with NT, CT, and RT, respectively. Fertilizer-N application increased
   sorghum grain yield and protein concentration, but NAE and GNRE
   decreased beyond 45 kg ha-1 N. In conclusion, NT is the best management
   practice to increase grain sorghum yield, NAE, and NRE in nonirrigated
   winter wheat-sorghum-fallow rotations.},

Title = {Floodplain characteristics affect woody vegetation regeneration on point

Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Floodplain characteristics contribute to the natural regeneration of
   vegetation and help facilitate their ecosystem recovery but vary within
   and between river systems and more so in a river system recovering from
   anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we explored the floodplain
   characteristics that contribute to the woody vegetation regeneration on
   point bars of the middle reach of the Apalachicola River in Florida,
   USA, which has been passively recovering for over two decades after
   dredging and disposal activities ended. Woody vegetation regeneration on
   point bars was analysed using 1999 and 2019 aerial imagery and divided
   into zones and sections. Data were extracted from a digitized
   geodatabase regarding several floodplain characteristics with potential
   to influence vegetation regenetation. Later, we analysed noncollinear
   floodplain characteristics using a random forest (RF) regression model.
   The top characteristics that contributed to the RF model include
   vegetation density, distance-to-seeding source and bend curvature.
   Findings suggest that high vegetation density contributes substantially
   to woody vegetation regeneration. The negative relationship between
   distance-to-seeding source and vegetation regeneration shows the
   importance of seeding availability. The bend curvature corresponds with
   the highest regeneration in the lowermost section of point bars. Our
   results signify the importance of maintaining healthy vegetated
   corridors as a buffer to reinforce the vegetation community and
   potential seed source for passive recovery. These findings regarding
   floodplain characteristics can be applied to future active restoration
   of anthropogenically disturbed floodplains.},

Title = {Impact of hydrological processes on wetland landscapes and wintering
   migratory birds in a large floodplain lake (Poyang Lake, China)},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hydrological processes are an important factor influencing the wetland
   landscapes and the quality of wintering migratory birds habitat in
   Poyang Lake. However, most of the research on a small spatiotemporal
   scale and there is a lack of studies on the impact of hydrological
   processes on migratory bird habitats. This study analysed the response
   of the Poyang Lake wetland landscape to low water levels from 1990 to
   2016 and determined the relationship between hydrological processes,
   wetland landscape characteristics and migratory bird habitats. According
   to the results, the number of days during the study period when the
   maximum water level was higher than the current water level (MaxDay) and
   the average water level from the 40th to 50th day prior to the current
   day (D50) are two critical factors affecting the area of grassland in
   Poyang Lake. In particular, a D50 value of 9.5-11.0 m is important for
   maintaining the grassland area and growth of wetland vegetation.
   Besides, the water level should not exceed 11 m from mid-late October to
   early November and should be maintained between 7.58 and 7.97 m in
   mid-late December that can maximize the habitat area of migratory birds.
   Furthermore, this study used ecological threshold to propose the optimal
   inundation period of Cyperus rotundus L. community, Leersia japonica
   community, Polygonum criopolitanum community, Phragmites australis
   community, Triarrhena lutarioriparia community, Carex spp. community and
   Phalaris arundinacea community, which are 124-174, 31-101, 199-249,
   65-147, 51-121, 110-190 and 175-253 days, respectively.},

   Forests},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The persistence of future forests depends on the success of tree
   seedlings which are experiencing increasing physiological stress from
   changing climate and air pollution. Although the moss layer can serve as
   an important substrate for tree seedlings, its potential for reducing
   environmental stress and enhancing the establishment of seedlings
   remains poorly understood. We tested if the moss layer decreased
   environmental stress and increased the abundance of balsam fir seedlings
   dominant in high-elevation forests of northeastern United States that
   are sensitive to changing climate and mercury deposition. We surveyed
   balsam fir seedling density by substrate (moss, litter, other) on 120
   quadrats (1 x 1 m) in two contrasting canopy environments (in gaps and
   under canopies), measured seedling stress, and quantified mercury
   content in seedlings and substrates. We observed that, in both canopy
   environments, tree seedlings established on moss exhibited (i) increased
   density, (ii) decreased physiological stress, and (iii) higher potential
   to recruit into larger size classes, compared to seedlings established
   in litter. Regardless of canopy environment, seedling foliar mercury
   levels did not correspond to substrate mercury despite large differences
   in substrate mercury concentrations (relative to moss, litter
   concentrations were similar to 4-times greater and soil concentrations
   were similar to 6-times greater), likely reflecting the dominance of
   foliar over root uptake of mercury. Because the moss layer appeared to
   mitigate seedling drought stress, and to increase seedling establishment
   and recruitment compared to other substrates, these microsite effects
   should be considered in models predicting forest regeneration and
   dynamics under increased drought stress associated with the ongoing
   climate warming.},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are key in regulating coastal carbon and nitrogen
   dynamics and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and
   anthropogenic nutrient reduction. We investigated organic carbon (OC)
   and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and burial rates at four adjacent
   vegetated coastal habitats across the seascape elevation gradient of
   Cadiz Bay (South Spain), including one species of salt marsh, two of
   seagrasses, and a macroalgae. OC and TN stocks in the upper 1 m sediment
   layer were higher at the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (72.3 Mg OC
   ha(-1), 8.6 Mg TN ha(-1)) followed by the upper intertidal salt marsh
   Sporobolus maritimus (66.5 Mg OC ha(-1), 5.9 Mg TN ha(-1)), the subtidal
   rhizophytic macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera (62.2 Mg OC ha(-1), 7.2 Mg TN
   ha(-1)), and the lower intertidal seagrass Zostera noltei (52.8 Mg OC
   ha(-1), 5.2 Mg TN ha(-1)). The sedimentation rates increased from lower
   to higher elevation, from the intertidal salt marsh (0.24 g cm(-2)
   y(-1)) to the subtidal macroalgae (0.12 g cm(-2) y(-1)). The organic
   carbon burial rate was highest at the intertidal salt marsh (91 +/- 31 g
   OC m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the intertidal seagrass, (44 +/- 15 g OC
   m(-2) y(-1)), the subtidal seagrass (39 +/- 6 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), and the
   subtidal macroalgae (28 +/- 4 g OC m(-2) y(-1)). Total nitrogen burial
   rates were similar among the three lower vegetation types, ranging from
   5 +/- 2 to 3 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1), and peaked at S. maritimus salt
   marsh with 7 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1). The contribution of allochthonous
   sources to the sedimentary organic matter also decreased with elevation,
   from 72\% in C. prolifera to 33\% at S. maritimus. Our results highlight
   the need of using habitat-specific OC and TN stocks and burial rates to
   improve our ability to predict OC and TN sequestration capacity of
   vegetated coastal habitats at the seascape level. We also demonstrated
   that the stocks and burial rates in C. prolifera habitats were within
   the range of well-accepted blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrass
   meadows and salt marshes.},

Abstract = {Trail degradation is a common management problem in protected areas
   around the world. To prevent intensively used trails from degradation,
   they can be surfaced with durable materials. However, the surfaced tread
   may not necessarily provide full protection to the whole trail because
   the tread is just a part of the surfaced trail. A very limited number of
   studies have evaluated the performance of surfaced trails by empirically
   examining their conditions. Therefore, this paper collected data from
   189 sample points along four high-use hiking trails in Hong Kong and
   examined the effects of surfacing, trail gradient, and their
   interactions on four trail condition indicators. The results indicated
   that, overall, both surfac-ing and trail gradient significantly affected
   trail conditions. Specifically, surfacing significantly reduced soil
   loss and soil compaction. Furthermore, the effects of trail gradient on
   width, maximum incision, and cross sectional area were significant among
   unsurfaced trails, but not in surfaced trails. These findings can
   supplement the existing literature by providing an under-standing of
   relations between surfacing, trail gradient, and trail condition.},

Title = {Assessing the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework toolbox in a
   Southern Piedmont landscape of the United States},

Abstract = {The Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) is a geospatial
   decision support tool that was developed and is used in many areas of
   the Midwest of the United States to help with the prioritization and
   placement of conservation practices within agricultural watersheds.We
   evaluated the utility and extensibility of ACPF in two US Geological
   Survey 12-digit scale hydrologic units in the Southern Piedmont of North
   Carolina. The Southern Piedmont consists of less row crop agriculture
   and more pasture systems than the Midwest and has generally lower
   pollutant loads. Also, agricultural fields are comparatively smaller,
   irregularly shaped, and more sparsely distributed. For this study, local
   conservation experts were interviewed about conservation practices and
   their appropriate locations in the landscape. Interviewees demonstrated
   an extensive working knowledge of the land and producers on over 90\% of
   the farmland. Many of the conservation practices identified by the local
   experts were ``soil health{''} practices, such as cover crops or
   nutrient management, and are assumed in use before running ACPF. Results
   revealed that many of the conservation practices output by ACPF were not
   identified by the local experts in the Southern Piedmont watersheds due
   to their limited use in pasture conservation, conservation priorities,
   and landscape characteristics. Row crop agriculture was sparsely
   distributed in each study watershed and comprised less than 2\% of the
   total catchment area. Contour buffer strips and grassed waterways were
   the conservation practices most identified by ACPF and were sited in
   75\% of cropped fields. A greater number of crop-related conservation
   practices (48 versus 15) were identified by ACPF than by local experts;
   however 80\% of the conservation practices identified by the experts
   were outside the scope ofACPF and were mainly nutrient management or
   soil health practices.To evaluate ACPF for broader utility in the
   Southern Piedmont, alternative interpretations for existing outputs were
   considered: (1) ACPF ``proxies{''} were identified to compare locally
   accepted practices with ACPF outputs that perform a similar function
   (e.g., strip cropping rather than contour buffer strips) and, (2)
   placing locally used conservation practices (e.g., exclusion fencing)
   based on existing ACPF data layers (hydrologically enforced flow paths).
   Alternative uses and interpretations surrounding ACPF outputs and data
   layers may provide opportunities for conservation planning outside the
   scope and intended use of ACPF in the Southern Piedmont.},

Title = {Effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradients on total carbon,
   nitrogen, and phosphorus lateral transport under simulated extraordinary
   rainstorm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this research was to study the characteristics and influence
   of the lateral transport of total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and
   total phosphorus (TP) under different slope gradients (5 degrees, 8
   degrees, 15 degrees, 25 degrees) caused by extraordinary rainstorms (90
   mm h-1, 120 mm h-1, 150 mm h-1) on a decomposed granite soil in the
   Zhejiang-Fujian hilly region. Rainfall induced runoff (RIR) contains
   overland flow (OF) and interflow (IF). Results show that with the
   increase of runoff time and runoff volume, TN and TP mass concentrations
   decrease rapidly; however, TC mass concentration increases with the
   increase of runoff volume in IF. TC mass concentrations greater than 55
   mg L-1 are distributed in areas with IF volume more than 5,100 mL.
   Meanwhile, a marginal effect of TC, TN, and TP increments appeared when
   examining TC, TN, and TP cumulative loss amounts in RIR; the inflection
   points appeared at the end of rainfall event. A simple stoichiometry was
   applied. Simulated rainfall reduced the C: N ratio with a range from
   6.68 to 5.98 while increasing the C:P and N:P ratios when rain-f all
   intensity was 120 or 150 mm h-1. Sediment is the main carrier for C
   lateral transport. We also noted that the gross amount of TC loss in RIR
   accounted for more than 10\%. The loss of TC with runoff cannot be
   ignored. Our research enriches slope land hydrology research under
   extraordinary rainstorm conditions and provides a basis for the
   effective control of TC, TN, and TP loss in the decomposed granite soil
   area of China and globally.},

Abstract = {One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in
   degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas
   without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to
   attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance
   seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of
   artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and
   composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien
   invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the
   bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used
   artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment
   (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at
   each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these
   and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside
   the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of
   focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total
   of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a
   significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial
   perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition
   increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An
   ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed
   communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive
   exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the
   third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from
   12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most
   represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures
   for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed
   species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly
   due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore,
   artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow
   area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of
   alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about
   overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the
   arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of
   birds in this process.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the hydrological processes in cocoa agroforests is
   extremely limited. Most work has focused on characterising throughfall
   and transpiration processes under various management approaches and
   climate change scenarios. However, little is currently understood about
   how soil water movement is driven by infiltration and hydraulic
   conductivity. We monitored the soil properties, soil water repellency
   and hydraulic conductivity in a 5-, 12- and >30-year-old cocoa
   plantation in the wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, repellent
   conditions were absent in all stands, while the hydraulic conductivity
   showed no significant differences among them. This suggests that stand
   age has little effect on water movement during the wet period. During
   the dry season, the soil at the 5- and 12-year-old stands became
   extremely repellent and was twice as severe as that of the >30-year-old
   plantation. It was expected that the extreme repellency in the younger
   stands would reduce infiltration rates; however, higher rates were
   recorded in the 5- and 12-year-old stands. This was likely due to the
   presence of large, deep soil cracks, which enhanced preferential flow.
   As the repellency was not significantly correlated with soil properties,
   we hypothesised that the high grass/sedge cover and temperatures in the
   5- and 12-year-old stands enhanced it. While further research is needed
   to investigate the role that grass and sedges play in developing
   repellent conditions, managing their cover may prove beneficial for the
   growth and survival of young cocoa trees.},

Abstract = {Batesian mimicry imposes several challenges to mimics and evokes
   adaptations in multiple sensory modalities. Myrmecomorphy, morphological
   and behavioral resemblance to ants, is seen in over 2000 arthropod
   species. Ant-like resemblance is observed in at least 13 spider families
   despite spiders having a distinct body plan compared to ants.
   Quantifying the extent to which spiders' shape, size, and behavior
   resemble model ants will allow us to comprehend the evolutionary
   pressures that have facilitated myrmecomorphy. Myrmaplata plataleoides
   are thought to closely resemble weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina. In
   this study, we quantify the speed of movement of model, mimic, and
   non-mimetic jumping spiders. We use traditional and geometric
   morphometrics to quantify traits such as foreleg size and hindleg size,
   body shape between the model ant, mimic, and non-mimics. Our results
   suggest that while the mimics closely resemble the model ants in speed
   of movement, they occupy an intermediate morphological space compared to
   the model ants and non-mimics. Ant-mimicking spiders are better at
   mimicking ants' locomotory movement than morphology and overall body
   shape. Some traits may compensate others, suggesting differential
   selection on these mimetic traits. Our study provides a framework to
   understand the multimodal nature of mimicry and helps discern the
   relative contributions of such traits that drive mimetic accuracy in
   ant-mimicking spiders.
   Mimicry provides a textbook example of adaptation by natural selection.
   Ant-like resemblance is observed in 13 spider families despite spiders
   having a distinct body plan compared to ants. Jumping spiders,
   Myrmaplata plataleoides, closely resemble weaver ants, Oecophylla
   smaragdina. We quantified movement, leg size and body shape of model
   ants, mimics, and non-mimics. Our results suggest that ant-mimicking
   spiders are better at mimicking ants' movement, than their morphology
   and overall body shape.},

Title = {The BIODESERT survey: assessing the impacts of grazing on the structure

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is both the main land use across drylands
   worldwide and a major desertification and global change driver. The
   ecological consequences of this key human activity have been studied for
   decades, and there is a wealth of information on its impacts on
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, most field assessments of
   the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have
   been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single
   ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa
   (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT
   survey, the first systematic field survey devoted to evaluating the
   joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the
   structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This
   collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and
   has involved the collection of field data and plant, biocrust, and soil
   samples from a total of 326 45 m x 45 m plots from 98 sites located in
   25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major
   characteristics and the field protocols used in this survey. We also
   introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful
   to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of
   researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the
   current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of
   grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of
   the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our
   planet using much-needed field data.},

Title = {Higher ultraviolet skin reflectance signals submissiveness in the
   anemonefish, Amphiprion akindynos},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {When signaling submission, it is important to wave the ``white flag.{''}
   In the Barrier Reef anemonefish, ultraviolet color patterns serve to
   signal submissiveness. In staged contests over dominance between
   size-matched anemonefish, low ultraviolet skin reflectance strongly
   predicted fish winning a contest, while high UV skin reflectance
   predicted losing. We demonstrate that juvenile subordinates benefit by
   signaling their submissiveness with a naturally higher ultraviolet skin
   reflectance which evokes less aggression from larger, more-dominant fish
   and likely aids with social group integration.
   Ultraviolet (UV) vision is widespread among teleost fishes, of which
   many exhibit UV skin colors for communication. However, aside from its
   role in mate selection, few studies have examined the information UV
   signaling conveys in other socio-behavioral contexts. Anemonefishes
   (subfamily, Amphiprioninae) live in a fascinating dominance hierarchy,
   in which a large female and male dominate over non-breeding
   subordinates, and body size is the primary cue for dominance. The iconic
   orange and white bars of anemonefishes are highly UV-reflective, and
   their color vision is well tuned to perceive the chromatic contrast of
   skin, which we show here decreases in the amount of UV reflectance with
   increasing social rank. To test the function of their UV-skin signals,
   we compared the outcomes of staged contests over dominance between
   size-matched Barrier Reef anemonefish (Amphiprion akindynos) in aquarium
   chambers viewed under different UV-absorbing filters. Fish under
   UV-blocking filters were more likely to win contests, where fish under
   no-filter or neutral-density filter were more likely to submit. For
   contests between fish in no-filter and neutral density filter
   treatments, light treatment had no effect on contest outcome (win/lose).
   We also show that sub-adults were more aggressive toward smaller
   juveniles placed under a UV filter than a neutral density filter. Taken
   together, our results show that UV reflectance or UV contrast in
   anemonefish can modulate aggression and encode dominant and submissive
   cues, when changes in overall intensity are controlled for.},

Abstract = {All organisms need elements in fixed proportions for carrying out normal
   metabolic processes and how flexible they are depends on how effective
   they are utilizing these resources from external sources. It is
   important to understand the interactions among plant, soil and microbial
   biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry under
   different conditions of resource supply. We conducted a pot experiment
   on 1-year-old Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings for nearly 5 months under
   different water, nitrogen and phosphorus supplies, and we determined
   plant, soil and microbial biomass C, N and P stoichiometry. We found
   that plant, soil and microbial nutrients and stoichiometry exhibited a
   certain degree of plasticity in response to the changes in water and
   nutrient conditions in their environments. Variation partitioning
   analysis showed that root stoichiometry accounted for a large part of
   the variance in microbial stoichiometry. Structural equation modeling
   further revealed that root stoichiometry and leaf stoichiometry were two
   direct factors affecting microbial biomass C:N and C:P, and that root
   stoichiometry had the greatest direct effect. In addition, the degree of
   homeostasis for microbial biomass C and C:P was more sensitive to
   changes in soil nutrients than changes in other factors, and other
   elements and elemental ratios displayed strict homeostasis. These
   results highlight the importance of studying microbial stoichiometry in
   improving our understanding of nutrient cycling of the plant-soil system
   under different water and nutrient supply.},

Abstract = {The widespread occurrence of soil erosion reflects the accelerated
   deterioration of the surface ecological environment. The spatiotemporal
   variation of rainfall erosivity is the key driving factor for soil
   erosion by water, especially in the Loess Plateau in China. The Fenhe
   River basin in the Loess Plateau was selected as a case study based on
   the daily rainfall data from 1962 to 2019. Using a rainfall erosivity
   model based the daily rainfall, we studied the changing pattern.
   Furthermore, the impact of rainfall erosivity on sediment load was
   evaluated, and the possible causes for changes in sediment load were
   discussed. The results showed that the annual rainfall erosivity of the
   12 weather stations experienced an insignifi-cant change (p > 0.05).
   Moreover, before the 1980s, the decrease in annual watershed average
   rainfall erosivity may be the main reason for the decrease in annual
   sediment load, while after the 1980s, the construction of check dams may
   be the main factor leading to annual sediment load reduction, especially
   around 1993. However, the increase of vegetation was a main reason for
   the reduction of annual sediment load after 1999. Given Fenhe River
   basin as a typical watershed of the Loess Plateau, the study of rainfall
   erosivity and its impacts on the sediment in this area can provide a
   useful reference for further ecological construction and soil erosion
   control in the Loess Plateau.},

   implement monitoring programs and management plans that will minimize
   future NO3- loadings to groundwater based on modeled NO3- leaching;
   however, a need remains for empirical NO3- leaching data and assessment
   of model suitability to specific systems. Moreover, debate remains
   around the ability of different management practices like cover
   cropping, replacement of chemicals with organic inputs, and cultivating
   perennials to reduce NO3- leaching in California's annual vegetable
   systems. We measured winter NO3- leaching over the wintery rainy season
   (October to March) within systems of the Century Experiment, a long-term
   cropping systems experiment in northern California evaluating effects of
   cover cropping, certified organic management, and alfalfa (Medicago
   saliva L.) incorporation in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)-maize
   (Zea mays L.) rotations. Anion exchange resin bags were installed at the
   bottom of the crop rooting zone (similar to 65 cm) following tomato and
   prior to the onset of fall rains to adsorb leaching NO3- over the
   winter. Empirical resin bag NO3- leaching values were compared to
   modeled leaching results using HYDRUS-1D, which estimates water movement
   and reactive solute transport in soils. The rotation with alfalfa was
   the only system that reduced winter NO; leaching (21.8 kg ha(-1)),
   compared to conventional management (bare winter fallow after tomato)
   (47.1 kg ha(-1)). Compared to conventional, certified organic management
   (44.7 kg ha(-1)) and inclusion of a winter cover crop (58.2 kg ha(-1))
   had no significant impact on NO3- leaching. HYDRUS-1D model estimates
   for NO3- leaching were in good agreement with empirical field
   measurements in conventional and cover cropped systems, but less for
   certified organic and greater for the alfalfa systems. Results from this
   study show that perennial crops have potential to mitigate NO3- leaching
   losses across an agricultural landscape, and models like HYDROS can
   provide useful estimates of NO3- leaching in some agricultural systems.},

Abstract = {The carbon and water cycle, an important biophysical process of
   terrestrial ecosystems, is changed by anthropogenic revegetation in arid
   and semiarid areas. However, there is still a lack of understanding of
   the mechanisms of carbon and water coupling in intrinsic ecosystems in
   the context of human activities. Based on the CO2 and H2O flux
   measurements of the desert steppe with the planted shrub Caragana
   liouana, this study explored the carbon and water flux coupling of the
   ecosystem by analyzing the variations in gross primary productivity
   (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) and
   discussing the driving mechanisms of biological factors. The seasonal
   variation in climate factors induced a periodic variation pattern of
   biophysical traits and carbon and water fluxes. The GPP and ET
   fluctuated in seasons, but the WUE was relatively stable in the growing
   season. The GPP, ET and WUE were significantly driven by global
   radiation (R-g), temperature (T-a and T-s), water vapor pressure
   deficit, leaf area index and plant water stress index (PWSI). However,
   R-g, temperature and PWSI were the most important factors regulating
   WUE. R-g and temperature directly affected WUE with a positive effect
   but indirectly inhibited WUE by rising PWSI. Plant water stress
   inhibited photosynthesis and transpiration of the planted shrub
   community in the desert steppe. When the plant water stress exceeded a
   threshold (PWSI >0.54), the WUE would decrease since the GPP responded
   more quickly to the plant water stress than ET. Our findings suggest
   that policies related to large-scale carbon sequestration initiatives
   under afforestation must first fully consider the status of water
   consumption and WUE.},

Abstract = {Several recent studies have hypothesized that
   postgermination/preemergence soil freezing can have a major negative
   impact on spring emergence of seeded perennial grasses in the
   Intermountain western United States. In this experiment, we measured
   germination and emergence of 4 fall-seeded perennial grasses at 15 sites
   in southeastern Oregon, north-central Nevada, and southwestern Idaho in
   2 different yr. We used hydrothermal germination and seedbed
   microclimatic models to estimate planting date effects on germination
   and preemergence mortality and evaluated these simulations relative to
   measured germination and seedling emergence in the field. There were
   clear indications that both germination and emergence were responsive to
   site-year effects, but premature fall germination before winter freezing
   events was not a factor in emergence rates. In all cases, planting was
   sufficiently late in the fall to avoid significant
   postgermination/preemergence freezing injury for the sites and years
   tested. Emergence was weakly correlated to seedbed favorability in the
   late winter and spring after the principal period of soil freezing. Our
   data show that for the 2 yr of this study, we can only account for a
   relatively small portion of any abiotic effects on spring emergence.
   General inferences about planting date effects, however, may have been
   limited by arid conditions during the 2-yr field study relative to
   long-term climate normals. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The

Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Infiltration rate (IR) has been commonly used as a metric to evaluate
   soil quality and health. For the USDA Soil Quality Test Kit, a 15 cm (6
   in) diameter cylinder is used to measure IR with 444 cm3 (equivalent to
   2.54 cm {[}1 in]) of water while other standard IR procedures require
   substantially larger volumes of water. The general objective of this
   study was to compare different methods for IR measurement. Using three
   replications, IR mea-surements were conducted along a 9 m (27 ft) long
   transect in two different soil types by the double-ring infiltrometer
   (DRI) using 25 and 50 cm (10 and 20 in, respectively) cylinders,
   single-ring infiltrometer (SRI) using 25 and 50 cm cylinders, Cornell
   sprinkle infiltrometer (CSI) using a 24.1 cm (9.5 in) cylinder, the USDA
   recommended procedure using a 15 cm diameter cylinder (hereafter
   referred to as USDA-15 method), and a modified USDA method using a 24.1
   cm diameter cylinder. Although the USDA-15 method is simple and requires
   a small amount of water, the procedure does not offer an accurate
   estimate of the soil infiltration potential due to high variability
   among replications and significant reduction in IR during early stages
   of water entry into the soil. The CSI procedure was reproducible, but it
   is more cumbersome to perform than other methods. The DRI, SRI, and CSI
   methods required a much greater volume of water than the USDA-15 method
   but produced results that are more consistent. The most consistent
   results were obtained by the CSI and DRI methods. The modified USDA
   method results were similar to the SRI method and were an improvement
   over the original USDA-15 method. For assessing soil health, additional
   investigations should be conducted to evaluate a modified version of the
   USDA procedure using a larger cylinder.},

Title = {Species richness and assemblages of bats along a forest elevational
   transect in Papua New Guinea},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-94},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, elevational gradients have become a powerful tool
   with which to understand the underlying cause(s) of biodiversity. The
   Mt. Wilhelm elevational transect is one such example, having been used
   to study the birds, insects, and plants of Papua New Guinea (PNG).
   However, a survey of mammals from this forest elevational transect was
   lacking. We thus aimed to investigate patterns in the community
   structure and species richness of bats (Chiroptera) along the transect,
   link the species to available regional data, and explain the observed
   patterns by including environmental characteristics. Bat assemblages
   were surveyed between 200 m and a timberline at 3700 m a.s.l. at eight
   study sites separated by 500 m in elevation. We conducted mist-netting
   and acoustic surveys to detect and identify species at each site.
   Regional data were compiled to compare local with regional diversity.
   Finally, biotic (i.e., food availability, habitat features) and abiotic
   (i.e., mean daily temperature) factors were included in our analyses to
   disentangle the ecological drivers underlying bat diversity. Results
   revealed that species richness decreases with ascending elevation and
   was best explained by a corresponding decrease in temperature. We
   observed both turnover and nestedness of the species composition at
   regional scale whereas turnover was dominant at local scale. Extensions
   and shifts of bat elevational ranges were also found in Mt. Wilhelm.
   Consequently, despite that the study was restricted to one mountain in
   PNG, it demonstrates how basic inventory surveys can be used to address
   ecological questions in other similar and undisturbed tropical
   mountains.},

Title = {Indaziflam Reduces Seed Bank Richness and Density but not
   Sagebrush-Grassland Plant Diversity},

Abstract = {Mitigating invasive annual grass impacts is critical to halting native
   rangeland conversion to fire-prone, annual grass-dominated communities
   and maintaining the ecosystem services provided by perennial plants. The
   herbicide indaziflam (Rejuvra, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) may allow
   managers to selectively deplete annual grass seed banks in plant
   communities that continue to support desirable perennial vegetation, but
   nontarget impacts are difficult to assess in the small plots typically
   used in herbicide trials, and the potential for impacts to the seed bank
   is not well understood. To assess the potential for nontarget impacts
   resulting from indaziflam treatment, we used modified-Whittaker
   multiscale vegetation plots to compare diversity (species accumulation)
   in three treatment plots (73 g ai ha(-1) indaziflam) and three control
   plots in sagebrush-grasslands near Pinedale, Wyoming that are invaded by
   cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). We also assessed the density and
   richness of shallow (0- to 1-cm depth) and deep (1- to 5-cm depth)
   germinable seed banks in treatment and control plots by tracking
   seedling emergence from seed bank samples during a 20-wk greenhouse
   study. Vegetation data and seed bank samples were collected during the
   third growing season after treatment. Treatment did not impact
   aboveground species diversity, but this contrasted with the results of
   the seed bank assay; shallow and deep native seed bank density and
   shallow native seed bank richness were significantly reduced in
   treatment plots. All impacted species were detected in the aboveground
   plant community in treatment plots after herbicide application,
   suggesting that reduced native annual abundance may be temporary.
   Considering the potential for nontarget impacts to seed banks will help
   land managers accurately assess trade-offs when making treatment
   decisions. (C) 2022 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Title = {Response of Soil Moisture to Infrequent Heavy Defoliation of Chemically

Volume = {84},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In semiarid regions of the western United States, there is heightened
   interest in tree removal to increase water availability for other uses
   such as forage growth and groundwater recharge. This study was conducted
   in central New Mexico to determine the effects of heavy infrequent
   defoliation of chemically thinned juniper woodland (Juniperus
   monosperma) on soil moisture. Each of three cattle-grazing exclosures
   (CD, FG, and KI) was instrumented: 1) beneath trees with a set of three
   soil moisture probes (0-25, 25-50, and 50-75 cm depth) and one soil
   temperature probe under live trees (control) and dead trees
   (herbicide-treated); and 2) between trees with one soil moisture and one
   soil temperature probe in control and herbicide-treated intercanopy
   plots. Each plot had three clipped and three unclipped subplots. Mean
   daily maximum surface soil temperature was highest (17.19 degrees C) in
   intercanopy, intermediate (16.13 degrees C) under herbicide-treated, and
   lowest (14.90 degrees C) under control trees. Topsoil moisture (0-25 cm
   depth) was different among treatment combinations from late July to
   early September 2006. Thus, the control unclipped combination had the
   highest topsoil moisture while the herbicide-treated unclipped
   combination had the lowest topsoil moisture. Comparing other depths,
   control unclipped plots had higher soil moisture in the middle layer
   (25-50 cm) and bottom layer (50-75 cm) than at the top from late August
   to early November 2006. Results imply that clipping on chemically
   thinned juniper woodlands does not increase soil moisture at any depth,
   yet macropore flow and water absorption on deep soil layers, underneath
   live trees, might help to store soil moisture for longer periods in
   water-limited environments. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Patch-Burn Grazing Impacts Forage Resources in Subtropical Humid Grazing
   Lands},

Abstract = {Subtropical humid grazing lands represent a large global land use and
   are important for livestock production, as well as supplying multiple
   ecosystem services. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) management is applied in
   temperate grazing lands to enhance environmental and economic
   sustainability; however, this management system has not been widely
   tested in subtropical humid grazing lands. The objective of this study
   was to determine how PBG affected forage resources, in comparison with
   the business-as-usual full-burn (FB) management in both intensively
   managed pastures (IMP) and seminative (SN) pastures in subtropical humid
   grazinglands. We hypothesized that PBG management would create patch
   contrasts in forage quantity and nutritive value in both IMP and SN
   pastures, with a greater effect in SN pastures. A randomized block
   design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each),
   8 each in IMP and SN at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch
   in Florida.
   PBG management employed on IMP and SN resulted in creation of patch
   contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass metrics, and recent fire
   increased forage nutritive value. Residual standing biomass was
   significantly lower in burned patches of each year, creating
   heterogeneity within both pasture types under PBG. PBG increased
   digestible forage production in SN but not IMP pastures. These results
   suggest that PBG may be a useful management tool for enhancing forage
   nutritive value and creating patch contrast in both SN and IMP, but PBG
   does not necessarily increase production relative to FB management. The
   annual increase in tissue quality and digestible forage production in a
   PBG system as opposed to once every 3 yr in an FB system is an important
   consideration for ranchers. Economic impacts of PBG and FB management in
   the two different pasture types are discussed, and we compare and
   contrast results from subtropical humid grazing lands with continental
   temperate grazing lands. (C) 2022 The Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {The distribution of marine zooplankton depends on both ocean currents
   and swimming behavior. Many zooplankton perform diel vertical migration
   (DVM) between the surface and subsurface, which can have different
   current regimes. If concentration mechanisms, such as fronts or eddies,
   are present in the subsurface, they may impact zooplankton near-surface
   distributions when they migrate to near-surface waters. A subsurface,
   retentive eddy within Palmer Deep Canyon (PDC), a submarine canyon along
   the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), retains diurnal vertically migrating
   zooplankton in previous model simulations. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that the presence of the PDC and its associated subsurface
   eddy increases the availability and delivery of simulated Antarctic
   krill to nearby penguin foraging regions with model simulations over a
   single austral summer. We found that the availability and delivery rates
   of simulated krill to penguin foraging areas adjacent to PDC were
   greater when the PDC was present compared to when PDC was absent, and
   when DVM was deepest. These results suggest that the eddy has potential
   to enhance krill availability to upper trophic level predators and
   suggests that retention may play a significant role in resource
   availability for predators in other similar systems along the WAP and in
   other systems with sustained subsurface eddies.},

Title = {Identifying the drivers of structural complexity on Hawaiian coral reefs},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {702},
Pages = {71-86},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Habitat structural complexity is created by biotic and abiotic processes
   that operate over a range of scales. This can be seen clearly on coral
   reefs, where corals and reef geomorphology create structure from mm to
   km scales. Here, we quantified the relative contribution of biotic and
   abiotic structures to habitat complexity using `Structure from Motion',
   a technology that allows accurate 3D models of environments to be
   reconstructed from overlapping photographs. We calculated the linear
   fractal dimension of these models using a virtual analogue of a profile
   gauge. By adjusting the spacing between profile gauge rods, we
   partitioned structural complexity into a series of scale intervals. We
   identified scales that were most indicative of coral cover (0.5-16 cm)
   and reef geomorphology (16-256 cm). We found that reefs in the Main
   Hawaiian Islands have more complexity at finer scales than reefs in the
   Northwest Hawaiian Islands, which we attribute to the latitudinal
   gradient in coral cover along the archipelago. At coarser scales,
   islands at each end of the archipelago have sites with high structural
   complexity, with less complexity in the center of the archipelago. These
   differences are consistent with geologic factors shaping island uplift,
   subsidence, and reef formation. In addition, we found that different
   coral genera and morphologies display unique patterns of fractal
   dimension, with branching Porites corals creating the greatest amount of
   habitat structure at nearly all scales. This study demonstrates how
   multi-scale approaches can be used to identify the processes responsible
   for reef structural complexity and changes in structure over time.},

Abstract = {Phosphatases play a crucial role in recycling organic phosphorus and
   determining primary production and phytoplankton communities in
   seawater, especially in phosphate-depleted coastal waters. The present
   study analyzed spatiotemporal variation in phosphomonoesterase (PMEase)
   activity (PMEA) and phosphodiesterase (PDEase) activity (PDEA) during 2
   dinoflagellate blooms occurring in 2 coastal areas of Fujian Province,
   East China Sea, which differed in external phosphate conditions.
   Together with environmental variables and with a specific focus on the
   availability of different phosphorus forms in the seawater, the
   regulation of both phosphatases was studied. The results showed that
   dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was the major phosphorus source
   during blooms, especially in phosphate-depleted environments. Labile DOP
   accounted for more than 50\% of DOP, of which phosphomonoester (PME) and
   phosphodiester (PDE) accounted for 75-94\% and 6-25\%, respectively.
   PMEA and PDEA were highly correlated, both increasing during blooms with
   a fixed PMEA:PDEA ratio of 2.5 under external phosphate conditions at
   both sites. Both PMEA and PDEA were negatively correlated with dissolved
   inorganic phosphorus (DIP) when phosphate was depleted, but positively
   correlated with DOP regardless of external phosphate conditions. During
   dinoflagellate blooms, temperature and phytoplankton biomass were the
   dominant variables determining both phosphatase activities under
   phosphate-depleted conditions, whereas the availability of DOP was the
   dominant variable determining both phosphatase activities under
   phosphate-replete conditions. This study suggests the importance of
   phosphatases in recycling DOP, and indicates similar regulation of PMEA
   and PDEA during dinoflagellate blooms.},

Title = {Behavioral models of hydrothermal regulation in anurans: A field study

Abstract = {Anurans rely on different microhabitats and microclimates for
   hydro-thermoregulation, which is an important physiological property for
   locomotor performance, body temperature, water flux, and pathogen
   defense. We ask whether microhabitat scouting is related to
   physiological states, specifically if microhabitat choice benefits the
   production of behavioral fever (e.g., increasing body temperature by
   selecting warmer places) or sickness behavior (e.g., inactivity and
   anorexia). We investigated how thermoregulatory behaviors affect
   hydro-thermoregulation in anurans, using agar models as a sampling unit,
   simulating four behaviors related to behavioral fever and sickness
   behavior. We compared the models' hydro-thermal balance in two different
   environments (wet and transitional forests). We showed that the wet
   forest was warmer and more stable than transitional forest and the agar
   models in the wet forest were warmer. Still, the four behavioral
   simulations exhibited similar average temperatures during the five-day
   study period in both forests. However, the apathetic behavior models had
   the lowest daily temperatures. The percentage hydration across models
   was higher in the wet forest, and daily variation in water loss for each
   behavioral simulation was higher in the transitional forest.
   Nevertheless, when limiting the analysis to the warmest times (1000-1600
   h), apathetic behavior models lost less water than the others in both
   forests. We showed that different forests provide microclimatic
   variation for understory anurans, but different thermoregulatory
   behaviors may lead to similar body temperatures. Therefore, the Atlantic
   Forest offers different microclimates and thermoregulation options for
   anurans, as some species could develop behavioral fever while others
   demonstrate sickness behavior.Abstract in Portuguese is available with

Title = {Audit procedures and implementation rates for forest water quality Best
   Management Practices in the 13 southeastern states},

Abstract = {Forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) were established to protect
   water quality by minimizing nonpoint source pollutants associated with
   forest operations. Research has shown that appropriate application of
   BMPs provides effective mitigation of erosion and sedimentation. State
   forestry agencies are primarily responsible for recommending which BMPs
   to implement and monitoring their use. Few studies have compared BMP
   programs, audits, and prescriptions among states and physiographic
   regions.To address these questions, audit questionnaires were obtained
   from the 13 member states of the Southern Group of State Foresters to
   evaluate six forest operational categories: stream crossings, decks,
   skid trails, haul roads, harvest areas, and overall implementation.
   These audits were used to assess BMP implementation at 116 harvest sites
   across 12 states (excluding Kentucky) and three physiographic regions
   (Mountains, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain) in the southeastern United
   States. Overall implementation was highest in the Coastal Plain,
   followed by the Piedmont, and lastly the Mountains. We found that skid
   trail implementation in the Mountains (76.1\%) was significantly lower
   than in both the Piedmont (86.0\%) (p-value = 0.0028) and Coastal Plain
   (85.2\%) (p-value = 0.0065) regions. Mountain stream crossing
   implementation (83.9\%) was also significantly lower (p-value = 0.0459)
   than in the Coastal Plain (92.3\%). Findings suggest that additional BMP
   focus in the Mountain region is needed for constructing and closing out
   skid trails and stream crossings to enhance water quality protection
   efforts.The mean overall BMP implementation rate was approximately
   90.1\% for the southeastern region.The regional BMP implementation rates
   were also calculated for each feature as follows: decks (92.7\%),
   harvest areas (95.6\%), haul roads (91.9\%), skid trails (82.9\%), and
   stream crossings (88.2\%). Mean BMP implementation rates using each of
   the 13 state audits were compared. Florida (93.5\%) and Kentucky
   (92.9\%) audits produced the highest overall scores, while Virginia
   (88.3\%), Alabama (88.3\%), and Tennessee (87.8\%) audits provided more
   stringent evaluations. Implementation rates for the 13 state audits were
   highly variable for both the stream crossings and skid trails,
   indicating substantial differences in assessments of these categories.
   Results from this study (1) provide insight into the current state of
   BMPs, (2) identify areas where BMPs have the most potential to improve,
   and (3) demonstrate that BMPs are being implemented at relatively high
   rates in the southeast. A combined audit among individual states with
   similar physiographic provinces, operating systems and conditions, and
   topography could be created so that stronger inferences can be made
   concerning BMP implementation among states.},

Volume = {55},

Pages = {221-231},

Abstract = {Predicting how forest species composition may change in response to
   global change is essential for meaningful management. Which species are
   most likely to successfully recruit depends on a multitude of factors,
   but processes operating at the seed-to-seedling transition being
   especially important. Here, we explore how insufficient seed dispersal
   (dispersal limitation) and ecological filtering of seedlings
   (establishment limitation) influence species recruitment in an
   Afromontane Forest. We combined census data from seeds in seed traps and
   seed-seedling transition plots in a Nigerian montane forest to measure
   dispersal and establishment limitation across species, life history
   strategies, and seed sizes. From 106 seed traps and 318 seedling plots,
   we recorded 11,278 seeds from 38 species and 2688 seedlings of 61
   species. All species except for one liana showed strong dispersal
   limitation while 23 out of the 30 species showed establishment
   limitation. The two lianas sampled had significantly lower dispersal
   limitation compared to the trees investigated in the study. Our results
   suggest that both dispersal and establishment limitation are markedly
   high in this Afromontane forest than would be expected in a lowland
   counterpart.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning is
   one of central topics in modern ecology, but variable and controversial
   patterns have been found depending on ecosystem type, organism type and
   scale. Such patterns call for mechanistic exploration within an
   integrative modelling framework. Lakes, especially reservoirs, are
   highly disturbed ecosystems, and the relationships between species
   diversity and ecosystem functioning likely differ from those of
   terrestrial ecosystems. Disturbance can have a great impact on local
   diversity and resource use efficiency (RUE) of phytoplankton assemblages
   and thereby influence these relationships. To elucidate how disturbance
   influences the diversity of phytoplankton and its relationship with
   ecosystem functioning, we analysed datasets from two groups of
   waterbodies (large-sized reservoirs and small-sized reservoirs)
   subjected to different disturbance regimes. We also investigated the
   mechanisms potentially underlying the relationships using structural
   equation modelling. A unimodal relationship between species richness and
   productivity was found in large-sized reservoirs and in small-sized
   reservoirs in dry seasons, while a positive linear relationship was
   detected in small-sized reservoirs in wet seasons. Cyanobacteria
   dominance increased the RUE of phytoplankton and decreased its evenness
   more significantly in large-sized reservoirs than in small reservoirs.
   The effects of water temperature and resources availability (TP) on
   species richness also changed with disturbance regimes. Disturbance is
   an important factor modifying the responses of phytoplankton communities
   to environmental gradients, and disturbance regimes at regional scale
   can largely shape the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and
   ecosystem functioning.},

Title = {Livelihood and climate vulnerability of coastal communities to natural

Abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the countries that is most likely to be affected by
   natural disasters and climate change. However, much less is known about
   the integrated livelihood and climate vulnerabilities of coastal
   communities to natural disasters in southwestern Bangladesh. Therefore,
   this paper proposes a holistic approach to measuring livelihood
   vulnerability in the southwestern coast of Bangladesh based on primary
   data from 300 respondents through face-to-face interviews, focus group
   discussion (FGD), and key informant interviews (KII), and secondary data
   on rainfall and temperature for the years 2010-2017. This study
   developed the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), the climate
   vulnerability index (CVI), and the LVI-IPCC to estimate climate
   vulnerability by incorporating 36 indicators of 9 major components under
   three dimensions. The pragmatic results show that the three coastal
   unions have different LVI, CVI, and LVI-IPCC values. Still, the
   households of the Gabura union showed more vulnerability than the rest
   of the two, with the highest LVI, CVI, and LVI-IPCC values due to their
   inadequate access to fresh water, limited physical resources, fewest
   livelihood strategies, the least variety of crops, and worst health
   conditions. This logical approach may be applied in data-scarce regions
   to assess vulnerability and evaluate potential policy efficiency for
   baseline comparison. The study demonstrates that the requirement for
   focused interventions and context-specific sustainable policies and

Abstract = {We conducted a nonlethal feeding experiment to measure diet/hair and
   diet/faeces trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) in two rodent species
   fed two diet types. The mean TDFs between diet and hair (expressed as
   delta C-13/delta N-15) were 2.14 parts per thousand/3.44 parts per
   thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 2.65 parts per thousand/3.25
   parts per thousand for fodder with 30\% animal (insect) matter in
   yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and 1.66 parts per
   thousand/4.67 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 1.94
   parts per thousand/4.49 parts per thousand for fodder with 30\% animal
   (insect) matter in bank voles (Myodes glareolus). As compared with the
   diet, faeces were depleted in C-13 by about 0.75 parts per thousand and
   enriched in N-15 by about 2 parts per thousand. All bank voles and only
   half of yellow-necked mice had regrown hair at the end of the study (day
   95). We analysed archived skins of those species and confirmed, that
   moult in bank voles is more intensive. Our results can be used for
   trophic studies of temperate-forest rodents and for meta-analyses on

Abstract = {Sustainable Development (SD) has played an important role in all
   industries and mining activities. The Internet of Things (IoT),
   interacting with industrial machines or home appliances through an
   interconnected network, can assist in developing real-time platforms for
   monitoring and operating a complex production system with minimal
   intervention of humans, which made it possible to benefit from the data
   obtained to increase production rate, Net Present Value optimization,
   workforce and machine safety, and decreasing pollution. Ideal automated
   mining can be achieved by designing an IoT based framework and suitable
   SD assessment. This research aims to achieve a holistic understanding of
   the current IoT scenario by conducting a comparative analysis of the
   prevailing literature regarding IoT applications in the mining and SD
   area. The results showed that, in the economic index of sustainability,
   mining activity based on IoT can increase productivity, wealth, income,
   and GDP and decrease operating expenses, depreciation costs, and total
   cost. From environmental point of view, a significant reduction in
   emission and pollution can be obtained. Also, the increase in workforce
   safety and positive impact on culture and knowledge are the components
   of the social index of sustainability. These activities are followed by
   some significant challenges such as developing infrastructures, modern
   machinery, adequate security for data transmission, increase business in
   the area, creating new jobs for individuals, especially those who have
   lost their jobs. It's essential to devise new rules to protect local
   people, properly distribute the wealth gained from this development to
   improve the infrastructure of the mining area.},

Title = {Sustainability factors influencing para rubber resources for the
   implementation of circular economy in Songkhla province, southern
   Thailand},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},

Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Circular economy (CE) has grown in popularity among policymakers as a
   novel approach to sustainable development, and a trending tool driving
   sustainable development in many countries around the world.
   Fundamentally, interactions between socioeconomic, socioecological, and
   technological factors determine sustainable development. Para rubber is
   a vital feedstock for bio-based industries. However, utilizing para
   rubber resources inefficiently can be a barrier to the desirable shift
   towards a CE system and sustainable development. In this present study,
   the sustainability factors enhancing the implementation of the CE
   potential of Para rubber resources in Songkhla province, southern
   Thailand, was evaluated. The classical Analytical Hierarchy Process
   (AHP) and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) were complementarily
   used to evaluate the main factors and sub-criteria for para rubber CE
   potential. The findings revealed the factors that will facilitate the
   implementation of para rubber CE and enhance sustainable development in
   the following order of priority: resource (0.420)> development (0.177)>
   environment (0.162)> economy (0.127)> population (0.114). Consequently,
   the para rubber resource has been identified as a bioeconomic gem in
   Thailand, with the potential to facilitate CE and enhance sustainable
   development in the study area. This study is useful to all stakeholders,
   including policymakers, in promoting para rubber resource efficiency,
   sustainable consumption and production trends at the national,
   provincial, and district levels, as well as improve the social,
   economic, ecological, and cultural resilience of rural areas. To drive
   Thailand's CE transition, a comprehensive scientific assessment of
   Songkhla megatrends and prospects is recommended.},

Title = {Two decades of monitoring earthworms in translocated grasslands at

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Construction of a second runway at Manchester Airport included a
   mitigation package of habitat restoration with relocation of earthworms
   as prey items for protected vertebrates. Translocation of turf in blocks
   was the standard method used for four of five monitored sites with loose
   soil moved at the other. To assess earthworm communities at these
   translocated grassland sites, monitoring was undertaken each October
   (1998-2019) by digging and hand sorting of soil, followed by vermifuge
   application. Fourteen earthworm species were recorded, representing all
   ecological groups, but the majority were endogeic species, dominated by
   Aporrectodea caliginosa. Total earthworm numbers fluctuated during the
   monitoring period, with lowest density at 4 m(-2) and highest more than
   a hundred times larger. The overall mean from all sites across the
   monitoring period was 151 ind.m(-2). The differences between sites such
   as total earthworm numbers and species richness were clearly influenced
   by the translocation method and specific site topography. Created
   Hummocks to 3 m for hibernating amphibians proved successful with
   grassland soil establishing well. Lumbricus terrestris failed to
   establish due to translocation technique. Using non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, integration of environmental data with
   earthworm records showed effects of soil moisture content, pH and
   rainfall on abundance of ecological groupings and particular species. In
   general, earthworm community composition was dynamic over the monitoring
   period suggesting that this and population size needs to be appraised
   over realistic timescales, which may be best monitored in decades.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the key factors that influenced the consumer
   purchase behaviour of green-certified buildings in Brazil. To do this, a
   theoretical model was developed from three systematic literature reviews
   (SLR) on three literature streams (green buildings, traditional
   buildings, and green products) - alongside classical consumer behaviour
   model. The resulting model was then used to set up the hypotheses that
   were evaluated through a mixed-method approach based on in-depth
   interviews and a survey with Brazilian customers who had bought a green
   building certified apartment or house. Our findings showed that there
   were nine key factors that positively influenced their purchasing
   behaviour: motivation, knowledge, environmental attitude, values and
   personality, physical attributes, external environment, trust,
   lifestyle, and situation. They were motivated by the desire to live in a
   sustainable property, live in a more secure environment, own a home and
   leave a legacy for future generations; and having background information
   and knowledge about green buildings and a high degree of environmental
   attitude and sustainability related values and lifestyle. Our
   contribution is threefold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first study that investigates the key factors that influenced the actual
   behaviour of green building consumers in the Brazilian market, and one
   of the few that studies the actual buying behaviour rather than
   intention. It extends the extant literature by studying a more
   comprehensive set of factors and it contributes to the investigation of
   consumer behaviour of traditional and sustainable products in emerging
   markets.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances and climate change are expected to reorganize
   biodiversity on multiple ecological levels from populations to
   ecosystems, especially in arid and semiarid regions due to environmental
   filtering imposed by water stress. This paper examines the individual
   and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance and increased
   aridity on the structure of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in a
   human-modified landscape of Caatinga dry forest, in the northeast of
   Brazil. Butterflies were recorded monthly across old-growth forest
   stands and their assemblages were described in terms of taxonomic and
   functional community-level attributes confronted to different levels of
   chronic disturbance and aridity. Butterfly assemblages were species-poor
   but had high species replacement (turnover) along both the chronic
   disturbance and aridity gradients. We observed a negative effect of
   aridity on alpha and beta diversity of butterfly assemblages. Butterfly
   assemblages across forest stands exposed to high levels of chronic
   disturbance and aridity had a nested structure. Functional diversity
   (Rao's Q) and the community-weighted means (CWM) of ocellus-bearing
   species and monocot-feeding larvae were negatively and positively
   affected by increased aridity and chronic disturbance, respectively. Our
   findings suggest that aridity and its combination with chronic
   disturbance have a drastic effect on the structure of butterfly
   assemblages in the Caatinga dry forest. These findings highlight that
   rainfall and chronic disturbances as major drivers of biological
   reorganization in human-modified landscapes. As aridity increases,
   Caatinga tends to support taxonomically and functionally impoverished
   and highly distorted assemblages. Abstract in Portuguese is available

Title = {The legacy of forest logging on organic matter inputs and storage in
   tropical streams},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Abstract = {Riparian forests play an important role in stream ecosystems, as they
   support biodiversity, reduce water erosion, and provide litter that
   fuels aquatic biota. However, they are affected by great array of
   anthropogenic threats (e.g., fire, logging, and organic pollution),
   which alter species composition and their physical structure. Although
   forest recovery after disturbance such as logging can take decades, the
   legacy of forest clear-cut logging on key processes in tropical riparian
   ecosystems is mostly unknown. Here, we investigated how litter inputs
   (leaves, twigs, and reproductive parts) and storage, key processes for
   carbon and nutrient recycling and for forest and stream biota, are
   influenced by riparian vegetation undergoing succession (after 28 years
   from logging) through the comparison of reference and logged forest
   sites in the Cerrado biome. Litterfall was overall similar between
   forest types, but litterfall of twigs was twofold higher at logged than
   reference sites. Similarly, litter inputs from the bank to the stream
   (i.e., lateral inputs) and streambed storage were 50-60\% higher at
   logged than reference sites. The higher litterfall observed in logged
   forests could be related to higher proportion of tree species that are
   characteristic of primary and secondary successional stages, including
   fast-growing and liana species, which often are more productive and
   common in anthropogenic areas. Our results showed that the legacy impact
   of clear-cut logging, even if residual woody vegetation is maintained in
   riparian buffers, can shift the type, quantity, and seasonality of
   litter subsidies to tropical streams. This knowledge should be
   considered within the context of management and conservation of
   communities and ecosystem processes in the forest-stream interfaces.

Title = {If you encyst: evidence of parasite escape and host-switching among
   three co-occurring crabs},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},

Abstract = {Biological invasions influence species interactions around the globe,
   including host and parasite communities. We evaluated trematode parasite
   diversity and the potential for host-switching of parasites in 3
   co-occurring crabs in the Northeast USA, including 1 native species
   (Cancer irroratus) and 2 non-natives (Carcinus maenas, Hemigrapsus
   sanguineus), of which the former represents a historical and the latter
   a contemporary invader. At 7 sites from Maine to Rhode Island, we
   surveyed crabs for trematode infection prevalence and abundance, and the
   influence of parasitism on host body condition. We also conducted DNA
   sequencing using the 18S rRNA barcoding marker to determine species
   composition, diversity, and gene flow of trematode lineages among the
   co-occurring hosts. While the native host, C. irroratus, and the
   historical invader, C. maenas, exhibited no statistical difference in
   trematode prevalence, we found that C. maenas had a greater abundance of
   metacercarial cysts than the other 2 hosts, and the contemporary
   invader, H. sanguineus, was rarely infected. Crab condition did not vary
   with infection abundance, although infected females of all species had
   higher reproductive investment than other groups. Genetic analyses
   revealed that the microphallid trematodes consisted of 3 main clades,
   representing over 50 haplotypes, with evidence of host-switching by
   native parasites utilizing the non-native hosts. Given the importance of
   crustaceans to parasite life cycles, the introduction of novel hosts to
   these systems alters both free-living and host-parasite community
   interactions and could ultimately affect community structure and
   function. Future studies should continue to investigate host-parasite
   diversity and demographics following invasions to better understand
   impacts on native marine communities.},

Number = {5},

Abstract = {The pollution of freshwater ecosystems is threatening freshwater plant
   species diversity worldwide. Freshwater plants, such as the common
   duckweed (Lemna minor), are potentially sensitive to novel stressful
   environments. To test if ecotype diversity could increase resistance to
   stressful environments, I used seven L. minor populations and measured
   their growth rates with and without moderate salt stress across an
   ecotype diversity gradient. The L. minor populations were grown over 5
   months in 92 experimental mesocosms, either in ecotype monocultures or
   in polyculture with either one or three conspecific ecotypes (23 unique
   compositions). After growing the duckweed in unperturbed conditions
   (phase 1), the cultures were subjected to moderate salt stress (50
   mmol/L NaCl) for several weeks (phase 2). The experiment was conducted
   in the presence of the natural epimicrobial community associated with
   the different ecotypes. In phase 2, a subset of these algae added an
   unintentional second stressor to the experiment. The ecotypes differed
   in their growth rates, the fastest growing at twice the rate of others.
   The diversity context further shaped the ecotype growth rates. Ecotype
   polycultures showed higher abundances towards the end of the experiment,
   thus over time, as the environment deteriorated, ecotype diversity
   gained in importance. These findings show that within-species variation
   in growth rates can translate to a positive effect of ecotype diversity
   on population abundance. Exposure of L. minor to moderate salt levels
   did not significantly impact growth rates, although the effect may have
   been masked by reduced algal stress in the saline environments.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effects of landscape differences
   associated with intensive agricultural activities on farmland use by
   medium and large mammals in Japan. We compared the species diversity of
   mammals that used farmland within three regions with different
   agricultural activity levels, and analyzed the relationship between the
   occurrences and escape responses of mammals in the farmland and
   surrounding landscape. We used spotlight count in intensive (high
   agricultural activity), intermediate (moderate agricultural activity),
   and non-intensive (low agricultural activity) areas. We observed 271 and
   199 occurrences of mammals in spring and autumn 2021, respectively.
   Seasonal changes in mammals occurrence were due to a decrease in the
   number of raccoon dogs observed. Species richness tended to be lower in
   intensive agricultural areas than in other areas, suggesting that
   intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affect the community
   structure of medium and large mammals. Generalized additive models
   showed that the effects of the surrounding landscape on the occurrences
   and escape responses of raccoon dogs, red foxes, and cats differed among
   species. Only raccoon dogs were negatively affected by the surrounding
   farmland, suggesting high sensitivity to agricultural activities. Our
   results have important implications for the management of ecosystems in
   Japanese agricultural areas.},

Title = {Sea-ice-related environmental drivers affect meiofauna and macrofauna

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {13-37},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The structure and drivers of Southern Ocean meiofauna and macrofauna
   were investigated together in one extensive study. From the tip of the
   Antarctic Peninsula to the southeastern Weddell Sea, we classified the
   investigated stations into 5 categories according to their summer
   sea-ice cover: (I) none (Drake Passage), (II) irregular (Bransfield
   Strait), (III) seasonal (northwestern Weddell Sea), (IV) high (South
   Filchner Trough), and (V) constant (North Filchner Trough). The
   categories differed significantly in primary-production-related
   characteristics in the water column and food availability at the
   seafloor. Almost all ice-cover categories differed significantly in
   meiofauna communities (32-500 mu m, 20 taxa, 585 825 individuals). Fewer
   regions differed significantly in macrofauna (>500 mu m, 19 taxa, 3974
   individuals) or the combined meiofauna and macrofauna communities.
   Environmental drivers explained >66\% of the variation among different
   communities and differed for the faunal size classes: for meiofauna
   (84.2\%), sea-ice cover (1 yr) and availability of fresh food
   (chlorophyll a {[}chl a]) were most important, whereas 1 yr ice cover,
   chl a, and total organic carbon were decisive drivers for macrofauna
   (66.6\%). Grain size, water depth, water-column chl a, long-term ice
   cover, seafloor temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio influenced
   communities to a lesser extent. We demonstrated a stronger relationship
   with sea-ice cover in meiofauna communities than in macrofauna
   communities, and we recommend including meiofauna in future assessments
   of the influence of environmental changes on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

Title = {Experimental validation confirms a carbon stable isotope lipid

Abstract = {Carbon stable isotope analysis is an important tool in studies of fish
   ecology. Studies using this tool must account for the effect of lipids
   present in fish tissue on carbon stable isotope (delta 13C) values.
   Simple correction equations have been developed to correct for this
   effect. For taxa with high fat content, choosing an accurate correction
   equation can have a significant impact on results. Pacific salmon
   (Oncorhynchus spp.) are a lipid-rich genus. Their broad marine
   distribution and ecological, cultural, and commercial importance make
   them prime candidates for stable isotope analysis. To determine both an
   accurate lipid correction equation for Pacific salmon delta 13C values,
   and the effect of lipid extraction on bulk nitrogen isotope (delta 15N)
   values, we performed pairwise isotope analysis on lipid-extracted and
   untreated muscle samples from 68 Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha spanning
   a size range of 165-750 mm and C:N values of 2.96-14.25. We compared the
   fit of existing delta 13C lipid correction equations from 3 previously
   published models to our data, and optimized the top performing model
   using a leave-one-out cross validation. The model of Kiljunen et al.
   (2006; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01224.x) performed the
   best (mean squared error: 0.22, r2: 0.91), while the optimized model
   only slightly improved on it (MSE: 0.20, r2: 0.93). For delta 15N, we
   determined that Chinook delta 15N values significantly increased by 0.6
   parts per thousand following lipid extraction. Our results confirm a
   lipid normalization procedure that is broadly applicable to Pacific
   salmon, and supports streamlined analysis of delta 13C and delta 15N
   from a single untreated muscle tissue sample.},

Abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and community stability have been
   well-documented in grassland ecosystems, yet the diversity-stability
   relationship and the mechanisms driving community stability in forests
   remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the community
   stability of a tropical montane forest in China over 10 years to explore
   the effect of multiple facets of biodiversity (that is, taxonomic,
   functional, and structural diversity). We further tested the relative
   importance of biodiversity, functional traits, species asynchrony,
   species stability, and abiotic factors (that is, soil nutrients) on
   community stability. We found that multiple facets of biodiversity had
   inconsistent effects on stability, including a neutral effect of species
   richness, and weak positive effects of functional diversity and
   structural diversity. Species asynchrony, rather than biodiversity, was
   the greatest predictor of community stability, followed by the stability
   of large trees. Consistent with the mass-ratio hypothesis, the stability
   of dominant species also had an important direct effect on community
   stability. Although functional trait composition had no direct effect on
   stability, it regulated stability via species asynchrony, large tree
   stability, and dominant species stability. Similarly, soil nutrients
   conferred minor effects on community stability. Our results indicated
   that the insurance effect is the main mechanism driving community
   stability in this subtropical forest. Meanwhile, the mass-ratio
   hypothesis also played an important role, which suggested that the
   management and protection of forest ecosystem should not only focus on
   biodiversity but also the community structural attributes.},

Title = {Lessons from comparative primatology for understanding trait covariation
   and diversity in evolutionary ecology},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-47},

Abstract = {Given the position of humans in the tree of life, comparative research
   on non-human primates has attracted the interest of researchers in
   biology, medical sciences, anthropology, psychology, and sociology.
   Covariation of species' phenotypes has been of particular interest.
   Learning from the historical development of comparative research with
   primates should thus be particularly valuable for evolutionary ecology
   and to improve understanding of phenotypic integration and diversity.
   Such learning would also help identify knowledge gaps, disputed
   questions, and new avenues of both basic and applied research in
   relation to the evolution of primate features and the conservation of
   our close relatives. We conducted a historical assessment through a
   non-systematic review and a systematic review, focusing on how the
   integration of different research lines in evolutionary ecology focused
   on primate phenotypic covariation unfolded throughout the 20th Century.
   The non-systematic review allowed us to reconstruct the history of the
   discipline from its earliest origins, when bibliometric assessments were
   more limited in scope, and to identify the most appropriate keywords for
   the systematic review. We employed a standard protocol for the
   systematic review, applying two complementary analyses: co-occurrence of
   keywords and bibliographic coupling of references. These analyses
   described the development of the conceptual and intellectual structures
   of comparative primatology from 1966 to 2020. By identifying the most
   influential researchers and concept interrelations, we highlight primate
   phenotypes critical for the development of the discipline (in
   particular, brain and body sizes and behavioural patterns), showcasing
   the reach of these investigations for evolutionary ecology. Overall, our
   findings emphasise the crucial role that comparative primatology has
   played in developing the study of phenotypic integration and the very
   onset of phylogenetic comparative methods.},

Title = {Direct and indirect pathways for environmental drivers of hatching

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {119-132},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Nest site selection has consequences for hatching success by mediating
   the temperature and moisture conditions that eggs experience during the
   incubation period. Understanding the potentially complex pathways by
   which nest placement influences these abiotic mediators, and therefore
   hatching success, is important for predicting which nests will be
   successful and which may require management action. We studied the
   effects of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nest site selection
   on hatching success by linking nest placement characteristics to
   hatching success through a structural equation model. We monitored 170
   nests on Ossabaw Island, Georgia, during the summers of 2017 and 2018
   and tracked nest conditions throughout the incubation period.
   Temperature had a complex effect on hatching success-nests had higher
   hatching rates if they were exposed to higher mean temperatures but also
   if they experienced both extremely high (>34 degrees C) and extremely
   low (<26.5 degrees C) temperatures, suggesting that temperature
   variability plays a role in determining nest outcomes beyond the mean
   temperature. Likewise, hatching success declined with a higher incidence
   of nests being inundated by tides. We found that nests placed at the
   highest elevations had the highest hatching success rates, likely
   because those nests had a much lower chance of being washed over by high
   tides and had higher mean temperatures. Nests were also more successful
   when placed in greater amounts of vegetation, again because vegetated
   nests were generally warmer and were associated with fewer washover
   events. These results shed light on the mechanisms behind selection for
   certain nest site characteristics and can guide the relocation of nests
   as a conservation action.},

Abstract = {Green infrastructures (GIs) are environmental designs mainly used to
   treat urban stormwater runoff pollution. The influences of green
   infrastructure designs are associated with the bacteria composition and
   diversity in their soils. This study evaluated the effects of GI design
   on the composition and function of urban soil bacterial communities in
   Wuhan, China. GI designs were divided into five different types:
   engineered (road bioswales, rain gardens, and sunken green spaces) and
   non-engineered (conventional road greenbelts and urban lawns) designs.
   The engineered soil combined with the connectivity to urban runoff of
   the GI design can have strong influences on bacterial community
   composition and function. Across the five GI design types, we found that
   the composition of bacterial communities was dominated by
   Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria at the
   phylum level. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
   in the engineered designs was significantly higher than the
   non-engineered designs and was highest in road bioswales. We detected
   nine predominant ecological function groups related to the carbon (3
   groups) and nitrogen (6 groups) cyclings, with their relative abundance
   in engineered soils significantly higher than those in non-engineered
   soils, especially in road bioswales and sunken green spaces. Road
   bioswales (RBS), with direct connection to urban runoff from street, had
   the highest denitrification enzyme activity (DEA). DEA of green
   infrastructures was highly correlated with soil organic carbon, moisture
   and total nitrogen. Road bioswales appear to function as denitrification
   hotspots and have higher potential denitrification than other GI
   designs.},

Abstract = {Many tree species grow across large climatic and geographical gradients,
   but there is a lack of information related to intraspecific variation in
   leaf traits for some of the most abundant trees in temperate forests as
   related to these gradients. In particular, understanding intraspecific
   variation in carbon (C)- and nitrogen (N)-based traits of both plant
   foliage and senesced leaves is important as they provide insight into
   leaf physiology, tree nutrient status, and forest biogeochemical
   processes. We report on a community science project that focused on
   variation in Acer rubrum (red maple) foliar C and N concentrations, C:N
   of green and fallen leaves, and N resorption across broad mean annual
   temperature (MAT), precipitation (MAP), and latitudinal gradients. MAT
   was negatively correlated with green leaf \%N and both fallen leaf C:N
   and N resorption, but was positively correlated with green leaf C:N and
   fallen leaf \%N. MAP was positively related to fallen leaf \%N and
   negatively with fallen leaf C:N and N resorption. Green leaf \%C and \%N
   was significantly higher in open than closed grown sites, but green leaf
   C:N was significantly higher in closed grown sites. Our results suggest
   red maple's leaf physiology and role in biogeochemical processes
   systematically vary throughout its broad geographic range. Further, our
   results suggest red maple's N resorption and recycling through
   litterfall impacts ecosystem C and N cycles differently throughout its
   geographic range, such that trees in warmer climates may have a greater
   reliance on litter-derived N on an annual basis relative to trees in
   cooler climates, which may be more adept at reusing N via resorption.},

Abstract = {Rapid advances in hardware and software, accompanied by public- and
   private-sector investment, have led to a new generation of data-driven
   computational tools. Recently, there has been a particular focus on deep
   learning-a class of machine learning algorithms that uses deep neural
   networks to identify patterns in large and heterogeneous datasets. These
   developments have been accompanied by both hype and scepticism by
   ecologists and others. This review describes the context in which deep
   learning methods have emerged, the deep learning methods most relevant
   to ecosystem ecologists, and some of the problem domains they have been
   applied to. Deep learning methods have high predictive performance in a
   range of ecological contexts, leveraging the large data resources now
   available. Furthermore, deep learning tools offer ecosystem ecologists
   new ways to learn about ecosystem dynamics. In particular, recent
   advances in interpretable machine learning and in developing hybrid
   approaches combining deep learning and mechanistic models provide a
   bridge between pure prediction and causal explanation. We conclude by
   looking at the opportunities that deep learning tools offer ecosystem
   ecologists and assess the challenges in interpretability that deep
   learning applications pose.},

Abstract = {The economy, society, and environment of the world are undergoing
   profound changes. Achieving sustainable development has become the
   common aspiration of the international communities. In recent years,
   sustainability issues are gaining increasing prominence for cities to
   formulate long-term development strategies. The Yangtze River Delta
   (YRD) urban agglomeration, one of China's most developed and densely
   populated industrial areas, has encountered environmental problems.
   Assessment of city sustainability of the YRD is a prominent issue in the
   process of urban construction. The paper used multi-criteria decision
   making (MCDM) framework to evaluate the sustainability level of 26
   cities in the YRD by selecting 24 indicators from the economic, social,
   and environmental dimensions. In the weighting process, the paper
   proposed a new subjective and objective integrated weighting method
   based on stochastic simulation techniques. Relative results including
   pairwise priority matrix (PPM), comprehensive priority index (CPI), and
   the most likely ranking were obtained to reflect the superiority degree
   between two cities by adequate comparisons. The assessment results
   indicate that all the cities showed an upward trend from 2015 to 2019.
   Shanghai had overwhelming advantages over the other cities. The CPIs of
   Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou in Jiangsu province, and Hangzhou,
   Ningbo, Zhoushan in Zhejiang province were above 50 in 2015 and
   increased to over 85 in 2019. Additionally, most cities had unbalanced
   development on the three dimensions. Each city should firstly pay more
   attention to their own weak points, and then achieve balanced
   development and long-term sustainability.},

   Accumulation in Abandoned Agricultural Fields},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Abandoned agricultural fields (old fields) are thought to accumulate
   soil organic matter (SOM) after cultivation cessation. However, most
   research on old fields soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration
   has focused on the surface (10 or 30 cm depth) and overlooked their
   dynamics below 30 cm. This study quantified C and N stock change in both
   the surface and subsurface with repeated inventories over 13 years. We
   conducted repeated soil surveys in 8 old fields that form a 64-year
   chronosequence at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CCESR),
   Minnesota in 2001 and 2014. On average, soil C and N accumulated by 16.5
   +/- 14.5 g C m(-2) y(-1) and 1.0 +/- 1.1 g N m(-2) y(-1) in the surface
   (0-20 cm). In contrast, we found soil C and N decreased by 78.9 +/- 26.3
   g C m(-2) y(-1) and 12.9 +/- 2.42 g N m(-2) y(-1) in the subsurface
   (20-100 cm). The C and N losses in the subsurface soil were correlated
   with low deep root biomass; the majority of roots are located in the top
   20 cm of soil. Such root distribution may be attributed to the
   continuing dominance of nonnative and shallow-rooted C3 grasses and the
   lack of legumes after field abandonment. This study shows that
   agriculture has a long legacy effect after abandonment on subsurface
   soil C and N. Some abandoned agricultural fields can continue to lose C
   and N because surface C and N accumulation does not offset the ongoing
   deeper soil C and N losses.},

Abstract = {Aim. To identify the distribution features of a key species of
   macrophytobenthos in the shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Material
   and Methods. The field materials from a comprehensive expedition carried
   out during the summer 2019 were collected and processed by the authors.
   Results. For the first time, a map was compiled and the features of the
   distribution of dominant types of macrophytobentos identified in the
   shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Conclusion. It was shown that in
   the eastern part of the bay, on a shallow slope composed of silty-sandy
   deposits, adjacent to the accumulative shores, sea grasses dominate and
   along the abrasive-clay shores there is no bottom vegetation and
   significant accumulations of dead leaves of Zostera marina i Z. noltei
   are typical there. In the water area of the Bakal spit macrophitobentos
   is not found on the sandy deposits. Cladophora spp. are represented in
   the base of the western branch of the spit, at the place of its joining
   an active clayey cliff. Mosaic distribution of bottom vegetation is
   noted in the area of Cape Kamenniy, where co-growth of algae on the
   limestone outcrops and marine herbs living on loose soils is registered.
   West of Cape Kamenniy in shallow water adjacent to the abrasive
   limestone coasts Carpodesmia crinite - Treptacantha barbata phytocenoses
   are characteristic. It was shown that in the composition of
   macrophytobentos decreased in the role of dominant species, an increase
   in the proportion of algae found in the areas with increased
   eutrophication of marine environment, which is probably due to the
   influence of anthropogenic and natural factors. Monitoring observations
   in this area will make it possible to develop scientifically based
   recommendations aimed at optimizing the environmental regime and
   rational environmental management of the coastal zone of Karkinitskiy
   Bay.},

Abstract = {We studied the formation of ant communities on rock dumps at coal mine
   dump sites of different ages and in natural environments in southwestern
   Siberia. The species composition and diversity were studied by means of
   plot sampling and line-transect surveys, while the nest density of ants
   was determined using pitfall traps. Soil pH, turf extent, and vegetation
   cover were measured and their effects on the formation of ant
   communities were evaluated. Our results revealed that ants' density and
   species diversity increased with progressing recovery of the dumps. In
   the first succession phase, the soil at the dumps was alkaline and sites
   were inhabited primarily by Tetramorium caespitum. The density and the
   number of Myrmica sp. and Formica sp. nests increased with here was an
   increase in with increasing soil acidity. Lasius sp. ants were the first
   to form significant clusters of nests and to become numerically dominant

   conservation of these highly valuable ecosystems. Here, we present the
   baseline data of an observational plot network in the Dehesa that will
   form the foundation for monitoring long-term dynamics and for
   experimental manipulations testing the mechanisms driving resilience
   within the Dehesa. The initial surveys indicate that the forest
   structure is typical for the Dehesa, which suggests it is an exemplary
   site for examining temporal dynamics of this ecosystem. We present these
   initial data to encourage collaborations from international scientists
   via either direct experimental projects or meta-analyses.},

Abstract = {The response of plant leaf and root phenology and biomass in the Arctic
   to global change remains unclear due to the lack of synchronous
   measurements of above- and belowground parts. Our objective was to
   determine the phenological dynamics of the above- and belowground parts
   of Eriophorum vaginatum in the Arctic and its response to warming. We
   established a common garden located at Toolik Lake Field Station;
   tussocks of E. vaginatum from three locations, Coldfoot, Toolik Lake and
   Sagwon, were transplanted into the common garden. Control and warming
   treatments for E. vaginatum were set up at the Toolik Lake during the
   growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. Digital cameras, a handheld sensor and
   minirhizotrons were used to simultaneously observe leaf greenness,
   normalized difference vegetation index and root length dynamics,
   respectively. Leaf and root growth rates of E. vaginatum were
   asynchronous such that the timing of maximal leaf growth (mid-July) was
   about 28 days earlier than that of root growth. Warming of air
   temperature by 1 degrees C delayed the timing of leaf senescence and
   thus prolonged the growing season, but the temperature increase had no
   significant effect on root phenology. The seasonal dynamics of leaf
   biomass were affected by air temperature, whereas root biomass was
   correlated with soil thaw depth. Therefore, we suggest that leaf and
   root components should be considered comprehensively when using carbon
   and nutrient cycle models, as above- and belowground productivity and
   functional traits may have a different response to climate warming.},

Title = {Biocrusts Modulate Climate Change Effects on Soil Organic Carbon Pools:
   Insights From a 9-Year Experiment},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {585-596},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that warming associated with climate
   change is decreasing the total amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in
   drylands, although scientific research has not given enough emphasis to
   particulate (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools.
   Biocrusts are a major biotic feature of drylands and have large impacts
   on the C cycle, yet it is largely unknown whether they modulate the
   responses of POC and MAOC to climate change. Here, we assessed the
   effects of simulated climate change (control, reduced rainfall (RE),
   warming (WA), and RE + WA) and initial biocrust cover (low (< 20\%)
   versus high (> 50\%)) on the mineral protection of soil C and soil
   organic matter quality in a dryland ecosystem in central Spain for 9
   years. At low initial biocrust cover levels, both WA and RE + WA
   increased SOC, especially POC but also MAOC, and promoted a higher
   contribution of carbohydrates, relative to aromatic compounds, to the
   POC fraction. These results suggest that the accumulation of soil C
   under warming treatments may be transitory in soils with low initial
   biocrust cover. In soils with high initial biocrust cover, climate
   change treatments did not affect SOC, neither POC nor MAOC fraction.
   Overall, our results indicate that biocrust communities modulate the
   negative effect of climate change on SOC, because no losses of soil C
   were observed with the climate manipulations under biocrusts. Future
   work should focus on determining the long-term persistence of the
   observed buffering effect by biocrust-forming lichens, as they are known
   to be negatively affected by warming.},

Abstract = {Past research has documented livestock grazing patterns and dynamics
   across pastoral landscapes. We used spatial locations of domestic range
   sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from Global Positioning System collars to
   study habitat selection on summer mountain habitat North of Scofield
   Reservoir Utah, United States. Data were collected between the months of
   July to September 2020. We developed a resource selection function to
   determine the influence of slope, distance to water, aspect, ruggedness,
   elevation, and vegetation types on habitat selection by sheep while
   grazing on summer mountain habitat. We found sheep selected for sites
   closer to water, with more gentle terrain, higher in elevation, and
   north-facing slopes. Vegetation types were less predictive, ostensibly
   due to the lack of species composition information in available
   geographic information system layers and the possibility of sheep being
   herded to avoid areas of overuse. Although it is often assumed that
   sheep use slopes more than their heavier and larger cattle counterparts,
   overall they tended to avoid steep slopes compared with all other
   predictor variables. This information on selection for higher elevations
   and avoidance of steep slopes can be used to improve livestock
   management practices including flock management that increases sheep
   foraging patterns and energy efficiency. (C) 2022 The Society for Range

Abstract = {The management of reef-associated fish species is challenging due to
   their life history characteristics and occurrence in rocky reef habitats
   that are difficult to sample using traditional sampling gears. We
   compared 2 common sampling gears for reef fish species, chevron traps
   and underwater video, using 5 yr of comprehensive paired sampling data
   (N = 7034) collected at reef habitats between North Carolina and Florida
   along the southeast United States Atlantic continental shelf. Most fish
   families (80\%) and species (85\%) were observed significantly more
   often on video than caught in traps, and only 2 species out of 40
   (5\%)-black sea bass Centropristis striata and bank sea bass
   C.ocyurus-were caught significantly more often in traps than observed on
   video. Moreover, site-specific species richness was approximately 3-4
   times higher on average for video compared to traps. We also used a
   generalized additive model to show that the ratio of trap-caught species
   to video-observed species was higher in shallower waters off North and
   South Carolina, especially when water clarity was low. Results
   demonstrate that video can be an efficient gear to sample most reef
   fishes around the world but may provide even greater benefits when
   paired with traditional sampling gears like traps to leverage the
   strengths of each gear for estimating relative abundance and species
   richness with more certainty.},

Title = {Interrelationships between soft corals and reef-associated fishes on

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},
Pages = {15-28},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The composition of coral reef habitats strongly influences associated
   fish assemblages. As habitat formers, soft corals constitute a
   morphologically diverse component of coral reefs, although their
   importance as fish habitat is largely unquantified. Our study assessed
   relationships between soft and hard coral habitats and assemblages of
   reef-associated fishes on inshore reefs of the Whitsunday Islands,
   focussing on pomacentrids, chaetodontids and pomacanthids. Study sites
   varied in hard and soft coral cover and were assessed by the level of
   exposure to previous cyclone damage. The soft coral community was
   dominated by Sinularia spp. and constituted an average of 11.4\% of
   benthic cover compared to 16\% hard coral cover. At fine spatial scales
   (250 m2), significant positive relationships between soft coral cover
   and abundance occurred for 2 species of pomacentrids (Amblyglyphidodon
   curacao and A. leucogaster) as well as total Chaetodontidae and
   Pomacanthidae. Further, it was clear that some taxa were associated with
   specific soft corals. For example, A. curacao, Pomacentrus lepidogenys
   and Chelmon rostratus were observed associating with branching digitate
   Sinularia, which has a structurally complex morphology. The combination
   of high and medium cover of hard and soft corals supported distinct
   assemblages of fishes and the highest abundances of many species at the
   scale of sites (1000 m2). Our results indicate that soft corals provide
   valuable habitat, supporting diverse fish assemblages by contributing to
   habitat mosaics on coral reefs. These findings suggest that the
   ecological role of soft corals has been underestimated and therefore
   holds direct implications for the management of coral reefs.},

Title = {Mesopelagic fishes in a hurry at low latitudes},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {149-156},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {We studied mesopelagic fishes in the Red Sea (22 degrees N),
   hypothesizing that the rapid shifts between day and night at low
   latitudes would translate into rapid vertical migration speeds and brief
   near-surface `antipredation windows'. Using a bottom-moored echosounder,
   we found that diel vertical migration speeds of acoustical scattering
   layers were up to double that of the global average. Visits to upper
   water by some of the layers were strikingly brief, around 10 min, and
   included unusual rapid ascent and descent (up to 22 cm s(-1)),
   apparently with a high degree of behavioral plasticity. We suggest that

Abstract = {Marine benthic habitats in continental shelf regions are increasingly
   impacted by hypoxia caused by the combination of eutrophication and
   climate warming. Many regions that have the potential for hypoxic
   conditions are being fished by mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears.
   The combined effects of trawling and hypoxia may be synergistic and
   disproportionally impact benthic fauna, or they may act
   antagonistically, leading to smaller trawl impacts in hypoxic areas.
   Yet, few studies have quantified how bottom trawling and hypoxia
   interact to affect benthic communities. Here we examine these combined
   effects on benthic community biomass and abundance, the number of large
   organisms, the longevity distribution of the community and the vertical
   position of fauna in the sediment in the southern Baltic Sea. We find
   large declines in benthic biomass and abundance that co-occur with
   declines in near-bed oxygen concentrations from 5.8 to 0.8 ml O-2 l(-1).
   Conversely, no relationships and weak positive relationships are found
   between bottom trawl disturbance and benthic community biomass and
   abundance. No interacting effects between hypoxia and trawling are
   detected. Our findings therefore highlight a low likelihood of
   synergistic impacts of bottom trawling and hypoxia on the benthic
   communities studied. These results suggest that management may
   prioritize benthic protection from fishing in regions that are not in a
   state of oxygen stress.},

Abstract = {Global warming may force montane species to shift upward to keep pace
   with their shifting climate niche. How species differences in such
   distribution shifts depend on their elevational positions,
   elevation-dependent warming rates, and other environmental constraints,
   or plant functional traits is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed for
   137 Himalayan tree species how distribution shifts vary with elevational
   niche positions, environmental constraints, and their functional traits.
   We developed ecological niche models using MaxEnt by combining species
   survey and botanical collections data with 19 environmental predictors.
   Species distributions were projected to 1985 and 2050 conditions, and
   elevational range parameters and distribution areas were derived. Under
   the worst-case RCP 8.5 scenario, species are predicted to shift, on
   average, 3 m/year in optimum elevation, and have 33\% increase in
   distribution area. Highland species showed faster predicted elevational
   shifts than lowland species. Lowland and highland species are predicted
   to expand in distribution area in contrast to mid-elevation species.
   Tree species for which species distribution models are driven by
   responses to temperature, aridity, or soil clay content showed the
   strongest predicted upslope shifts. Tree species with conservative trait
   values that enable them to survive resource poor conditions (i.e.,
   narrow conduits) showed larger predicted upslope shifts than species
   with wide conduits. The predicted average upslope shift in maximum
   elevation (8 m/year) is >2 times faster than the current observations
   indicating that many species will not be able to track climate change
   and potentially go extinct, unless they are supported by active
   conservation measures, such as assisted migration. Abstract in Nepali is
   available with online material},

Title = {Pyric Herbivory and the Nexus Between Forage, Fire and Native and

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {610-626},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Earth's tropical savannas typically support high biomass of diverse
   grazing herbivores that depend on a highly fluctuating resource:
   high-quality forage. An annual wet-dry cycle, fire and herbivory combine
   to influence forage quality and availability throughout the year. In the
   savannas of northern Australia, a depauperate suite of large native
   (marsupial) herbivores (wallaroos {[}Osphranter spp.] and the agile
   wallaby {[}Notamacropus agilis]) compete for resources with non-native
   large herbivores introduced in the late nineteenth century, particularly
   bovines (feral and managed cattle {[}Bos spp.] and feral water buffalo
   {[}Bubalus bubalis]) that now dominate the landscape. Anecdotal reports
   of recent population declines of large macropods and negative impacts of
   bovines highlight the need to better understand the complex relationship
   between forage, fire and abundance of native and introduced large
   herbivores. The pyric herbivory conceptual model, which posits complex
   feedbacks between fire and herbivory and was developed outside
   Australia, predicts that native and introduced large herbivores will
   both respond positively to post-fire forage production in Australian
   savannas where they co-occur. We used grazing exclosures, forage biomass
   and nutrient analyses and motion-sensor camera-trapping to evaluate the
   overall robustness of the pyric herbivory model in the Australian
   context, specifically whether forage quantity and quality are impacted
   by herbivory, season and fire activity, and which forage attributes most
   influence large grazing herbivore abundance. Forage quantity, as
   measured by live, dead and total herbaceous biomass and proportion of
   biomass alive, was higher inside herbivore exclosures, even at
   relatively low densities of herbivores. Forage quality, as measured by
   fibre content, was not affected by herbivory, however, crude protein
   content of live herbaceous biomass was greater outside herbivore
   exclosures. Recent fire was an important predictor of all measures of
   forage quantity and quality. Recent fire occurrence decreased overall
   quantity (biomass) but increased quality (decreased fibre content and
   increased crude protein content); late dry season fires resulted in
   forage with the highest crude protein content. The predictions of the
   pyric herbivory conceptual model are consistent with observations of the
   feeding behaviour of introduced bovines and some large macropods in
   northern Australian savannas, lending support to the global generality
   of pyric herbivory in fire-prone grassy biomes.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones (for example, hurricanes, typhoons) are expected to
   intensify under a warming climate, with uncertain effects on tropical
   forests. These ecosystems contribute disproportionately to greenhouse
   gas (GHG; carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O))
   fluxes globally but there is high uncertainty in how these fluxes will
   respond to the projected increase in the frequency of severe tropical
   cyclones. To examine how these natural disturbance events may alter
   ecosystem processes in tropical forests, we studied the effects of
   Hurricane Maria (2017), a category 4 storm, on soil GHG fluxes from a
   forest in Puerto Rico. We also asked how environmental conditions,
   namely severity of tree canopy damage and topographic position,
   influenced spatial heterogeneity in post-hurricane soil GHG emissions.
   Seven months after Hurricane Maria, we observed an 18\% increase in soil
   CO2 fluxes, a switch in CH4 fluxes from net consumption toward net
   production, and a threefold increase in N2O emissions relative to
   pre-hurricane fluxes. None of these fluxes were sensitive to topographic
   heterogeneity or the magnitude of tree canopy damage, in contrast to the
   marked soil GHG flux sensitivity to topography prior to the storm.
   Upscaling the increase in soil N2O emissions to the ecosystem level
   shows that greater emissions of soil N2O following hurricanes also led
   to high rates of nitrogen loss that, if sustained over a year, would be
   equivalent to 30\% of estimated losses of inorganic nitrogen to runoff
   and groundwater. Additionally, the combined hurricane-induced increases
   in soil GHGs suggest a 25\% increase in the contribution of soil GHG
   emissions from this forest to global warming, an effect that can persist
   for several months after the storm. Taken together, our results show
   that hurricane disturbance in coastal tropical forests can, at least
   temporarily, shift the radiative forcing of soils in these forests,
   exacerbating climate change.},

Title = {Can native predators be used as a stepping stone to reduce prey naivety

Abstract = {Lay Summary Prey species that are naive to novel predators are at
   increased risk of predation and potential extinction. We showed that
   exposure of prey to a native predator can improve anti-predator traits
   compared to naive prey. However, these behavioral advantages may not be
   a useful stepping stone for exposure to a novel predator if the novel
   and native predators are behaviorally distinct.
   Predator naivety negatively affects reintroduction success, and this
   threat is exacerbated when prey encounters predators with which they
   have had no evolutionary experience. While methods have been developed
   to inculcate fear into such predator-naive individuals, none have been
   uniformly successful. Exposing ontogenetically- and evolutionary-naive
   individuals first to native predators may be an effective stepping stone
   to improved responses to evolutionarily novel predators. We focused on
   greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) and capitalized on a multi-year
   mammalian recovery experiment whereby western quolls (Dasyurus
   geoffroii) were reintroduced into parts of a large fenced reserve that
   contained a population of naive bilbies. We quantified a suite of
   anti-predator behaviors and measures of general wariness across
   quoll-exposed and quoll-naive bilby populations. We then translocated
   both quoll-exposed and quoll-naive individuals into a large enclosure
   that contained feral cats (Felis catus) and monitored several behaviors.
   We found that bilbies can respond appropriately to quolls but found only
   limited support that experience with quolls better-prepared bilbies to
   respond to cats. Both populations of bilbies rapidly modified their
   behavior in a similar manner after their reintroduction to a novel
   environment. These results may have emerged due to insufficient prior
   exposure to quolls, inappropriate behavioral tests, or insufficient
   predation risk during cat exposure. Alternatively, quolls and cats are
   only distantly related and may not share sufficient similarities in
   their predatory cues or behavior to support such a learning transfer.
   Testing this stepping stone hypothesis with more closely related
   predator species and under higher predation risk would be informative.},

Abstract = {Drought-induced forest dieback can lead to a tipping point in community
   dominance, but the coupled response at the tree and stand-level response
   has not been properly addressed. New spatially and temporally integrated
   monitoring approaches that target different biological organization
   levels are needed. Here, we compared the temporal responses of
   dendrochronological and spectral indices from 1984 to 2020 at both tree
   and stand levels, respectively, of a drought-prone Mediterranean Pinus
   pinea forest currently suffering strong dieback. We test the influence
   of climate on temporal patterns of tree radial growth, greenness and
   wetness spectral indices; and we address the influence of major drought
   episodes on resilience metrics. Tree-ring data and spectral indices
   followed different spatio-temporal patterns over the study period
   (1984-2020). Combined information from tree growth and spectral
   trajectories suggests that a reduction in tree density during the
   mid-1990s could have promoted tree growth and reduced dieback risk.
   Additionally, over the last decade, extreme and recurrent droughts have
   resulted in crown defoliation greater than 40\% in most plots since
   2019. We found that tree growth and the greenness spectral index were
   positively related to annual precipitation, while the wetness index was
   positively related to mean annual temperature. The response to drought,
   however, was stronger for tree growth than for spectral indices. Our
   study demonstrates the value of long-term retrospective multiscale
   analyses including tree and stand-level scales to disentangle mechanisms
   triggering and driving forest dieback.},

Title = {Biophysical Factors Influence Methane Fluxes in Subtropical Freshwater

Abstract = {Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4); however, the
   contribution of subtropical wetlands to global CH4 budgets is still
   unclear due to difficulties in accurately quantifying CH4 emissions from
   these complex ecosystems. Both direct (water management strategies) and
   indirect (altered weather patterns associated with climate change)
   anthropogenic influences are also leading to greater uncertainties in
   our ability to determine changes in CH4 emissions from these ecosystems.
   This study compares CH4 fluxes from two freshwater marshes with
   different hydroperiods (short versus long) in the Florida Everglades to
   examine temporal patterns and biophysical drivers of CH4 fluxes. Both
   sites showed similar seasonal patterns across years with higher CH4
   release during wet seasons versus dry seasons. The long hydroperiod site
   showed stronger seasonal patterns and overall, emitted more CH4 than the
   short hydroperiod site; however, no distinctive diurnal patterns were
   observed. We found that air temperature was a significant positive
   driver of CH4 fluxes for both sites regardless of season. In addition,
   gross ecosystem exchange was a significant negative predictor of CH4
   emissions in the dry season at the long hydroperiod site. CH4 fluxes
   were impacted by water level and its changes over site and season, and
   time scales, which are influenced by rainfall and water management
   practices. Thus with increasing water distribution associated the
   Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan we expect increases in CH4
   emissions, and when couple with increased with projected higher
   temperatures in the region, these increases may be enhanced, leading to
   greater radiative forcing.},

Title = {Acclimation to elevated temperatures in Acropora cervicornis: effects of
   host genotype and symbiont shuffling},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {41-65},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the average surface temperatures of
   tropical waters, creating unfavorable conditions for corals. Some
   species of coral can physiologically acclimate to elevated temperatures,
   but the degree to which genetic variation underlies differences in this
   ability is currently unknown. Acclimation to elevated temperatures in
   coral has been hypothesized to be due to either alterations in the
   symbiont community or to changes in gene expression. The present study
   investigated the ability of Acropora cervicornis to acclimate to
   elevated temperatures, estimated the heritability of plasticity in upper
   thermal tolerance, and tested whether observed acclimation patterns
   could be explained by symbiont shuffling. Coral fragments from a nursery
   in the Florida Keys (USA) were acclimated at either ambient (27 +/- 1
   degrees C) or elevated (30 +/- 1 degrees C) temperatures and then
   exposed to a second heat stress (32 +/- 1 degrees C) and monitored for
   mortality. Fragments acclimated to elevated temperatures showed
   significantly longer lifespans in the subsequent heat stress than did
   those acclimated at ambient temperature. The ability to acclimate to
   elevated temperatures differed significantly among coral genets,
   yielding low, but significant, estimates of broad-sense heritability. A
   subsequent experiment revealed no changes in either bacterial or
   dinoflagellate communities of symbionts as a result of acclimation,
   suggesting that symbiont shuffling did not account for the differences
   in lifespan between treatments. While estimates of heritability were
   low, the results suggest that plasticity in upper thermal tolerance
   significantly differs among coral genets, and that acclimation is likely
   a result of alterations in gene expression as opposed to symbiont
   shuffling.},

Abstract = {Dungeness crabs Cancer magister support the largest fishery in Oregon
   (USA), which inputs millions of pounds of bait into the coastal ocean
   every year. We assessed evidence for seasonal consumption of commercial
   Dungeness crab fishery bait off the Oregon coast by that target species
   through delta 13C and delta 15N stable isotope and gut content analysis.
   Using Dungeness crab samples collected on the Oregon inner to
   mid-continental shelf, variation in delta 13C and delta 15N values were
   assessed according to sex, size class, region, and season using nested
   ANOVA, Euclidean vector statistics, and Bayesian standard ellipse areas
   corrected for sample size (SEAc) in R. The isotopic signatures of
   sampled crabs showed statistically significant variation by sex, region,
   and season; the differences in the isotopic niches of large male versus
   female crabs (carapace width >= 159 mm) were especially pronounced.
   delta 15N in female crabs peaked in spring and declined toward fall with
   similar mean delta 13C, which could be indicative of higher trophic
   level bait consumption in the winter when the fishery is the most
   active, while delta 13C varied seasonally in males with similar mean
   delta 15N. The approximated trophic niches (based on SEAc) of both male
   and female crabs were greatest in fall, suggesting broader foraging in
   the absence of bait inputs. This work provides a step towards
   understanding the ecological role of fishery activities on one of the
   most economically valuable species on the US west coast.},

Title = {Changes in fish assemblages after marine heatwave events in West Hawai'i
   Island},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},
Pages = {95-109},

Abstract = {Marine heatwaves are prolonged events of anomalously warm water that
   affect diverse marine habitats and their associated biota. Evidence
   shows that anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and
   duration of marine heatwaves and that coral reef systems are sensitive
   to the thermal stress imposed by these heatwaves. In this study, we
   examined fish community response to consecutive marine heatwaves
   (2014-2015) by analyzing changes in fish assemblages in Hawai'i over 11
   yr (2009-2019). Subtidal video survey data were collected in 3 areas on
   the west side of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Fish were counted and
   identified to species or genus, then assigned to one of 7 functional
   groups: predators, secondary consumers, planktivores, corallivores,
   scrapers, grazers or browsers. Our study revealed 4 key findings. We
   show that all fish assemblages changed significantly in each area after
   the marine heatwaves. Across all 3 areas, the 3 most abundant functional
   groups (planktivores, grazers and secondary consumers) drove the
   observed changes in the community. Following the marine heatwaves, fish
   abundance increased in 2 areas with fewer fishing regulations. In the
   most protected area, fish abundance remained high and diversity indices
   were significantly higher post-marine heatwaves. Our results support the
   hypothesis that marine heatwaves can cause shifts in fish assemblages
   and that the precise nature of these shifts can vary over relatively
   short spatial scales that may coincide with scales of management.},

Title = {Monitoring the reproductive status of resident and migrant Atlantic
   bluefin tuna in the Strait of Gibraltar},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},

Abstract = {Two distinct contingents of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT), migrants and
   residents, occur in the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG). Long-term residents
   are commercially exploited all year round using hook and line gears,
   whereas migrants are caught by traps in springtime as they pass through
   the SoG towards Mediterranean spawning grounds. While reproductive
   features of migrants have been widely studied, the life history of
   residents remains poorly investigated. The relative contribution of this
   subpopulation to ABFT eastern stock productivity is therefore unknown.
   Reproductive traits of resident ABFT were monitored throughout the year,
   and were compared with those of migrants crossing the SoG in spring. To
   assess maturation timing, gonads were classified into maturation stages
   based on histological features. Our results indicate biometric and
   reproductive differences between SoG residents and migrants. ABFT caught
   by hook and line gears were smaller on average than those collected from
   traps. The females sampled from the hook and line fishery in May and
   early June showed, on average, significantly lower GSI values than those
   caught by trap. In contrast, the GSI values of males sampled in May were
   not significantly different between gears. Histological analyses showed
   a more advanced reproductive condition in trap-caught migrants. Delayed
   maturation schedules of residents in comparison to migrants would result
   in less egg production and poorer larval survival rates. The present
   findings encourage further investigation of reproductive schedules in
   unstudied subpopulations for a better understanding of ABFT dynamics.},

Title = {Tidal water exchange drives fish and crustacean abundances in salt
   marshes},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},

Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Coastal salt marshes provide important habitat for fishes and
   crustaceans, including species of commercial value that feed or take
   refuge in the marsh. Yet population abundances vary considerably between
   sites, often without clear explanation. We hypothesised that faunal
   abundance and mean size would be positively related to 2 physical
   properties that govern marsh accessibility to water-dependent species,
   as has been found on the southeastern coast of the USA: (1) the volume
   of water exchanged by tidal flooding, which gives access to the marsh,
   and (2) edge amount, the length of the water-vegetation borderline per
   unit area where species can take refuge and feed. Digital terrain models
   and tidal information were used to select 5 marshes in Wales, UK, that
   differed in edge amount and water exchange (52 degrees N, 4 degrees W).
   Fishes and crustaceans were sampled using baited traps, fyke nets and
   seine nets. In total, 15 species were caught, including commercially
   valuable brown shrimp, European eel and sea bass. We found water
   exchange volume, but not edge amount, boosted fish and crustacean
   abundances. Crab and sea bass sizes were both negatively affected by
   water exchange, while shrimp and fish sizes were unaffected. Our
   findings show how the mechanisms that drive fish and crustacean
   abundances and sizes vary between geographical regions. Feasibly,
   fisheries associations with marsh hydro-geomorphology might operate
   differently as well.},

Title = {Responses of nitrification and denitrification in the rhizosphere of
   mudflat paddy to rice genotype and nitrogen fertilization},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Nitrification and denitrification are important processes in the
   biogeochemical cycle in agricultural soils and are influenced by plant
   genotype and nitrogen (N) fertilization. However, few studies have
   evaluated the effects of genotype on nitrification and denitrification
   in the rhizosphere of rice cultivated in mudflats and their response to
   N fertilization. In this study, we determined the net nitrification and
   denitrification rates, quantified the abundance of functional genes
   involved in nitrification and denitrification, and characterized
   bacterial com-munities in the rhizosphere of two rice varieties
   (japonica and hybrid rice) cultivated in mudflat soil with three N
   fertilization levels. Results showed that net nitrification rates were
   strongly influenced by genotype and was higher in the rhizosphere of
   hybrid rice than in that of japonica rice, which might be related to the
   N absorption strategy of rice, while net denitrification rates were
   mainly affected by N fertilization. Unlike hybrid rice, the net
   nitrification rate in the rhizosphere of japonica rice was strongly
   influenced by N fertilization and positively correlated to N
   fertilization levels. In contrast, the net denitrification rate of
   hybrid rice was strongly influenced by N fertilization and positively
   correlated to N fertilization levels, while N fertilization had no
   significant effect on the net denitrification rate of japonica rice.
   Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were the main drivers of nitrification in the
   rhizosphere, and denitrification in the rhizosphere of hybrid rice was
   mainly driven by narG-, nirS-, and norB-type denitrifiers. Furthermore,
   differences in the assemblages of bacteria associated with the relative
   abundance of these functional genes provided insight into genotypic
   differences in nitrification and denitrifi-cation responses to N
   fertilization. Overall, this study provides insight into the underlying
   mechanisms of nitrification and denitrification influenced by rice
   genotypes and N fertilization in the rhizospheres of japonica and hybrid
   rice.},

Title = {Biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi stimulate rice root growth
   strategy and soil nutrient availability},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The application of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is of
   great significance in improving soil properties and plant growth. In
   this study, a pot experiment of rice (Oryza sativa L) was conducted to
   evaluate the effects of biochar derived from rice husk (HBC) and wood
   (WBC) combined with AMF (Rhizophagus irregularis) on soil nutrient
   availability and rice root traits. The results showed that the presence
   of AMF significantly increased soil pH and microbial biomass carbon
   content, and also significantly increased nutrient accumulation in
   plants (except shoot N content) in the absence of biochar. Both biochar
   significantly increased mycorrhizal colonization, with greater effects
   from HBC than WBC. The correlation analysis showed that mycorrhizal
   colonization rate had a significant positive correlation with soil
   nutrient availability (P and K) and microbial biomass carbon and
   nitrogen. Compared with the application of biochar and AMF alone, the
   combination of biochar and AMF led to significant increases in soil
   NO3--N content, available K content, and total P content, while
   significantly decreased in NH4+-N content. The positive effects of
   biochar and AMF together on plant nutrient uptake and root growth were
   more than when either biochar or AMF was present. The increase of plant
   nutrient accumulation was driven by the increase of mycorrhizal
   colonization and the improvement of root structure guided by the change
   of soil nutrient availability by biochar and AMF. Overall, this study
   indicated that the biochar combined with AMF improved the soil nutrient
   availability and root growth strategy, and then promoted the nutrient
   absorption capacity of rice.},

Title = {Deciphering environmental factors driving soil microbial elevational
   distribution in the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has been ranked as one of the main
   hotspots of biodiversity. Many studies on microbial diversity and
   structure have been investigated in QTP, whereas the joint impacts of
   environmental properties and geographic distance that influence
   microbial communities along altitudinal gradient is yet poorly
   understood. In this paper, we investigated sites along the elevational
   gradient of 3270-4530 m on the southeast QTP in China, characterizing
   environmental properties, and systematically examined the composition,
   diversity patterns and the driving factors of soil microbial community
   structures. Elevation led to distinct changes in environmental
   properties. Bacterial alpha-diversity did not differ significantly among
   elevations, whereas fungal alpha-diversity showed a decrease pattern,
   which could be attributed to changes in temperature, soil moisture, pH
   and total carbon content. The dominant bacterial and fungal phyla were
   Actinobacteria (30.4\%), Proteobacteria (24.1\%) and Acidobacteria
   (14.7\%), and Ascomycota (52.3\%), Basidiomycota (32.6\%) and
   Mortierellomycota (13.9\%), respectively. Notable distance-decay of
   microbial community was observed across environmental factors and
   geographic distance. Partial Mantel tests indicated that differences in
   bacterial community were driven by the joint impacts of environmental
   factors and geographic distance, while differences in fungal community
   were primarily driven by a sole impact of environmental factors. The
   multiple regression on matrices (MRM) model explained 79\% of the
   variability in bacterial community similarity, with pH being the most
   important variables, followed by soil moisture, elevation, AK content
   and geographic distance. The proportion of variance explained by MRM
   model was 55\%, with elevation and TN content being the main variables
   altering the soil fungal structure. In summary, our findings suggested
   that alpha-diversity patterns, and the driving factors of the bacterial
   and fungal community structure were different, and environmental factors
   and geographic distance played different roles on the bacterial and
   fungal community structures.},

Abstract = {Pollinator species have seen recent declines in abundance, generating
   conservation concern as well as alarm about the ecosystem services they
   provide. A common approach to alleviate pollinator decline is through
   habitat management, including restoration of degraded habitats and
   removal of invasive species, but apparent habitat improvement does not
   necessarily mean an improvement in pollinator abundance and diversity.
   We collected pollinators in colored pan traps at three sites at the
   Lacamas Prairie Natural Area, Washington: remnant wet prairie, restored
   wet prairie, and an area invaded by reed canary grass (Phalaris
   arundinacea). We used model selection to assess whether site and trap
   color explained variation in pollinator abundance, richness, and
   diversity. Pollinator abundance was similar at the native and restored
   sites with predicted averages of 9.06 (7.15, 11.48) and 9.51 (7.52,
   12.03), respectively while a heavily invaded reed canary grass site had
   a significantly lower predicted mean of 7.26 (5.69, 9.26). Site was not
   included in the top model for species richness or diversity. All three
   measures varied with trap color. Habitat restoration and invasive
   species control at Lacamas Prairie appear to have benefited local
   pollinator populations, but evidence for differences in pollinator
   richness and diversity was weak. Further work, both characterizing the
   response of pollinator communities to wet prairie restoration and
   optimizing trap colors for monitoring in this area, is warranted.},

Abstract = {Within some developing countries, wetlands have long been regarded as
   dumping grounds. However, there has been a gradual paradigm shift in
   societal attitudes towards recognising their importance as landscape
   features that provide benefits for humans and wildlife. Unfortunately,
   construction activities have continually plagued their existence.
   Therefore, this present research examines the risks factors associated
   with construction projects in wetlands ecosystem, using Ghana as a case
   study. A quantitative research strategy leaning towards the positivist
   paradigm was adopted. A structured survey was developed to collect data
   from key stakeholders. Purposive sampling was employed to recruit
   construction experts in the Kumasi Metropolis, with a total of 78
   experts agreeing to participate. Relative Importance Index (RII), Mean
   Score Ranking and a One-Sample T-Test were used to analyse primary data
   collected. The findings revealed that the key driving forces spurring
   construction projects in wetlands were rapid urbanisation; high rate of
   migration; and scarcity of land for development. Critical risks factors
   associated with construction projects in wetlands were identified as
   cost overruns; exploitation of biological resources; and water
   pollution. Finally, the findings also showed that the most critical
   detrimental effects of construction projects in wetlands were the
   destruction of aquatic and terrestrial lives; loss of flood control
   capability; and deterioration of wetland water quality. The study
   recommends the protection and conservation of wetlands environments
   through systematized enactment and enforcement of environmental
   protection regulations by government and non-governmental institutions.
   This would ensure the preservation of important biodiversity and aid
   with pollution control and flood protection.},

Abstract = {Nonsessile animals could partition the use of resources in different
   axes, reducing the effects of competition and allowing coexistence.
   Here, we investigated the spatial and trophic niche dimensions in four
   lizard assemblages in the Neotropical semiarid Caatinga to investigate
   the determinants of resource use and the extent to which lizards
   partition their niches. We sampled each lizard assemblage once, for 10
   days, in the dry season of 2017 and 2018. In two lizard assemblages, we
   detected nonrandom niche overlap patterns that were higher or lower than
   expected by chance. The high niche overlap patterns suggest that either
   there is intense current competition for available microhabitats or an
   abundance of microhabitats. The lower niche overlap may be influenced by
   the presence of species adapted to sandy habitats (psammophilous),
   suggesting that spatial partitioning detected has historical basis,
   which is supported by the pPCA results and by the lack of patterns in
   the realized niche distribution of species across niche space. We
   detected trophic niche partitioning in three lizard assemblages. In one
   assemblage, we discovered random spatial and trophic niche overlap
   patterns, revealing that competition is not a determining factor in the
   structure of that assemblage. In fact, phylogenetic effects were
   predominantly the main determinants of resource use in the four studied
   lizard assemblages. Arid and semiarid habitats cover about one third of
   land surface of the world. Comparisons between our findings and those
   from other regions of the world may aid identify general trends in the
   lizard ecology of dry environments.},

Abstract = {Insect herbivores have the potential to consume large amounts of plant
   tissue in tropical forests, but insectivorous vertebrates effectively
   control their abundances, indirectly increasing plant fitness
   accordingly. Despite several studies already sought understanding of the
   top-down effects on arthropod community structure and herbivory, such
   studies of trophic cascades in old tropics are underrepresented, and
   little attention was paid to top-down forces in various habitats.
   Therefore, we examine how flying insectivorous vertebrates (birds and
   bats) impact arthropods and, consequently, affect herbivore damage of
   leaves in forest habitats in Papua New Guinea. In a 3-month long
   predator exclosure experiment conducted at four study sites across
   varying elevation and successional stage, we found that vertebrate
   predators reduced arthropod density by similar to 52\%. In addition,
   vertebrate predators decreased the mean body size of arthropods by 26\%
   in leaf chewers and 47\% in non-herbivorous arthropods but had only a
   small effect on mesopredators and sap suckers. Overall, the exclusion of
   vertebrate predators resulted in a similar to 41\% increase in leaf
   damage. Our results, across different types of tropical forests in Papua
   New Guinea, demonstrate that flying vertebrate insectivores have a
   crucial impact on plant biomass, create a selective pressure on larger
   and non-predatory prey individuals and they prey partition with
   mesopredators.},

Abstract = {Aims Dioecious plants present sexual dimorphism, but how the root traits
   and nutrient uptake of female and male plants in dioecious species
   response to the sexual identity change of the neighbor plants are poorly
   understood. Methods Mulberry (Morus alba L.), a dioecious plant widely
   distributed in China, was employed in our study. Male and female plants
   were grown with neighbors of the same and opposite sex for 3 months. At
   harvest, the root anatomy, root morphology, nutrient concentrations and
   biomass accumulation were measured. Important Findings When grown with
   the opposite sex, the males showed decreases in root xylem size, biomass
   of root and stem and increases in root N, P and K concentrations
   compared with grown with the same sex. By contrast, females showed
   significant increases in xylem size, fine root system (e.g. fine root
   length, root surface area and root volume), root carbon isotope
   composition (delta C-13) and root N, P and K concentrations. The changes
   in the delta C-13 and N, P and K concentrations in male and female
   plants were associated with the changes of root traits. These results
   demonstrated that the sexual identity of the neighboring plants affected
   root anatomy and morphology of female and male mulberry plants.
   Meanwhile, the responses of female and male plants to the sex change of
   the neighboring plants showed sexual dimorphism, which influenced
   water-use efficiency and resource acquisition. These findings are
   important for understanding the population dynamics of other dioecious
   species in forestry and natural systems.},

Title = {Long-Term Effects of Cattle Ranching on Soil Nitrogen and Phosphorus

Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},

Abstract = {We used ranch records and soil analyses to investigate the effects of
   cattle ranching on phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) balances in a humid,
   tallgrass savanna ecosystem in Tanzania. Over a 41-yr period between
   1958 and 1999, the ranch supported an average of 10 435 cattle. These
   consumed an estimated 571 586 tons (t) of dry matter containing 692 t P
   and 6 230 t N. Of these nutrients, 162 t of P (23\%) and 602 t of N
   (9.7\%) were exported in animals leaving the ranch, while 222 t (32 \%)
   P and 2 364 t of N (38 \%) were transferred as excreta to the night
   corrals. The measured excesses of nutrients in the soil of the corrals
   were equivalent to 59\% of all P and 19\% of all N deposited in these
   areas over 41 yr. Total losses from the pastures amounted to 10.2\% of P
   and 6.6\% of N in the top 20 cm of tall grass savanna soil. These
   losses, especially of P, probably reduced the nutritional quality of the
   pastures and may have contributed to the reported decline in animal
   fertility. In addition, they may have promoted the spread of secondary
   woodland dominated by Vachellia (formerly Acacia) zanzibarica. Three
   general conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, humid tallgrass
   savannas on nutrient-poor soils are unsuitable for intensive livestock
   production. Second, over an extended period the loss of nutrients from
   cattle pastures can be ecologically significant. Ensuring the
   sustainability of grazing systems requires measures to counteract this
   loss, such as the use of shifting night corrals. Third, ranch records,
   while lacking the precision and detail possible in experimental studies,
   can provide valuable insights into long-term effects of ranching that
   would be difficult to obtain by other means. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Interspecific differences in the response of coral trophic status to the
   decrease in symbiotic zooxanthellae in summer},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {73-87},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency and severity
   worldwide. From the perspective of energy supply, a decrease in
   symbiotic zooxanthellae density (ZD) during bleaching leads to a
   reduction in the amount of energy provided by photosynthesis to the
   coral host. However, there are still many unknowns about how corals
   maintain the stability of their energy supply when zooxanthellae
   decrease. In this study, 89 coral samples, including the relatively
   stress-tolerant massive Favia palauensis and Porites lutea and the
   relatively vulnerable branching Acropora millepora and Pocillopora
   damicornis, were collected from the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea
   in spring and summer 2020. The physiological parameters ZD, chl a,
   tissue biomass and lipid content were measured. The delta C-13
   compositions of zooxanthellae and hosts were analyzed to explore the
   changes in trophic status in summer. Results show that the ZDs of A.
   millepora, P. damicornis, F. palauensis and P. lutea significantly
   decreased by 32, 29, 22 and 22\%, respectively, in summer. P. lutea and
   F. palauensis maintained metabolic energy requirements depending largely
   on heterotrophy. A. millepora and P. damicornis were more dependent on
   consuming their own lipids. Our study shows that there are intergeneric
   differences in the energy maintenance mechanisms used to cope with
   decreases in ZD. We suggest that the higher heterotrophic ability of F.
   palauensis and P. lutea renders their trophic status more plastic than
   that of A. millepora and P. damicornis. This characteristic may
   potentially affect their bleaching resilience.},

Title = {Community-level spatiotemporal synchrony: new metric and application to

Abstract = {Synchrony is a multifaceted biological phenomenon exhibited at various
   levels of organization. Here, we introduce the concept of structural
   synchrony, defined as the coherence of structural variations in
   multispecies assemblages occurring at a certain spatiotemporal scale,
   and propose a direct measure of this type of synchrony. This approach
   was first tested on numeric simulations imitating various types of model
   community dynamics and then applied to a large data set on White Sea
   intertidal harpacticoids, covering a wide range of spatial (decimeters
   to 140 m) and temporal (days to 25 yr) scales. Scale-specific analysis
   revealed distinct patterns and allowed us to draw inferences about
   processes that drive community dynamics. Short-term (up to 1 mo) changes
   occurred independently or even anti-synchronically, possibly due to
   trophic-driven migrations. On a seasonal scale, a high degree of
   within-habitat synchrony occurred at time intervals of 2-3 mo or longer
   but dropped with increasing spatial distance; this pattern is most
   likely caused by seasonal reproductive dynamics of populations. At the
   interannual scale, external exposure, i.e. long-term changes in sediment
   composition, appeared to be the strongest synchronizing force for the
   harpacticoid community, while this factor was locally active and became
   most apparent at the within-habitat scale. We evaluate the advantages
   and limitations of our framework, highlighting its broad domain of
   application and anticipating potential extensions. We encourage
   ecologists to integrate structural synchrony analysis into their toolbox
   to quantitatively evaluate spatiotemporal community dynamics and to link
   these dynamics with underlying processes.},

Title = {Effects of hypoxia and acidification on Calanus pacificus: behavioral
   changes in response to stressful environments},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},

Abstract = {Copepods, which play major roles in marine food webs and biogeochemical
   cycling, frequently undergo diel vertical migration (DVM), swimming
   downwards during the day to avoid visual predation and upwards at night
   to feed. Natural water columns that are stratified with chemical
   stressors at depth, such as hypoxia and acidification, are increasing
   with climate change. Understanding behavioral responses of copepods to
   these stresses-in particular, whether copepods alter their natural
   migration-is important to anticipating impacts of climate change on
   marine ecosystems. We conducted laboratory experiments using stratified
   water columns to measure the effects of bottom water hypoxia and pH on
   mortality, distribution, and swimming behaviors of the calanoid copepod
   Calanus pacificus. When exposed to hypoxic (0.65 mg O2 l-1) bottom
   waters, the height of C. pacificus from the bottom increased 20\% within
   hypoxic columns, and swimming speed decreased 46\% at the bottom of
   hypoxic columns and increased 12\% above hypoxic waters. When exposed to
   low pH (7.48) bottom waters, swimming speeds decreased by 8 and 9\% at
   the base of the tanks and above acidic waters, respectively.
   Additionally, we found a 118\% increase in `moribund' (immobile on the
   bottom) copepods when exposed to hypoxic, but not acidic, bottom waters.
   Some swimming statistics differed between copepods collected from sites
   with versus without historical hypoxia and acidity. Observed responses
   suggest potential mechanisms underlying in situ changes in copepod
   population distributions when exposed to chemical stressors at depth.},

Abstract = {Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis, POPR) is a dominant invader of the
   northern Great Plains, but little is known about its impact on
   seedbanks. We quantified patterns of seedling emergence from samples of
   litter, thatch, and mineral soil collected from invaded grassland sites,
   hypothesizing that POPR would be the dominant emergent species, but that
   composition of seedling populations would differ between the layers with
   a higher incidence of native species in mineral soil. POPR accounted for
   84\% of the emergent seedlings, and curves, fit with a Hill model,
   indicated that 50\% of cumulative emergence was reached after 40.5 d.
   Rank-abundance diagrams were highly skewed and strongly dominated by
   POPR but indicated differences among litter, thatch, and soil layers.
   POPR accounted for 94.3\%, 71.9\%, and 69.9\% of emergent seedlings from
   litter, thatch, and soil layers, respectively. More POPR seedlings
   emerged from litter material than the other layers. Management of POPR
   by fire or grazing should consider their possible effects on seed
   production, distribution, and longevity of buried seeds. Published by

Abstract = {Usable space for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) has been
   reduced across South Texas rangelands because of the spread of
   non-native, invasive grasses. A native grass, tanglehead (Heteropogon
   contortus), has also rapidly expanded its dominance in South Texas
   within the past 25 yr. It has formed high-density monocultures, similar
   to non-native grasses, which are associated with losses of herbaceous
   diversity and bare ground, both key components of bobwhite habitat. The
   objectives of our research were to 1) determine selection-avoidance of
   invasive grass cover by bobwhites and 2) determine effects of invasive
   grass cover on vegetation characteristics. We hypothesized the effects
   of tanglehead on bobwhite would be negative and similar to the effect of
   non-native grasses in the region.
   We recorded covey locations via helicopter surveys in December 2014 and
   2015, with field measurements of bobwhite habitat at covey and random
   locations taken each spring. We measured grass and forb species
   richness, herbaceous vegetation height, woody-plant cover, tanglehead
   canopy cover, and non-native grass canopy cover at all covey detections
   and an equal number of random locations. We developed continuous
   selection ratios using Simple Saddlepoint Approximations to determine
   habitat selection by bobwhites. We also used quantile regression, at the
   10th, 50th, and 90th quantiles, to determine relationships between
   invasive grass cover and vegetation factors. Bobwhites avoided areas of
   high canopy cover (> 20\%) of all invasive grasses measured. We found
   negative relationships between native and non-native invasive grass
   cover and forb and grass species richness, as well as bare ground, and a
   positive relationship with herbaceous vegetation height at all quantiles
   modeled. Our results demonstrate the negative effects of increased
   tanglehead cover on native rangeland habitats, which aligns with similar
   non-native invasive grasses. Further expansion by tanglehead has the
   potential to significantly reduce usable space for bobwhites in South
   Texas. (C) 2022 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The spatial distributions and associations of plant species in a stand
   can provide essential information about their dynamics. However, since
   tree spatial distribution and association depend on factors that operate
   at different scales, disentangling the effects of environmental
   heterogeneity and plant-plant interactions requires the choice of a
   suitable null model for spatial analysis. We analyzed the spatial
   distributions of the same savanna palm tree populations that were
   studied, the underlying hypothesis being that these distributions have
   changed in 20 years. To remove the effect of large-scale environmental
   heterogeneity, the inhomogeneous L-function under the heterogeneous
   Poisson null model was used. We showed: (i) unlike 20 years ago, adults
   had a regular distribution instead of an aggregated distribution in the
   grass savanna; (ii) although the spatial distribution of seedlings and
   juveniles was always aggregated, we observed a decrease in the size of
   the aggregates (intensities); (iii) except for juveniles, no other
   stages were associated with nutrient-rich patches, which was also
   different 20 years ago; (iv) we did not observe any particular
   difference in structure between two study sites, only that female palm
   trees were spatially associated with entire-leafed seedlings in the
   reserve while they were spatially independent in the rural area. Our
   study supports the hypothesis that the spatial distributions have
   partially changed, and that the management of spatial heterogeneity has
   improved and given more precision in the results.},

Abstract = {Rangelands used for cattle grazing in Florida are typically managed
   under prescribed fire to increase forage production and nutritive value
   while preventing shrub encroachment. Sustainability of extensively
   managed, low-input native rangelands is highly dependent on nutrient
   cycling through plant litter decomposition, which is often constrained
   by limited N availability. We evaluated the effect of prescribed fire
   (Unburned vs. Burned), N addition (0 vs. 180 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and
   species composition (Palmetto {[}Serenoa repens Bartr.] {[}100\%
   saw-palmetto], Palmetto-Grass {[}50-50\% mixture of saw-palmetto and
   grasses], and Grass {[}chalky bluestem, Andropogon capillipes Nash.;
   lopsided indiangrass, Sorghastrum secundum \{Elliott\} Nash]) on
   aboveground plant litter decomposition and N and P mineralization using
   field incubated litterbags over 224 d in a split-split plot design with
   three replicates. Litter disappearance followed a single exponential
   decay model (P <= 0.01) and was mainly driven by plant litter chemical
   characteristics. At the end of the 224-d incubation, remaining plant
   litter was less in Palmetto (62\%) compared with other treatments
   (similar to 72\%), possibly due to more favorable chemical
   characteristics associated with Palmetto treatment (43, 65, and 112 C:N
   ratio; and 15, 20, and 25 lignin:N ratio for Palmetto, Palmetto-Grass,
   and Grass, respectively). Remaining N was less (greater N
   mineralization) in Palmetto (79\%) compared with Palmetto-Grass
   treatment (92\%) but was not different from Grass (P >= 0.12, 86\%
   remaining N). Greater lignin and proportion of N bound to fiber observed
   at the end of incubation suggested increased C and N recalcitrance as a
   result of decomposition. Nutrient inputs through ash or N addition
   suppressed litter net P and N mineralization. These results suggest
   litter quality, particularly N concentration and C:N and lignin:N
   ratios, are the main drivers in nutrient cycling through plant litter
   decomposition in Florida rangelands. (C) 2022 The Society for Range

Title = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi protect a subtropical tree species exposed

Abstract = {Acid rain (AR), which occurs frequently in southern China, negatively
   affects the growth of subtropical tree species. Arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) mitigate the detrimental effects induced by AR. However, the
   mechanisms by which AMF protect Zelkova serrata, an economically
   important tree species in southern China, from AR stress remain unclear.
   We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which Z. serrata plants were
   inoculated with AMF species Rhizophagus intraradices and Diversispora
   versiformis, either alone or as a mixed culture, or with a sterilized
   inoculum (negative control). The plants were subjected to three levels
   of simulated sulfuric AR and nitric AR (pH 2.5, 4.0 and 5.6) to examine
   any interactive effects on growth, photosynthetic capabilities,
   antioxidant enzymes, osmotic adjustment and soil enzymes. AR
   significantly decreased dry weight, chlorophyll content, net
   photosynthetic rate and soluble protein (SP) of non-mycorrhizal plants.
   Mycorrhizal inoculation, especially a combination of R. intraradices and
   D. versiformis, notably improved dry weight, photosynthetic
   capabilities, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, SP and root
   acid phosphatase activity of Z. serrata under harsh AR stress. Moreover,
   the benefits from AMF symbionts depended on the identity of AM fungal
   species and the gradient of AR stress. Our results indicate that AM
   fungi protect Z. serrata against AR stress by synchronously activating
   photosynthetic ability, antioxidant enzymes and osmolyte accumulation.
   These findings suggest that a combination of R. intraradices and D.
   versiformis may be a preferable choice for culturing Z. serrata in
   southern China.},

Abstract = {In the early 1990's, reserves adjacent to Kruger National Park (KNP)
   removed their fences to create a continuous landscape within the Kruger
   to Canyons Biosphere Reserve. Understanding how these interconnected
   multi-management systems responded to changes in environmental factors
   and management regimes can help to maintain natural large-scale
   landscape heterogeneity and ecological resilience. Our objective was to
   analyze remote sensing-derived vegetation metric changes between the
   different management types pre- and post-fence removal. The study area
   included fourteen reserves and the central section of KNP. We calculated
   the residuals between TIMESAT-derived metrics (from AVHRR NDVI time
   series) and rainfall to analyze changes in vegetation from 1985 to 2006.
   We then compared vegetation-rainfall residuals between different
   management types pre- and post-fence removal using mean-variance plots,
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots, and permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance to statistically identify and analyze changes. All
   management types experienced increased greenness. Reserves that removed
   their fences had greater changes in vegetation post-fence removal
   compared to reserves that remained fenced and KNP. Our findings suggest
   managers may need to address landscape changes by implementing
   management regimes such as reducing artificial surface water to
   counterbalance increased grazing pressure as a result of increased
   animal mobility across artificially created resource gradients. Habitat
   connectivity within and between protected area networks can be achieved
   by removing fences across adjacent conservation areas thus potentially
   increasing ecological resilience, which is vital to effective long-term
   conservation.},

Abstract = {The numbers of deep-sea fish species and their genetic diversities are
   poorly understood because of taxonomic confusion and the lack of robust
   diagnostic features. However, DNA barcoding using mitochondrial DNA
   sequences may offer an effective approach to identifying cryptic species
   and characterizing their genetic diversities. To validate the genetic
   differentiation identified by DNA mitochondrial barcoding, it is
   necessary to show that these reflect variations present in nuclear
   genomic markers. Here, we performed DNA barcoding using cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and also carried out multiplexed
   intersimple sequence repeat genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) for
   mesopelagic and demersal fish species from the continental shelf and
   upper slope of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. We obtained the COI
   sequences of 115 species from 48 families; the species were identified
   using the Barcode of Life Data System. Phylogenetic analyses using COI
   sequences showed high levels of intraspecific genetic differentiation
   (Kimura 2-parameter distances >2\%) in 20 of 115 species, suggesting
   many cryptic species or intraspecific genetic differentiation previously
   unknown in these species. We performed phylogenetic and population
   genetic analyses using multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism loci
   obtained by MIG-seq of 3 species that showed high levels of
   intraspecific genetic differentiation in COI sequences. The nuclear
   markers confirmed the genetic differentiation in all 3 species
   identified by the COI sequences. The high concordance between these
   different genetic markers indicates the effectiveness of DNA barcoding
   for identifying cryptic deep-sea species and characterizing genetic
   differentiation in these species.},

Title = {Variation in the behavioral tolerance of congeneric marine snails to
   low-pH exposure},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},
Pages = {57-66},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {The ocean is acidifying, with multiple consequences for coastal
   organisms. However, species may differ in their sensitivities. Some taxa
   may find future conditions mildly stressful or even advantageous, while
   others will persist only through acclimatization or genetic adaptation.
   An open question is whether such variation in the sensitivity of species
   to ocean acidification relates to their evolutionary histories of
   exposure to reduced pH. Here, we explored this unknown through an
   investigation of differences in pH tolerance of 2 shoreline gastropods,
   the black turban snail Tegula funebralis and its congener, the brown
   turban snail T. brunnea. These species occupy distinct vertical
   distributions on rocky shores, each subject to different extremes in low
   pH. We assayed the extent to which low pH degrades the flight behavior
   of each species in response to the predatory sea star Pisaster
   ochraceus. Across a range of pH, the tidepool-inhabiting T. funebralis
   exhibited less behavioral disruption than T. brunnea at any given pH
   value but also experienced impairment at a pH characteristic of the
   present-day minimum in its habitat (7.1 pH). The latter pattern suggests
   T. funebralis operates near what may be a fixed tolerance limit to low
   pH. T. funebralis also exhibited hints of elevated intraspecific
   variation in its behaviors, which could imply scope for selection to
   act. Deeper-dwelling T. brunnea, in contrast, showed little sensitivity
   to present-day pH minima found where it lives (7.6 pH) and displayed
   less variation upon which selection might operate. These results provide
   a initial framework for investigations into the capacity of species of
   differing evolutionary histories to cope with future ocean
   acidification.},

Title = {No-till adoption by corn and soybean producers: An examination of tenure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Number = {5},
Pages = {482-492},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of no-till can be explained by the range of
   on-farm ben-efits, including soil erosion control, soil moisture
   conservation, and reduced operating costs (e.g., labor, fuel, and
   tillage machinery). When used continuously as part of a suite of
   practices that minimize soil disturbance and maintain soil cover, there
   is evidence that no-till can help improve soil health. Therefore, there
   is continued interest in understanding the factors that affect no-till
   adoption, on a national scale, as they may contribute to improved
   conserva-tion program design. This article uses logit analysis of
   field-level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey to
   identify factors that affect no-till adoption for corn (Zea mays L.) and
   soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) producers. Our results show effects
   of climate, farm size, irrigation use, crop rotation, and drainage (in
   corn fields) on no-till adoption that are generally consistent with the
   literature but do suggest some significant differences in determinants
   of no-till between corn and soybeans. Results also show that renters are
   more likely to use no-till in soybeans than in corn and that the
   estimated probability is much larger for share renters that for cash
   renters. The latter tenure effect differs from previous research and
   could have important implications for program design given there are
   more than twice as many cash renters as share renters in the United
   States.},

Title = {Using targeted messages to improve farmer engagement in conservation

Volume = {77},

Pages = {546-551},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {In this time of information overload, successfully engaging farmers with
   compelling outreach materials is a major challenge for conservation
   programs and related research projects. One potential approach is
   targeting information to the recipient, e.g., local rather than regional
   soil and water conditions, when sending messages to farmers. Targeted
   information may increase engagement by making materials stand out as
   more relevant and useful; conversely, it may decrease engagement by
   making farmers wary of the program and how it is using the information.
   We tested the effect of targeted information on farmer engagement using
   a large, randomized controlled trial in Iowa. In partnership with Iowa
   State University, we sent 2,996 farmers a single mailing with
   information about erosion at the local watershed (targeted) or state
   (control) level and measured their responses to a two-minute survey. We
   found that targeted information increased relative response rates by
   20\%, from 13.8\% to 16.4\%. This level of increase is meaningful for
   practitioners, as well as statistically significant. Our findings show
   that targeted information can be an important tool for practitioners and
   researchers seeking to better connect with farmers who are inundated
   with marketing mail.},

Title = {Nitrogen addition overrides the effects of Stellera chamaejasme litter
   on the growth of Leymus chinensis and its associated mycorrhizal fungi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1007-1020},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Rapid spread and growth of plants that are poisonous to animals produce
   large amounts of plant litter in degraded grasslands. Nitrogen (N) input
   may promote the growth of these poisonous plants and alter the
   rhizosphere microbes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in
   particular. However, it is unclear how poisonous plant litter affects
   the growth of palatable plants and their associated AMF in the
   rhizosphere and whether and how N deposition may mediate these effects.
   A greenhouse experiment was performed to test the combined effects of
   litter addition of a poisonous plant, Stellera chamaejasme, and N
   addition on the growth of a dominant grass, Leymus chinensis, AMF
   characteristics and soil properties. Litter addition significantly
   increased the ramet number and aboveground biomass of L. chinensis and
   soil available phosphorus (AP) concentration and decreased the spore
   density of AMF. However, the interaction of both treatments had no
   significant effects on traits of L. chinensis and AMF properties.
   Stellera chamaejasme litter positively affected L. chinensis by
   increasing AP and negatively affected AMF by combining balanced changes
   in soil nutrients and litter-induced allelopathic compositions. High N
   addition may alleviate soil N limitation and inhibit litter
   decomposition, thus overriding the litter's effects on L. chinensis and
   AMF. These findings imply that it is necessary to objectively and
   comprehensively evaluate the ecological functions of poisonous plants
   beyond their harmful effects on livestock. Simultaneously, N deposition
   should be an indispensable factor in predicting the relationships
   between poisonous plants and edible plants in degraded grasslands.},

Abstract = {Clonal integration benefits clonal plants by buffering environmental
   stress and increasing resource extraction efficiency. However, the
   number of connected ramet generations that benefit from clonal
   integration in a clonal system has received relatively little attention.
   A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the extent of physiological
   integration within the clonal system of Vallisneria natans consisting of
   a mother ramet and three sequentially connected offspring ramets. Mother
   ramets were grown in full sunlight, and offspring ramets were heavily
   shaded with limited light availability. Stolons between mother ramets
   and offspring ramets were severed or connected, but connection among the
   three offspring ramets remained. The photosynthetic ability of unshaded
   mother ramets of V. natans was significantly enhanced, but their biomass
   accumulation was greatly reduced when connected to shaded offspring
   ramets. Clonal integration significantly increased biomass accumulation,
   C and N availabilities, extracellular enzyme activities and microbial
   biomass of the first ramet generation (adjacent ramet), but not later
   ramet generations. Our results indicate that support from the mother
   ramet of V. natans may be limited to the adjacent offspring ramet in a
   clonal system under severe light stress, implying an effect of ramet
   generation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the
   hierarchy and segmentation of clonal plants. These findings suggest that
   the extent of clonal integration plays a vital role in ecological
   interactions of the ramet population.},

Abstract = {Aims We compared vein and stomatal traits of seedlings and adults of
   three Mediterranean Quercus species. Previous work suggests that
   gas-exchange rates tend to be higher at the seedling stage than in
   adults. Our objective was to determine whether vein and stomatal traits
   vary throughout whole-plant ontogeny in parallel with the changes in
   gas-exchange rates. We addressed the following alternative hypotheses:
   hypothesis 1-seedlings show higher vein and stomatal densities than
   adults; and hypothesis 2-seedlings have lower investments in vascular
   tissues to reduce construction costs. Methods Ten specimens from each
   growth stage were randomly sampled for each species in a location in
   central-western Spain. We measured mean stomatal and vein traits (size
   and number of stomata per unit of leaf area, vein density, vein volume,
   vein to epidermis distance), leaf mass per area and lamina thickness.
   Important Findings Minor vein density and vein volume per area increased
   with tree age, which seems inconsistent with the ontogenetic trends in
   gas-exchange rates. This discrepancy is in support of our hypothesis 2,
   and it suggests that, at the seedling stage, reducing investments in
   vascular tissues in benefit of maximizing growth rates is a priority.
   Larger interveinal distances in seedlings were compensated by smaller
   vein to epidermis distances. The thin leaves of the seedlings may thus
   constitute as a necessary trait for achieving shorter path length
   distances for the transport of water to evaporation sites without the
   need for a strong investment in costly vascular tissues.},

Title = {Effects of disturbances by plateau pikas on soil microbial communities
   in an alpine ecosystem of the southeast Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, China},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Small burrowing herbivores often disturb the grassland soil. Although
   the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is widespread in alpine meadows in
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, their detailed effects on ecosystem
   properties are not well-established. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of the densities of plateau pikas on plant char-acteristics,
   soil properties, and the composition and diversity of soil microbial
   communities. Plant coverage, height, aboveground biomass, and
   belowground biomass decreased with an increase in the densities of
   active plateau pika burrows. Additionally, pika disturbances led to
   distinct changes in soil moisture, soil bulk density (SBD), total
   phosphorus (TP), NH4+-N, available phosphorus (AP), and available
   potassium (AK) contents. Soil moisture, TP and AK contents were highest
   under moderate plateau pika disturbance levels, whereas the SBD and AP
   content were highest under the highest active burrow density. However,
   soil microbial diversity, as deter-mined by high-throughput sequencing,
   did not differ significantly among pika disturbance levels. Linear
   discriminant analysis Effect Size revealed that biomarker bacteria for
   various levels of disturbances belong to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
   and Firmicutes, and most biomarker bacteria were found at moderate
   disturbance level (D2), while biomarker fungi belong to Ascomycota and
   Basidiomycota, and most biomarker fungi were found in the highest
   plateau pika disturbance level (D4). Pika disturbances significantly
   influenced the microbial community, possibly via alterations in the
   belowground biomass, SBD, AK and TP contents. Thus, plateau pika
   disturbances significantly influenced the plant and soil properties and
   microbial community structure.},

Title = {Temporal dynamics of a Sabellaria wilsoni (Sabellariidae: Polychaeta)
   reef on the Brazilian Amazon Coast},

Abstract = {Polychaetes of the family Sabellariidae build extensive reefs in many
   coastal regions worldwide. These structures are dynamic systems that
   undergo a natural cycle of growth and destruction provoked by
   fluctuations in hydrodynamic conditions and biological factors. Here, we
   monitored a Sabellaria wilsoni reef over an annual cycle on
   Algodoal-Maiandeua Island on the Brazilian Amazon coast. We studied the
   impact of temporal variations in local environmental characteristics on
   the structure of the reef and the reef-building polychaete population.
   Metrics included the local climate (temperature, rainfall, and winds),
   hydrological variables (suspended particulate matter and salinity), and
   the output of a numerical model of the local hydrodynamics. There was
   increased hydrodynamic stress in the dry season due to changes in the
   direction and intensity of the wind and stronger waves. This in turn led
   to an accentuated decrease in sabellariid density, and the eventual
   erosion of the reef, which lost >80\% of its original area. The
   reduction in the hydrodynamic energy at the end of the rainy season
   favoured the mass recruitment of sabellariids as well as the subsequent
   growth and recuperation of the reef. Oligohaline conditions also
   contributed to a reduction in worm density, but not to any loss in reef
   structure. These findings provide important insights into the thresholds
   of energy and salinity tolerated by the reef-building polychaete S.
   wilsoni and offer a useful baseline for future research on the ecology
   of this species and the monitoring of this important marine habitat.},

Title = {Strategies for segregation during foraging in sympatric otariids of the

Volume = {702},

Abstract = {The competitive exclusion principle predicts that species exhibit
   segregation mechanisms to coexist. In the Humboldt Current System, South
   American sea lions Otaria byronia (SASL) coexist with South American fur
   seals Arctocephalus australis (SAFS); however, the existence of temporal
   and spatial partitioning in foraging strategies remains unknown. To
   compare foraging strategies, we analyzed locations of 35 adults (18
   SASL, 17 SAFS; 4 and 8 females, 14 and 9 males, respectively) equipped
   with satellite tags in Punta San Juan, Peru (2013-2017). We evaluated
   (1) distance and duration of foraging trips, (2) utilization
   distributions (UDs), (3) foraging by hour and (4) association of
   foraging with environmental variables. Regular interval tracks (every 30
   min) were modeled, and residence time was estimated to determine
   foraging events. Proportion overlap and analysis of similarity compared
   groups in core areas (50\% UD) and home ranges (95\% UD). Generalized
   additive mixed models were built to determine if hour of day and
   environmental conditions had an effect on foraging. Multiple mechanisms
   for foraging segregation that explain coexistence were found. Duration
   and distance between species-sex groups were significantly different,
   except for trip duration between SASL sexes. SAFS traveled longer
   distances and duration than SASL, and males traveled longer distances
   and duration than conspecific females. Female UDs overlapped, while male
   UDs did not. Core areas between sexes overlapped in SAFS and SASL, but
   home ranges were significantly different. Hour of day had a significant
   effect on foraging events in SAFS females and SASL males. Environmental
   conditions during foraging by SASL and SAFS females reflected coastal
   and offshore habitats, respectively. However, interspecific segregation
   was not evident between males.},

Abstract = {Forage fish species play a crucial role in most ecosystems, transferring
   energy from plankton to larger fishes. Therefore, understanding the
   factors driving the dynamics of forage fish populations is essential in
   marine ecosystems. Gadiculus argenteus is an important forage fish
   species in the Galicia and Cantabrian Sea ecosystem. In this study, the
   influence of several biotic and abiotic factors on the distribution of
   this species was examined using generalized additive models in a 2-step
   approach. G. argenteus habitat preference was not affected by changes in
   annual abundance during the study period (1998-2019). From the variables
   selected in the final models, depth and geographic location (latitude
   and longitude) were the most important factors to describe the presence
   of G. argenteus. Peak abundance was found on the upper slope and
   although the species was found throughout the study area, its higher
   abundance values were located in Galician waters. The species seemed to
   avoid coarse sand bottoms, with mean chlorophyll a concentration showing
   a positive effect on the presence and abundance of G. argenteus.
   Interestingly, the observed aggregations of G. argenteus showed a
   remarkable similarity to the commercial trawling footprint in the area,
   suggesting a strong link between the distribution of this forage species
   and the distribution of its predators, most of which are important
   commercial species. Further work should focus on a better understanding
   of this relationship to provide important information on the study of
   the structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem of the northern
   Spanish continental shelf.},

Abstract = {Increases in nitrogen (N) deposition greatly affect soil processes and
   functions, but there is limited information about the effects of
   long-term N deposition on soil nematodes. A field experiment was
   initiated in 2004 with four levels of N addition (0, 60, 120, and 240 kg
   N ha(-1) y(-1)) in a subtropical Cunninghamia lanceolata forest. After
   10 years of treatment, soil samples were collected at three depths
   (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm), and the community structure, trophic
   groups, and diversity of soil nematodes was determined. In addition, a
   meta-analysis with 220 observations from 52 field manipulation
   experiments was performed to determine whether the results of the
   current study were consistent with previous results obtained after a
   range of treatment durations. Long-term N addition significantly
   increased the abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes but decreased the
   abundance of plant-feeding nematodes in the C. lanceolata forest. The
   plant parasite index and enrichment index decreased but the basal index
   and channel index increased, which reduced the importance of the
   bacterial-based energy channel but increased the importance of the
   fungal-based energy channel as soil depth increased. The meta-analysis
   confirmed that for treatment durations that did not exceed 10 years, N
   addition increased the abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes but
   reduced the abundance of plant-feeding nematodes. Further analysis of
   our experimental data indicated that N addition directly affected the
   abundance of plant-feeding nematodes and indirectly affected the
   abundances of bacterial-, fungal-, and plant-feeding nematodes via
   changes in soil nutrients, soil water content, and pH. These findings
   suggest that N addition can change the abundance and community
   composition of soil nematodes, which would affect the soil food web and
   biogeochemical cycling under future global-change scenarios.},

Title = {Provenance-specific ecophysiological responses to drought in
   Cunninghamia lanceolata},

Abstract = {Aims Cunninghamia lanceolata is one of the most important coniferous
   species in southern China, but its high sensitivity to drought restricts
   its expansion. Understanding the intraspecific variation of
   physiological responses to drought can help us manage this plantation
   better. Methods We selected 3-year-old seedlings of C. lanceolata, which
   originated from the low precipitation (LP), middle precipitation (MP)
   and high precipitation (HP) habitats, respectively. Seedlings were grown
   under drought stress (20\% of soil volumetric water content) for 40
   days. The ecophysiological responses and adaptive strategies with
   different drought tolerance were investigated. Important Findings LP
   provenance possessed the best tolerance to drought stress, suggesting
   that considerably increased carbohydrates and nitrogen-containing
   compounds as osmotic protective materials, which were driven by fast
   carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. In addition, the highest peroxidase
   activity could effectively eliminate hydrogen peroxide in
   drought-stressed LP provenance. The MP provenance reserved a large
   amount of non-structural carbohydrates, which may act as a certain
   buffer for encountering drought stress. Importantly, timely closure of
   stomata to reduce needle transpiration when encountering a water
   deficiency would help them adapt to long-term drought. MP provenance
   adopted a conservative water-saving strategy. However, HP provenance
   regulated root growth (increased root/shoot ratio) and reduced
   penetration potential to help them absorb water. The different
   strategies among provenances may be related to the long-term
   domestication of the geographical environments. Therefore, our results
   underline the importance of provenance-specific responses to drought
   stress. It is highly significant to accelerate the selection of
   drought-resistant germplasms and to cultivate high-yield plantations in
   the future.},

Title = {Wave exposure affects the persistence of kelp beds amidst outbreaks of

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {702},

Abstract = {In certain regions of the northwest Atlantic, rocky subtidal habitats
   have transitioned from luxuriant kelp beds to turf dominated ecosystems.
   Encrustation by the invasive epiphytic bryozoan Membranipora membranacea
   has accelerated the defoliation of macroalgal stands, particularly on
   the southwestern shore (SWS) of Nova Scotia. In contrast, at the Eastern
   Shore Islands (ESI) in Nova Scotia, a temperate island archipelago with
   relatively high wave exposure, kelp beds persist. We investigated how
   spatial and temporal dynamics of the dominant kelps (Saccharina
   latissima and Laminaria digitata) and M. membranacea relate to wave
   exposure. We examined canopy cover and density of kelps using video
   transects and quadrat sampling at 6 sites of different wave exposures at
   ESI and a highly wave exposed site on the SWS (Shag Rock), where kelp
   also persists, in summer and autumn 2018-2020. We measured percent cover
   of adult colonies of M. membranacea on kelps from autumn 2018 to autumn
   2020, and density of settlers in 2019. Colony cover of M. membranacea
   was comparable across the range of wave exposures at ESI, whereas
   settler density peaked at intermediate wave exposure. Despite annual
   outbreaks of the bryozoan, kelp beds at ESI persisted over multiple
   years, in contrast to a declining trend at Shag Rock. Overwinter
   recovery of kelps at ESI following bryozoan-induced seasonal declines
   the preceding autumn indicate that, in contrast to sites on the SWS,
   these colder more wave exposed kelp beds may be resilient to
   defoliation.},

Title = {Biological responses of the predatory blue crab and its hard clam prey

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {67-81},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {How ocean acidification (OA) interacts with other stressors is
   understudied, particularly for predators and prey. We assessed long-term
   exposure to decreased pH and low salinity on (1) juvenile blue crab
   Callinectes sapidus claw pinch force, (2) juvenile hard clam Mercenaria
   mercenaria survival, growth, and shell structure, and (3) blue crab and
   hard clam interactions in filmed mesocosm trials. In 2018 and 2019, we
   held crabs and clams from the Chesapeake Bay, USA, in crossed pH (low:
   7.0, high: 8.0) and salinity (low: 15, high: 30) treatments for 11 and
   10 wk, respectively. Afterwards, we assessed crab claw pinch force and
   clam survival, growth, shell structure, and ridge rugosity. Claw pinch
   force increased with size in both years but weakened in low pH. Clam
   growth was negative, indicative of shell dissolution, in low pH in both
   years compared to the control. Growth was also negative in the 2019
   high-pH/low-salinity treatment. Clam survival in both years was lowest
   in the low-pH/low-salinity treatment and highest in the
   high-pH/high-salinity treatment. Shell damage and ridge rugosity
   (indicative of deterioration) were intensified under low pH and
   negatively correlated with clam survival. Overall, clams were more
   severely affected by both stressors than crabs. In the filmed
   predator-prey interactions, pH did not substantially alter crab
   behavior, but crabs spent more time eating and burying in high-salinity
   treatments and more time moving in low-salinity treatments. Given the
   complex effects of pH and salinity on blue crabs and hard clams,
   projections about climate change on predator-prey interactions will be
   difficult and must consider multiple stressors.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {53-64},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Shell debris increases habitat diversity and ecological heterogeneity,
   stabilizing sediments and providing substrate for encrusting and
   epifaunal animals and protection against predation. However, how shell
   debris influences disturbance-recovery dynamics in different habitats
   has not been evaluated. We experimentally tested the effects of shell
   debris on early colonization of macroinvertebrates into defaunated
   patches across 12 sites along a mud-to-sand gradient. The addition of
   shell debris enhanced species richness compared to plots without shells
   and increased variability in the local contributions to beta-diversity,
   mostly at the muddier sites. The variation in the strength of these
   effects along the mud gradient highlights the effects of shell debris on
   community structure and how the muddying of coastal sediments shifts
   species composition. Loss of shellfish and burying of shells with
   elevated rates of sedimentation diminishes the role of small-scale
   sediment heterogeneity for sustaining beta-diversity in low-energy
   environments.},

Title = {Seagrass roots strongly reduce cliff erosion rates in sandy sediments},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Vegetated coastal ecosystems such as saltmarshes, mangroves and seagrass
   beds are increasingly promoted as sustainable storm and flood defence
   solutions by reducing wave energy. Yet, there is still intense debate on
   the ability of root mats to mitigate erosion, with some studies arguing
   that the direct contribution of roots in preventing sediment erosion is
   minor, while others consider them of major importance. Here, we
   hypothesized that the contrasting findings on the role of seagrass root
   mats in preventing erosion may stem from differences in sediment type.
   To test this idea, we investigated how root mats of seagrass that
   thrives in both sandy and muddy sediments mitigate wave-induced cliff
   erosion using Zostera marina in manipulative flume experiments. Results
   demonstrate that roots are very effective in reducing cliff erosion
   rates in sandy sediments. Cliff erosion rates were reduced up to 70\% in
   sandy sediment with high seagrass root biomass. In contrast, cliff
   erosion rates in cohesive muddy sediments were low and unaffected by
   seagrass roots. This highlights the important role of seagrass roots in
   erosion mitigation, which has been overlooked compared to the role of
   canopies, which has received more attention. We suggest that management
   strategies should be developed to enhance the stabilization of sandy
   sediment, such as (1) using species with high belowground biomass, (2)
   using fast-growing pioneer species and (3) applying temporary
   stabilising measures.},

Title = {Intra- and inter-annual shifts in foraging tactics by parental northern

Abstract = {Seabirds are constrained by central-place foraging during breeding, when
   the energy obtained from prey must outweigh the costs of travel, search,
   capture and transport. The distribution and phenology of the
   cold-blooded marine fishes they exploit are heavily influenced by
   oceanic climate. Northern gannets, the largest breeding seabird in the
   North Atlantic, use a generalist foraging strategy, preying on a wide
   array of pelagic fishes. They employ different foraging tactics for
   different prey types, with rapid, shallow V-shaped dives used for large,
   powerful prey such as mackerel, and U-shaped dives for smaller forage
   fishes like capelin. Here we assess intra- and inter-annual differences
   in foraging effort and influences of prey availability at the
   southernmost colony of the species at Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland,
   Canada. We compared foraging trip characteristics (total and maximum
   distance, directness, duration and number of dives) of parental gannets
   during the breeding seasons of 2019 (n = 10) and 2020 (n = 7) using
   GPS/time-depth recorders. Individual gannets shifted away from using
   U-shaped dives in early chick-rearing to primarily V-shaped dives in
   late chick-rearing. Shifts were abrupt and occurred in mid-August in
   2019 and 2020. Maximum and total foraging trip distance and duration
   were significantly greater during early chick-rearing in 2020 than in
   2019. Kernel density 50\% utilization distributions were larger and
   expanded further from the colony during early chick-rearing in 2020
   (7297 +/- 1419 km2; mean +/- SE) than 2019 (2382 +/- 797 km2). Increased
   foraging effort during early chick-rearing in 2020 was likely due to
   decreased capelin availability, resulting from earlier spawning, and
   greater variation in the timing of spawning among sites, which may have
   been influenced by warmer waters.},

Abstract = {Marine herbivores may alter their behavior regarding habitat and food
   source choice according to the presence or absence of chemical cues from
   predators. To assess whether an amphipod species can detect and react to
   different water-soluble cues, individuals of Ampithoe marcuzzii were
   tested through a 2-current choice flume. Dual-response choice
   experiments were conducted in which the animals selected water flowing
   from one of 2 different sources. Comparisons among sources were tested
   using seawater (control), water with cues from different seaweeds
   (Dictyopteris delicatula, Gracilaria cervicornis or Gelidium
   coarctatum), water with cues from potential predators (Abudefduf
   saxatilis, Sparisoma sp., Haemulon plumieri, H. aurolineatum and
   Holocentrus adscensionis) and water mixtures with seaweed and predator
   cues. The amphipods were able to avoid predator cues and to distinguish
   and actively choose between the water-soluble cues of different
   seaweeds. The animals preferred D. delicatula cues over those of G.
   cervicornis and G. coarctatum. The amphipods also selected more G.
   cervicornis cues than those of G. coarctatum. When predator cues were
   mixed with D. delicatula cues, amphipods changed their initial choice
   for G. cervicornis. However, when predator cues were added to G.
   cervicornis, the animals maintained their preference for this seaweed's
   cues over those of G. coarctatum. Our findings demonstrate that A.
   marcuzzii exhibits a preference for brown seaweeds that draw fewer
   predators. The choice of seaweed changes according to predation risk
   perception based on water-soluble chemical cues. This ability to
   distinguish water-soluble chemical cues and base their habitat decisions
   on them is a fundamental adaptive behavior for this group.},

Title = {Pneumatophores and crab burrows increase CO2 and CH4 emission from
   sediments in two Brazilian fringe mangrove forests},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},

Abstract = {We assessed the release of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) from
   air-exposed sediments and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from
   inundated sediments in 2 Brazilian mangrove forests. Our focus was on
   the impact of biogenic structures, i.e. pneumatophores and crab burrows,
   on greenhouse gas emissions. Emission of CO2 from air-exposed bare
   sediment (111-156 and 57-148 mmol m-2 d-1 in darkness and in light,
   respectively) was comparable to DIC release from inundated sediment
   (122-158 and 52-62 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively). Pneumatophores and crab
   burrows increased dark CO2 emission during air exposure by 113-123 and
   49-91\%, respectively. CH4 emission from air-exposed bare sediment
   (0.22-0.25 mmol m-2 d-1) was increased 92-137 and 288-607\%,
   respectively, by pneumatophores and burrows. Carbon loss in the form of
   CO2 and DIC from sediments with biogenic structures can at the two study
   locations be extrapolated to 64.1 and 71.0 mol C m-2 yr-1. These values
   fit well with literature values of litterfall in the studied area,
   providing carbon accretion of 28.5 and 21.6 mol C m-2 yr-1. However, the
   budget will be unbalanced if the role of biogenic structures is not
   considered. In the presence of biogenic structures, CH4 emissions of 2.8
   and 3.3 mol C m-2 yr-1 (when converted to CO2 units) will partly
   (10-15\%) counteract the climate mitigation effect of the accumulated
   carbon. Carbon budgets in mangrove sediments may therefore be flawed if
   the contribution of biogenic structures to greenhouse gas emissions is
   ignored.},

Abstract = {Population-scale information on the spatial ecology of threatened mobile
   sharks is required to design more effective management measures. Using
   an exhaustive collection of presence-only records and relevant
   predictors, we applied temporally explicit environmental niche modelling
   to study habitat use by a school shark Galeorhinus galeus population in
   the Southwest Atlantic. As a complementary tool, we developed randomized
   habitat association curves to assess both the representation of data
   with biological information and possible intra-population variation in
   habitat use. Seasonal niche models supported a core area of distribution
   between southern Brazil and southern Argentina. Marginal seasonal
   variation in suitability at the northern and southern extremes of its
   distribution supported the hypothesis that the G. galeus population
   behaves to some degree as a niche shifter on an annual cycle. Habitat
   associations revealed regional bias in the collection of records with
   biological information, and suggested a complex intra-population
   segregation pattern between sexes and between maturity stages during the
   cold half of the year. Overall, results supported large-scale partial
   migrations (i.e. some individuals migrate while others remain resident)
   of the G. galeus population. This study demonstrates the significance of
   future regional efforts that focus on producing more and better
   databases to derive relevant information at a low cost for the
   management of threatened sharks and their relatives.},

Abstract = {A new species Duvalius djokovici Curcic, Pavicevic \& Vesovic is
   described, illustrated and compared with its closest relatives. It is
   tentatively placed in the subgenus Neoduvalius Muller, 1913. The new
   species is weakly pigmented, mid-sized, with no traces of eyes, with
   deep and complete frontal furrows, two pairs of elytral discal setae,
   and a distinctive form of aedeagus. It inhabits a subterranean site on
   Mt. Povlen (western Serbia), and is endemic to this mountain. We provide
   data on the distribution and biology of this new species. Additionally,
   we discuss the relations among other species of the subgenus Neoduvalius
   from western and southwestern Serbia, and provide a provisional key for
   their identification and an annotated list of Serbian Neoduvalius taxa.},

Abstract = {The frequency and type of dyadic social interactions individuals partake
   in has important fitness consequences. Social network analysis is an
   effective tool to quantify the complexity and consequences of these
   behaviors on the individual level. Less work has used social networks to
   quantify the social structure-specific attributes of the pattern of all
   social interactions in a network-of animal social groups, and its
   fitness consequences for those individuals who comprise the group. We
   studied the association between social structure, quantified via five
   network measures, and annual reproductive success in wild, free-living
   female yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer). We quantified
   reproductive success in two ways: (1) if an individual successfully
   weaned a litter and (2) how many pups were weaned. Networks were
   constructed from 38 968 interactions between 726 unique individuals in
   137 social groups across 19 years. Using generalized linear mixed
   models, we found largely no relationship between either measure of
   reproductive success and social structure. We found a modest
   relationship that females residing in more fragmentable social groups
   (i.e., groups breakable into two or more separate groups of two or more
   individuals) weaned larger litters. Prior work showed that
   yellow-bellied marmots residing in more fragmentable groups gained body
   mass faster-another important fitness correlate. Interestingly, we found
   no strong relationships between other attributes of social group
   structure, suggesting that in this facultatively social mammal, the
   position of individuals within their group, the individual social
   phenotype, may be more important for fitness than the emergent group
   social phenotype.
   Lay Summary How individuals interact with other members of their own
   species often has fitness consequences. Such interactions also structure
   social groups, which may in turn affect the individuals who reside in
   the group. Using social network analysis to quantify social group
   structure, we show that female yellow-bellied marmots living in more
   fragmentable social groups (breakable into two or more separate groups
   of two or more individuals) weaned larger litters.},

Title = {Metabolic rate shapes differences in foraging efficiency among honeybee

Abstract = {Metabolic rate is the rate at which organisms process energy and is
   often considered as the fundamental driver of life history processes.
   The link between metabolic rate and life history is critically mediated
   via foraging, which shapes the energy acquisition patterns of an
   individual. This predicts that individuals with different metabolic
   rates likely vary in their foraging strategies, although such a link has
   rarely been empirically investigated in the context of optimal foraging
   theory-a powerful framework for understanding how animals maximize their
   foraging returns. Many central place foragers such as honeybees maximize
   their energetic efficiency rather than the rate of energetic gain, given
   the critical role of energetic costs in foraging decisions. We therefore
   tested if individuals with low and high metabolic rates differ in
   efficiency maximization, using genetic lines of honeybees with different
   metabolic rates. Our results show that low metabolic rate foragers visit
   more flowers during a foraging trip and have a higher energetic
   efficiency than high metabolic rate foragers in both low and high
   resource conditions. We discuss the significance of these results in the
   context of division of labor and the adaptive role of phenotypic
   diversity in metabolic rate in a social insect colony.
   Lay Summary Metabolic rate is often cited as a primary driver of life
   history because it determines the energy that is available for behavior.
   We tested the foraging performance of honeybees that had been
   genetically selected for either low or high metabolic rate, and found
   that low-metabolic-rate bees visited more flowers in a foraging trip
   than high-metabolic rate bees, and also displayed higher energetic
   efficiency under both low- and high-resource conditions.},

Title = {N limitation increases along a temperate forest succession: evidences
   from leaf stoichiometry and nutrient resorption},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1021-1035},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Forest productivity and carbon (C) sequestration largely depend on soil
   N and P availability. To date, however, the temporal variation of
   nutrient limitation along forest succession is still under debate. Leaf
   stoichiometry and nutrient resorption are important indicators for
   predicting nutrient limitation of plant growth. Here, we measured
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in green leaves and leaf
   litter for all woody species at four stages of temperate forest
   succession, and analyzed how abiotic and biotic factors affect leaf
   stoichiometry and nutrient resorption along forest succession. At the
   individual scale, leaf N and P concentrations had a significant increase
   at the end of the succession, while no change in leaf N:P ratio was
   detected. Nitrogen resorption efficiency (NRE) increased significantly
   with succession, but P resorption efficiency (PRE) first increased and
   then decreased. Significant increases in NRE:PRE ratios only occurred at
   the end of the succession. Moreover, plant N cycling was less responsive
   to soil nutrient than P cycling. At the community scale, we found that
   leaf N and P concentrations first decreased and then increased along
   forest succession, which were mainly affected by Shannon-Wiener index
   and species richness. Leaf N:P ratio significantly varied with
   succession and was mainly determined by community-weighted mean diameter
   at breast height (DBH). NRE increased and was significantly influenced
   by species richness and DBH, while PRE was relatively stable along
   forest succession. Thus, the NRE:PRE ratios significantly increased,
   indicating that N limitation is exacerbated with the temperate forest
   succession. These results might reflect the intense interspecific
   competition for limiting resource in a higher biodiversity community. In
   conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of biotic factors in
   driving forest ecosystem nutrient cycling and provide valuable
   information for sustainable fertilizer management practices in China's
   temperate and boreal forests.},

Abstract = {Aims In the Oregon of USA, the control of western juniper (Juniperus
   occidentalis) is an accepted rangeland management practice to restore
   sagebrush steppe habitats of importance to wildlife and livestock. The
   effects of juniper cutting on ecosystem nitrogen, however, have not been
   well addressed although woody plant control has important implications
   for local watershed management and regional nitrogen pools. Methods We
   quantified ecosystem nitrogen stocks in two adjacent watersheds,
   comprised of a treated watershed (most juniper removed) and an untreated
   watershed (juniper not removed). Thirteen years after juniper removal,
   we measured aboveground nitrogen stocks for juniper trees, shrubs,
   grasses and litter in both watersheds. We also measured belowground
   nitrogen stocks (roots and soil) in both watersheds at two soil depths
   (0-25 and 25-50 cm). Important Findings Aboveground nitrogen stocks were
   6.9 times greater in the untreated than in the treated watershed
   considering the much larger aboveground biomass. However, root nitrogen
   stocks were 3.1 times greater in the treated one due to the gain of
   understory root biomass associated with juniper cutting. Soil nitrogen
   stocks at both 0-25 and 25-50 cm depths were not affected by juniper
   removal. Overall, total ecosystem nitrogen stocks did not differ between
   the treated (9536 kg N ha(-1)) and untreated (9456 kg N ha(-1))
   watersheds. The greatest ecosystem nitrogen accumulation (at least 95\%
   total ecosystem nitrogen) resided belowground (soil 0-50 cm and roots)
   in both watersheds. This study provides evidence that the benefits of
   juniper removal can be attained without significantly affecting the
   capacity of ecosystem nitrogen storage.},

Abstract = {Aims Both extreme drought and insect herbivores can suppress plant
   growth in grassland communities. However, most studies have examined
   extreme drought and insects in isolation, and there is reason to believe
   that insects might alter the ability of grasslands to withstand drought.
   Unfortunately, few studies have tested the interactive effects of
   extreme drought and insect herbivores in grassland communities. Methods
   Here, we tested the drought-herbivore interactions using a manipulative
   experiment that factorially crossed extreme drought with the exclusion
   of insect herbivores in a temperate semiarid grassland in Inner
   Mongolia. Important Findings Our results demonstrated that both extreme
   drought and insect herbivores separately decreased total plant cover.
   When combined, insect herbivores reduced the impact of drought on total
   cover by increasing the relative abundance of drought-resistant dominant
   species. Our results highlight that the negative effect of extreme
   drought on total plant cover could be alleviated by maintaining robust
   insect herbivore communities.},

Abstract = {Elasmobranchs are an important component of the marine ecosystem that
   face obvious anthropogenic threats through habitat degradation and
   overfishing, but the impact of anthropogenic sounds on these animals is
   less obvious and remains unclear. Using a Y-maze behavioural set-up with
   sound presentation on one side of the pen, we exposed southern stingrays
   Hypanus americanus to 4 types of anthropogenic sounds: 2-stroke boat,
   4-stroke boat, cruise ship and airplane. While stingrays did not have a
   side preference, they did exhibit an increase in escape behaviours
   during all sound treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first study
   to examine the impacts of airplane sound on any aquatic animal, and we
   found that stingrays exhibited escape responses most often to airplane
   sounds. We demonstrate that anthropogenic sounds affect the behavioural
   response of stingrays and further state that more efforts are needed in
   determining the behavioural or physiological impacts of anthropogenic
   sounds on elasmobranchs.},

Title = {Untangling leaf expansion triggers: A new experimental study with
   Epipremnum aureum (Araceae)},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Allomorphic aroid vines exhibit a distinct morphology compared to the
   typical ``sun and shade{''} leaf pattern. Their leaves exposed to high
   light irradiance at canopies are up to 30 times larger in area compared
   to leaves in the forest understory. Growth axis direction, contact with
   the host, and canopy light are morphogenesis-inducing factors for these
   aroids. While the first two factors are directly related to growth, the
   light obtained at canopies is associated with foraging and reproduction.
   In previous studies, the stimulus of light or the simultaneous
   application of contact and growth axis direction was not able to induce
   intense changes in leaf, petiole, and stem dimensions, as seen in
   nature. In this study, we tested the simultaneous interaction of light
   intensity, growth axis direction, and contact as inducing factors of
   morphological shoot development in the allomorphic aroid vine,
   Epipremnum aureum. An experiment with 60 cuttings was established, which
   included three growth conditions (horizontal, hanging, and climbing) and
   two light conditions (low light and high light). After 10 months, the
   leaf, petiole, and internode dimensions and dry mass allocation were
   compared. In both the horizontal and hanging treatments, the presence of
   high light doubled the individual leaf area to approximately 60 cm(2).
   However, when high light was combined with vertical growth and contact
   stimuli in the climbing treatment, this increase was 20-fold, producing
   leaves up to 1,000 cm(2). Dry mass allocation followed the same pattern.
   This result shows that the enormous leaf area expansion of E. aureum is
   a synergistic effect of the simultaneous application of light, growth
   axis direction, and contact. The increase in light interception by wider
   leaves is an advantage to the maintenance of allomorphic aroid vines in
   a variable light environment such as in canopies.},

Title = {Relationships between topographic variation and plant functional trait
   distribution across different biomes},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {293},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plant functional traits can affect ecosystem functions and services.
   Although many studies have investigated the driving factors of plant
   functional-trait distribution, few have explored the relationship
   between terrain factors and such distribution. Here, we proposed three
   hypotheses to explain the above-mentioned relationship: 1) terrain
   factors affect the distribution pattern of plant functional traits; 2)
   the relationship between terrain factors and plant functional-trait
   distribution is biome-dependent; 3) the relationship between terrain
   factors and plant functional-trait distribution is scale-dependent. To
   test these hypotheses, we used geographically weighted regression and
   ordinary least squares to study the relationship between functional
   traits (specific leaf area, height, and wood density) and terrain
   factors (roughness, terrain ruggedness index, terrain position index,
   and vector ruggedness measure) in 14 different biomes at scales of 5 and
   50 km2. We found that terrain factors affected the distribution of plant
   functional traits. Specifically, there was a significant negative
   correlation between terrain factors and wood density; further, terrain
   factors had effects on specific leaf areas but not on plant height;
   furthermore, roughness was the most significant among the influential
   terrain factors, followed by the vector ruggedness measure and the
   terrain ruggedness index. Additionally, the effect of biome type on the
   relationship between terrain factors and plant functional-trait
   distribution was widespread. Finally, spatial scale effects on
   biodiversity may depend on the transition between different biomes.
   Therefore, considering biome and scale effects is essential to
   understanding heterogeneity and biodiversity, especially in
   macroecological studies with important scientific and practical
   significance.},

Abstract = {Aims Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition influences tree hydraulic
   architecture and thus the growth and survival; but the responses of leaf
   hydraulic traits remain uncertain, and may vary with species or plant
   functional types. Methods We used the 16-year N addition experiment (10
   g N m(-2) year(-1)) on Fraxinus mandshurica (ash, broadleaf angiosperm)
   and Larix gmelinii (larch, conifer gymnosperm) plantations in
   northeastern China and examined the effect of N addition on their leaf
   hydraulics. We measured the leaf pressure-volume traits by the bench
   drying method and quantified the maximum leaf hydraulic conductance
   (K-leaf\_max) and resistance to embolism (P-50leaf) by the timed
   rehydration method. Important Findings Larch had higher K-leaf\_max and
   stronger drought tolerance (i.e., lower relative water content at turgor
   loss point (RWCtlp) and modulus of elasticity (epsilon), and more
   negative P-50leaf) than ash. N addition increased the leaf osmotic
   potential at turgor loss (pi(tlp)) and full turgor (pi(0)), and leaf
   capacitance (C-leaf\_mass) for ash but not for larch, indicating that
   ash is more sensitive to N addition. N addition consistently increased
   K-leaf\_max and P-50leaf values for both species. pi(tlp) and pi(0) were
   positively while C-leaf\_mass was negatively correlated with leaf
   density (LD) for ash. K-leaf\_max was positively but P-50leaf was
   negatively related with LD for larch. There were negative relationships
   between K-leaf\_max and P-50leaf for both species. Overall, our findings
   suggest that long-term N addition decreases the leaf drought tolerance
   for these two important tree species, which improve the understanding of
   the tree hydraulic performance under N deposition.},

Abstract = {Aims Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, have recently emerged
   as cost-effective and flexible tools for acquiring remote sensing data
   with fine spatial and temporal resolution. It provides a new method and
   opportunity for plant ecologists to study issues from individual to
   regional scales. However, as a new method, UAVs remote sensing
   applications in plant ecology are still challenged. The needs of plant
   ecology research and the application development of UAVs remote sensing
   should be better integrated. Methods This report provides a
   comprehensive review of UAV-based remote sensing applications in plant
   ecology to synthesize prospects of applying drones to advance plant
   ecology research. Important Findings Of the 400 references, 59\% were
   published in remote sensing journals rather than in plant ecology
   journals, reflecting a substantial gap between the interests of remote
   sensing experts and plant ecologists. Most of the studies focused on UAV
   remote sensing's technical aspects, such as data processing and remote
   sensing inversion, with little attention on answering ecological
   questions. There were 61\% of studies involved community-scale research.
   RGB and multispectral cameras were the most used sensors (75\%). More
   ecologically meaningful parameters can be extracted from UAV data to
   better understand the canopy surface irregularity and community
   heterogeneity, identify geometrical characteristics of canopy gaps and
   construct canopy chemical assemblies from living vegetation volumes.
   More cooperation between plant ecologists and remote sensing experts is
   needed to promote UAV remote sensing in advancing plant ecology

Abstract = {Polyphosphate-accumulating microbial mats can influence PO43-
   concentration in the benthic zone. To investigate the role of microbial
   mats in benthic P cycling, short peat cores including supernatant water
   from a coastal fen in NE Germany (southern Baltic Sea) were incubated in
   winter, summer and fall under 3 conditions: in situ, elevated
   temperature and oxygen-depletion. Bottom water PO43- concentrations
   decreased in treatments where a microbial mat had formed (summer and
   winter) but not in the mat-deficient fall treatment. The mats were
   densely populated with polyphosphate-rich Lyngbya sp. filaments. On the
   last day of incubation, PO43- concentrations in the oxygen-depleted
   bottom water were lower in the winter (70x) and summer (44x) than in the
   fall treatment, demonstrating the significant effect of microbial mats
   on PO43- fluxes, even under oxygen-depleted conditions. Mean
   polyphosphate-P content in the upper 1 cm peat layer of 8 freshly
   collected winter cores was 2.23 mu mol g-1 (5\% of total P), comprising
   a noticeable percentage of the P reservoir. Low sediment Fe:P molar
   ratios among the cores (5.9-6.3) indicated that P-adsorption sites in
   Fe-P compounds were fairly saturated and had limited efficiency in
   precipitating additional bottom water PO43-. Using known
   temperature-dependent coefficients for biological systems, we estimate
   that bottom water PO43- concentrations in temperature-elevated cores
   were reduced by 96\% in the presence of a microbial mat. We propose that
   a microbial mat can take up a large amount of dissolved inorganic P,
   highlighting its regulatory role in coastal peatland P fluxes under
   varying environmental conditions.},

   throughout the world, and the fishery for North Atlantic lumpfish
   Cyclopterus lumpus roe is no exception. In Greenland, the fishery was
   Marine Stewardship Council-certified in 2015 but has pending conditions
   related to bycatch quantification, enforcement and mitigation
   strategies. To improve this situation and to assess the potential impact
   of bycatch, we collected independent on-board observer data on
   non-target fish and seabirds over 2 seasons (2019 and 2021). We recorded
   6 fish species, but the only species constituting >1\% of the lumpfish
   landings was the spotted wolffish Anarhichas minor. The bycatch of fish
   likely had little impact on the involved fish stocks. We recorded 4
   seabird species, of which common eider Somateria mollissima was most
   common. When extrapolated to the entire West Greenland lumpfish fishery,
   the estimated bycatch of common eider was considerably higher in 2019
   (19938; 95\% CI: 3486-59661) than in 2021 (9802: 1260-29940) due to a
   longer fishing season in 2019. On average, for 2019 and 2021, the
   bycatch was modelled to reduce the growth potential for the West
   Greenland winter population by 51\%. In comparison, the current hunting
   level (16538 birds yr-1) reduced the growth potential by 30\%. The
   larger impact of bycatch was mainly due to a larger proportion of adults
   and females being targeted. The common eider bycatch impacts mainly the
   breeding population in Canada and Southwest Greenland and less so in
   Northwest Greenland. As mitigation, we recommend temporal closures of
   the fishery unless modified gillnets, which markedly reduce bycatch,
   become available.},

Abstract = {Fisheries threaten marine predator populations through bycatch and
   competition for the same resources, but may also provide feeding
   opportunities. Understanding benefits and mitigating impacts, therefore,
   requires a detailed understanding of fishery interactions. The Humboldt
   Current system supports the world's largest single-species fishery
   (Peruvian anchoveta Engraulis ringens), along with abundant marine
   predators dependent on these forage fish, including seabirds. We
   combined bird-borne video cameras and GPS-acceleration-dive loggers to
   quantify the foraging behaviour of chick-rearing Peruvian boobies Sula
   variegata around Isla Macabi, Peru, in December 2020 and May 2021.
   Videos revealed that 18\% of 77 Peruvian booby foraging trips included
   feeding at actively fishing purse seine vessels, diving in and around
   the nets. Most vessel interactions were close to the colony, and we
   found no difference in foraging effort (e.g. trip duration) between
   trips with and without vessel interactions. We recorded fishing effort
   in the foraging range of the colony using remotely sensed data from the
   vessel monitoring system accessed via Global Fishing Watch, finding more
   frequent interactions and catch depredation when fishing effort was high
   near the colony. We found no evidence that birds expended additional
   energy (e.g. dynamic body acceleration) or travelled to different
   locations to reach vessels. We emphasise the value of combining
   high-resolution movement and video loggers with remotely sensed
   fisheries data to monitor seabird-fishery interactions in detail, rather
   than just spatio-temporal overlap, and assess the potential for
   competition and bycatch. Threatened seabird populations may benefit from
   no-take zones or reduced fishing effort in core foraging areas of
   colonies.},

Title = {Synergistic effects of salinity and temperature on the eastern oyster
   Crassostrea virginica throughout the lifespan},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {111-124},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has a wide salinity tolerance,
   but all life stages are vulnerable to environmental extremes, and
   elevated temperatures can truncate the expected salinity tolerance. The
   rising water temperatures and more intense and variable storm events
   predicted to accompany global climate change therefore raise concerns
   for habitat suitability for ecologically important species such as the
   eastern oyster. To better understand environmental limitations, oysters
   of all life stages were exposed to a range of salinities (0-40) and
   temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C) to test physiological tolerance to
   the combined effects of osmotic and thermal stresses. Elevated
   temperatures (30 degrees C) amplified negative effects during exposure
   to salinity extremes at all life stages; however, tolerance to extremes
   increased with developmental stage (gametes < embryos < larvae < spat <
   adult). Gradual changes allow for a wider tolerance in juvenile oysters
   (spat) compared to acute changes, and short-term reprieves during low
   salinity exposure improved survival rates for adults. Overall, the
   present study found a threshold salinity of 15 for polyhaline oyster
   populations and highlights the importance of both rate of change and
   temperature as critical components of salinity tolerance. Additionally,
   salinities <10 during the summer months could result in negative
   population effects, especially if extreme low salinity occurs during
   peak reproduction when pelagic gametes, embryos, and larvae are most
   vulnerable to environmental stresses. This work will benefit population
   models and inform resource management decisions regarding the timing of
   controlled freshwater releases.},

Title = {Macrocystis pyrifera forest development shapes the physical environment
   through current velocity reduction},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {45-59},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Marine forests of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera create biogenic
   habitat spanning the water column, within which hydrodynamic conditions
   can differ strongly from those outside. Such flow alteration has
   implications for physical, chemical, and ecological processes across
   multiple spatial scales. At the forest-wide scale, M. pyrifera has been
   shown to decrease alongshore current velocities, but relatively little
   is known about how the attenuation of such currents evolves as new kelp
   forests emerge and mature. Here, we quantified alongshore current
   velocities outside and within a temperate rocky reef environment that
   twice underwent a transition from a barren state to one in which a thick
   surface canopy was present. We identified a threshold density during
   forest emergence at which much of the attenuation of alongshore
   depth-averaged velocity occurs- 3 stipes m(-2) with a surface canopy
   present. Incremental increases in damping occur as the forest matures,
   highlighting that relatively young, thin forests can induce
   substantially reduced flows. Additionally, the presence of a young
   forest's subsurface canopy and its subsequent increase in height create
   a seasonally changing profile of varying velocities through the water
   column. These results indicate greater complexity in how canopy-forming
   kelp influence nearshore flow properties than has often been recognized.
   Importantly, emerging forests can alter the nearshore environment
   through modulation of current speeds shortly following initial
   recruitment, with consequences for the transport of larvae, nutrients,
   and sediment throughout the forest and adjacent habitats.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilizer use has led to reductions in air and water
   quality but is essential for increasing crop production. Following the
   4Rs of nutrient management (right: source, rate, timing, and placement),
   specifically following university N rate guidelines, proper urea
   fertilizer management, use of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, and
   splitting up inorganic fertilizer-N applications can minimize potential
   negative environmental effects. Data from a 2019 probability sample
   survey of 465 South Dakota farmers were used to examine how local and
   operational characteristics (geographic location, tillage practice, and
   farm size) are related to the adoption of these four Rs of nutrient
   management practices. Factors included in inorganic N rate decisions
   from most to least were use of preplant soil test N (74\%), yield
   potential (68\%), previous crop credit (48\%), manure credit (25\%), and
   tillage type (16\%). Of all the factors used to make fertilizer-N rate
   decisions, only the use of previous crop and manure credit factors were
   influenced by farm location and tillage method but not farm size. Of all
   respondents, 30\% used urease inhibitors to minimize ammonia (NH3) loss
   and 31\% applied urea before predicted precipitation. However, farms in
   drier, central South Dakota and no-till farms used urease inhibitors and
   applied before predicted precipitation more often than farms in wetter,
   eastern South Dakota and conventional-and reduced-tillage farms, who
   were more likely to use tillage to incorporate urea. To minimize
   leaching and denitrification loss, farms in eastern South Dakota where
   normal rainfall is greater used nitrification inhibitors or slow-release
   fertilizers and split-N applications (48\% and 53\%, respectively),
   while fewer farms in central South Dakota where normal rainfall is less
   used these technologies (34\% and 36\%, respectively). Larger farms more
   frequently used urease and nitrification inhibitors, and/ or
   slow-release fertilizer technologies to minimize N loss. These results
   indicate that local and operational characteristics including geographic
   location, tillage, and farm size influence on-farm decisions concerning
   the adoption of these 4R management practices and should be considered
   when investigating and promoting 4R practices.},

Abstract = {Effective fire and grazing management practices are crucial to the
   restoration of prairie ecosystems, but prairie restoration efforts have
   only recently included bison (Bison bison) reintroduction. Given the
   novelty of such efforts and the importance of grazing in ecosystem
   dynamics, questions remain regarding how human activity and habitat
   management affect bison habitat selection. We radiocollared seven female
   bison at an enclosed restored grassland site in northern Illinois during
   2014-2016 and developed resource selection models to evaluate the
   influence of land cover, fire management, and concentrated human
   activity on habitat selection by bison. To help managers target areas
   for future activities, we used the most-supported model to map predicted
   bison use across the study area. Our results indicated that bison
   habitat selection was primarily driven by the type of restoration
   conducted at a location, with strong selection for partially restored
   prairie and avoidance of nongrassland areas. These results are likely
   due to the expected high relative abundance of perennial grasses at
   partially restored prairie sites in our study area. Our research
   emphasizes the relationship between restoration approaches and grazers
   in prairie ecosystems and underscores the importance of including
   restoration practices in habitat selection research. Additionally, the
   map of predicted bison use highlights areas to focus further management
   and conduct vegetation surveys to ensure grazing is resulting in
   increased plant diversity and species richness. (C) 2022 The Society for

Abstract = {Biogeographical patterns are increasingly modified by the human-driven
   translocation of species, a process that accelerated several centuries
   ago. Observational datasets, however, rarely range back more than a few
   decades, implying that a large part of invasion histories went
   unobserved. Small-sized organisms, like benthic foraminifera, are more
   likely to have been reported only recently due to their lower
   detectability compared to larger-sized organisms. Recently detected
   native species of tropical affinity may have thus been mistaken for
   non-indigenous species due to the lack of evidence of their occurrence
   in pre-invasion records. To uncover the unobserved past of the
   Lessepsian invasion-the entrance of tropical species into the
   Mediterranean through the Suez Canal-we collected sediment cores on the
   southern Israeli shelf. We deployed state-of-the-art radiocarbon
   techniques to date 7 individual foraminiferal tests belonging to 5
   alleged non-indigenous species and show that they are centuries to
   millennia old, thus native. Two additional species previously considered
   non-indigenous occurred in centennial to millennia-old sediments,
   suggesting their native status. The evidence of multiple tropical
   foraminiferal species supposed to be non-indigenous but proved native in
   the eastern Mediterranean suggests either survival in refugia during the
   Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.96-5.33 million years) or, more likely,
   dispersal from the tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific during the
   Pleistocene. In the interglacials of this epoch, higher sea levels may
   have allowed biological connectivity between the Mediterranean and the
   Red Sea for shallow-water species, showing that the Isthmus of Suez was
   possibly a more biologically porous barrier than previously considered.},

Title = {Combined impacts of natural recruitment and active propagation for coral
   population recovery on the Great Barrier Reef},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {95-109},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are experiencing
   long-term shifts in size structure, including steep declines in small
   colonies, driving major concerns for recovery through the supply of new
   recruits. Whilst coral restoration began on the GBR in 2018, the
   combined influence of natural recruitment and outplanting for coral
   population recovery has not been evaluated. Here, we assessed 2 sites
   (Rayban and Mojo) at Opal Reef that were subject to intensive outplant
   efforts over a 3 yr period (2018-2021). Coral cover did not change
   significantly, with a baseline of 15\% in 2018 and a cover of 28 and
   25\% in Rayban outplant and control areas, respectively, in 2021, while
   Mojo exhibited a coral cover of 38\% in 2018 and 52\% (outplant area)
   and 29\% (control area) in 2021. Natural recruitment in 2021 did not
   vary by site and was characterised by a settlement rate of 5.5 and 3.7
   recruits tile-1 at Rayban and Mojo, respectively. Juvenile coral
   abundance and diversity were similar for control and outplant areas at
   each site. Over the 3 yr period, coral cover as a metric did not
   identify differences between control and outplant areas; however,
   size-frequency distributions of key coral taxa revealed a higher
   frequency of small to mid-sized colonies in outplant communities
   compared to controls. Given that no differences were observed in
   recruitment rates or juvenile abundances, variations in population
   structure appear to be driven by planting efforts rather than natural
   recovery. Our results demonstrate the need for combined monitoring of
   natural versus intervention-based rehabilitation to understand the
   impact of coral propagation efforts for local site recovery.},

Title = {Effects of N-enriched biochar on ecosystem greenhouse gas emissions,
   rice yield, and bacterial community diversity in subtropical rice paddy
   soils},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Nitrogen (N)-enriched biochar is a novel type of biochar prepared by
   mixing biomass with N-rich sources at a higher temperature via
   pyrolysis. Although the agronomic benefits of N-enriched biochar are
   reportedly positive, its effects on GHG emissions, crop yields, and soil
   bacterial communities in rice paddy fields remain undefined. This study
   examines the short-time effects of adding different rates of N-enriched
   biochar (0, 4, and 8 t ha-1) to subtropical early and late rice cropping
   soils on GHG emissions - namely carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4),
   rice yields, and soil bacteria communities. Across the two seasons,
   cumulative CO2 emissions increased under both biochar treatments while
   cumulative CH4 emissions declined with the application of biochar at 8 t
   ha-1. Early rice's global warming potential increased by 86 and 21\%
   following application of biochar at 4 and 8 t ha-1, respectively, and by
   43 and 41\%, respectively, in late rice. Rice yields significantly (P <
   0.05) increased with the application of 4 t N-enriched biochar ha-1
   while rates at 8 t ha-1 had no effect. Application of N -enriched
   biochar altered the relative abundance of dominant bacterial taxa
   related to N and C cycling, partic-ularly of denitrifying Rhodanobacter
   and Sphingomona in early and late rice soils, respectively. Furthermore,
   both rates of N-enriched biochar raised the relative abundance of
   Thiobacillus and Lysobacter in early and late rice-the latter associated
   with rice yields-while reducing Streptomyces and H16 taxa. Overall,
   findings suggest that the application of 4t ha-1 nitrogen-enriched
   biochar can increase rice yield and reduce CH4 emissions while increased
   soil cumulative C emissions GWP caused by CO2 emission increase, in part
   via biochar-induced changes on the plant growth characteristics and
   soil's bacterial community. This study reflects that the application of
   moderate doses of biochar can become an important sustainable soil
   management method for rice fields in subtropical regions, and the
   application of exogenous organic nutrients can promote crop yields and
   reduce GHC emissions. Now, a long-term experiment would be required to
   assess what is the optimal yearly frequency of application of these
   moderate doses of biochar.},

Title = {Leaf traits from stomata to morphology are associated with climatic and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1115-1127},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Aims Understanding variation and coordination of leaf traits at
   multiscales along elevational gradients can help predict the likely
   responses of dominant species to climate change. We seek to determine
   the extent to which variation in leaf stomatal, anatomical and
   morphological traits is associated with environmental factors, and
   whether ecological strategies of Cyclobalanopsis species shift with
   elevations. Methods In a tropical forest landscape in Jianfengling,
   South China, we determined leaf traits related to stomata, anatomy and
   morphology of six evergreen oak species (Cyclobalanopsis bambusaefolia,
   C. hui, C. patelliformis, C. fleuryi, C. tiaoloshanica and C. phanera)
   along a long elevational gradient (400-1400 m above sea level).
   Important Findings We found that stomatal density and stomatal pore
   index increased, whereas spongy mesophyll thickness to leaf thickness
   ratios decreased, significantly with elevation. The leaf area and leaf
   dry matter content increased and decreased, respectively, with
   elevation. Variations in stomatal, anatomical and morphological traits
   were mainly correlated to the mean annual temperature, mean annual sum
   precipitation and soil pH. At low and high elevations, the oak species
   exhibited strong stress tolerance combined with competition strategy,
   while they shifted toward more clearly the competitive strategy at
   intermediate elevations. And the changes in soil phosphorus
   concentration and soil pH along the elevation may drive the shift of
   ecological strategy. The results showed that the dominant oak species in
   tropical forests respond to environmental change by modulating traits at
   multiple levels, from that of the individual cell, through tissue and up
   to the whole leaf scale.},

Title = {Short-term soil physical responses to grazing and cover crops in an

Abstract = {Cover crops (CCs) and grazing play critical roles in the successful
   implementa-tion of integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLSs) because
   they can have a direct impact on soil functions. The present study was
   conducted to assess the short-term impacts of CCs and grazing on soil
   physical and hydrological properties. Two sites (Northern-Brookings and
   Northwestern-Brookings) were established in 2016 and 2017, respectively,
   in South Dakota, United States. The specific objective was to evaluate
   the impact of CCs and grazed CCs under oat (Avena sativa L.)/CCs-corn
   (Zea mays L.) rotation on soil physical and hydrological properties.
   Study treatments included (1) legume-dominated CC (LdC), (2)
   cattle-grazed LdC (LdC+G), (3) grass-dominated CC (GdC), (4)
   cattle-grazed GdC (GdC+G), and (5) no CC and no grazing (NC). After two
   to three years of management, CCs and grazing did not impact soil
   organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks, and their values at
   approx-imate depth of 0 to 20 cm ranged from 50.9 to 60.6 Mg C ha-1 and
   3.65 to 4.92 Mg N ha-1, respectively, among the treatments at each site.
   Cover crops decreased soil bulk density (rho b) at 0 to 10 cm and 10 to
   20 cm depths and, in general, increased soil water retention (SWR),
   total porosity, and quasi-steady infiltration rate (Northern-Brookings
   only) compared to the NC. Cattle grazing of CC generally increased rho b
   and reduced SWR and porosity compared with the ungrazed CC but not to
   the often-perceived detrimental levels. Our findings showed that CCs can
   improve some aspects of soil physical health in the short term and that
   grazing of CCs and crop residue did not cause substantial physical
   damage to the soil under the condi-tions of these experiments.},

Title = {Blanket bog CO2 flux driven by plant functional type during summer
   drought},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Recent climate predictions for the United Kingdom expect a nationwide
   shift towards drier and warmer summers, increasing the risk of more
   frequent and severe drought events. Such shifts in weather patterns
   impede functioning of global peatlands, especially rare intact blanket
   bogs abundant in Scotland and representing nearly a quarter of the UK's
   soil carbon. In this in situ study, carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from
   dominant peatland plant functional types (PFTs) such as Sphagnum spp.,
   graminoids, ericoids and other key cover types (i.e., pools and bare
   peat) were measured and compared across upland and low-lying blanket bog
   margins and centres, immediately before and during a summer drought in
   2018, and over the subsequent year. During that period, most sites acted
   as net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. Our results showed that net
   ecosystem exchange (NEE) was limited by water availability during the
   drought, with ericoid shrubs showing the highest drought resilience,
   followed by graminoids (which were still limited in GPP in 2019) and
   Sphagnum mosses. Diverging NEE estimates were observed across centre and
   margin areas of the blanket bogs, with highest variability across the
   upland site where signs of active erosion were visible. Overall, our
   study suggests that estimating growing season carbon fluxes from in situ
   peatland PFT and cover types can help us better understand global
   climate change impacts on the dynamics and trajectories of peatland C
   cycles.},

Title = {Integrating satellite altimeter data and geomorphic in-stream flow tool
   to assess reach average hydraulic habitat of the Ganga River dolphin},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Ganga River ecosystem is under severe anthropogenic stress. Flow
   regulations through structural barriers alter the geomorphic and
   hydraulic geometry of riverine habitats. Determining the ecological
   health of river habitats under the contemporary modification is
   detrimental to its restoration and management. This study evaluates
   reach averaged hydraulic habitat of the endangered Ganga River dolphin
   (Platanista gangetica) in a stretch between Bijnor and Narora barrages.
   We consider an optimal minimum flow depth as the determining factor of
   habitat suitability. Field measurement of the hydraulic geometry and
   flow characteristics show that the optimal flow depth is available in
   the study reach during the monsoon period, while in the pre-monsoon, the
   minimum depth is present only in the reach upstream to Narora barrage.
   We use a geomorphic instream flow tool (GIFT) and satellite altimeter
   water level data to simulate reach averaged hydraulic habitat in varying
   flow conditions in area upstream of Narora barrage. We observe that to
   maintain the minimum flow depth which supports the dolphin habitat in
   the study reach, an optimal discharge of about >280 m3s-1\$\$
   >280\textbackslash{} \{m\}<\^{}>3\{s\}<\^{}>\{-1\} \$\$ is essential.
   Furthermore, we develop a water-level (altimeter) and discharge
   (simulated from GIFT) rating curve for the study reach. It can be used
   to get a first-order estimate of discharge for a given water level or
   vice versa. This study indicates that the altimetry datasets are good
   precursors for estimating averaged hydraulic habitat of rivers in the
   data-scarce regions. The application of altimeter data can be a boon in
   the effective management of river habitat health over a reach scale.},

Title = {Sapwood and heartwood are not isolated compartments: Consequences for
   isotope ecohydrology},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In most tree species, xylem consists of two different functional parts:
   sapwood and heartwood. While sapwood, as the flowpath for sap, has
   received more attention in isotope studies assessing water sources
   accessed by trees (e.g. soil water from different depths, groundwater,
   stream water or a mixture of these), much remains unknown about
   heartwood and the possible water exchange between the two functional
   parts. We investigated four tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus
   petraea, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea abies) characterised by
   different xylem anatomy and timing of physiological activity to evaluate
   the degree of differentiation in isotopic composition of water between
   sapwood and heartwood on a biweekly time scale. We found that the
   sapwood and heartwood of all species displayed a concurrent variation in
   their isotopic composition throughout the growing season and on a
   day-night scale suggesting that the two are not isolated compartments.
   While the two functional parts display a consistent difference in
   isotopic composition in conifers, they are characterised by more similar
   values in broadleaved species in broadleaved species, suggesting a
   higher degree of water exchange. Furthermore, we have also observed a
   progressive change in the isotopic composition in broadleaved species
   with sampling depth rather than functional parts of xylem. Our study
   highlights the value of accounting for radial isotopic variation, which
   might potentially lead to uncertainties concerning the origin of the
   extracted water for water uptake studies.},

Abstract = {The escalating anthropogenic activities in recent decades are constantly
   affecting the aquatic ecology and posing a threat to freshwater species.
   In this study, a two-dimensional ecohydraulic model and multiple
   criteria decision analysis (MCDA) coupled framework is employed in the
   Dikhow River, India, to investigate the favourable habitat condition for
   the nearly threatened Notopterus chitala fish locally known as Chital
   fish. The habitat residence suitability and habitat suitability indices
   are calculated at the observed and ecological flows. The ecological flow
   rates are computed from flow duration curve shifting and flow duration
   curve analysis methods. The hydrodynamic computations are carried out
   using a 1D-2D coupled MIKE FLOOD model. The habitat assessment of the
   targeted species is carried out by constructing the suitability curves
   from the computed hydraulic parameters at different environmental
   management conditions. Results from the habitat assessment curves
   indicate that the maximum habitat suitability index is found for the
   targeted fish species at average annual flow. Based on the MCDA
   analysis, the outer banks of the meander zones are identified as not
   suitable residence regions for the target species. This study revealed
   that the coupled approach could be useful to regulate the stream
   restoration strategies and identify potential habitat preference
   locations in the domain.},

Abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes are strongly influenced by litter
   inputs in natural ecosystems. However, general responses of soil N pools
   and fluxes to litter inputs from both above- and belowground are still
   lacking at a global scale. Here, we compiled 2791 paired observations
   from 145 published articles to assess global effects of altered leaf
   litter and roots inputs on soil N pools and fluxes. We found that litter
   addition increased soil N pools and fluxes globally, with a 30.6\%
   increase in soil microbial biomass N (MBN) pool, a 28.9\% increase in
   dissolved organic N (DON) pool, a 15.8\% increase in ammonia (NH4+) pool
   and a 12.6\% increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. In contrast, litter
   removal decreased soil MBN, DON and nitrate (NO3-) pools and N2O fluxes
   by 9.6\%, 9.2\%, 9.1\% and 16.9\%, respectively. Moreover, the increases
   in soil N pools in response to leaf litter addition and root removal
   were greater than their decreases in response to leaf litter removal.
   Soil N pools in forests, especially mixed forests, responded more
   positively to litter addition than those in grasslands. However, the
   negative effects of litter removal on soil N pools were contingent upon
   environmental conditions. In particular, the negative effects of litter
   removal on soil DON and NO3- pools were stronger in region with warmer
   and wetter climates and in soils with higher pH. Our synthesis
   highlights the globally positive effects of litter inputs on soil N
   pools and fluxes and the importance of litter type, climate factors and
   soil pH in understanding soil N pools and fluxes responses. These
   changes have important implications for soil N supply under global
   change-induced increases in litterfall.},

Abstract = {Soil and topographic variability severely influence agricultural
   productivity and food security in a mountainous agroecosystem.
   Understanding these soil spatial disparities are important to optimize
   suitable land use planning and adoption of appropriate conserva-tion
   practices to ensure sustainable agricultural productivity in mountainous
   regions. A field survey and sampling of 108 elevation sites were
   conducted to assess spatial dynamics and influence of prevalent tillage
   systems on selected soil attributes and on reported maize (Zea mays L.)
   grain yield (MGY) in mountainous valleys of Pakistan. Measured soil
   properties were effective soil depth (ESD), soil penetration resistance
   (SPR), soil bulk density (SBD), fraction of rock fragments (FRF), soil
   organic matter (SOM), and soil water holding capacity (SWHC).
   Additionally, the influence of three existing tillage systems-integrated
   tillage (IT), bullock tillage (BT), and tractor tillage (TT)-on soil
   properties and MGY were assessed. Research results showed that ESD, SPR,
   SBD, FRF, SOM, SWHC, and MGY varied from 15.0 to 40.0 cm, 180.0 to 278.0
   psi, 0.9 to 1.7 g cm-3, 13.2\% to 43.5\%, 0.6\% to 2.9\%, 10.5\% to
   35.6\%, and 4.1 to 10.2 t ha-1, respectively. Differences between soil
   parameters were signif-icant among the sampling sites studied. Soil
   properties were found to be strongly associated with each other and with
   the MGY and were grouped through Pearson correlation, principal
   component analysis, and heatmap. Moreover, significant variation of soil
   properties was noted due to the tillage systems adopted by the farmers.
   The ESD (26.8 cm), SOM (1.4\%), SWHC (16.9\%), and MGY (7.8 t ha-1) were
   the highest under IT while the SPR (262.8 psi), SBD (1.6 g cm-3), and
   FRF (38.0\%) were the greatest with TT compared to the other tillage
   sys-tems. Findings of this study are imperative for agriculturists, soil
   managers, land use planners, and policy makers to identify and implement
   suitable interventions for sustainable use of agri-cultural lands to
   bring economic produce while conserving the mountainous agroecosystem
   and its resources on sustainable basis.},

Abstract = {The Arctic marine ecosystem is changing fast due to climate change,
   emphasizing the need for solid ecological baselines and monitoring. The
   polar cod Boreogadus saida functions as a key species in the Arctic
   marine food web. We investigated the stomach contents of polar cod from
   the northern Barents Sea using DNA metabarcoding with the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase I gene in parallel with classical visual analysis.
   Arctic amphipods and krill dominated the diet in both methods. Yet,
   metabarcoding allowed for the identification of digested and
   unidentifiable prey and provided higher taxonomic resolution, revealing
   new and undiscovered prey items of polar cod in the area. Furthermore,
   molecular results suggest a higher importance of barnacles and fish
   (presumably eggs and pelagic larvae) in the diet than previously
   recorded. Parasites and, in 6 cases, other prey items were only visually
   identified, demonstrating the complementary nature of both approaches.
   The presence of temperate and boreal prey species such as northern krill
   and (early life stages of) European flounder and European plaice
   illustrates the advection of boreal taxa into the polar region or may be
   indicative of ongoing borealisation in the Barents Sea. We show that a
   combination of visual analysis and metabarcoding provides complementary
   and semi-quantitative dietary information and integrative insights to
   monitor changing marine food webs.},

Abstract = {Aims To explore whether grazing-induced legacy effects on plants could
   benefit plants adaptation to drought. Methods A water-controlled
   experiment was conducted in the greenhouse, which with Agropyron
   cristatum and Carex korshinskyi collected from free-grazing and enclosed
   plots on a typical grassland in Inner Mongolia. Important Findings We
   found that A. cristatum and C. korshinskyi collected from the
   free-grazing plot were less affected by drought in terms of ramet
   biomass, ramet number and total biomass than those collected from the
   enclosed plot. The enhanced adaptation to drought for plants collected
   from the free-grazing plot should partly be ascribed to the larger root
   biomass allocation plasticity under drought treatment. Our findings
   suggest that grazing management can be used to improve the adaptation of
   grassland plants to climate change.},

Title = {Changes in community assembly processes and co-occurrence networks of
   soil diazotrophs along an elevational gradient in Tibetan alpine meadows},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Shifts in soil microbial community composition along elevational
   gradients have been extensively studied; yet, the assembly process and
   co-occurrence network of soil microbes underlying these shifts remain to
   be explored, especially for diazotrophs that contribute to the most
   nitrogen input in natural ecosystems. In this study, we examined how
   assembly processes and co-occurrence networks of soil diazotrophs
   changed along an elevational gradient with four elevation levels ranging
   from 3200 m to 3800 m using high-throughput sequencing of the nifH gene
   in Tibetan alpine meadows. Our analyses showed that alpha-diversity of
   soil diazotrophs was lower at low elevations (i.e., 3200 m and 3400 m)
   relative to high elevations (i.e., 3600 m and 3800 m). Moreover,
   dominant diazotrophic phyla shifted from Actinobacteria at low
   elevations to Proteobacteria at high elevations. The change in
   diazotrophic community composition along the elevation gradient was
   related to the differences in soil temperature, moisture, NH4+-N
   concentration and pH. Species rank-abundance distribution models showed
   that soil diazotrophic communities were mainly assembled by
   deterministic processes at 3200 m, 3600 m and 3800 m elevations, and by
   stochastic processes at the 3400 elevation. Additionally, the complexity
   of diazotrophic co-occurrence networks increased with increasing
   elevations. Collectively, our findings highlight the change in soil
   diazotrophic communities along the elevation gradient and the high
   environmental sensitivity of soil diazotrophs, and suggest that global
   change could have consequences for soil diazotrophic community
   compo-sition and structure in montane ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Carrion production is one of the most crucial yet neglected and
   understudied processes in food webs and ecosystems. In this study, we
   performed a large-scale estimation of the maximum potential production
   and spatial distribution of ungulate carrion biomass from five major
   sources in peninsular Spain, both anthropogenic (livestock, big game
   hunting, roadkills) and natural (predation, natural mortality). Using
   standardized ungulate carrion biomass (kg/year/100km(2)) estimates, we
   evaluated the relationship between ungulate carrion production and two
   ecosystem-level factors: global human modification (GHM) and primary
   productivity (NDVI). We found that anthropogenic carrion sources
   supplied about 60 times more ungulate carrion biomass than natural
   sources (mean = 90,172 vs. 1533 kg/year/100km(2), respectively). Within
   anthropogenic carrion sources, livestock was by far the major carrion
   provider (91.1\% of the annual production), followed by big game hunting
   (7.86\%) and roadkills (0.05\%). Within natural carrion sources,
   predation of ungulates provided more carrion (0.81\%) than natural
   mortality (0.13\%). Likewise, we found that the spatial distribution of
   carrion differed among carrion sources, with anthropogenic carrion being
   more aggregated in space than natural carrion. Our models showed that
   GHM was positively related to carrion production from livestock and
   roadkills, and that wild ungulate carrion supplied by natural sources
   and big game hunting was more frequently generated in more productive
   areas (higher NDVI). These findings indicate a disconnection between the
   main ungulate carrion source (livestock) and primary productivity.
   Ongoing socio-economic changes in developed countries (for example
   increase of intensive livestock husbandry and rewilding processes) could
   lead to additional alteration of carrion production processes, with
   potential negative impacts at the community and ecosystem levels.
   Overall, we highlight that carrion biomass quantification should be
   considered a crucial tool in evaluating ecosystem health and delineating
   efficient ecosystem management guidelines in the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {Brood parasitic cuckoos and their hosts serve as model systems for
   studying host-parasite coevolution. Egg-rejection behavior constitutes
   an effective defense against brood parasitism, but some host species
   show phenotypic plasticity in egg-rejection behavior. Direct exposure to
   a cuckoo near the nest can increase egg-rejection likelihood, and
   long-term studies have shown that increased the egg-rejection rates
   generally correlate with higher parasite prevalence. However, it remains
   unclear whether such increases result from interactions between
   parasites and hosts, as these can be surprisingly common, or whether the
   mere presence of cuckoos in the breeding area is sufficient. Daurian
   redstarts Phoenicurus auroreus are a common host of the common cuckoo
   Cuculus canorus that defend against cuckoo parasitism mainly by ejecting
   the parasitic egg from the nest. This species is unique, as its first
   breeding attempt of the year takes place before the arrival of cuckoos,
   excluding the possibility for direct interactions. We simulated the
   ambient presence of cuckoos or hoopoes Upupa epops (control) in
   sub-populations of redstarts during their first egg-laying period by
   presenting taxidermic models and playing back vocalizations. Redstarts
   in cuckoo-treated plots showed significantly higher egg-ejection rates
   than individuals in control plots, even though females in both groups
   were equally likely to recognize the parasitic egg. Among females that
   did recognize the parasitic egg, those exposed to the cuckoo treatment
   were more likely to eject it than those exposed to the control
   treatment. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that the mere presence
   of cuckoos in the environment is sufficient to provoke egg-ejection
   behavior.
   Perceived presence of cuckoos in the environment is sufficient to
   produce egg-ejection behavior by Daurian redstarts. We presented
   taxidermy models and play-backs of vocalizations of common cuckoos to
   Daurian redstarts (with exposure to hoopoes as a control), prior to the
   cuckoos' arrival at the breeding ground. Redstarts exposed to cuckoos
   were both more likely to eject a foreign egg and to eject it more
   quickly than redstarts exposed to hoopoes.},

Abstract = {Animals that regularly traverse habitat extremes between the subtropics
   and subarctic are expected to exhibit foraging behaviors that respond to
   changes in dynamic ocean habitats, and these behaviors may facilitate
   adaptations to novel and changing climates. During the
   chick-provisioning stage, Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis
   parents regularly undertake short- and long-distance foraging trips
   throughout the vast central North Pacific Ocean. We examined GPS
   tracking data among chick-provisioning albatrosses in Hawai'i to
   characterize habitats during short- and long-distance trips. The study
   period encompassed a marine heatwave (2014) and the cooling period after
   an extreme El Nino event (2016), enabling us to examine foraging
   habitats under novel and changing climates. First passage time and
   generalized additive mixed models indicated that during 183 short and
   110 long trips (n = 32 birds), wind-assisted flight efficiency,
   proximity to productive areas, and moonlit-searching were important in
   both subtropical and subarctic habitats. Laysan albatross took foraging
   trips that had similar lengths and durations in 2014 and 2016 and
   visited similar areas, indicating that their foraging range did not
   expand in response to climatic variability. A strategy that uses similar
   foraging areas across years combined with reliance on environmental
   processes that enhance flight efficiency (wind) and that enable
   searching behaviors (moonlight) indicate that Laysan albatross exhibit
   complex behavioral plasticity that allows them to utilize subtropical
   and subarctic habitats affected by dynamic climate variability. This
   strategy may benefit their ability to respond to oceanographic and
   climatic change, including expanding warm water regions and changing
   atmospheric conditions influenced by global warming.},

Abstract = {Aim. Study of the growth dynamics of Dianthus awaricus plants in field
   experimental conditions and of laboratory germination of seeds obtained
   in the introduction experiment.Material and Methods. Samples of D.
   awaricus seeds collected in natural populations along the altitudinal
   ecocline from 820 to 1,720 m above sea level served as the material for
   the study. To study the field germination and growth dynamics of the
   plants, D. awaricus seeds were sown at two experimental bases of the
   Mountain Botanical Garden (at 1,100 and 1,750 m above sea level).
   Evaluation of laboratory germination was carried out using seeds
   collected at the Tsudakhar base.Results. Comparative characteristics of
   the average values of the shoot length and the number of lateral
   branches of the studied samples showed that the differences between the
   populations are significant. The monthly increase in D. awaricus plants
   of different accessions also differs. Monthly variability of the shoot
   length of D. awaricus in the tested accessions is at a high level, the
   expressivity of which, apparently, is significantly affected by a
   complex of environmental factors. A study of the germination of D.
   awaricus seeds showed that it is higher under laboratory conditions than
   under experimental field conditions. The highest percentage of seed
   germination was observed in the ``Gunib{''} sample: 64.0\% in the
   laboratory and 28.6\% in the field at the Tsudakhar base.Conclusions.
   Differences were noted in growth dynamics in the studied samples of D.
   awaricus studied, apparently due to a complex of abiotic and biotic
   environmental factors. For the ``Tsudakhar{''} samples the experimental
   conditions and place of collection of seed material were identical but
   for the other two samples they were different from their natural
   habitat. The low field germination of D. awaricus seeds is probably due
   to the negative impact of winter drought and adverse weather conditions
   in the spring.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {As critical drivers of ecosystem functionality, soil fauna are sensitive
   to soil management such as organic amendments. However, the effects of
   organic amendments on soil fauna communities are poorly understood.
   Here, we evaluated the differentiated responses of soil arthropod
   communities to the application of biogas slurry (BS) and biochar (BC) in
   a newly established poplar plantation on reclaimed coastal land.
   Compared with the control, the application of BS increased the abundance
   of soil arthropods by 113-253\%, whereas the application of BC decreased
   it by 35-74\%. Furthermore, the total taxonomic richness and Shannon
   index of the soil ar-thropods increased under the BS treatments and
   decreased under a high-dose BC treatment. Arthropod abun-dance and
   diversity under the BS treatments correlated with the increased biomass
   (46-76\%) of leaf litterfall, fine roots, and undergrowth vegetation,
   elevated soil water and nitrogen concentrations (28-254\%), as well as
   neutralized soil pH. In contrast, arthropod abundance and diversity
   under the BC treatments were correlated with decreased fine root biomass
   and increased soil alkalinity. These results suggested that BS and BC
   appli-cations exert different effects on arthropod communities, probably
   linked with the differential direction and extent of the modification on
   plant food resource and soil variables in the newly reclaimed coastal
   lands.},

Abstract = {Climate change has strongly increased the fire frequency in
   Mediterranean forests causing changes in soil bacterial, fungal and
   microarthropod communities. Fire impacts on soil properties depend on
   vegetation covers. In this framework, the aim of this research was to
   evaluate the effects of fire on bacterial, fungal communities and
   microarthropod community in soils under trees and shrubs in a
   Mediterranean area. Surface soil cores were sampled in unburnt and burnt
   (three years since fire occurrence) patches in the Vesuvius National
   Park trees (Quercus ilex L. and Pinus nigra L.) and shrubs (Ginesta sp.,
   Myrtus communis L., Laurus nobilis L.). Samples were analyzed for
   abiotic (pH, water content and concentrations of C, N, C-org, P, NO2-,
   NH4+ and P-avail) and biotic (bacterial and fungal biomasses, and
   density, taxa richness, diversity, evenness and QBS-ar of
   microarthropods) properties. Results showed that, three years since
   fire, the abiotic properties were recovered in shrub stands but not yet
   in tree stands. Fire stimulated the development of bacteria only in
   shrub stands; no effects were observed for the fungal community in both
   shrub and tree stands; the amount and the taxa richness of
   microarthropods recovered to the values of the pre-fire conditions in
   both the stands. In conclusion, in the investigated area, fire
   differently impacted the vegetation covers, making soils under trees
   more similar to shrubs with the consequence to reduce the differences
   between the vegetation covers.},

Abstract = {Temperate-climate insects vary in overwintering life stages even within
   local communities, but factors driving this variation are not well
   understood. We studied the density and overwintering stages of insects
   in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and generated a
   phylogenetic tree of the insects based on DNA barcoding. The total
   number of studied individuals (of all four stages) was 2211; they
   belonged to 88 species, 36 families and 6 orders. Insect overwintering
   stages were phylogenetically conserved across species, primarily because
   particular stages dominated in related orders or families. In addition,
   immobile egg and pupal stages were common in the topsoil layer, whereas
   larvae and adults occurred generally in the top and deep soil layers;
   and larvae were often larger in the lower than in the upper soil layers.
   Thus, the stages of overwintering insects are evolutionally conserved
   despite their associations with physical parameters (e.g., soil
   temperature) or species traits (e.g., body size).},

Title = {Rancher Experiences and Perceptions of Climate Change in the Western

Abstract = {Ranchers in the western United States have long managed working
   landscapes prone to drought and wildfires. As the frequency and
   intensity of climate change impacts increase, ranchers will be
   front-line workers in the climate crisis-both adapting to climate
   impacts and managing landscapes with mitigation potential. This Forum
   paper first summarizes recent peer-reviewed research on ranchers and
   climate change in the western United States and then offers conceptual
   clarification of climate change adaptation based on this empirical
   research. Many ranchers remain unconvinced by climate science and
   express skepticism about long-term and anthropogenic climate change,
   though this may change as climate extremes intensify. Researchers
   working with ranchers often avoid climate change terminology, instead
   focusing on impacts, especially drought. Ranchers adjust their land and
   livestock management practices, as well as livelihood strategies, to
   cope with weather variability. Ranchers identify increasing management
   flexibility and diversifying ranch income as key adaptation strategies.
   While studies often focus on how to transition ranchers from reactive
   and toward proactive adaptation planning, few ranchers are actively
   planning for climatic change. Yet in this ranching context, many
   practices that begin as reactive coping strategies become longer-term
   adaptations as the impact, such as drought or recurrent wildfire smoke,
   persists. As ranchers observe positive outcomes of short-term
   adaptations or are unable to return to previous strategies, reactive
   coping strategies become proactive. We provide a conceptual
   clarification of adaptation in ranching systems, forwarding adaptation
   as a process, inclusive of a continuum from coping actions to more
   transformative adaptation strategies. Centering ranchers' experiences,
   perceptions, and responses related to climate change can help land
   managers, agricultural advisors, and policy makers increase the pace and
   scale of adaptation and mitigation in range systems. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Effect of Defoliation Frequency on Rytidosperma Virescens Plants and

Abstract = {Rangelands provide different ecosystem services to satisfy human needs.
   Although grazing management in southern Patagonia is mostly
   characterized by extensive continuous grazing, rotational grazing
   management may improve plant productivity and its associated microbiome.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses play an important role in the
   functioning of arid rangelands. However, in most arid and semiarid
   grasslands, little is known about the environment-plant-symbiont
   interaction under different defoliation frequencies and contrasting
   growth conditions. In this context, the objective of the present study
   was to evaluate the response of Rytidosperma virescens native grass and
   the associated AM fungi under different defoliation frequency treatments
   (plants undefoliated, two clippings with 50-d intervals between
   defoliations, four clippings with 30-d intervals, and six clippings with
   21-d intervals) and two growth conditions (field and greenhouse) in a
   150-d experiment. Defoliation frequency with 21-d clipping intervals
   negatively affected plants and AM colonization. We found a negative
   linear relationship between AM colonization and removal of aboveground
   biomass and a positive relationship with root biomass and leaf area of
   R. virescens plants. We determined that the appropriate recovery period
   for rotational grazing systems should be at least 50 d (threshold) to
   optimize forage production and AM symbiosis during spring-summer
   seasons. Sustainable grazing management practices should be designed to
   improve or restore AM communities to maintain positive feedback with
   plant development. (C) 2022 The Society for Range Management. Published

Abstract = {Epiphytes, which grow on other plants for support, make up a large
   portion of Earth's plant diversity. Like other plants, their surfaces
   and interiors are colonized by diverse assemblages of fungi that can
   benefit their hosts by increasing tolerance for abiotic stressors and
   resistance to disease or harm them as pathogens. Fungal communities
   associated with epiphytic plants and the processes that structure these
   communities are poorly known. To address this, we sampled seven
   epiphytic seedless plant taxa in a Costa Rican rainforest and examined
   the effects of host identity and microhabitat on external and endophytic
   fungal communities. We found low host specificity for both external and
   endophytic fungi and weak differentiation between epiphytic and
   neighboring epilithic plant hosts. High turnover in fungi within and
   between hosts and habitats reveals that epiphytic plant-associated
   fungal communities are highly diverse and suggests that they are
   structured by stochastic processes.Abstract in Spanish is available with

   SARS-COV-2 replication.Material and Methods. The laboratory strain
   SARS-CoV-2/human/RUS/Nsk-FRCFTM-1/2020 was passivated on Vero cell
   culture. For the preparation of water extracts six types of experimental
   tea compositions (not containing flavorings) based on black and green
   tea or flowers of hibiscus as well as individual ingredients were used.
   Antiviral (inhibitory) activity of plant raw materials was studied in
   vitro according to the classical scheme of neutralization (inactivation)
   of the virus.Results. When compared with the main control sample of an
   aqueous extract of chaga (Inonotus obliquus) with a 50\% effective
   concentration equal to 13.72 +/- 2.99 mu g/ml against 103 TCPD50/ml of
   SARS-CoV-2, superior activity was found for extracts of the spice
   Syzygium aromaticum L. and black tea from Nepal. Approximately equal
   inhibitory activity was detected for extracts of tea compositions based
   on black tea with the addition of the grass Thymus altaicus and the
   spice S. aromaticum L. or with the addition of seeds of Carum carvi L.
   and the root of Angelica archangelica L. In addition, such activity was
   detected for extracts of tea compositions based on green tea from China
   with the addition of leaves of Mentha piperita L. and flowers of
   Lavandula angustifolia MILL. or with the addition of the peel of Citrus
   sinensis L. and seeds of Pimpinella anisum L. Extracts from individual
   plant raw materials used to make tea compositions were black teas from
   India, Argentina, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, leaves of M. piperita L. and
   flowers of L. angustifolia MILL. Cetraria islandica lichen, green tea
   and berries of Oxycoccus also showed antiviral activity.Conclusion. The
   results obtained suggest that tea compositions based on black and green
   tea with the addition of various plant raw materials in the form of a
   regular drink can be useful to people with COVID-19 infection.},

Abstract = {Aim. To analyse the data on spreading and population of the common
   hamster in Western Siberia from the mid-20th to early 21st centuries and
   to determine the major predictors affecting these parameters.Material
   and Methods. Long-term data on species' population from the Zoomonitor
   Databank (Institute of Systematics and Ecology of Animals of the
   Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, ISEA SB RAS),
   populace survey data and field observations provided by scholars over
   recent years were used. The maximum entropy method was used to model the
   species' ecological niche and range based on 82 common hamster sighting
   spots in Western Siberia. 19 bioclimatic factors as well as various soil
   types were used.Results. The reduction of range and threefold decrease
   of common hamster population until the 90s of the last century and a
   local increase in the number of the population at the beginning of the
   21st century were noted. The main causes of the population decline
   include extensive extermination through the procurement of common
   hamster fur skins and limiting the harm caused as well as agricultural
   area size dynamics. The bioclimatic correlations revealed of the
   distribution of the common hamster, considered together with models of
   climate changes, suggest the possibility of common hamster obsolescence
   in modern steppe areas and its according repopulation of the large river
   bottomlands to the north of the current range.Conclusion. For the Asian

Title = {Black and orange coloration predict success during male-male competition

Abstract = {Investigating how intrasexual competition and intersexual mate choice
   act within a system is crucial to understanding the maintenance and
   diversity of sexually-dimorphic traits. These two processes can act in
   concert by selecting for the same trait, or in opposition by selecting
   for different extremes of the same trait; they can also act on different
   traits, potentially increasing trait complexity. We asked whether
   male-male competition and female mate choice act on the same male traits
   using Trinidadian guppies, which exhibit sexual size dimorphism and
   male-limited color patterns consisting of different colors arranged
   along the body and fins. We used behavioral assays to assess the
   relationship between color and competitive success and then compared our
   results to the plethora of data on female choice and color in our study
   population. Males initiated more contests if they were larger than their
   competitor. Males won contests more often if they had more black
   coloration than their competitor, and the effect of black was stronger
   when males had less orange than their competitor. Additionally, males
   won more often if they had either more structural color (iridescence)
   and more orange, or less structural color and less orange than their
   competitor, suggesting multiple combinations of color traits predict
   success. Females from our study population exhibit a strong preference
   for more orange coloration. Thus, traits favored in male contests differ
   from those favored by intersexual selection in this population. These
   results suggest that inter- and intrasexual selection, when acting
   concurrently, can promote increased complexity of sexually selected
   traits.
   Mate choice and mate competition can favor different extremes of a
   trait, or different traits altogether. Female Trinidadian guppies from
   the Paria River prefer males with high amounts of orange color and large
   tail fins. Here, we show that male-male competition instead favors large
   males with more black and less orange on their body. The conflicting
   selection pressures generated by female choice and male-male competition
   may therefore explain the complexity of male guppy color pattern.},

Abstract = {To forage optimally, deer select individual plants highest in limiting
   nutrients, while avoiding individuals that are high in anti-herbivore
   defenses. For some woody species, deer may selectively browse on larger
   stems, which can provide a larger amount of younger, more nutritious
   tissue per individual. However, in some species, larger stems may
   possess increased levels of anti-herbivore defenses, ultimately
   discouraging deer from browsing on these larger individuals. We examined
   differences in the proportion of twigs and stems (individual
   seedlings/saplings/trees) browsed across three height classes for four
   species: blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata Michx,), white ash (F.
   americana L.), sassafras (Sassafras albidium Nutt.), and sugar maple
   (Acer saccharum L.), across multiple sites in central Indiana. Overall,
   we found that taller stems had a higher likelihood of being browsed, but
   smaller stems were browsed more heavily. We also found that sugar maple
   twigs and stems were most likely to be browsed, while sassafras twigs
   and white ash twigs and stems were least likely to be browsed. Our
   results indicate that under intense browsing pressure, preference should
   be given to smaller stems for protection, and that stands with greater
   vertical stratification of palatable species are more resilient to the
   effects of deer browsing.},

Abstract = {In laboratory conditions, ants can combat a pathogen infection by means
   of the medicinal use of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is
   still unknown where they obtain medicinal compounds in the wild and how
   they use them. Due to an upregulation of ROS in response to herbivory,
   aphid-infested plants have been suggested to be a potential source of
   ROS for ants in the wild. We investigated whether infection would cause
   Lasius platythorax ants to change their foraging on extrafloral nectar
   on aphid-infested plants. We found no clear evidence for the ants
   significantly changing their foraging behaviour in response to the
   pathogen, nor for the extrafloral nectar to contain ROS. The aphids in
   our experiment had a relatively high concentration of ROS and future
   research should determine whether predation on aphids could be a
   potential source of both protein and ROS needed to combat a disease.},

Title = {Ineffective integration of multiple anti-predator defenses in a rotifer:
   a low-cost insurance?},

Abstract = {To maximize survival, prey often integrates multiple anti-predator
   defenses. How the defenses interact to reduce predation risk is,
   however, poorly known. We used the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to
   investigate how morphological (spines) and behavioral (floating)
   defenses are integrated against a common predatory rotifer, Asplanchna
   brightwellii, and if their combined use improves survival. To this end,
   we assessed the cost of the behavioral defense and the efficiency of
   both defenses, individually and combined, as well as their mutual
   dependency. The results show that the behavioral defense is costly in
   reducing foraging activity, and that the two defenses are used
   simultaneously, with the presence of the morphological defense enhancing
   the use of the behavioral defense, as does the pre-exposure to predator
   cues. However, while the morphological defense reduces predation risk,
   the behavioral defense does not, thus, adding the costly behavioral
   defense to the morphological defense does not improve survival. It is
   likely that the cost of the behavioral defense is low given its
   reversibility-compared to the cost of misidentifying the predator
   species-and that this has promoted the adoption of both defenses, as
   general low-cost insurance rather than as a tailored strategy toward
   specific predators. Thus, the optimal strategy in the rotifer appears to
   be to express both morphological and behavioral defenses when confronted
   with the cues of a potential predator.
   When predators are around, no effort should be spared in defending
   oneself. We show that the rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, uses both
   spines on its body and floating behavior to defend itself when exposed
   to predator cues. However, only spines are needed to reduce predation
   risk. It seems likely that the low cost of floating has promoted its
   adoption, in addition to the possession of spines: it offers a general
   low-cost insurance against predation.},

Title = {Baltic Sea transparency from ships and satellites: centennial trends},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Water transparency can be measured with optical instruments and
   estimated with satellite sensors, but such measurements have been widely
   available for only a few decades. Estimates of water transparency using
   a white disk called a Secchi disk have been made for over a century and
   can be used to estimate long-term trends. However, historic in situ
   measurements of the Secchi depth (ZSd) were irregular in space and time
   and are difficult to interpret in regular time series due to biases
   introduced by changing locations and the timing of measurements.
   Satellite data time series, on the other hand, have consistent
   resolution in both space and time but cover too short a time to resolve
   climate-scale trends. We normalized historic ZSd measurements in the
   Baltic Sea with a satellite-derived mean climatology at 5 d temporal and
   4 km spatial resolutions and created a merged time series of ZSd for the
   last century. The mean ZSd in the Baltic Sea from 1927-2020 decreased by
   4.2 +/- 0.6 m at a rate of 0.045 +/- 0.06 m yr-1. Most of the change
   happened before 1987, and a further decrease was evident primarily in
   the satellite data during the 1998-2008 period. After 2008, no
   significant trend in ZSd and or the coefficient of diffuse light
   attenuation was detected in the Baltic Sea. However, in some sub-basins
   of the Baltic Sea, the decrease in ZSd continued even after that. The
   decrease in spectral water transparency in recent decades was highest in
   the 412 nm band, indicating an increase in the concentration of
   chromophoric dissolved organic matter.},

Title = {Physical and environmental drivers of oceanic manta ray Mobula birostris
   sightings at an aggregation site in Bahia de Banderas, Mexico},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {133-148},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Oceanic manta rays Mobula birostris are distributed in tropical and
   subtropical oceans with aggregation sites typically at oceanic islands
   and seamounts. However, in some regions the species is found in coastal
   habitats close to highly productive areas. Recently, an important
   aggregation site for oceanic manta rays was identified along the
   southern coast of Bahia de Banderas, Mexico. We conducted weekly
   monitoring trips to the aggregation hotspots over a period of 41/2 yr,
   recording manta sightings and collecting zooplankton samples, to
   investigate relationships between sightings and prey availability. We
   evaluated relationships between manta sightings and physical,
   biological, and environmental variables, finding a seasonal signal of
   manta occurrence with a peak in sightings around April, although there
   were substantial deviations from this trend in some years. Our results
   show effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on sighting rates, with
   more mantas during La Nina phases. We found significant relationships
   between manta sightings and sea surface temperature, moon phase, and
   tidal range. Manta sightings were negatively related to fish egg
   densities, positively related to copepod and cladoceran densities, and
   showed no relationship to euphausiid density. Mantas may be feeding on
   mesopelagic prey in the submarine canyon adjacent to the southern coast
   and basking in shallow waters through the day during thermal recovery
   periods. Identifying the seasonal patterns of occurrence and the
   environmental drivers of sightings will support the development of
   strategies to mitigate anthropogenic threats, which are common in this
   coastal population.},

Title = {Echinoid larvae can express food-conditioned morphological plasticity at
   ecologically relevant culture densities},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {The feeding larvae of many echinoids develop long postoral arms relative
   to body length when food is sparse but relatively short postoral arms
   when food is abundant, a response thought to adaptively adjust feeding
   capability. However, in an important recent study, larvae of Dendraster
   excentricus exhibited this food-conditioned plasticity only when reared
   at a high density typical of laboratory cultures; when reared at a lower
   density more representative of larval densities in nature, they did not
   exhibit this plastic response. This finding suggests that laboratory
   results cannot be easily extended to make inferences about phenotypic
   plasticity in nature. We replicated this study and extended it to an
   even lower larval culture density and to a second species, Lytechinus
   pictus. Larvae of D. excentricus developed longer arms adjusted for body
   length when fed the lower of 2 food rations at all culture densities,
   though differences were only marginally significant at the lower culture
   density in one experiment. Larvae of L. pictus tended to develop longer
   arms adjusted for body length at lower food rations, though differences
   only approached statistical significance at the highest culture density
   in one experiment. For both species, contrasts between food rations
   almost always showed an inverse relationship between postoral arm length
   and stomach length, consistent with prior work demonstrating trade-offs
   in investment in these 2 features characteristic of phenotypic
   plasticity. These results suggest that the feeding larvae of echinoids
   may exhibit food-conditioned plasticity of postoral arm length even at
   low natural densities.

Title = {Long-term fire and vegetation change in northwestern Amazonia},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-209},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Amazonian forest plots are used to quantify biodiversity and carbon
   sequestration, and provide the foundation for much of what is known
   about tropical ecology. Many plots are assumed to be undisturbed, but
   recent work suggests that past fire, forest openings, and cultivation
   created vegetation changes that have persisted for decades to centuries
   (ecological legacies). The Yasuni Forest Dynamics plot is one of the
   most biodiverse places on earth, yet its human history remains unknown.
   Here, we use charcoal and phytolith analysis to investigate the fire and
   vegetation history of the Yasuni forest plot, and compare results with
   nearby forest plots in Colombia (Amacayacu) and Peru (Medio
   Putumayo-Algodon {[}MPA]) to explore the spatial variability of past
   disturbances and ecological legacies in northwestern Amazonia. Three
   C-14 dated charcoal fragments provided evidence for a modern (1956 CE)
   and a past fire event ca. 750 years ago at Yasuni, compared with fire
   ages of 1000-1600 years ago documented at Amacayacu and MPA. Small-scale
   disturbances and localized canopy openings also occurred in the Yasuni
   plot. Phytolith assemblages from Yasuni and Amacayacu showed more
   variability in past vegetation change than MPA. Low-intensity,
   non-continuous disturbances occurred at all three plots in the past, and
   our results highlight the variability of past human activities both in
   space and time in northwestern Amazonia. Our data also suggest that
   post-Columbian human disturbances from the Rubber Boom (AD 1850-1920)
   and subsequent oil exploration have likely left stronger ecological
   legacies than those left by pre-Columbian peoples in our studied
   regions.},

Title = {Impact of human foraging on tree diversity, composition, and abundance
   in a tropical rainforest},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {232-245},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tropical forest tree communities are structured by a range of
   large-scale drivers including elevation, certain high-impact
   anthropogenic activities (e.g., deforestation), and fires. However,
   low-impact human activities such as foraging may also be subtly but
   notably altering the composition of tropical forest tree communities.
   The study assessed the (i) differences in species diversity, patterns of
   relative abundance, and pairwise beta diversity between trees with
   edible and inedible fruits and seeds along an elevation gradient, and
   (ii) impact of human foraging on the forest tree communities in Oban
   Division of Cross River National Park, Nigeria. Fifteen permanent 40 by
   40 m plots were established along an elevational gradient (120-460 m
   above mean sea level). All trees of 0.1 m diameter at breast height
   (dbh) and above were measured, identified, and, with the aid of
   structured questionnaires, classified into those with edible and
   inedible fruits/seeds. A total of 35 edible species with density of 128
   stems/hectare and basal area of 11.99 m(2)/hectare, and 109 inedible
   species with density of 364 stems/hectare and basal area of 22.42
   m(2)/hectare were sampled. However, the evenness of edible and inedible
   species was similar at pooled and plot levels. For inedible species,
   there was a positive relationship between pairwise beta diversity and
   elevation, and this was driven mainly by turnover. In contrast, edible
   species exhibited a non-significant trend between elevation and beta
   diversity. Thus, the study showed that human foraging of edible fruits
   may have subtly influenced patterns of species diversity and community
   structure in this tropical forest.},

Abstract = {Human progress has become detrimental to the environment. Moreover, the
   failure to mitigate pollution would eventually impact negatively on the
   economy. This study investigates the influence of technological
   innovation, research and development, and quality of governance on
   carbon emissions for the European Union countries while controlling for
   industrialization, renewable energy, trade openness and foreign direct
   investment from 1996 to 2018 by employing the method of moment quantile
   regression technique. The result revealed that renewable energy, trade
   openness, and quality governance boost environmental quality, while
   technological innovation and industrialization increase carbon
   emissions. Also, the interaction between technological innovation and
   quality governance, research and development and quality governance as
   well as industrialization and quality governance decreases carbon
   emission while that of foreign direct investment and quality governance
   increases carbon emission. From the causality analysis, there is a
   bidirectional relationship between research and development and carbon
   emission, technology innovation and carbon emission, renewable energy
   and carbon emission, trade openness and carbon emission as well as
   industrialization and carbon emission. Moreover, a unidirectional
   connection was obtained between foreign direct investment and carbon
   emission, as well as quality governance and carbon emission. Based on
   the outcomes, comprehensive policy directions are suggested for
   policymakers in these countries.},

Title = {Variations in the reproductive cycle of Bornean montane tree species

Abstract = {Although lowland tree species in the ever-wet regions of Southeast Asia
   are characterized by the supra-annual cycle of reproduction, the
   reproductive phenology of montane tree species remains poorly
   understood. In this study, we investigated the reproductive phenology of
   montane tree species using litter samples that were collected every 2
   weeks from six rainforest sites, consisting of three elevations (1700,
   2700, and 3100 m), on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. At each elevation, one
   site was on infertile ultrabasic soil and one was on relatively fertile
   non-ultrabasic soil. We used a composite sample from 10 or 20 litter
   traps per site and sorted it by species. Therefore, the obtained data
   captured reproductive phenology in the population of each species rather
   than in an individual tree. Ten-year time series of flower and fruit
   litterfall were obtained for 30 and 39 tree species, respectively.
   Fourier analysis was used to identify the dominant cycle of each time
   series. The most abundant cycle across species was supra-annual,
   followed by sub-annual, and annual cycles. Many species at higher
   elevations showed supra-annual cycles of flower litterfall, whereas
   species in the 1700 m sites often showed annual or sub-annual cycles
   regardless of soil types. No systematic differences were found among
   sites for fruit litterfall. Mechanisms underlying these elevational
   patterns in reproductive cycle remain unclear but may include more
   severe El Nino droughts, lower primary productivity, lower soil
   fertility, and the absence of some sub-annually or annually reproducing
   families at higher elevations.},

Abstract = {The coevolutionary relationship between fungus-growing ants (Formicidae:
   Attini: Attina) and their symbionts has been well studied in the
   Panamanian rain forests. To further understand the ecological context of
   these evolutionary relationships, we have examined the
   population-genetic structure of the fungus-growing ant species
   Mycetomoellerius mikromelanos Cardenas, Schultz, Adams 2021 in the
   Panama Canal Zone. We specifically investigated the presence of
   population structure, the significance of geographic features (i.e.,
   creeks) limiting gene flow, and relatedness between ant colonies. To
   accomplish this, we genotyped 85 ant colonies from nine creeks across an
   approximately 30 km transect in Parque National Soberania, Panama, using
   double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing. We did not
   find distinct population structure using two genetic clustering methods;
   however, we did detect an effect of isolation by distance. Furthermore,
   related colonies were frequently detected on the same creek or
   neighboring creeks, and some at further geographic distances.
   Collectively, these findings demonstrate that new colonies tend to
   establish on natal creeks and occasionally on distant creeks following
   long-distance dispersal events. We discuss how population-genetic
   patterns reveal the natural history of M. mikromelanos in Parque
   National Soberania and how these results fit into the context of
   fungus-growing ant mutualisms. Abstract in Spanish is available with
   online material.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to understand how the water-saving
   irrigation mode affected the microbial community structure and function
   in paddy soil. A field experiment with three irrigation modes (flooding
   irri-gation FI, alternate wetting and drying irrigation AI and ridge
   irrigation RI) was conducted, and DNA extracted from the upper 25 cm
   paddy soils were measured using whole genome sequencing (WGS). The
   results showed that FI, AI and RI modes were significantly distinct in
   microbial communities. Compared to FI mode, two water -saving irrigation
   modes (AI and RI) decreased the relative abundance of Euryarchaeota and
   showed significant difference in their microbial co-occurrence networks.
   Compared to FI mode, AI mode increased the relative abundance of
   Proteobacteria but decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria,
   while RI mode showed opposite effects. Some biomarker species associated
   with carbon/nitrogen metabolism, such as Cupriavidus tai-wanensis,
   Gemmatirosa kalamazoonesis, Nitrospira moscoviensis, Pseudomonas
   tolaasii and Methanosarcina barkeri, were significantly sensitive to
   different irrigation modes. Meanwhile, two water-saving irrigation modes
   espe-cially AI mode enhanced the genes involved in carbohydrate
   decomposition and nitrification pathways, while FI mode significantly
   enriched the genes involved in methane metabolism, denitrification and
   nitrogen fixation. Thus two water-saving irrigation modes decreased the
   main methanogen (Methanosarcina barkeri) and meth-anogenesis genes in
   paddy soil, while AI mode enhanced potentially beneficial microbes and
   carbon/nitrogen metabolic-related genes in paddy soil.},

Journal = {SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Soil contamination from film debris following the prolonged application
   of mulching film has emerged as a worldwide concern. However, the extent
   that mulching films contribute to soil microplastics, and the spatial
   distribution of soil contamination from film debris remain unclear. In
   this study, the cotton field in Xinjiang (China), which underwent film
   mulching for a prolonged period of 5-30 years, was selected as the
   research location. A total of 360 soil samples were collected, aiming to
   study the spatial distribution characteristics of mulching film debris
   pollution. The samples were extracted using the density flotation method
   combined with stereomicroscopic; the source, composition, abundance, and
   distribution characteristics of soil MPs were identified by the scanning
   electron microscopic, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic
   analyses. In soil mulched for a 30 year period, the abundance of
   microplastics across the studied soil depth (0-60 cm) was 78.51 +/- 2.57
   n/(100 g). The mu-FTIR analyses revealed that the composition of the
   microplastics matched that of polyethylene materials. Therefore, plastic
   mulching could be inferred as a major contributor to microplastic
   pollution in agricultural lands. Overall, it is necessary to study the
   distribution characteristics of plastic film remaining for further study
   of plastic pollution in farmland soils.},

Title = {Stable nitrogen-cycling capacity in relation to fertilization and
   intercropping in a sub-boreal grassland},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Grasslands are important in sub-boreal climate agricultural systems and
   are managed with various combinations of N fertilization and plant
   species. Ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms are key
   players in determining the fate of nitrogen (N) and thereby also the
   yield in grassland systems and their impact on gaseous N losses and
   leaching. We established a three-year field study in southern Finland
   with fertilizer treatment as a main-plot factor, including organic and
   synthetic fertilizers and plant species and mixtures thereof as the
   sub-plot factor. We quantified six genes encoding key N-cycling enzymes
   by quantitative PCR to determine the abundance of the communities
   involved in N-transformation processes and also included previously
   published data on crop yield, soil properties and the overall bacterial
   community composition. With the exception of ammonia oxidizing bacteria
   (AOB), which were primarily affected by fertilization, the abundances of
   all other N-cycling communities changed over time with either an
   increase or decrease from summer to autumn. Differences in gene
   abundances between plant species treatments and in fertilizer by plant
   species interactions were detected mainly in the beginning of the
   cropping season during the first year. The nirS-type denitrifiers and
   nosZII nitrous oxide reducers responded more to changes in soil
   properties than their functional counterpart nirK and nosZI communities.
   Using structural equation modeling, we show that the overall microbial
   community composition and diversity played an important role in
   mediating the management effects on crop yield, genetic potential for N
   retention and N2O sink capacity. However, a trade-off between the
   genetic potential for N retention and N2O sink capacity was detected,
   indicating the challenges in managing grasslands in a sustainable way.},

Abstract = {The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight the
   most pressing issues that need to be resolved by the global community,
   including the Islamic banking industry, to ensure social equity,
   economic viability, and environmental protection. Accordingly, this
   study aims to develop a practical framework for evaluating the
   sustainability reporting performance of Islamic banks in the purview of
   the SDGs. This study employed the most recent Global Reporting
   Initiative and religious sustainability indicators to establish the
   measurement framework for evaluating sustainability reporting in
   relation to the SDGs. Centering on the Malaysian Islamic banks, this
   study found that overall performance on corporate sustainability
   reporting is quite low, though it has increased over time from
   2011-2020. The bank-wise analysis implies that the SDGs reporting
   differs for Islamic banks, where most of the banks outperform on SDGs
   disclosure scores. Further, the SDG-wise analysis indicates that SDG-9,
   SDG-17, SDG-11, and SDG-1 appear to have the highest disclosure scores.
   Nevertheless, SDG-16 revealed the least SDG disclosure score, indicating
   that the sampled Islamic banks do not provide complete information about
   addressing sustainability-related issues. The outcome of the study might
   be useful to the regulators and managers of Islamic banks in embedding
   sustainability into their strategy for reporting on SDGs. This will help
   in recognizing the strong and weak points of their sustainability
   reporting procedures regarding the SDGs.},

Abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation represents the largest natural flux of new
   nitrogen (N) into terrestrial ecosystems, providing a critical N source
   to support net primary productivity of both natural and agricultural
   systems. When they are common, symbiotic associations between plants and
   bacteria can add more than 100 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) to ecosystems. Yet,
   these associations are uncommon in many terrestrial ecosystems. In most
   cases, N inputs derive from more cryptic sources, including mutualistic
   and/or free-living microorganisms in soil, plant litter, decomposing
   roots and wood, lichens, insects, and mosses, among others.
   Unfortunately, large gaps remain in the understanding of cryptic N
   fixation. We conducted a literature review to explore rates, patterns,
   and controls of cryptic N fixation in both unmanaged and agricultural
   ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that, as is common with N fixation,
   rates are highly variable across most cryptic niches, with N inputs in
   any particular cryptic niche ranging from near zero to more than 20 kg
   ha(-1) y(-1). Such large variation underscores the need for more
   comprehensive measurements of N fixation by organisms not in symbiotic
   relationships with vascular plants in terrestrial ecosystems, as well as
   identifying the factors that govern cryptic N fixation rates. We
   highlight several challenges, opportunities, and priorities in this
   important research area, and we propose a conceptual model that posits
   an interacting hierarchy of biophysical and biogeochemical controls over
   N fixation that should generate valuable new hypotheses and research.},

Pages = {140-149},
Abstract = {Aim. Considering the high capability of Ilam province in the development
   of health tourism as indicated in its active border crossings with Iraq
   and the response to the recent epidemic, it was deemed necessary to
   identify the risks of air pollution on the health of tourists.
   Materials and Methods. During 2008-2018, data on five primary air
   pollutants during 2008-2018 were identified by literature research and
   by referring to the relevant monitoring organizations. Data analysis was
   performed by the Full permutation polygon synthetic indicator model,
   while Excel and MATLAB software were used to display data.
   Results. The findings of the study revealed that despite the application
   of the Land Use Planning Document, average suspended particulate matter
   of less than 10 microns ranked second after sulphur dioxide (SO2), in
   terms of the contribution to air pollution and instability in Ilam City
   during the 11 years in question (excluding 2008 and 2009).
   Conclusions. The link between air pollution and the development of
   health tourism on the one hand and the emergence of an epidemic on the
   other has recently necessitated a new concept of health, tourism and
   welfare in relation to the environment with the aim of achieving a
   healthy environment for visiting tourists.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of this work is the study of the specifics of accumulation
   of heavy metals in the body of gastropod mollusks -slugs (Molluska:
   Limacidae) on the southern slope of the Aragats mountain range, namely,
   conducting a quantitative analysis of heavy metals in the soil of
   different points of the Aragats mountain range and in the body of slugs
   (Vitrinoides monticola armeniaca; Deroceras caucasicum; Limax flavus),
   as well as the principles of biogenic migration of heavy metals
   according to the soil- plant-animal system (slugs) and determining the
   role of slugs in this migration in terrestrial ecosystems.Material and
   Methods. Slugs collected from different points of the southern slope of
   the Aragats mountain range served as material for this study. The
   content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ca, Mo) in the body of the mollusks
   was determined by the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry method: AAS
   extraction \& ISO-8288. The features of the biological accumulation of
   heavy metals in the body of mollusks were also determined.Results.
   Gastropod mollusks (Molluska: Limacidae) actively accumulate heavy
   metals (especially Cu, Zn, Ca) in their bodies and play a certain role
   in their transfer through food chains. Slugs, living in upper soil
   horizons (mesofauna) and under stones and plant litter, actively respond
   to the slightest changes in the environment and are perspective objects
   allowing the detection of deviations in the functioning of soils and the
   natural complex as a whole.Conclusion. Slugs living in the soil are an
   important link of the biogenic migration of heavy metals. An inverse
   relationship was revealed between the total and removable number of
   heavy metals in migration through the system: soil-plant-organism.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},

Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Ocean warming and acidification are predicted to impact the physiology
   of marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers that must deposit
   calcium carbonate and resist dissolution. Of particular concern are
   articulated coralline algae, which must maintain both calcified segments
   (intergenicula) and uncalcified joints (genicula) in order to thrive
   along wave-swept rocky coastlines. We examined the effect of pH and
   temperature, both individually and in combination, on the growth,
   calcification, and biomechanical properties of 2 species of articulated
   coralline algae, Corallina vancouveriensis and Calliarthron
   tuberculosum, common on wave-exposed shores in the NE Pacific. Increased
   temperature and reduced pH were found to reduce growth rates in both
   species (30-89\% lower) but had little influence on the amount of
   intergenicular calcium carbonate or on the genicular biomechanical
   properties of these species. Results suggest that although growth rates
   may decline, these 2 coralline species will maintain the integrity of
   their tissues and continue to persist under future climate stress.},

Abstract = {Changing conditions in the Arctic have had severe consequences for many
   marine mammals. In this study, we examined blubber cortisol using
   radioimmunoassay in 4 Canadian beluga whale Dephinapterus leucas
   populations. The endangered Cumberland Sound population had higher

   Hudson Bay (0.44 +/- 0.04 ng g-1; p = 0.004). To evaluate if measured
   cortisol differences were due to differences in diet, we compared stable
   isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (delta 13C and delta 15N) and
   dietary fatty acids among populations. Beluga whales from Eastern
   Beaufort Sea had lower delta 13C (p <= 0.017) and higher delta 15N (p <
   0.001) values than other measured populations, while Western Hudson Bay
   beluga dietary fatty acid profiles differed from other measured
   populations (p < 0.001). Population and sex were significant predictors
   of blubber cortisol (p <= 0.017). Females exhibited higher cortisol than
   males. Despite diet differences among populations, neither stable
   isotopes nor fatty acids were significant predictors of cortisol,
   suggesting differences in cortisol levels were unrelated to diet. Other
   factors, such as increased risk of predation, hunting pressure, vessel
   traffic, or differences in baseline blubber cortisol concentrations may
   be contributing to elevated cortisol levels in Cumberland Sound beluga
   whales. Measuring blubber cortisol in combination with chemical
   indicators of diet provides a useful method for monitoring population
   health and can be used to inform management and conservation.},

Title = {Ocean acidification and bivalve byssus: explaining variable responses
   using meta-analysis},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {89-103},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have documented weakened byssal attachment strength
   under ocean acidification (OA); however, a comparable number have
   reported no effect, even within the same species. We used meta-analysis
   to explore factors that could potentially explain observed effect size
   variation in byssal attachment strength following OA exposure. A
   systematic literature search uncovered 20 studies experimentally testing
   the impact of OA on byssal attachment strength (or some proxy thereof).
   Meta-analysis revealed body size (mean shell length) to be the strongest
   predictor of effect size variation, with a negative linear relationship
   observed between body size and effect size. Despite this relationship,
   no single study or experiment included body size as a moderating factor.
   Our finding that the byssal strength of larger bivalves is more
   susceptible to negative OA effects runs counter to prevailing wisdom
   that larger, older animals of a given species are more robust to OA than
   earlier life history stages. This result highlights that body size may
   be an important factor in moderating OA sensitivity in adult calcifiers;
   however, in stress response studies, variation in animal size is
   typically standardized methodologically rather than embraced and
   warrants further investigation for other taxa and biological traits. In
   addition to body size, our analysis also identified a suite of
   previously unconsidered factors that could influence byssal thread
   attachment strength, including aspects of thread morphology, animal
   nutritional status, and the impact of seasonality, which we highlight to
   provide suggestions for future research.},

Title = {Cyanobacterial blooms alter benthic community structure and parasite
   prevalence among invertebrates in Florida Bay, USA},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {29-44},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Many marine habitats are at risk due to increasing frequency, intensity,
   and persistence of harmful algal blooms. Repeated cyanobacterial harmful
   algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in Florida Bay, USA, kill sponges, resulting in
   reduced filtration and loss of shelter for benthic species. The loss of
   these key ecosystem functions can impact disease dynamics if fewer
   pathogens are filtered from the water column (dilution), if shelter loss
   increases host density in remaining shelters and a directly transmitted
   disease is present (host regulation), or if shelter loss changes species
   distributions and foraging patterns (trophic exposure). We show
   persistent impacts to hard-bottom communities relative to non-impacted
   communities 2 yr after a significant cyanoHAB. We compared benthic
   structure, invertebrate epibenthic/infaunal community composition, and
   parasitism among macroinvertebrates, stone crab Menippe mercenaria, and
   Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. On sites degraded by cyanoHABs,
   we found more, smaller sponges, indicating regrowth. Despite this
   evidence of recovery, epibenthic/infaunal invertebrate communities were
   distinct and more diverse on unimpacted sites. Additionally, there were
   fewer, smaller bivalves on impacted sites. The bivalve Tucetona
   pectinata, prey for stone crabs, was nearly absent on impacted sites,
   resulting in decreased prevalence of the apicomplexan gregarine
   Nematopsis sp., which is trophically transmitted from T. pectinata to M.
   mercenaria. Panulirus argus virus 1 also appears to be affected by
   cyanoHABs, as it was absent on impacted sites but present in 26.5\% of
   spiny lobster on unimpacted sites. Impacts remain evident 2 yr after
   significant cyanoHABs, which does not bode well for these areas
   considering the frequent reoccurrence of blooms.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {52-61},
Abstract = {Aim. To determine the age structure and assess the current state of
   Fagus orientalis Lipsky in the Caucasian Ecoregion. Material and
   Methods. The material was collected in beech forests in different
   floristic districts of the Caucasian Ecoregion. The registration of
   individual specimens was carried out on 121 test sites, with a total
   area of 73925 m2. A total of 19936 individuals of Fagus orientalis were
   involved in the analysis. Each individual was assessed by condition and
   assigned to a certain age group. Results. The study of the age structure
   of Fagus orientalis in the beech forests of the Caucasian Ecoregion
   showed a similar pattern of distribution of age group participation in
   all the studied areas studied. The age spectra revealed are left-sided
   and full-membered where individuals of the pre -generative phase
   predominate. For all populations, in general, almost the same share of
   the contribution of individuals of germinal and virginal age groups was
   noted, amounting to about 50\% in total. On average, there are 2906
   individuals per 1 ha, of which 459 have reached the generative phase.
   The condition of individuals of the pre-generative and generative phases
   across all the botanical areas of the Caucasian Ecoregion studied was
   estimated by us at 1.47 points. Conclusions. The study of the age
   structure of populations and the assessment of the condition of
   individuals allows us to assess the influence of certain abiotic and
   biotic factors. Low values of the proportion of post -generative
   individuals are the result of anthropogenic load in easily accessible
   territories. Under the influence of processes of intra-and interspecific
   competition, the share of participation of virginal and post -generative
   groups increases and is especially clearly observed in beech
   elfin-woodlands.},

Pages = {130-139},
Abstract = {Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of the main directions of
   genetic studies of complex (chronic) human neuropsychiatric diseases and
   to determine the prospects for their genomic studies.Discussion. Complex
   diseases account for more than 90\% of the total human pathology and are
   the main cause of premature death and disability. One of the most urgent
   and severe categories of complex diseases, both for the patients
   themselves and for society, are endogenous mental illnesses, in
   particular, schizophrenia, mental retardation and autism spectrum
   disorders. Despite the fact that genetic and epidemiological studies
   show high heritability rates (up to 70-80\%), the identification of
   predisposition genes remains a challenge. Studies in recent decades have
   contributed to understanding the genetic mechanisms of the pathogenesis
   of such diseases and have significantly advanced our understanding in
   terms of identifying risk loci, possible mechanisms for the transmission
   of genetic risk, and the involvement in the pathogenesis of such
   diseases of not one but of a large number of genes that provide many
   variants of gene expression. However, the mapping of genes that control
   such clinical phenotypes and mutations in them that cause pathogenesis
   remains largely unknown.Conclusion. The finding of the same gene changes
   in neuropsychiatric complex diseases suggests that the genes involved
   converge in biochemical pathways and may be caused by a complex
   interplay of genetic and environmental factors characterized by genetic
   heterogeneity, which is often associated with clinical heterogeneity,
   incomplete penetrance and phenocopies. This is of great importance for
   the development of gene therapy through the identification of drug
   targets for the treatment of these disorders.},

Title = {Ant diversity decreases during the dry season: A meta-analysis of the

Abstract = {Tropical studies traditionally describe insect diversity variation
   throughout the year. The temporally structured responses of insect
   assemblages to climate seasonality vary across ecosystems due to
   gradients of resource availability and limiting ecological factors.
   These idiosyncratic responses might be particularly true across the vast
   geographical range of the Brazilian territory, including various
   environments that harbor one of the most diverse ant faunas worldwide.
   This study addressed the relationship between ant diversity and climatic
   seasonality, performing a quantitative review of the published data on
   ant diversity collected in Brazil. We investigated the seasonality
   effect on ant abundance and richness described in the literature in 47
   papers published between 2000 and 2018. These studies were developed
   mainly in the Atlantic Forest biome and collected ants with pitfall
   traps on the soil/litter stratum. We initially carried out a
   vote-counting procedure by comparing the number of significant results
   describing seasonal differences in the ant assemblage. We found that
   most papers described a similar pattern of ant abundance, richness, and
   species composition between seasons. However, when we performed a
   meta-analysis, we observed a clear pattern of higher ant abundance and
   richness in the wet/summer season compared with the dry/winter season.
   Our meta-analysis reveals that the ant diversity decreases in the dry
   season, strongly in the Cerrado biome. Additionally, we point out
   differences in the sampling effort across biomes, indicating the need
   for further investments in studies focused on temporal diversity
   patterns, including seasonal effects, on the insect assemblage in biomes
   less investigated so far. Abstract in Portuguese is available with

Abstract = {Seed and pollen dispersal contribute to gene flow and shape the genetic
   patterns of plants over fine spatial scales. We inferred fine-scale
   spatial genetic structure (FSGS) and estimated realized dispersal
   distances in Phytelephas aequatorialis, a Neotropical dioecious
   large-seeded palm. We aimed to explore how seed and pollen dispersal
   shape this genetic pattern in a focal population. For this purpose, we
   genotyped 138 seedlings and 99 adults with 20 newly developed
   microsatellite markers. We tested if rodent-mediated seed dispersal has
   a stronger influence than insect-mediated pollen dispersal in shaping
   FSGS. We also tested if pollen dispersal was influenced by the density
   of male palms around mother palms in order to further explore this
   ecological process in large-seeded plants. Rodent-mediated dispersal of
   these large seeds occurred mostly over short distances (mean 34.76 +/-
   34.06 m) while pollen dispersal distances were two times higher (mean
   67.91 +/- 38.29 m). The spatial extent of FSGS up to 35 m and the fact
   that seed dispersal did not increase the distance at which male alleles
   disperse suggest that spatially limited seed dispersal is the main
   factor shaping FSGS and contributes only marginally to gene flow within
   the population. Pollen dispersal distances depended on the density of
   male palms, decreasing when individuals show a clumped distribution and
   increasing when they are scattered. Our results show that limited seed
   dispersal mediated by rodents shapes FSGS in P. aequatorialis, while
   more extensive pollen dispersal accounts for a larger contribution to
   gene flow and may maintain high genetic diversity.Abstract in Spanish is
   available with online material.},

Title = {The role of non-natural foods in the nutritional strategies of monkeys
   in a human-modified mosaic landscape},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {106-118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many tropical animals inhabit mosaic landscapes including human-modified
   habitat. In such landscapes, animals commonly adjust feeding behavior,
   and may incorporate non-natural foods. These behavioral shifts can
   influence consumers' nutritional states, with implications for
   population persistence. However, few studies have addressed the
   nutritional role of non-natural food. We examined nutritional ecology of
   wild blue monkeys to understand how dietary habits related to
   non-natural foods might support population persistence in a mosaic
   landscape. We documented prevalence and nutritional composition of
   non-natural foods in monkey diets to assess how habitat use influenced
   their consumption, and their contribution to nutritional strategies.
   While most energy and macronutrients came from natural foods, subjects
   focused non-natural feeding activity on five exotic plants, and averaged
   about a third of daily calories from non-natural foods. Most non-natural
   food calories came from non-structural carbohydrates and least from
   protein. Consumption of non-natural foods related to time in
   human-modified habitats, which two groups used non-randomly. Non-natural
   and natural foods were similar in nutrients, and the amount of
   non-natural food consumed drove variation in nutritional strategy. When
   more daily calories came from non-natural foods, females consumed a
   higher ratio of non-protein energy to protein (NPE:P). Females also
   prioritized protein while allowing NPE:P to vary, increasing NPE while
   capitalizing on non-natural foods. Overall, these tropical mammals
   achieved a similar nutrient balance regardless of their intake of
   non-natural foods. Forest and forest-adjacent areas with non-natural
   vegetation may provide adequate nutrient access for consumers, and thus
   contribute to wildlife conservation in mosaic tropical landscapes.},

Title = {Movements and habitat connectivity of New Zealand forest birds: a review
   of available data},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {New Zealand's original forested landscape has been greatly fragmented
   since human arrival, limiting connectivity and habitat quality for
   forest-dependent fauna. We review the limited available information
   about forest bird movement behaviour, especially whole-year sociality
   and movement, natal dispersal, and pasture- and water-gap crossing. Most
   small insectivores (17 species) and North Island kokako are territorial
   year-round, but frugivore-nectivores (three species), raptors (two
   species), and volant parrots (four species) can be highly mobile,
   presumably to find scattered food. Natal dispersal is the main behaviour
   by which birds find new habitats and mates, but natal dispersal
   distances are unknown for half the species we review. There is limited
   information about species' ability to cross gaps between forests, and
   more is known about movement over water than pasture. We classify four
   species (North Island kokako, popokotea, South Island tieke, and North
   Island brown kiwi) as strongly gap limited, defined as currently unknown
   to cross water or pasture gaps larger than 500 m. A further eight
   species (mohua, tititipounamu, pipipi, weka, North Island tieke,
   kakaruai, toutouwai, and miromiro) are moderately gap-limited, with
   maximum observed gap-crossing distances of less than 5 km. Pending new
   data, these twelve species have most need of corridors or translocations
   to enable them to establish in new, safe, ecosanctuary sites. Habitat
   connectivity can be increased by strategic planting, but this also risks
   decreasing populations if birds emigrate from safe to unsafe sites. Many
   managed ecosanctuaries are too small to accommodate natal dispersal
   distances expected in continuous forest, so pest control is required at
   larger scale in the long term to restore natural movement patterns.},

Title = {Diurnal, seasonal and annual abundance patterns of California quail
   (Callipepla californica) in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand,
   2010-2019},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The California quail was introduced to New Zealand in 1862 as a game
   bird, and today is held in high regard by recreational hunters. The
   species is widespread through the North and South Islands, except for
   the regions of Westland, Fiordland, and Southland. However, it is
   suspected that populations have been declining in recent decades. Our
   study focused on the California quail population in the Marlborough
   Sounds along six road sections between Manaroa, Picton, and Havelock
   during 2010-2019. Analysis of quail counts using a Generalised Linear
   Model revealed that year (decline from 2010 to 2019), season (highest in
   spring, lowest in winter and Autumn) and vehicle traffic (highest at low
   traffic, lowest at high traffic) all showed significant relationships
   with the mean number of quail counted per survey. Quail numbers also
   showed significant relationships with time of day (highest in evening,
   lowest in afternoon) and road section (highest from Portage to Te Mahia
   and Te Mahia to Linkwater). The decline in quail counted over the
   10-year period was possibly due to loss of suitable habitat through
   forest regeneration, and perhaps also increased predation by certain
   introduced mammals. We recommend future research to further investigate
   the causes of the decline, given that confirmed declines in exotic quail
   populations may have similar implications for native species that also
   prefer open habitats within the Marlborough Sounds region.},

Title = {Soil erodibility after the removal of wood chip mulch: A wind tunnel
   experiment},

Abstract = {Numerous field studies have investigated the effects of mulching on soil
   wind ero-sion. However, little is known about the changes in soil
   erodibility after removing the mulch layer. In this paper, we measured
   the physicochemical properties and aggregate characteris-tics of soil
   from an urban park after removing the mulch layer and estimated
   wind-erodible materials emission by wind tunnel experiments. Wood chips
   at 4,500 g m-2 (mulch thickness of 5 cm, R5), 6,300 g m-2 (mulch
   thickness of 7 cm, R7), and 8,100 g m-2 (mulch thickness of 9 cm, R9)
   were used for mulching an area in Yuanmingyuan Park from October of 2019
   to the end of February of 2021. The following four treatments were
   listed: unmulched soil (CK), R5, R7, and R9. Compared with CK, the soil
   moisture content (SM), the macro -aggregates (>0.25 mm) ratio (M >
   0.25), the wind erodible fraction (WEF), and the dry aggregate stability
   (DAS) of R5, R7, and R9 were significantly increased after mulching (P <
   0.05), whereas the soil organic matter content (SOM) was only slightly
   increased. The calcium carbonate contents (CaCO3) varied greatly among
   the different treatments. Based on the wind tunnel experiments, the
   distribution of wind erosion materials near the soil surface (0 to 30
   cm) was fitted to logarithmic, power, and exponential functions (R2
   ranged between 0.7179 and 0.9859). The particle size distribution of all
   wind-erodible materials was unimodal, and the proportion of coarse
   particles (250 to 100 mu m) was highest. Compared with the CK, the
   average wind erosion rate (AWER) of R5, R7, and R9 was decreased by
   48.44\%, 65.04\%, and 70.03\%, respectively, after mulching. The AWER
   was significantly (P < 0.01) negatively correlated with SM, M > 0.25,
   WEF, and DAS, and negatively correlated with CaCO3 and SOM. The CaCO3
   was significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with M > 0.25, WEF,
   and DAS. Overall, despite the relatively short mulching period (16
   months), wood chip mulch improved the physicochemical properties and
   aggregate characteristics of soil and decreased erodibility.},

Abstract = {Although efforts to restore floodplain forests are becoming more popular
   in the northeastern United States, best management practices are not
   well defined. In this study, we demonstrate the success of a planting
   effort in western Massachusetts to increase the extent of a floodplain
   forest along the Housatonic River. Over 1700 floodplain-adapted tree
   saplings were planted in an old field and in two hayfields at
   Bartholomew's Cobble, a property located in Sheffield, Massachusetts,
   and individually tagged to follow their growth and survival. Planted
   trees had relatively high rates of survival over a 6 y period,
   especially the two most commonly planted tree species: silver maple
   (Acer saccharinum, 42.5\% survival) and boxelder (Acer negundo, 71.7\%),
   although plantings were more successful in the old field compared to the
   two hayfields. Tree dbh after 6 y differed across fields for silver
   maples and boxelders with those planted within the old meadow
   significantly larger than those planted into hayfields (silver maple dbh
   9.8 cm old field vs. 6.5-6.6 cm hayfields; boxelder dbh 10.4 cm old
   field vs. 4.4-6.6 cm hayfields). By documenting which floodplain-adapted
   tree species were successful in establishing under which conditions, our
   observational study provides valuable insights for future restoration
   efforts.},

Title = {Insights into the trophic ecology of white-beaked dolphins
   Lagenorhynchus albirostris and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in
   Iceland},

Volume = {702},

Abstract = {Sympatric organisms can avoid competition by occupying different
   ecological niches, a mechanism known as niche partitioning. In Iceland,
   white-beaked dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and harbour porpoises
   Phocoena phocoena are the most common small cetaceans observed but their
   trophic ecology remains understudied, including the potential for
   resource competition. In this study, we measured delta 15N and delta 13C
   values from white-beaked dolphin (n = 28) and harbour porpoise (n = 29)
   muscle samples collected over a 33 yr period (1987-2019) to compare
   isotopic niche width and overlap of both species, as well as diet
   composition. We also tested for within-species effects of sex, age
   class, body length, year of sampling and origin (bycatch vs. stranding)
   on the delta 13C and delta 15N values. Intra-species variations included
   differences between stranded and bycaught white-beaked dolphins and
   ontogenetic variations in both species, but further studies are
   necessary to investigate the factors that might explain these results.
   Inter-species comparisons showed that harbour porpoises and white-beaked
   dolphins had non-overlapping isotopic niches, with harbour porpoises
   exhibiting smaller niche widths (corrected standard ellipse area, SEAc:
   1.25 vs. 2.13 parts per thousand 2). While white-beaked dolphins had a
   broader diet, composed primarily of gadoids but with contributions of
   other fish species, harbour porpoises fed almost exclusively on capelin
   Mallotus villosus, suggesting niche segregation and width is largely
   maintained by targeting different prey resources. Both species also
   showed no long-term changes in trophic ecology, despite recent ecosystem
   changes in this region, possibly a result of adapting to spatial changes
   in prey distribution or shifts to other prey at similar trophic levels.},

Title = {Hatching distribution, abundance, and losses to freshwater diversions of
   longfin smelt inferred using hydrodynamic and particle-tracking models},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {179-196},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The distribution of larval fishes is influenced by where they hatch and
   their movements after hatching. In the San Francisco Estuary, the
   threatened longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys spawns adhesive eggs in
   fresh to brackish water. Attached eggs hatch and the larvae disperse
   seaward toward higher-salinity water. Actual locations of spawning and
   hatching are unknown, and cannot reliably be inferred from distributions
   of larvae because intense tidal mixing obscures the history of movement.
   Human interventions such as manipulations and diversions of freshwater
   flow may contribute to the ongoing decline of this species, and these
   effects depend on where the fish hatch. We combined movement estimated
   using hydrodynamic and particle-tracking modeling with trawl data using
   a Bayesian model to estimate the location and timing of hatching, as
   well as natural mortality of larvae and losses to freshwater diversions.
   Results indicate that longfin smelt may hatch further seaward than
   previously believed, and that estimated direct losses due to diversions
   were small relative to other sources of mortality. Abundance of this
   species varies similar to 100-fold with freshwater flow, but our results
   suggest that proportional entrainment was practically zero during an
   extreme wet year and relatively low (2 \%) in a moderately dry year.
   This method could be applied to other estuarine and coastal systems
   where strong mixing reduces the ability of simpler models to predict
   hatching locations and larval movements.},

Title = {Otolith microchemistry reveals different environmental histories for two

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {161-178},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Many fishes inhabit different environments throughout ontogeny in order
   to utilize more suitable habitats and meet their growth needs during
   different developmental stages. Otolith microchemistry analysis is a
   powerful tool to elucidate the environmental histories and past movement
   patterns of fishes, providing important insights into the connectivity
   between various environments utilized by different developmental stages.
   In this study, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of otoliths throughout
   the entire lifetime of 2 endangered and closely related fourfinger
   threadfin species, Eleutheronema rhadinum and E. tetradactylum. This is
   the first study to reconstruct the life history of fourfinger
   threadfins, and the various element:Ca ratio profiles from otolith
   core-to-edge analysis suggest differences in environmental histories
   between the species, especially during their early life stages. We
   identified 2 contrasting environmental history patterns. Most of the
   analyzed E. rhadinum individuals were estuarine-dependent, with fish
   spending their first year in an estuarine environment and then moving to
   marine coastal systems. In contrast, the majority of E. tetradactylum
   individuals were coastal-dependent, remaining in the coastal systems
   throughout their early life history stages. Element:Ca profiles,
   self-organizing maps and random forest analysis also detected a unique
   environmental history pattern in early life history stages of the Thai
   E. rhadinum population that differed from the Chinese E. rhadinum
   population. There was no evidence of differences between E.
   tetradactylum populations from Thailand and China. Fourfinger threadfins
   have experienced drastic population declines over the past decade, and
   holistic management to increase environmental connectivity for these
   species is necessary to maintain sustainable fisheries.},

Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Temporary penning prior to release is a strategy increasingly being used
   in lizard translocations to improve site fidelity and increase chances
   of translocation success. However, it is yet to be tested on a range of
   lizard taxa. Between 2015 and 2018, 49 individuals of a New Zealand
   endemic arboreal gecko species (ngahere gecko, Mokopirirakau ``southern
   North Island{''}) were translocated to mammal-free Mana Island near
   Wellington as mitigation for a development project. Twenty-five of these
   geckos were tracked for this study with geckos being either
   hard-released (n = 9) or released into a 0.52 ha pen for 10-31 months (n
   = 16). Using radio-telemetry, we compared the behaviour, habitat use,
   dispersal, and home ranges of geckos from both groups in the weeks
   immediately following removal of the pen. Hard-released geckos travelled
   further from their initial release point and between location fixes than
   penned geckos. Hard-released geckos also had a larger home range size
   than penned geckos using both minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel
   methods, albeit with significant variation among individuals within each
   group. Habitat use was similar in both groups, but only hard-released
   geckos used grass, which was unexpected due to the arboreal nature of
   the species. In conclusion, our results support the use of
   penned-releases for translocations of arboreal geckos to restrict
   initial post-translocation dispersal and aid population establishment.},

Title = {Differential ecophysiological responses to inorganic nitrogen sources
   (ammonium versus nitrate) and light levels in the seagrass Zostera
   noltei},

Abstract = {Seagrasses can use both ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) as inorganic
   nitrogen (N) sources. However, NO3- uptake and assimilation are
   energetically more expensive and tightly regulated than NH4+ uptake. The
   objective of this study was to test the complex interactive effects
   between different forms of N enrichment (NH4+ and NO3-) and light levels
   on the morphological and physiological traits in the intertidal seagrass
   Zostera noltei. Plants were cultured over 40 d under 2 levels of light
   (low and high) with 2 inorganic N concentrations supplied at the same
   dose, NO3- (25 mu M) and NH4+ (25 mu M), and a control, following a
   2-factorial design. Results showed a differential response in Z. noltei
   depending on the inorganic N source and light dose. NH4+ enrichment
   negatively affected almost all morphometric and dynamic variables
   analyzed, both in isolation and combined with low light conditions. In
   contrast, NO3- enrichment had a positive effect on Z. noltei survival
   compared with the control treatment in terms of net growth rate and
   rhizomatic growth, mainly under high light conditions. Therefore, our
   study demonstrated that the effects promoted by nutrient enrichment
   largely depend on the source of N used. Light levels play a crucial role
   in this response by potentially shifting the effects from toxic (under
   low light) to beneficial (under high light) when NO3- is the main N
   source. Our findings highlight that N form in eutrophication events
   should be considered when evaluating the potential impacts of nutrient
   enrichment and light reduction on seagrass communities.},

Title = {Compounded effects of sea urchin grazing and physical disturbance on
   macroalgal canopies in the lagoon of Moorea, French Polynesia},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},

Abstract = {Release from herbivory is a factor underpinning coral replacement by
   macroalgae. Once macroalgae have achieved dominance, shifts back to the
   coral-dominated state can be hindered by stabilizing feedbacks. Thus,
   restoring herbivore assemblages alone can be insufficient to trigger
   coral recovery. However, herbivores could control macroalgal recovery in
   the aftermath of physical disturbances removing macroalgae. Diadematid
   urchins at Moorea (French Polynesia) have collapsed in the last decade.
   By means of a manipulative field experiment, we tested the interactive
   effects of physical disturbance and increased diadematid densities on
   macroalgae inside the lagoon. Massive Porites colonies, referred to as
   `bommies', were assigned to 3 different macroalgal removal treatments
   (removal of stipes and fronds of the canopy-forming macroalgae
   Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum pacificum, total removal of erect
   macroalgae or untouched) and exposed to 3 different urchin densities
   (absent, low {[}similar to 0.5 ind. m(-2)], and intermediate {[}similar
   to 1 ind. m(-2)]). After 1 yr, sea urchins had no effect on the covers
   of S. pacificum and T. ornata when macroalgal canopies were left
   untouched. Urchins could control the recovery of S. pacificum on total
   macroalgal removal bommies, but not that of T. ornata. However, urchins,
   even when at intermediate densities, did not generate major changes in
   the structure of benthic assemblages on experimental bommies. Our study
   indicates that a moderate increase in diadematid densities is unlikely
   to reduce the extent of macroalgal stands in Moorea back reefs unless
   associated with the recovery of other herbivore guilds able to remove
   adult macroalgae (i.e. browsers).},

Title = {Temperature mediates chorusing behaviour associated with spawning in the
   sciaenid Argyrosomus regius},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},
Pages = {109-124},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity
   of daily temperature extremes in aquatic environments, posing a threat
   to ectothermic animals such as fishes. Temperature shifts can impact
   their reproductive cycle and behaviour, including acoustic signalling
   associated with courtship and mating in vocal fishes. Here, we examined
   the effect of temperature and other environmental factors on
   spawning-related chorusing behaviour in the meagre Argyrosomus regius.
   Using an automatic recognition system based on hidden Markov models
   coupled with one-third octave band sound level analysis, we extracted
   meagre daily vocal activity over 4 yr of passive acoustic monitoring
   (PAM) in the Tagus estuary (Portugal). Meagre vocal activity showed a
   distinct diel pattern, with choruses being most prevalent at dusk.
   Chorus activity started earlier in years with warmer springs, while the
   end of the season was concurrent with the rise in water temperature.
   Circa 70\% of daily variations were explained by changes in water
   temperature. Tidal cycle, lunar phase and changes in daylength did not
   appear to affect vocal behaviour. Choruses were detected on days with
   mean water temperature ranging from 15-25 degrees C, with stronger
   chorusing observed around 18 degrees C. Abrupt temperature changes
   caused disruption in choruses and likely in associated spawning. This
   study highlights the importance of temperature to fish reproduction and
   demonstrates that PAM can be a useful tool for long-term conservation
   management plans. PAM may also allow us to predict how temperature
   shifts due to climate change may affect fish reproduction, using vocal
   fishes as model species.},

Title = {Floral Resources Used by the Endangered Rusty Patched Bumble Bee (Bombus

Abstract = {The once-common rusty patched bumble bee (RPBB, Bombus affinis) has
   disappeared from most of its original range in eastern North America. As
   a result of this dramatic population decline, RPBB was listed as
   federally endangered in 2017. Unlike many endangered species, remnant
   populations of the RPBB often occur in urban/suburban parks and natural
   areas. This paper summarizes photographic records of RPBB floral use
   collected largely by volunteer community scientists in the midwestern
   United States, with a focus on Wisconsin, one of the species' remaining
   strongholds. RPBB were documented in 37 of Wisconsin's 72 counties. We
   identified flowers to genus in 772 of 803 digital images (some bees were
   not on flowers). Although 87 plant genera were identified, 76\% of the
   flowers represented just 13 genera. Over half of the flower records
   (54.6\%) were from Monarda, Eutrochium, Veronicastrum, Agastache, or
   Solidago. Incidental surveys from other states show a similar pattern,
   although additional genera have been shown to be used by RPBB. Our
   results support existing recommendations for plantings and habitat
   management favoring specific plant species, generally associated with
   native grasslands and savannas. Because the active period of RPBB covers
   a large part of the growing season, however, we also provide evidence
   for the importance of spring ephemeral woodland wildflowers (e.g.,
   Dicentra, Anemone, Hydrophyllum) and late-flowering species of wetlands
   and wet meadows (e.g., Eutrochium, Eupatorium). A landscape that
   includes woodland, native grassland, and wet meadows provides floral
   resources that support all RPBB life history stages, including
   early-season queens, late-season gynes, and males.},

Title = {The Solar Stag of the Chamalals and Tindals and other masonry
   petroglyphs in the upper Andiiskoe Koisu region of Dagestan and their
   relationships to similar phenomena in the mountain communities of the
   Caucasus: Socio-ecological and historical perspectives},

Abstract = {Aim. Following the discovery of a number of iconographically unique
   masonry petroglyphs depicting a red deer solar stag (i.e. bearing the
   sun between its antlers) in settlements of the Chamalal ethno-linguistic
   group in the upper Andiiskoe Koisu region of the Tsumadinskiy district
   of Dagestan, the aim of the research has been: (1) to survey the region
   to ascertain whether other images of this nature existed and to
   understand the relationship of the corpus to other petroglyphs produced
   within the Avar-Ando-Dido metacultural zone and of neighbouring ethnic
   groups in the Caucasus; (2) to study the evolution and meaning to the
   community of the petroglyphic imagery and (3) to understand the
   mechanisms by which peoples of the Caucasus shared and adapted
   polytheistic belief systems arising from the deep past following their
   conversion to Christianity and Islam.Materials and Methods. Research
   activities involved field surveys of traditional buildings within the
   ethno-linguistic enclaves of the upper Andiiskoe Koisu which might
   contain masonry petroglyphs and their photographic documentation. A
   thorough survey of the scientific literature impacting on this field in
   the Caucasus was undertaken in the libraries and institutions of
   Dagestan, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. This data added to the
   documentation of masonry petroglyphs already undertaken in the Gidatli
   communities of the upper Avarskoe Koisu region.Results. Field surveys
   resulted in the discovery of more petroglyphs of the solar stag
   iconography both within Chamalal territory and that of the neighbouring
   Tindals as well as other petroglyphs of interest in neighbouring
   republics of the North Caucasus. A socio-ecological assessment of local
   habitats which might have sustained both red deer and bezoar goat (the
   principal game animals since human presence in the region) indicated
   that the bezoar goat inhabited the territories of both groups but were
   now rarely found in Chamalal lands. While red deer did inhabit the
   forests of the Tindals, it appears that they never frequented those of
   the Chamalals, who must have travelled to hunt them in forests further
   to the south. Conclusion. The research confirmed the presence of a
   unique corpus of petroglyphic imagery attesting to beliefs in a solar
   stag which may date back to period of man's re-inhabiting the upper
   Andiiskoe Koisu region in the early Holocene. Indigenous beliefs
   relating both to the red deer and the bezoar goat initially represented
   in rock face petroglyphs of the eastern Dagestan piedmonts and rock
   paintings of the mountainous regions were by the late Bronze Age
   represented on masonry blocks used in building in the Avar-Ando-Dido
   metacultural zone. As Christianity spread in Transcaucasia and the Great
   Caucasus Range, including north-western Dagestan, indigenous images
   representing the solar stag were conflated with those of the popular
   Christian cult of the Miracle of Saint Eustace, resulting in the unique
   petroglyphs of the solar stag common to the Chamalals, Tindals and the
   communities of the Gidatli area of the Avarskoe Koisu basin.},

Abstract = {Sustainable agriculture and agroecology are now essential to the
   discussion on agricultural models in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
   Considering this new dimension as different intensities of ecosystem
   services use within farming practices, we propose identifying how these
   forms of agriculture take shape in the region's rural areas. Family
   farms' socio-economic organizations can explain the adoption conditions
   of agroecology in these regions, and its success or failure. From data
   collected in the Niayes region in Senegal, we develop a typology of
   farms with different levels of agroecology, from none to advanced
   adoption, based on a Factor Analysis on Mixed Data (FAMD). It allows for
   characterizing how these levels relate to farm income, labor types, and
   off-farm activities, among others. Our results confirm the existence of
   an association between agroecology/family farming and
   conventional/employer forms of agriculture, as suggested by our
   hypothesis. However, they bring to light contrasted models that nuance
   the common archetypes linking family farming with agroecology. Thus,
   better-off households employing wage workers display certain levels of
   agroecology, while the most conventional farms present a higher deficit
   risk. These findings provide a better understanding of agroecology's
   development in dynamic rural contexts such as the Niayes.},

Abstract = {India is a major developing world economy that has predominantly been
   highly energy-intensive and fossil fuel dependent. Consequently, this
   South Asian nation has not been able to safeguard its environment from
   persistent degradation through the discharge of greenhouse gases.
   Accordingly, this study tries to reveal the relationships between Carbon
   Dioxide (CO2) emissions, renewable energy consumption, international
   trade, and economic growth in India in order to recommend policies that
   can help the nation attain carbon neutrality. Both the conventional
   Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the newly developed Quantile
   ARDL (QARDL) models are used in this study. The ARDL results unveil that
   1\% increase in renewable energy consumption contributes to 0.8\%
   reduction in CO2 emissions, while economic growth boosts CO2 emissions
   in the long run. Besides, international trade deteriorates the
   environment by amplifying emissions only in the short run. The QARDL
   results reveal that economic growth positively and renewable energy
   consumption negatively affect CO2 emissions across all quantiles of CO2
   emissions. In contrast, international trade is not found to exert any
   statistically significant effect on CO2 emissions. Lastly, the
   quantile-based causality analysis somewhat supports the regression
   findings by verifying causal associations between the variables of
   concern in India's context. Thus, in light of these findings, several
   carbon neutrality-related policy insights are put forward.},

Abstract = {In the ancestral heritage, mankind was in mutual interdependence with
   nature through hunting of animals, gathering of plant materials, and
   animal and plant domestication. However, agricultural advancements
   detached mankind from that heritage. In U.S. Midwest, it is evident that
   technological advancements over the past half-century have threatened
   man's survival for centuries to come. Midwest is the prime agricultural
   land area in North America whose recent glaciation, deep-rooted prairie
   vegetation, and moderate precipitation favored the development of highly
   productive rain-fed farming systems. Evolution of productionist paradigm
   in Midwest focused on crop and livestock output but also resulted in
   numerous environmental externalities. Massive use of agrochemicals, for
   instance, resulted in pollution of Mississippi River watershed from
   upperstream to downstream creating a hypoxic zone in Gulf of Mexico. In
   this situation, it is appropriate to ask what best alternatives for
   mankind could be to reconnect with nature to achieve sustainability. The
   study explored three approaches including ecological conservation,
   biodiversity, and agricultural education. Conservation requires the
   passion of humanity to reconnect with ecological community and become
   part of it rather than to manipulate and seek control over it to reap
   ecosystem services. In creating interrelated diversity through
   domestication of culturally important wild species, agroforestry,
   horticulture, animal husbandry, and inclusion of relevant language and
   culture we can define a sustainable world. Agricultural education brings
   in three tenets of teaching/learning, research/discovery, and
   extension/engagement to provide, create, and apply knowledge,
   respectively, which are important in communicating the science of
   sustainability.},

Title = {The challenging coexistence of forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis and

Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},

Pages = {15-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With a drastic decrease in their populations over the last decades,
   forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis are facing increasing human
   pressure. Their decline will have serious ecological consequences, as
   they are key actors in shaping ecosystems. Whilst timber concessions
   host many mammal species, the interactions between selective logging and
   forest elephants remain unclear. Through an extensive literature review,
   we discussed the following: 1) the ecological and human factors that
   drive the distribution of forest elephants on a large scale as well as
   in the specific context of logged forests; 2) the contribution of forest
   elephants to the regeneration of timber species; and 3) the damage
   caused by forest elephants to timber species. Although human activities
   have the greatest impact on forest elephant distribution, it is the
   availability of food, water, and minerals that locally determines their
   use of the habitat. Under specific conditions, timber concessions may
   host large populations of forest elephants. As effective seed
   dispersers, forest elephants contribute to the regeneration of at least
   41 timber species, such as Bobgunnia fistuloides (pao rosa), one of the
   most expensive woods on the market. Damage caused by forest elephants is
   diverse and affects a wide range of species. From branch breaking to
   bark stripping, at least 61 timber species are used by forest elephants,
   and little is known about the consequences for the tree's vitality and
   wood quality. The interactions between forest elephants and logging are
   complex and involve many variables, requiring additional research.
   Nevertheless, this review suggests that timber concessions constitute
   key areas for forest elephant conservation, provided that low-impact
   logging and wildlife management are implemented.},

Abstract = {Non-native aquatic plants are amongst the major threats to freshwater
   biodiversity and climate change is expected to facilitate their further

   Pannonian and Mediterranean regions, respectively, under both climate
   scenarios. Of the horizon species, 42\% were classified as high risk
   under current conditions and, under climate change, this proportion
   increased to 78\%. The `top invasive' species (i.e. scored as very high
   risk) under both climate conditions and for both regions were extant
   Elodea nuttallii and horizon Lemna aequinoctialis. The horizon
   Hygrophila polysperma was very high risk for the Mediterranean Region
   under current climate conditions and for both regions under projected
   climate conditions. Azolla filiculoides, Elodea canadensis, Egeria densa
   and Utricularia gibba were also classified as high risk under current
   climate conditions and, after accounting for climate change, they became
   of very high risk in both regions. Further, Gymnocoronis spilanthoides
   and Lemna minuta were found to pose a very high risk under climate
   change only for the Pannonian Region. It is anticipated that the
   outcomes of this study will contribute to knowledge of the invasiveness
   of aquatic plants in different climatic regions and enable
   prioritisation measures for their control/eradication.},

Title = {Revisiting ramet connection under homogeneous water availability
   environments},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is little consistency on effects of ramet physical connection in
   homogeneous environments. To revisit this issue, we chose Cynodon
   dactylon (Linn.) Pers. (Bermuda grass) as a model plant to establish
   three experiments. In the water availability experiment (I), stolon
   severing had no significant effects on plant biomass; however, it
   significantly affected plant morphology by increasing main stolon length
   of C. dactylon grass under the homo-geneous high water (i.e., less
   stress) condition, possibly due to an escape strategy from disturbance
   (stolon severing). Apical dominance and root competition are common
   factors shaping these plant performance mea-sures. We followed these
   results with two additional experiments to test if such results could be
   explained by the partial release of apical dominance or root
   competition. In the apical dominance release experiment (II), biomass
   and number of branches of distal sections were significantly increased.
   However, at the whole clonal fragment level, main stolon and inter-node
   length were both significantly decreased after apical ends were
   disconnected. In the root competition experiment (III), no significant
   effect was found indicating weak root competition in homogeneous
   environments. We concluded that stolon connection had no significant
   effects on the biomass of C. dactylon while it affected plant morphology
   in homogeneous environments. Secondly, clonal architecture is partially
   determined by the presence of ramet connection and apical dominance.
   Removal of the apical end may have enhanced development of the distal
   sections, but the loss of stolon connection with distal sections
   inhibited the performance of apical sections leading to negative effects
   to the whole clonal fragment. Apical dominance seems more important than
   root competition for plant performance of C. dactylon under homogeneous
   envi-ronments, but this is only one clonal species in one environmental
   condition.},

Title = {Comparison of footprint tracking and pitfall trapping for detecting
   skinks},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Inventory and monitoring of biodiversity requires effective sampling
   tools. Footprint tracking tunnels, developed in New Zealand to monitor
   small mammals, may also be useful for sampling lizards and other
   reptiles but more research is needed to verify this. To that end, we
   compared the detectability of terrestrial skinks using two methods:
   pitfall trapping and footprint tracking. In New Zealand, the former is
   the traditional method for sampling skinks, while the latter is
   routinely used to monitor populations of introduced rodents and
   mustelids. In January 2019, we operated paired grids containing 5 x 5
   arrays of pitfall traps and standard rodent tracking tunnels on Tiwai
   Peninsula in Southland, South Island, and compared the daily proportions
   of traps and tunnels that detected skinks via captures and footprints,
   respectively. Overall, tracking tunnels were approximately twice as
   likely to detect skinks as pitfall traps. Additional research is
   required to: (1) test the relative efficacy of footprint tracking versus
   conventional detection methods on other lizard and reptile species; (2)
   investigate alternative tunnel designs and long-life lures; and, (3)
   calibrate footprint tracking rates against density estimates to assess
   suitability for monitoring.},

Title = {Factors affecting home range size of feral cats: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Managing invasive species requires knowledge of their ecology, including
   distribution, habitat use, and home range. In particular, understanding
   how biotic and abiotic factors influence home range can help with pest
   management decision-making, as well as informing native species
   management. Feral cats, self-sustaining cat populations that live
   independently of people, have caused numerous extinctions and continue
   to adversely affect native species globally. Managing feral cat
   populations requires spatially explicit knowledge to enable strategic
   deployment of management or monitoring devices, understand where native
   species are most likely to be at risk, and to mitigate the spread of
   cat-vectored diseases such as toxoplasmosis. Here, we present a
   meta-analysis of factors that influence feral cat home range size
   including land use types, differing levels of land use heterogeneity,
   and numbers of competitors. Male feral cats had larger home ranges than
   females, but effects of season, competitors, habitat heterogeneity, or
   land use on feral cat home range were not statistically significant,
   possibly due to high variability (male cat home range: 22.1 to 3232 ha;
   female cat home range: 9.6 to 2078 ha). This may reflect the fact that
   cats are generalists and are able to exploit any opportunity. Thus, we
   recommend that these factors and others, such as prey availability and
   composition, should be included in future research, so that the
   variability in home range size can be better understood. Improved
   understanding is vital for improving feral cat management in ecosystems
   where cats have been introduced.},

Title = {Consistency in impact assessments of invasive species is generally high
   and depends on protocols and impact types},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {163-190},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Impact assessments can help prioritising limited resources for invasive
   species management. However, their usefulness to provide information for
   decision-making depends on their repeatability, i.e. the consist-ency of
   the estimated impact. Previous studies have provided important insights
   into the consistency of final scores and rankings. However, due to the
   criteria to summarise protocol responses into one value (e.g. maximum
   score observed) or to categorise those final scores into prioritisation
   levels, the real consistency at the answer level remains poorly
   understood. Here, we fill this gap by quantifying and comparing the
   consistency in the scores of protocol questions with inter-rater
   reliability metrics. We provide an overview of impact assessment
   consistency and the factors altering it, by evaluating 1,742 impact
   assessments of 60 terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrates,
   invertebrates and plants conducted with seven protocols ap-plied in
   Europe (EICAT; EPPO; EPPO prioritisation; GABLIS; GB; GISS; and
   Harmonia+). Assessments include questions about diverse impact types:
   environment, biodiversity, native species interactions, hy-bridisation,
   economic losses and human health. Overall, the great majority of
   assessments (67\%) showed high consistency; only a small minority (13\%)
   presented low consistency. Consistency of responses did not depend on
   species identity or the amount of information on their impacts, but
   partly depended on the impact type evaluated and the protocol used,
   probably due to linguistic uncertainties (pseudo-R2 = 0.11 and 0.10,
   respectively). Consistency of responses was highest for questions on
   ecosystem and human health impacts and lowest for questions regarding
   biological interactions amongst alien and native spe-cies. Regarding
   protocols, consistency was highest with Harmonia+ and GISS and lowest
   with EPPO. The presence of few, but very low, consistent assessments
   indicates that there is room for improvement in the repeatability of
   assessments. As no single factor explained largely the variance in
   consistency, low values can rely on multiple factors. We thus endorse
   previous studies calling for diverse and complementary ac-tions, such as
   improving protocols and guidelines or consensus assessment to increase
   impact assessment repeatability. Nevertheless, we conclude that impact
   assessments were generally highly consistent and, therefore, useful in
   helping to prioritise resources against the continued relentless rise of
   invasive species.},

Title = {Regional models do not outperform continental models for invasive
   species},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Aim: Species distribution models can guide invasive species prevention
   and management by characterizing invasion risk across space. However,
   extrapolation and transferability issues pose challenges for developing
   useful models for invasive species. Previous work has emphasized the
   importance of including all available occurrences in model estimation,
   but managers attuned to local processes may be skeptical of models based
   on a broad spatial extent if they suspect the captured responses reflect
   those of other regions where data are more numerous. We asked whether
   species distribution models for invasive plants performed better when
   developed at national versus regional extents. Methods: We developed
   ensembles of species distribution models trained nationally, on
   sagebrush habitat, or on sagebrush habitat within three ecoregions
   (Great Basin, eastern sagebrush, and Great Plains) for nine invasive
   plants of interest for early detection and rapid response at local or
   regional scales. We compared the performance of national versus regional
   models using spatially independent withheld test data from each of the
   three ecoregions. Results: We found that models trained using a national
   spatial extent tended to perform better than regionally trained models.
   Regional models did not outperform national ones even when considerable
   occurrence data were available for model estimation within the focal
   region. Information was often unavailable to fit informative regional
   models precisely in those areas of greatest interest for early detection
   and rapid response. Main conclusions: Habitat suitability models for
   invasive plant species trained at a continental extent can reduce
   extrapolation while maximizing information on species' responses to
   environmental variation. Standard modeling methods can capture spatially
   varying limiting factors, while regional or hierarchical models may only
   be advantageous when populations differ in their responses to
   environmental conditions, a condition expected to be relatively rare at
   the expanding boundaries of invasive species' distributions.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, there has been a major decrease in the numbers of old and
   large sardines in the Gulf of Lions, which has had a major effect on
   regional fisheries. A bottom-up process involving a shift in diet
   towards smaller planktonic prey has been suggested as the main driver of
   this development. Yet, the reproductive capacities of the sardines have
   not changed, suggesting potential modifications in energy allocation
   trade-offs. Whether this could also affect maintenance, in particular at
   the end of the winter reproductive period, and explain the lower adult
   survival and the disappearance of older individuals remains unclear. We
   therefore experimentally investigated the consequences of seasonal food
   availability (summer vs. winter) on life-history traits and energy
   allocation trade-offs at the individual and population levels. Our
   results indicate that food resources during summer had a major effect on
   energy reserves and growth, limiting the maximum size and body condition
   reached at the end of reproduction. In addition, food restrictions
   during growth and/or reproduction periods led to physiological costs
   mediated by increased oxidative damage. Mediterranean sardines did not
   show any ability for compensatory growth and did not appear to be
   capital breeders. Instead, they displayed individual differences in
   coping with physiological constraints and displayed various life-history
   strategies regardless of food availability. We highlighted 3 main
   individual energy allocation strategies: (1) preferential allocation to
   body condition or (2) to growth, or (3) simultaneous allocation to
   reproduction and growth. These issues are key, as climate change is
   expected to favour smaller phytoplankton, which might amplify the
   deterioration in the condition of pelagic fish.},

Title = {Defaunation by deoxygenation: efficacy and divergent responses of
   estuarine macroinvertebrates},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {17-24},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Understanding the influence of macroinvertebrates on ecosystem function
   often relies on experimental defaunation with methods that remove fauna
   through minimal sample disturbance. Defaunation is challenging and can
   lead to confounding effects and/or loss of empirical information when
   unsuccessful. We evaluated the ability of a deoxygenation treatment to
   remove macroinvertebrates from sediment cores collected in 2 regions of
   a microtidal estuary. Only 1 of 16 cores was fully defaunated following
   3 deoxygenation cycles. To counteract confounding effects of partial
   defaunation, we quantified the biomass remaining in each core and used
   these data as a covariate in statistical models. The unremoved biomass
   had, in some cases, significant effects on alkalinity fluxes, with
   positive linear relationships evident, and net phosphate fluxes. The
   community in the upper estuary that regularly experiences hypoxia
   exhibited stronger sediment emergence responses (82-100\%). The
   remaining fauna were spread equally among annelids, molluscs and
   arthropods in abundance, although arthropods dominated the biomass. In
   contrast, fewer macroinvertebrates emerged from sediments from the lower
   estuary (47-89\%), with most of the remaining biomass and abundance
   being annelids and molluscs. These findings suggest that estuarine taxa
   have divergent responses to hypoxia and that regional communities are
   variably prone to eradication of sensitive taxa. Our study shows how the
   use of defaunation by deoxygenation can create systematic bias,
   particularly when comparing areas with disparate in situ oxygen regimes,
   and provides a way to quantitively account for partial defaunation
   without sacrificing statistical power or using overly destructive
   methods.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {697},
Pages = {31-43},

Abstract = {Accurate estimates of productivity of marine macrophytes are crucial to
   predict the consequences of invasive species expansions and
   climate-related range shifts on coastal ecosystem functioning and carbon
   cycling. We examined the potential impacts of climate-driven shifts in
   the relative abundances of foundation species within a temperate reef
   system on net primary productivity. Specifically, we estimated
   productivity rates of 3 co-occurring kelp species (Laminaria hyperborea,
   L. ochroleuca and Undaria pinnatifida) in contrasting regions of their
   ranges (centre, leading-edge and invasive, respectively) via in situ
   photorespirometry methods in Brittany, France. Lamina tissues of
   cold-temperate L. hyperborea and warm-temperate L. ochroleuca had
   similar rates of net productivity. The stipes of L. hyperborea, however,
   displayed much higher rates of productivity and respiration than L.
   ochroleuca, likely due to the dense macroalgal epiphytes colonising
   their surface. Our results suggest that replacement of L. hyperborea by
   L. ochroleuca in the NE Atlantic due to increased dominance or further
   range expansion of this warm-temperate species might lead to reduced net
   rates of productivity as a result of increased lamina respiration and
   reduced photosynthetic capacity of stipes. The invasive kelp U.
   pinnatifida had high rates of net productivity at saturating light
   levels (294 mu mol O2 g-1 dry weight h-1), 3 times higher than any kelp
   species ever incubated in situ, helping to explain its high success as
   an invader. We show that shifts in the distributions and relative
   abundances of seemingly similar foundation species may lead to
   subsequent changes in net metabolic balance.},

Title = {Three Decades of Changing Nutrient Stoichiometry from Source to Sea on

Pages = {1809-1824},

Abstract = {European ecosystems have been subject to extensive shifts in
   anthropogenic disturbance, primarily through atmospheric deposition,
   climate change, and land management. These changes have altered the
   macronutrient composition of aquatic systems, with widespread increases
   in organic carbon (C), and declines in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).
   Less well known is how these disturbances have affected nutrient
   stoichiometry, which may be a more useful metric to evaluate the health
   of aquatic ecosystems than individual nutrient concentrations. The
   Swedish west coast has historically experienced moderate to high levels
   of atmospheric deposition of sulfate and N, and eutrophication. In
   addition, coastal waters have been darkening with damaging effects on
   marine flora and fauna. Here, we present three decades of macronutrient
   data from twenty lakes and watercourses along the Swedish west coast,
   extending from headwaters to river mouths, across a range of land
   covers, and with catchments ranging 0.037-40,000 km(2). We find a high
   degree of consistency between these diverse sites, with widespread
   increasing trends in organic C, and declines in inorganic N and total P.
   These trends in individual macronutrients translate into large
   stoichiometric changes, with a doubling in C:P, and increases in C:N and
   N:P by 50\% and 30\%, showing that freshwaters are moving further away
   from the Redfield Ratio, and becoming even more C rich, and depleted in
   N and P. Although recovery from atmospheric deposition is linked to some
   of these changes, land cover also appears to have an effect; lakes
   buffer against C increases, and decreases in inorganic N have been
   greatest under arable land cover. Our analysis also detects coherently
   declining P concentrations in small forest lakes; so called (and
   unexplained) ``oligotrophication.{''} Taken together, our findings show
   that freshwater macronutrient concentrations and stoichiometry have
   undergone substantial shifts during the last three decades, and these
   shifts can potentially explain some of the detrimental changes that
   adjacent coastal ecosystems are undergoing. Our findings are relevant
   for all European and North American waters that have experienced
   historically high levels of atmospheric deposition, and provide a
   starting point for understanding and mitigating against the trajectories
   of long-term change in aquatic systems.},

Abstract = {Land management decisions have profound impacts on biological
   communities. Various administrative units are likely to implement
   different management decisions, with the result that consistent
   biological patterns that track administrative boundaries may emerge. To
   assess these relationships, we collected data on land cover, disturbance
   evidence, and tree communities in randomized sampling sites located in
   National Park, US Forest Service Wilderness, and US Forest Service
   Non-wilderness distributed across the Great Smoky Mountains National
   Park Protected AreaCentered Ecosystem (GRSM PACE). We examined how
   present-day values for these ecological responses were linked to both
   biophysical site characteristics (as the foundation for ecological
   communities) and jurisdiction type (as categories that integrate the
   combination of dynamic social decisions and management practices since
   initial designation). The variable representing administrative unit,
   jurisdiction type, acted as an umbrella indicator of the management
   trajectory and social influences that have affected a site and emerged
   as an important predictor of groundcover types (grass and litter), tree
   diversity, and wildlife sign at sites across the GRSM PACE. This was an
   exploratory study with limited sample size, so more data are needed to
   explore the mechanisms driving these relationships. These initial
   findings, however, suggest that differences in management activities
   alter the ecological trajectory of sites across the PACE. Given dynamic
   and diverse management practices, our data suggest jurisdiction overlaid
   on biophysical site information may be useful to rapidly assess how
   socially defined landscape activities impact biological responses,
   particularly when both are stressed by global change.},

Title = {Applying ecological research to improve long-term outcomes of wilding
   conifer management},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Removing wilding conifers (invasive non-native trees in the Pinaceae)
   has become a major focus of conservation and land management in Aotearoa
   New Zealand. Management of wilding conifers has been supported by
   applied research on control methods, generally with a short-term focus
   of removing or containing invasions to prevent further spread. However,
   a focus on short-term management activities may not achieve desired
   longer-term outcomes of restoring economic and environmental values.
   Greater integration of ecological research on wilding conifer impacts
   and legacies with management can help to ensure long-term goals are
   achieved. We review how impacts and legacies of wilding conifers develop
   and persist over time. Several key thresholds or tipping points are
   identified, where prioritising management may avoid state-changes in
   ecosystems. We then review the potential of sites to support different
   land uses after wilding conifers have been controlled, including
   pasture, plantations and native restoration, and develop a decision
   support tree to guide successful transition to these land uses. We find
   that maintaining anthropogenic native tussock grasslands is unlikely to
   be a sustainable goal on most invaded sites without major sustained
   management interventions. Native woody cover is likely more sustainable,
   but often requires additional management of post-removal legacies of
   wilding conifers, including other invasive plants such as sward-forming

Title = {Defoliation facilitates Leymus chinensis clones spatial expansion into
   saline-alkali soils under different population densities},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Defoliation/grazing and competition could have impacts on growth and
   spatial expansion of clonal plants. However, how these factors
   influencing clonal plants spatial expansion in heterogeneous
   environments remain ambiguous. A pot experiment was conducted to examine
   the effects of defoliation, intraspecific competition and their
   interactions on the spatial expansion of Leymus chinensis (Trin.)
   Tzvel., a dominant clonal plant species in the Songnen grassland,
   northeast China, from favourable soil patches to saline-alkali soil
   patches. Results showed that defoliation significantly increased L.
   chinensis spatial expansion from favourable soil patches into saline
   -alkali ones. The average rhizome length increased, as did the number of
   ramets growing in saline-alkali soil patches. Intraspecific competition
   had no documented effects on these parameters. Defoliation increased the
   total biomass of the ramets in moderate and severe saline-alkali patches
   by 33\% and 22\%, respectively. Across the saline-alkali stress regimes,
   defoliation increased the belowground biomass by 26\%, while increased
   aboveground biomass by 18\%. Results demonstrated that defoliation
   improved L. chinensis expansion in saline -alkali soil patches mainly
   due to increased belowground biomass, which contributes to rhizome
   elongation and ramet proliferation. Therefore, it is suggested that
   defoliation/mowing management practices in Songnen degraded grasslands
   might promote the expansion and colonization of L. chinensis clones
   toward degraded saline -alkali patches, thereby accelerating vegetative
   reconstruction and grassland restoration.},

Abstract = {Natural products derived from native plant species may be an alternative
   for the control of invasive exotic plants, thus reducing the use of
   synthetic herbicides. The present study evaluated the phytotoxicity of
   the essential oil of Hesperozygis ringens (Benth.) Epling, a native
   plant to the Pampa Biome, as an alternative for the control of
   Eragrostis plana Nees, an invasive exotic plant from the South Brazilian
   grasslands. The effect of the essential oil and pulegone, its major
   component, on germination and initial plant growth was evaluated at
   concentrations 0 (control), 0.001\%, 0.0025\%, 0.005\%, 0.01\%, and
   0.02\% (v/v). Furthermore, chlorophyll concentration, hydrogen peroxide
   accumulation, and loss of plasma membrane integrity were evaluated in
   adult plants at concentrations of 0 (control) and 0.02\% for 48 and 60
   h. Germination and root/shoot development were negatively affected
   starting at the concentration of 0.001\%, with the most evident results
   at higher essential oil concentrations. Reduced chlorophyll
   concentration and tissue damage, due to hydrogen peroxide accumulation
   as well as loss of plasma membrane integrity, were also observed, thus
   showing the potential for this essential oil to control E. plana.
   Pulegone also had inhibitory effects during E. plana germination and
   seedling formation. Field studies must be conducted to check potential
   toxic effects on the environment and to determine its applicability as a
   natural herbicide.},

Abstract = {Salmonids are an extensively hatchery-reared group of fishes that have
   been introduced worldwide mainly for their high commercial and
   recreational value. The Balkan Peninsula (south-eastern Europe) is
   char-acterised by an outstanding salmonid diversity that has become
   threatened by the introduction of non-native salmonids whose potential
   risk of invasiveness in the region remains unknown and especially so
   under predicted climate change conditions. In this study, 13 extant and
   four horizon non-native salmonid species were screened for their risk of
   invasiveness in the Danube and Adriatic basins of four Balkan
   coun-tries. Overall, six (35\%) of the screened species were ranked as
   carrying a high risk of invasiveness under current climate conditions,
   whereas under predicted conditions of global warming, this number
   decreased to three (17\%). Under current climate conditions, the very
   high risk ('top invasive') species were rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
   mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta (sensu stricto), whereas under
   predicted climate change, this was true only of O. mykiss. A high risk
   was also attributed to horizon vendace Coregonus albula and lake charr
   Salvelinus namaycush, and to extant Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and
   brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, whose risk of invasiveness, except
   for S. fontinalis, decreased to medium. For the other eleven medium-risk
   species, the risk score decreased under predicted climate change, but
   still remained medium. The outcomes of this study reveal that global
   warming will influence salmonids and that only species with wider
   temperature tolerance, such as O. mykiss will likely prevail. It is
   anticipated that the present results may contribute to the
   implementation of appropriate management plans to prevent the
   introduction and translocation of non-native salmonids across the Balkan
   Peninsula. Additionally, adequate measures should be developed for
   aquaculture facilities to prevent escapees of non-native salmonids with
   a high risk of invasiveness, especially into recipient areas of high
   conservation value.},

Title = {Evidence of shared trends in juvenile fish recruitment to nearshore

Abstract = {Monitoring abundance of juveniles over time is fundamental to effective
   fisheries management, especially when juvenile abundance may be used to
   predict future productivity. Yet, the mechanisms underlying variation in
   fish recruitment remain a source of uncertainty for fully understanding
   population dynamics. Given the interest in progression from
   single-species to ecosystem-based fisheries management, tracking
   multiple species over time and determining overall trends becomes a key
   component of management. Therefore, we (1) examined potential temporal
   synchrony among recruitment of juvenile fish species to seagrass
   habitats along the West Florida Shelf (WFS) in the eastern Gulf of
   Mexico and (2) sought to identify potential environmental covariates
   driving shared trends among species. Dynamic factor analysis identified
   3 shared trends among catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time series of 11
   species from a 2008-2018 trawl survey. The first and third trends had
   similar bimodal patterns with high CPUEs at the beginning of the time
   series, a decline, and then an increase near the end of the time series.
   The second trend had increasing CPUEs for the first 2 yr, a stable but
   variable trend in the middle, and an increase thereafter. Within the
   annual trends, most species' seasonal CPUEs mimicked seasonal
   variability of seagrass biomass. Furthermore, southeast to westerly
   winds along the WFS 1 mo prior to sampling coincided with increased
   juvenile fish abundance for multiple species. Although the model is not
   without its limitations, there is evidence of shared recruitment
   patterns among fishes, which can inform multispecies survey design,
   habitat protection and restoration efforts, and management decisions for
   data-rich and data-limited species.},

Title = {Defining invasive species and demonstrating impacts of biological
   invasions: a scientometric analysis of studies on invasive alien plants
   in Brazil over the past 20 years},

Abstract = {Despite biological invasions being widely recognised as an important
   driver of environmental change, lack of consensus regarding the
   definition of invasive alien species (IAS) and vagueness around the
   demonstra-tion of their impacts limits knowledge and research in this
   field. In this study, a scientometric approach was used to analyse
   academic documents published between 2002 and 2021 in three databases
   with refer-ence to invasive alien plants in Brazil. Despite the growing
   body of scientific literature in the area, only 10\% of the publications
   provided some definition of invasive species. Of the 398 publications
   analysed, 23.6\% found some type of damage caused by the invader and, of
   these, only 5\% addressed economic or social damage. Only 17\% of the
   publications proposed a method for controlling and/or mitigating
   bio-logical invasions. The absence of clear terminology and the lack of
   focus on impacts limits understanding of IAS of plants in Brazil. Based
   on the present findings, future studies on IAS of plants should move
   towards a consensus on the definition of biological invasion, as well as
   understand the impact caused by these species. In addition, it is
   recommended that further scientometric studies should guide future
   efforts to support objective measures for management and
   decision-making.},

Title = {The scale of seasonal migrations in the urban part of the Great Tit

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {28-36},
Abstract = {Aim. This research aims to study the Great Tit breeding density,
   depending on the distance from preferred wintering sites with all other
   things being equal. Material and Methods. 36 route counts were carried
   out in 22 locations ranging up to 95 km away from the preferred
   wintering sites. The data was collected in the same weather and climatic
   zone. The route counts were carried out in the wintering season
   (January) and in the breeding season (16 April - 15 May) in 2014-2018.
   To consider the influence of small settlements, where a smaller number
   of tits spends winter in comparison with a large city, sample sites were
   characterized by the population of people living within a radius of 25
   km around the sample site. Results. Most Great Tits prefer to minimise
   the distance from their wintering sites to their nesting sites. The most
   preferred distance of seasonal movement is 10-20 km from a large city,
   the main wintering place for this species. Conclusions. The density of
   the Great Tit population during the nesting period increases
   exponentially with the proximity of wintering sites. When more than 20
   km from wintering sites, the density of the species during the nesting
   period does not change reliably. The maximum immanent density during the
   nesting period is achieved in places of favourable wintering of the
   species, that is, in a metropolis with agglomeration.},

Title = {Atlantic inflow is the primary driver of remotely sensed autumn blooms
   in the Barents Sea},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {25-40},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Arctic shelf seas have historically hosted a single spring bloom,
   contrasting with temperate seas, where additional smaller autumn blooms
   occur regularly, caused by storm systems mixing nutrient-rich deep
   waters towards the surface ocean. Post millennium, autumn blooms have
   increased in frequency in Arctic shelf seas. Delayed sea-ice formation,
   stronger autumn winds and greater inflows of nutrient-rich temperate
   waters have all been suggested to support growing annual net primary
   production and an increasing incidence of autumn blooms. Here, we
   investigated data sets of remotely sensed September chlorophyll a, sea
   surface temperature, current and wind speeds. We explored mechanistic
   drivers of autumn blooms in the Barents Sea, one of the most productive
   Arctic shelf seas, to better understand the role of strong winds and the
   ingression of Atlantic waters in the dynamics of autumn blooms. We
   performed geographically resolved regressions between remotely sensed
   September chlorophyll a and environmental conditions in the Barents Sea,
   demonstrating a strong dependency of autumn bloom intensity on Atlantic
   inflow. This result highlights the importance of increased study of
   autumn phytoplankton bloom dynamics on Arctic shelf seas, especially the
   further collection and dissemination of in situ cell count and nutrient
   data to determine the significance of autumn blooms for wider ecosystem
   function.},

Title = {Impacts of marine protected areas and the environment on larval rockfish
   species richness and assemblage structure in the Southern California
   Bight},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},
Pages = {125-137},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Although it is well established that marine protected areas (MPAs) are
   effective tools for augmenting the abundance of fished species, effects
   on biodiversity and assemblage structure are less clear. Many rockfish
   (genus Sebastes) species were overfished in the California Current
   Ecosystem at the turn of the 21st century, leading to establishment of 2
   large MPAs in the Southern California Bight, the Cowcod Conservation
   Areas (CCAs). The CCAs, alongside favorable environmental conditions,
   helped rebuild overfished rockfish stocks by 2019. Here we assessed the
   impacts of the CCAs and environment (temperature, oxygen, salinity,
   chlorophyll a) on rockfish diversity and assemblage structure using a 16
   yr time series (1998-2013) of genetically identified rockfish larvae.
   Larval rockfish richness generally increased across the time series,
   with the greatest increases inside CCAs when temperature was low and
   dissolved oxygen was high. We also found a clear species assemblage
   shift after the implementations of the CCAs, driven largely by
   rockfishes targeted by fisheries. This shift was most likely initially
   driven by maturation of a strong 1999 year class, and sustained by
   protection from fishing and favorable environmental conditions. Our
   results suggest that the large and long-term MPAs along the southern
   California coast have induced increases in the diversity of larval
   rockfish, driven largely by the direct effects of fishing cessation on
   targeted species.},

Title = {Depth distributions of benthic and pelagic species highlight the
   potential of mesophotic and deep habitats to serve as marine refugia},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {39-52},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Shallow marine ecosystems are threatened by human impacts. The prospect
   that deeper environments could serve as refugia is promising but remains
   uncertain, as it has been evaluated primarily in benthic taxa and on
   small spatial scales. We use a dataset of all biota from the Gulf of
   Mexico to evaluate the degree to which species' occurrences extend
   across shallow (0-30 m), mesophotic (>30-150 m), and deep (>150 m)
   environments. High percentages of species inhabit multiple depth zones:
   70\% of benthic and 81\% of pelagic species occurring in the mesophotic
   zone are also found in the shallow zone, and 45\% of benthic and 80\% of
   pelagic species found in the shallow zone extend into mesophotic depths.
   After accounting for confounding effects using logistic regression,
   pelagic species have significantly higher odds of extending between
   depth zones than benthic species. Analyses of species in adjacent 20 m
   depth bands reveal taxonomically distinct communities of benthic species
   from 0 to 100 m and pelagic species from 0 to 200 m. Peaks in
   probability distributions show that pelagic species generally have
   broader depth ranges than benthic species. Depth ranges that overlap
   between deeper and shallower zones show that movement of individuals or
   propagules in one or both directions between these habitats is either
   occurring now or has occurred in the past. Over the long term, deeper
   habitats can allow species to escape regional extirpation, and can
   contribute to the resilience and persistence of coastal ecosystems in
   the face of increased disturbance in shallow water. This is particularly
   true when pelagic species are considered.},

Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Seabirds play important roles as marine ecosystem sentinels. Studying
   their at-sea ecology is essential for understanding how environmental
   variability affects their populations. However, the at-sea ecology of
   small-sized temperate seabirds remains poorly studied. We explored the
   at-sea ecology of the Critically Endangered MacGillivray's prion
   Pachyptila macgillivrayi breeding on the subtropical Saint Paul Island.
   Using global location sensor loggers and stable isotope analysis, we
   investigated movements, migratory strategies, at-sea activity and
   moulting period, and characterized the isotopic niche of tracked
   individuals. During incubation, MacGillivray's prions remained in
   temperate waters north of the Subtropical Front, possibly feeding on
   prey caught in cold eddies. During the inter-breeding period,
   individuals wintered almost equally to the north and south of the
   Subtropical Front in 2 distinct sectors (Tasman Sea and Southwest Indian
   Ridge). Daily activity varied seasonally, and individuals overwintering
   in the Tasman Sea spent more time flying at night when moonlight
   intensity was high. Moulting occurred after the breeding period and
   lasted longer compared to other prion species. Isotopic data suggest a
   higher dietary proportion of low trophic-level prey for MacGillivray's
   prions than for Antarctic and slender-billed prions, highlighting
   trophic segregation in relation to bill width. Our study provides new
   evidence to understand the suite of adaptations allowing the abundant
   prion species to coexist by feeding on prey of different sizes. Contrary
   to the majority of seabird species, MacGillivray's prions from Saint
   Paul Island exhibited 2 migratory tactics with associated differences in
   at-sea activity, leading to questions about the origin of these
   differences.},

Title = {Assessing marine ecosystem complexity: isotopic integration of the

Abstract = {Understanding the processes structuring communities is a fundamental
   goal in ecology and conservation biology. Seabirds are commonly used as
   sentinels of marine ecosystems, but there is a lack of quantitative
   information providing a synoptic view of their community structure and
   of its underlying mechanisms. We used stable isotope analysis of chick
   feathers to investigate the structure of 2 communities that are
   representative of the subantarctic (Kerguelen) and Antarctic (Adelie
   Land) seabird diversity. Total area of the convex hull (a measure of the
   total delta C-13-delta N-15 niche space) was 8.4-fold higher at the
   Kerguelen Islands than in Adelie Land, a consequence of the higher
   seabird diversity at the former locality. Kerguelen seabirds grouped
   into 2 clusters of oceanic and inshore species, with the latter group
   not represented in Adelie Land. Communities are primarily structured by
   the availability of foraging habitats (delta C-13) and then of trophic
   resources (delta N-15), with body size being a major driving force of
   trophic position. Ecological characteristics are more important than
   phylogeny to shape seabird isotopic niche breadth (standard ellipse area
   corrected for small sample size, SEAc), with no significant differences
   between Sphenisciformes, Procellariiformes, and Charadriiformes. By
   contrast, SEAc varies according to foraging guilds, diet, and a
   specialist-generalist gradient, with ubiquitous seabirds having a
   10-fold larger mean SEAc than pelagic divers. This study sets a baseline
   against which the effects of long-term environmental changes on seabird
   community structure can be studied across years and conditions, and
   provides a relevant starting point for the investigation into the effect
   of climate change on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

Title = {Plant origin and trade-off between generative and vegetative
   reproduction determine germination behaviour of a dominant grass species
   along climatic gradients},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {297},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An increasing number of studies explore the effects of climate change on
   plants; less studies have paid attention to germination. Even less is
   known on a trade-off between investment to generative and vegetative
   reproduction. To assess how conditions of plant origin, germination
   climate and seed mass affect species' germination, we studied Festuca
   rubra originating from localities situated along a natural climatic grid
   with a factorial combi-nation of temperatures and precipitations.
   Germination of seeds of different origin was tested in two temperature
   and two soil moisture regimes, simulating extremes of the climatic grid.
   To study the relationship between generative and vegetative
   reproduction, we used previous data on vegetative traits of the species
   originating from the same study system. Higher seed mass and warm
   germination temperature contributed to higher and faster germination.
   However, the effects of temperature and moisture interacted leading to
   low germination and high proportion of dormant seeds in warm, dry
   conditions. Seeds of plants originating from warm climate had higher
   germination than those from cold climate; the effects of original
   climate were partly due to differences in seed mass. Total germination
   negatively correlated with plant performance variables contributing to
   vegetative reproduction. Both conditions of plant origin and of
   germination determine species' germination and the effect of plant
   origin can partly be explained by seed mass. We confirmed a trade-off
   between generative and vegetative reproduction indicating that,
   depending on the actual conditions, the species is able to modify
   investments to generative or vegetative reproduction.},

Title = {Comparative leaf blade anatomical analysis of the annual Polygonum s.

Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Leaf blade anatomy in six annual plant taxa of the genus Polygonum from
   the western and central regions of the Balkan Peninsula and the southern
   region of the Pannonian Plain was analyzed. The aim was to compare the
   anatomical characteristics of the leaf blades and identify the
   diagnostic significance of these traits in the taxonomy of the studied
   taxa. The analyses included 32 populations, and focused on 18
   quantitative (14 basic and 4 derived) and 5 qualitative traits. A
   detailed description of the leaf anatomy was also provided for all
   examined taxa. Based on the statistical analysis and tests conducted on
   the quantitative leaf blade anatomical traits, it is possible to
   distinguish P. albanicum from the remaining taxa (P. arenarium subsp.
   arenarium, P. arenarium subsp. pulchellum, P. arenastrum, P. aviculare,
   and P. graminifolium). However, the analyzed quantitative
   characteristics did not contribute to the delimitation of the remaining
   taxa or to the formation of new groups within this genus. Consequently,
   they are insufficient for the separation of the examined taxa, but can
   provide important additional taxonomic information. On the other hand,
   the results yielded by nonparametric statistical analyses confirm that
   the analyzed qualitative traits, the midrib protrusion in particular,
   and the presence and level of protrusion of the lateral ribs, are
   valuable in taxa delimitation.},

Title = {The invasiveness of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is characterized
   by habitat and differing herbivore assemblages in its native and invaded
   range},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {25-44},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {A significant challenge of global change is the human-mediated movement
   of pasture grasses and their subsequent impact on ecosystem processes
   when they become invasive. We must understand invasive grass ecology and
   their natural enemies in native and introduced ranges to mitigate these
   impacts. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is a pantropically
   introduced pasture grass that escapes intended areas and invades native
   ecosystems - threatening biodiversity and ecosystem function. The
   success of invasive plants has of-ten been attributed to ecological
   release from stressors, including natural enemies and resource
   availability. Our objective was to assess Guinea grass functional traits
   across three different habitat types in native and invaded ranges by
   documenting ungulate and arthropod abundance, diversity, and feeding
   guilds. Guinea grass functional traits were assessed in three habitat
   types: grassland, riparian, and woody thickets around nitrogen-fixing
   Prosopis glandulosa in its introduced range in Texas, USA, and Senegalia
   mellifera in its native range in Kenya. We characterized Guinea grass
   functional traits by measuring plant height, cover, biomass,
   root-to-shoot ratios, and reproductive traits. We then examined the
   phytophagous arthropod and ungulate abundance and feeding guild
   diversity across the three habitat types. We hypothesized that
   functional trait expression related to invasiveness would be associated
   with Guinea grass in its introduced range. Also, we hypothesized that
   the abundance and diversity of phytophagous arthropods and ungulates
   would be lower in the invaded range. Finally, we hypothesized that
   Guinea grass functional traits would differ between the three habitat
   types, given the habitat types' innate differences in resource
   availability. We found that Guinea grass was 2.5 times taller and 3.3
   times more productive and covered 2.5 times more area in its invaded
   versus native ranges. Introduced Guinea grass had higher reproduction
   rates with 2.5 times more reproductive tillers, while habitat type drove
   vegetative reproduction with 15 times more stoloniferous establishment
   in wooded and riparian sites than grasslands. Texan ungulate communities
   were less species-rich, less functionally diverse, and less abundant
   than the Kenyan ungulate community. The phytophagous arthropod diversity
   on plants was twice as high on Kenyan Guinea grass than on Texan Guinea
   grass. Total arthropod family richness was nearly double, with 15
   families represented in Kenya and 8 in Texas. These results suggest that
   Guinea grass has escaped a rich assemblage of arthropods and ungulates
   and likely explains some of its spread in introduced ranges. This study
   demonstrates how the invasive success of Guinea grass can be understood
   in terms of its competitive ability and interaction with natural enemies
   in the introduced and native ranges and may inform future biological
   control.},

Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Conservation across jurisdictional boundaries can help achieve recovery
   goals for species at risk, provide funding for conservation actions by
   private landowners, and reduce regulatory burdens. Habitat crediting
   programs, a type of offsite mitigation, are a relatively new form of
   cross-boundary conservation. To better understand the current status of
   these programs and their perceived strengths and shortcomings for
   species conservation, credit providers (e.g., private landowners), and
   credit purchasers (e.g., federal agencies), we surveyed the literature
   and online resources, and engaged with a small group of professionals
   who have been closely involved with habitat crediting programs. From
   these resources and interactions, we identified nine habitat crediting
   programs in the United States. Those engaged in these programs suggest
   that the programs may provide regulatory relief, a positive return on
   investment for participants, and benefits to species conservation in
   some contexts. However, economic and institutional challenges include
   up-front costs of participation and divergent preferences for short-term
   or permanent contracts. Furthermore, programs tend to measure ecological
   success by monitoring habitat amount and condition rather than species'
   abundance, survival, and reproduction. As such, monitoring is not always
   sufficiently rigorous to assess ecological outcomes and account for
   environmental change. We suggest that habitat crediting programs hold
   promise for meeting multiple objectives for at-risk species, landowners,
   and developers, but their potential often is hampered by high
   transaction costs and a lack of the ecological information needed to
   evaluate success.},

Title = {Risk of invasiveness of non-native fishes in the South Caucasus
   biodiversity and geopolitical hotspot},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},

Abstract = {Aquatic invasions are one of the major threats for freshwater
   ecosystems. However, in developing countries, knowledge of biological
   invasions, essential for the implementation of appropriate legislation,
   is often limited if not entirely lacking. In this regard, the
   identification of potentially invasive non-native species by risk
   screening, followed by a full risk assessment of the species ranked as
   higher risk, enables decision-makers to be informed about the extent of
   the threats posed to the recipient (risk assessment) area. In this
   study, 32 non-native extant and horizon fish species were screened for
   their risk of invasiveness under current and predicted climate
   conditions for the South Caucasus - a biodiversity and geopolitical
   hotspot that includes the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   Overall, the number of very high-risk species increased from four
   (12.5\%) under current climate conditions to 12 (37.5\%) under predicted
   climate conditions. The highest-risk species under both conditions
   included the already established gibel carp Carassius gibelio and
   topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, the locally translocated pikeperch
   Sander lucioperca and the horizon North African catfish Clarias
   gariepinus. Under predicted climate conditions, a very high risk of
   invasiveness was predicted also for the translocated three-spined
   stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis,
   for the already established eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki,
   ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua, sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus and Nile
   tilapia Orechromis niloticus, and for the horizon pumpkinseed Lepomis
   gibbosus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Future research on
   the non-native species in the South Caucasus should be conducted both
   country-and region-wide and should account not only for the high
   biodiversity, but also for the critical geopolitical situation affecting
   the study area.},

Title = {Gut content metabarcoding and citizen science reveal the earthworm prey
   of the exotic terrestrial flatworm, Obama nungara},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The metabarcoding of digestive contents is a powerful approach to study
   the diet of newly introduced predatory species, and therefore to
   forecast their potential impact on native species. Obama nungara
   (Platyhelminthes: Geoplanidae) is an exotic terrestrial flatworm, which
   recently invaded several Western European countries and predates on
   earthworms. Because O. nungara is known to live above ground, we
   hypothesize that it consumes earthworms living on or coming frequently
   to the soil surface i.e. epigeic or anecic species, respectively. In
   this study, we undertook the metabarcoding of O. nungara gut contents to
   characterize more precisely the earthworm prey it consumes in its
   invaded range. This species is only known to date in anthropized, mostly
   privately-owned, environments and the contribution of citizen science
   volunteers to the reporting of species and their collection is of
   critical value. We first validated the development of the method, by
   extracting the digestive contents of O. nungara obtained through citizen
   science contributions throughout France, amplifying a 70bp earthworm
   -specific fragment of the 16S RNA gene and sequencing amplicons with a
   high-throughput approach. Secondly, the taxonomic affiliation of the
   sequences allowed identifying one to five species of earthworms in the
   digestive content of each flatworm. Contrary to our hypothesis, O.
   nungara seems also to consume endogeic species living within the soil
   and rarely coming out to the surface, as well as intermediate ecological
   categories. These results, by expanding the range of potential prey of
   O. nungara, confirm its status as a threat to native soil fauna.},

Abstract = {Forming a landscape-ecological framework is an urgent task supporting
   the adoption of a strategy for the progress of specially protected
   natural territories in Russia by 2030. According to the author, the
   strategy does not fully reflect the specifics of the development of the
   network of territorial nature protection objects in the agricultural
   regions of the country. Aim Substantiate proposals for optimizing the
   network of protected areas. Materials and Methods. Methods of
   cartographic analysis of schemes of physical and geographical zoning,
   generalisation of the results of expedition research, assessment of the
   representativeness of the existing network of protected areas and a
   comparative assessment of the most valuable landscape and natural biotic
   plots were used in the paper. Results. As a result of this study a
   complex of new and promising sites has been identified for inclusion in
   the landscape and ecological framework, which can constitute the natural
   reserve fund of the regions as clusters. The study covers steppe and
   forest-steppe landscapes of southern European and Asian Russia. The
   problem has been considered in the context of subjects relating to
   physical and geographical zoning. Proposals for the modernisation and
   expansion of the network of objects included in the landscape and
   ecological framework were compiled based on expedition studies, combined
   with quantitative and qualitative indicators of natural diversity.
   Conclusions There is a need to modernise the existing network and to
   create new nature reserves based, among other things, on as-yet
   -unrealised projects for the creation of reserves.},

Pages = {102-114},
Abstract = {Aim. To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional
   ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for
   ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network
   and the ecological stability of the region.Material and Methods. Based
   on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the
   ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the
   Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the
   protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and
   calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index
   of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh
   and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and
   corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was
   analyzed.Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and
   their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and
   11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its
   representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation
   were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection
   network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological
   framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and
   66\%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been
   proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species
   included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.Conclusions. The creation of
   new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network
   will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological
   framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make
   significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the
   impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of
   protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will
   help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity
   of the region.},

   peonies species are in danger of extinction, but their geographical
   distribution is still unclear, hindering further resource protection. In
   this work, based on comprehensive environmental data and long-term
   presence records, the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was used to predict
   the past, current and future potential distribution of two Chinese
   endemic and endangered species, Paeonia decomposita and Paeonia
   rotundiloba. The results showed that the two species were narrowly
   distributed in Western Sichuan (Aba and Ganzi), China, with the
   temperature seasonality and UV-B seasonality being the most important
   environmental variables to determine the habitat suitability of the both
   tree peonies. In addition, growing degree days and precipitation
   seasonality also had an important impact on P. decomposita and P.
   rotundiloba, respectively. The reconstitution for the past distribution
   showed that they were mainly distributed in the south foot of Hengduan
   Mountains in the last interglacial (LIG) period. The reconstitution for
   historical suitable distribution indicated that the two tree peonies
   would migrated along Hengduan Mountains and Yarlung Zangbo River into
   the southeast of Qinghai Tibet Plateau, northeast from the current
   distribution. The areas of current potential distribution of the two
   tree peonies, which were partially crossed, were 14050 km2 and 45299 km2
   respectively. Under different future climate scenarios, the potential
   distribution of the two peonies continued to expand and migrated to
   high-altitude areas in the north if the greenhouse gas concentration
   will continue to increase. This study will not only provide theoretical
   guidance for the conservation of P. decomposita and P. rotundiloba, but
   also help to understand the evolution and migration process of section
   Moutan.},

Title = {Divergent strategies of nectar secretion in two bat-pollinated
   Passiflora species},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {293},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The secretion dynamics and chemical compositions of flower nectar can
   vary according to the plant physiology and the pollinator type.
   Bat-pollinated flowers are commonly associated with nocturnal nectar
   secretion as well as large amounts of nectar per flower, which is
   generally diluted and composed mostly of hexose sugars. The nectar
   traits in bat-pollinated Passiflora species are poorly understood and in
   this work, we describe these for two such species. We conducted field
   experiments to assess the nectar secretion dynamics of two species with
   nocturnal anthesis and similar colours and structures, performed
   chemical analyses of the sugar components of nectar from these two
   species, and combined these data with systematic observations of floral
   visitors. The nectar dynamics of both Passiflora species are similar to
   those of other bat-pollinated species. In Passiflora mucronata, nectar
   secretion starts before the flower opens, which occurs around 04h00,
   with secretion ending after 10h00. Passiflora setacea starts secreting
   nectar at the time of flower opening, around 22h00, finishing secretion
   between 04h00 and 06h00. In P. setacea, the final period of anthesis is
   characterised by active nectar resorption. The different blooming times
   of these two bat-pollinated passionflowers and the significant
   differences in their nectar secretion schedules suggest a divergent
   nectar secretion dynamics: the nectar of P. mucronata is made available
   only by the end of the bats' foraging activity period, continuing
   throughout the morning, while P. setacea secretes nectar earlier, with
   very little overlap in the secretion period between the species. We
   hypothesise that this segregation in time helps avoid the negative
   effects from competition for pollinators or pollen interference between
   flowers with a similar structure, while the outstanding nectar traits
   and the constant production of flowers throughout the year make these
   closely related vines important nectar sources for their bat pollinators
   where they co-occur.},

Title = {Variability in Stem Methane Emissions and Wood Methane Production of
   Tree Different Species in a Cold Temperate Mountain Forest},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {784-799},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The role of trees, in addition to that of the soil, must be considered
   in CH4 budget for forests. Although trees can emit CH4 through their
   stems, there are uncertainties about the main factors that explain
   inter- and intraspecific variations, which impedes upscaling of
   measurements from the stem to the ecosystem level. This study aimed to
   characterize the variability in CH4 emissions (F-CH4) from stems between
   species and individuals, and within individuals. We measured F-CH4 in
   situ during the snow-free period in five species in a temperate mountain
   forest, using individuals of different sizes and chambers at different
   heights along the stems. One coniferous species emitted almost no CH4,
   whereas four broadleaved species exhibited high intraspecific
   variability in F-CH4 (0-3.7 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Increasing trends in
   F-CH4 with tree diameter were observed for four species. The vertical
   patterns in F-CH4 were complex. Seasonal variations in F-CH4, measured
   on two trees per species, were well explained by air temperature with
   apparent temperature sensitivity coefficients (Q(10)) between 1.2 and 2,
   which were not related to the antecedent precipitation indices, whether
   calculated over 7 or 30 days. Potential CH4 production was detected in
   wood core segments incubated under anoxic conditions in the majority of
   individual trees of all species. Our results suggest that the CH4
   emitted by trunks can originate either from soil or internal sources.
   Scaling F-CH4 from trees at the stand level and developing process-based
   models of F-CH4 will remain challenging until the sources of variation
   are better explained.},

Title = {Do non-native and dominant native species carry a similar risk of
   invasiveness? A case study for plants in Turkey},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {53-72},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Most risk analysis studies in invasion biology have focused on the
   invasiveness of non-native species, even though some native species also
   can pose a high risk to the environment and human well-being. This is
   especially true under current global change, which may cause dominant
   native species to expand their range of distribution and have
   substantial effects on the ecosystem. In this study, the risk of
   invasiveness of five non-native and five native plant species in Turkey
   was evaluated using a standard risk screening protocol. All ten species
   selected for screening are known to be invasive in several parts of the
   world, i.e. non-native Ailanthus altissima, Cuscuta campestris,
   Phytolacca americana, Robinia pseudoacacia and Sicyos angulatus, and
   native Cirsium arvense, Hedera helix, Onopordum acanthium, Phragmites
   australis and Sorghum halepense. The Australian Weed Risk Assessment
   decision-support tool adapted to Turkey's geographical and climatic
   conditions was used for screening the study species based on their
   biological traits, ecology and management approaches. All species were
   classified as high-risk, with R. pseudoacacia among non-natives and P.
   australis among natives achieving the highest scores followed by S.
   halepense, C. campestris, C. arvense, O. acanthium, P. americana, S.
   angulatus, A. altissima and H. helix. Based on their risk scores, all
   non-native species were classified as invasive and all native species as
   `expanding' for Turkey. An ordination based on the risk scores showed
   similarities between invasive and expanding species. The outcomes of
   this study indicate that species can have several risk-related traits
   resulting in high risk scores irrespective of their origin. Such species
   can modify their environment and interact with other species with severe
   consequences for biodiversity. It is argued that dominant species with
   highly negative environ-mental and socioeconomic impacts in their
   habitats should be included in priority lists for management measures
   irrespective of their origin (i.e. native or non-native). More studies
   are needed to evaluate the magnitude and prevalence of the present
   findings for other regions worldwide.},

Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {57-77},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Scientific research has become increasingly collaborative. We
   systematically reviewed invasion science literature published between
   1980 and 2020 and catalogued in Clarivate Analytics Web of Science to
   examine patterns of authorship and the relationship between
   co-authorship and annual citation rates. This study analysed 27,234
   publications across 1,218 journals and demonstrated that, as the number
   of publi-cations in invasion science has exponentially increased, the
   number of authors publishing per year and the average number of authors
   per paper have also increased. The rising number of authors per paper
   coincides with a marked decline of single-authored publications;
   approximately 92\% of publications in this dataset were multi-authored,
   with single-authored papers comprising less than 4\% of all papers
   published in 2020. The increase in multi-authored papers is likely
   driven by multiple factors, including the widespread perception that
   collaboration increases scientific quality. The number of authors is
   positively correlated with perceived research impact; papers with two or
   more authors produce research that is more frequently cited compared to
   single-authored papers, and papers with five or more authors have annual
   citation rates almost double that of single-authored papers. The
   complexity, context-dependence and urgency of biological invasions
   contributed to the rise of the highly collaborative field of modern

Title = {Two distinct ecological behaviours within anecic earthworm species in
   temperate climates},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Earthworm species in temperate climates have usually been classified
   into three main ecological categories according to their
   morpho-anatomical, physiological , ecological traits: epigeic, endogeic
   and anecic. How-ever, since these ecological categories were first
   defined, many studies on the ecological traits of widespread anecic
   species: Lumbricus centralis (Bouche `, 1972), Lumbricus terrestris
   (Linnaeus, 1758), Aporrectodea longa longa (Ude, 1885) and Aporrectodea
   giardi (Ribaucourt, 1901) have revealed two distinct feeding behaviours,
   as well as differences in their growth rates and burrowing behaviour. In
   this review we highlight that within anecic earthworms, Lumbricus anecic
   species (here after ``LAS{''}) mainly consume fresh plant-derived
   materials on the soil surface modifying the quantity and spatial
   organisation of said materials. In contrast, Aporrectodea anecic species
   (here after ``AAS{''}) consume mainly aged plant-derived materials
   already incorporated into the soil and only a small proportion of
   surface-available plant-derived materials. Furthermore, the AAS have a
   denser and more complex burrow network than LAS. This suggests that AAS
   burrow into the soil to search for soil organic matter incorporated in
   the soil whereas the LAS essentially focus on burying the surface litter
   into their burrow. Consequently, LAS seem to benefit from easily
   assimilated substrates, grow faster and reach maturity in a shorter time
   span than AAS species. This distinction between anecic Lumbricus and
   Aporrectodea earthworms is expected to have different consequences for
   soil trophic network and soil functioning such as carbon and nutrient
   cyclings, water regulation and soil structure maintenance.},

Abstract = {In western North America, nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   frequently threaten native salmonids via competition and hybridization,
   so fisheries managers often implement eradication programs for
   conservation purposes. In conjunction with such programs, managers often
   construct population models to evaluate the effects of different
   management strategies designed to control the undesirable population,
   but such models require demographic data (e.g., age, growth, sex ratios,
   and survival), which are lacking for western brook trout populations.
   Brook trout were sampled from 12 alpine lakes and two streams in Idaho,
   with total length varying from 80 to 380 mm and age varying from 1 to 11
   yrs. Across all waters, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L8 varied
   from 231 to 490 mm (mean = 345 mm) and K varied from 0.15 to 0.76 (mean
   = 0.37). Survival estimates, constructed from age-length keys, were
   corrected for streams with mark-recapture data; for alpine lakes,
   corrections were made via gill net selectivity data. Survival varied
   from 0.30 to 0.56 (mean = 0.45), and except for one waterbody, estimates
   were minimally affected by correcting for capture efficiency. The
   proportion of the population that was male varied from 0.34 to 0.75
   (mean = 0.53). Our results indicate that brook trout population vital
   rates in Idaho were similar to those observed in their native range, and
   were surprisingly similar between alpine lake and stream environments.},

Title = {Anatomical and histochemical characterization of glands associated with
   the leaf teeth in Rhaphiolepis loquata BBLiu \& J.Wen (Rosaceae Juss.)},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {293},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Several representatives of Rosaceae are characterized by presenting leaf
   teeth. These projections on the leaf margins may be associated with
   different secretory structures such as extrafloral nectaries, hydathodes
   or col-leters. Colleters are the secretory structures far less kwon in
   Rosaceae. Although colleters were previously mentioned in species from
   subfamily Amygdaloideae, authors fail to provide a detailed
   morphoanatomical description and the chemical nature of the secretion
   for those colleters. Therefore, we aimed to morphoana-tomically describe
   the leaf teeth of Rhaphiolepis loquata, confirming the nature of the
   gland associated with the teeth and shedding light on the chemical
   composition of the gland exudates. For that, samples from the leaf
   margins at different stages of development were collected and fixed
   according to standard techniques for both light and scanning electron
   microscopy. The leaf teeth in R. loquata presented a colleter at its
   apex. Colleters were rounded with covered by single-or doubled-layered
   secretory palisade covered with thick cuticle and the central axis was
   made up of parenchyma cells. The presence of polysaccharides, pectins
   and proteins was confirmed in the exudates and phenolic compounds
   accumulated as the gland aged and ceased the exudate production. An
   abscission zone at the base of the colleter was observed what could
   cause the falling off of older, non-secreting colleters. This is the
   first study on the chemical composition of colleter exudates as
   interpreted through histo-chemical tests, being a novelty not only for
   R. loquata but for the Rosaceae family.},

Abstract = {Aim. Study of the effect of short di-and tetrapeptides (AB-0, AE-0) on
   the growth, development and productivity of Batya soybean varieties.
   Material and Methods. Biologically active dipeptide AB-0 and
   tetrapeptide AE-0 were used. Field studies were carried out on
   meadow-brown podzolized gley heavy loamy soil. One month before
   planting, soybean seeds were treated with dipeptide/tetrapeptide of
   concentrations of 0.01 g/l or 0.001 g/l. Hand-tended and
   industrial-level research was carried out. Results. The use of dipeptide
   AB-0 in a hand-tended study had a positive effect on the growth
   processes of soybeans of the Batya variety compared to the control. The
   use of tetrapeptide AE-0 in a hand-tended study increased the weight of
   plants by 7.3-67.0 g and plant height by 3.0-9.0 cm compared to the
   control. The use of dipeptide AB-0 and tetrapeptide AE-0 increased the
   yield of soybeans by a maximum of 81.2-83.7\% compared to the control.
   The use of peptides AB-0 and AE-0 in an industrial-level experiment
   increased the yield by 30.5\% and 18.4\%, respectively, compared with
   the control. Conclusion. The short peptides AB-0 and AE-0 studied had an
   impact on the growth, development and productivity of Batya soybean
   varieties. They can be classified as plant growth regulators.},

Title = {Combining telemetry and fisheries data to quantify species overlap and
   evaluate bycatch mitigation strategies in an emergent Canadian Arctic
   fishery},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {702},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides are bottom-dwelling
   flatfish that support commercial and community fisheries in Baffin Bay,
   Canada. Recently, exploratory inshore summer fisheries have raised
   concerns surrounding the bycatch of Greenland sharks Somniosus
   microcephalus and Arctic skate Amblyraja hyperborea, which are
   susceptible to overfishing due to their conservative life history
   traits. To explore fisheries selectivity and opportunities for bycatch
   mitigation, we combined pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and
   fisheries data to assess habitat overlap and catch trends across these 3
   species. PSAT data showed variable inter-specific overlap, with
   Greenland sharks primarily inhabiting depths <1000 m (725 +/- 193 m),
   Greenland halibut inhabiting a narrower depth range (1030 +/- 113 m),
   and Arctic skates overlapping depths (950 +/- 225 m) of both species.
   However, fisheries data suggested high inter-specific overlap at deepest
   depths, with peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of all species at depths
   800-1000 m. A marked decline in Greenland shark CPUE was observed
   throughout the fishing season which was best explained by cumulative
   fishing pressure. Combined tagging and fisheries data suggest that
   targeting specific seasonal habitat will not decrease bycatch, and
   inshore summer longline fisheries should be evaluated in the context of
   potentially high elasmobranch mortality, with enforced bycatch handling
   practices and alternative mitigation measures (e.g. gear modification or
   reduced soak times) required.},

Title = {Chronically stressed benthic macroinvertebrate communities exhibit
   limited effects on ecosystem function in a microtidal estuary},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Anthropogenically driven alterations to coastal sediments and their
   benthic macroinvertebrate communities impair ecosystem function.
   However, this paradigm is yet to be tested in ecosystems that typically
   harbour underdeveloped communities lacking larger bioturbating species.
   Here, we investigated the effects of sediment condition and
   macroinvertebrate communities on benthic metabolism, nutrient exchange
   and denitrification (N2 production), and assessed the relative
   importance of taxon richness, abundance, biomass and community
   bioturbation potential in influencing these processes in 2 regions of
   the highly modified, microtidal Peel-Harvey Estuary in temperate Western
   Australia. Sediment condition influenced benthic metabolism more than
   the macroinvertebrate community, whereas the reverse was true for
   nutrient exchange. Denitrification was driven by sediment condition and
   the community in the upper and lower estuary, respectively, highlighting
   the change in controls of this nitrogen-removal process within
   estuaries. Overall, benthic macroinvertebrates had little to no effect
   on many ecosystem processes, exhibiting the limited functional role
   played by these chronically stressed biota in this estuary. There was
   also no interaction between sediment condition and the community,
   suggesting a functional decoupling between these 2 ecosystem components.
   Where significant macroinvertebrate effects were detected, community
   biomass was the most frequently selected predictor, demonstrating its
   fundamental role in ecosystem function. This study reveals pressing
   implications of what might be expected when benthic environments become
   particularly degraded and the highly limited potential of the resultant
   benthic macroinvertebrate communities to provide key ecosystem services
   such as nutrient processing.},

Abstract = {Pigeon guillemots Cepphus columba are ubiquitous along the coasts of the
   eastern North Pacific, yet little is known about their winter migration
   patterns, habitat needs, and potential threats faced during the
   non-breeding period. We used 3 seasons of year-long light level data
   from tagged individuals to estimate the migration timing and winter
   residency of pigeon guillemots breeding on Southeast Farallon Island in
   California (USA). Light level data were combined with a movement model
   to estimate positions of tagged animals, revealing that individuals from
   this population undertook a coordinated coastal migration north in the
   fall, stopping at sites near Haida Gwaii in British Columbia (Canada),
   presumably during a flightless prebasic molt, before continuing north to
   stationary overwintering sites in coastal British Columbia and Southeast
   Alaska. Birds then made an uninterrupted migration south in the spring,
   returning to waters around Southeast Farallon in late March and early
   April. Wet/dry data indicated nocturnal resting on land during the
   breeding season and likely on the water throughout the non-breeding
   months. This is the first study to confirm the migratory patterns of
   pigeon guillemots from California, and highlights the importance of the
   waters of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska for the studied
   population and possibly other major populations of this species.},

Title = {Impact of whale-watching vessels on humpback whale calling behavior on
   an Icelandic foraging ground during the Covid-19 pandemic},

Abstract = {Whale-watching vessels contribute to elevated ambient sound levels in
   marine habitats. The reduction in maritime tourism activities during the
   Covid-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the
   acoustic response of marine mammals to noise associated with
   whale-watching activities. In this study, we used acoustic recordings,
   visual observations, and Automatic Identification System data to
   determine the changes in humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae calling
   behavior associated with whale-watching vessels on a foraging ground in
   Skjalfandi Bay, Iceland. We compared pre-pandemic summer months (2018)
   with pandemic (2020) conditions to quantify reductions in vessel
   activity and determine changes in calling behavior. Broadband ambient
   sound pressure levels were low in both years (median similar to 90
   dB(RMS (25-1300 Hz)) re mu Pa). During the Covid-19 pandemic (2020), the
   number of whale-watching trips was reduced by 68.6\%. The number of
   humpback whale call detections increased nearly 2-fold. Ambient sound
   pressure levels stayed the same. We found that humpback whales reduce
   their calling effort in the presence of vessel sound independent of the
   overall ambient sound. As whale-watching vessel traffic rebounds and
   continues to grow, demonstrating behavioral responses should inform
   management plans such as vessel codes of conduct and marine spatial
   planning.},

Title = {Demographics and dynamics of the world's largest known population of
   oceanic manta rays Mobula birostris in coastal Ecuador},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {700},
Pages = {145-159},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Information on the life history and demographics of oceanic manta rays
   Mobula birostris remains scarce. Using photo-ID data, we describe the
   demographic structure, population size, and possible environmental
   drivers of the seasonal occurrence of M. birostris at Isla de la Plata
   and Bajo Cope, Ecuador. We identified a total of 2803 individuals from
   3322 encounters over a period of 14 yr (2005-2018). The population
   sampled at these sites was significantly biased towards males (sex ratio
   1F:1.67M) and only 12.9\% of individuals were resighted. We used
   mark-resight models to estimate demographic parameters of the
   population, including superpopulation size, survival probability,
   entry/recruitment probability, and detection probability. We also
   evaluated how these parameters were related to environmental predictors,
   such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), sea surface temperature
   (SST), and chlorophyll a (chl a). Mark-resight analyses indicated that
   SST, chl a, time, and sex, but not ENSO, were important predictors of
   estimated population parameters. Entry probability peaked in 2012, which
   coincided with the lowest SST and highest chl a concentrations. The
   best-fit mark-resight model estimated a superpopulation size of 22316
   individuals, with annual estimated abundances of 949-7650 females and
   5226-9340 males. Localised sampling of this highly mobile species limits
   the interpretations of mark-resight analyses, but provides lower bounds
   for total abundance that indicate the population of M. birostris in
   coastal Ecuador and Peru is likely the largest in the world.},

Title = {A multi-tiered assessment of fish community responses to habitat
   restoration in a coastal lagoon},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Essential fish habitat is critical for foraging, breeding, or as
   refugia. As such, restoration of these habitats has the potential to
   increase the diversity and abundance of fishes. Here, we explored how
   fish communities responded in the first 12-24 mo following oyster reef
   restoration. Study sites included 8 restored reefs plus 4 live and 4
   dead reefs as controls. Oyster reef metrics (e.g. density, height,
   thickness) and fish abundance and diversity metrics were quantified,
   including species richness, Shannon diversity, Simpson's diversity, and
   Pielou's evenness. Species composition was explored further to identify
   indicator species and assess habitat preferences. Patterns of fish
   community diversity and species composition were compared to oyster reef
   metrics to discern what oyster reef characteristics best predict fish
   diversity. Results showed that intertidal oyster reefs were structurally
   restored and shifted from resembling negative control reefs to positive
   control reefs within 12-24 mo. Across all treatment types, oyster shell
   height and reef thickness were the best predictors of fish diversity.
   However, at the fish community level, assemblages at restored reefs were
   similar to those at positive and negative controls. Species-level
   analyses suggest treatment types have unique indicator species,
   including Chilomycterus schoepfi (striped burrfish) for dead reefs,
   Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper) for restored reefs, and Gobiosoma
   robustum (code goby) for live reefs. This work suggests fishes can be
   used as higher trophic level indicators of restoration success, and
   ecosystem-based approaches, such as habitat restoration, can restore
   essential fish habitat, thus benefiting fish communities while moving
   coastal ecosystems toward sustainability.},

Title = {Biophysical modelling of larval dispersal and population connectivity of
   a stalked barnacle: implications for fishery governance},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {694},
Pages = {105-123},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Numerical biophysical models are a standard methodology used to provide
   estimates of larval dispersal and population connectivity for marine
   species with a bi-phasic life cycle. However, confidence on biophysical
   models, tested by confronting model estimates with empirical evidence,
   is seldomly assessed. We compared time-series estimates of larval supply
   of the stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes to rocky shores in 3
   regions around the Iberian Peninsula (Asturias, Galicia, SW Portugal)
   with recruitment observations made at monthly intervals for 2 yr. Supply
   estimates were made with the Regional Ocean Modelling system using
   several larval behaviour scenarios, while the number of recruits on the
   stalks of adult barnacles was used as a measure of recruitment
   intensity. Cross-correlation analysis showed that passive,
   surface-dwelling and ontogenetically migrating larval scenarios
   generally produced significant positive correlations at time lags of 0
   to + 2 mo at the regional level but not at sub-regional or site levels.
   None of the scenarios produced a substantially better fit than the
   others, and all 3 produced estimates of average realized dispersal (-73
   to + 63 km in the S/W and N/E directions) and larval retention (2.0 to
   2.4\%) that were numerically very similar. These estimates indicate high
   levels of connectivity, either during larval life or via steppingstone
   processes, within and between the 3 regions. Based on these estimates,
   we advocate that the management of the P. pollicipes fishery requires an
   interactive, polycentric governance system at transregional, regional
   and local scales, which will give the resource a higher possibility of
   persistence by diversifying the fishery's management portfolio.},

Title = {Can user reviews on online shopping websites contribute to user-involved
   green product innovation: a case study of household refrigerators},

Abstract = {User reviews (URs) have been regarded as a novel way of promoting
   user-involved green product innovation (GPI) in theory. However, the
   actual relationships between URs and GPI are still underexamined. This
   study adopted the method of content analysis to exemplify the
   effectiveness of user reviews on online shopping websites (OSURs) in
   user-involved GPI. Specifically, 62,909 effective OSURs on 24 green
   household refrigerators and 43 conventional refrigerators were collected
   and analyzed. The results show that 8.41\% of all the pre-processed
   OSURs contain green information, which cannot be a dominant information
   source for promoting GPI. Yet, the identified green reviews (GRs) are
   still valuable for developing and diffusing GPI. On the one hand, three
   green topics related to energy efficiency, environmental friendliness,
   green materials and technologies are intensively generated, massive user
   experiences can objectively reflect the actual environmental performance
   of existing products. On the other hand, GRs account for 12.62\% and
   6.19\% of all the OSURs on green refrigerators and conventional
   refrigerators, respectively. Users prefer to generate positive rather
   than negative GRs on green refrigerators. The implementation of GPI has
   a positive impact on OSURs in return. Firms can actively collect and
   analyze OSURs of extant green products, thus promoting the green
   innovation of their own products. This study adds to the literature of
   user-involved GPI by exploring the actual relationships between OSURs
   and GPI. A practical analysis framework and valuable implications are
   also proposed to advance GPI, green growth at firm level and sustainable
   development at social level.},

Title = {Changes in Nesting Habitat Availability for Piping Plovers at the John

Abstract = {Habitat loss is a major threat to the conservation of endangered
   species. We measured changes in piping plover (Charadrius melodus)
   nesting habitat at five alkali wetlands in The Nature Conservancy's John
   E. Williams Preserve, McLean county, North Dakota, from 1992 to 2021.
   This site has supported nesting by federally threatened piping plovers
   for decades. We measured the amount of non-vegetated (open) shoreline,
   required nesting habitat for plovers, from photo plots at 34 sites
   historically occupied by plovers distributed across the five wetlands.
   Twenty-six of 34 plots had significant negative trends (95\% credible
   intervals not including zero) in nesting area availability. Nesting
   habitat increased significantly at one plot. Seven other plots had no
   detectable trends (i.e., the 95\% credible intervals included zero).
   Mean percent annual change was similar to 1.2\% (60.17 SE) and estimated
   total loss of nesting habitat within plots was similar to 42\%. To
   assess whether plover nesting habitat might have been created at areas
   outside of our plots, we compared total open shoreline habitat over all
   five wetlands in 1992 to that in 2017. We detected a similar to 42\%
   decline in total open shoreline area. Although measurement methods
   differed between 1992 and 2017, we found no evidence that nesting
   habitat was created at non-photo plot areas. In the absence of habitat
   restoration and management the decline in piping plover nesting habitat
   is likely to continue. Climate change projections for North Dakota
   indicate increased annual rainfall, higher CO2 levels, and longer
   growing seasons, all factors likely to promote vegetative growth at
   alkali wetlands like those we studied.},

Title = {Expanding the invasion toolbox: including stable isotope analysis in
   risk assessment},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {191-210},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Species introductions are a major concern for ecosystem functioning,
   socio-economic wealth, and human well-being. Preventing introductions
   proved to be the most effective management strategy, and various tools
   such as species distribution models and risk assessment protocols have
   been developed or applied to this purpose. These approaches use
   information on a species to predict its potential invasiveness and
   impact in the case of its introduction into a new area. At the same
   time, much biodiversity has been lost due to multiple drivers. Ways to
   determine the potential for successful reintroductions of once native
   but now extinct species as well as assisted migrations are yet missing.
   Stable isotope analyses are commonly used to reconstruct a species'
   feeding ecology and trophic interactions within communities. Recently,
   this method has been used to predict potentially arising trophic
   interactions in the absence of the target spe-cies. Here we propose the
   implementation of stable isotope analysis as an approach for assessment
   schemes to increase the accuracy in predicting invader impacts as well
   as the success of reintroductions and assisted migrations. We review and
   discuss possibilities and limitations of this methods usage, suggesting
   promis-ing and useful applications for scientists and managers.},

Title = {Timing mussel deployments to improve reintroduction success and
   restoration efficiency},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {698},
Pages = {69-83},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The loss of newly translocated species directly contributes to low rates
   of reintroduction success in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In
   this study, experimental reintroductions of green-lipped mussels Perna
   canaliculus into a shallow coastal habitat were conducted across 5
   week-long experimental translocations within a 10 mo period (April
   2021-January 2022) to relate temporal variations in predator abundance,
   predator size, and environmental parameters (water temperature,
   rainfall, days before/after full moon, turbidity, wind speed, wind
   direction) to variations in mussel survival. Predator counts from
   timelapse camera images gathered over the first 4 d after each
   deployment were used as a proxy for potential predator pressure.
   Timelapse images (n = 8561) allowed for a census of 2371 individuals
   from 10 different mobile species, 5 of which were known bivalve
   predators (Australasian snapper, New Zealand eagle ray, rig shark,
   octopus, and an unidentifiable ray species), with Australasian snapper
   contributing to 98\% of overall species counts. At the end of the study,
   mean mussel survival ranged from 0 +/- 0 SE\% to 56 +/- 8 SE\% and was
   best predicted by changes in turbidity and the total number of predators
   among deployments (R2 = 0.445). Patterns in predator abundance were best
   explained by time of year and did not share strong correlations among
   environmental parameters (rho = 0.015). These results suggest that
   planning deployments of mussels for cooler times of the year when water
   clarity is high and predator abundance is low may substantially increase
   immediate survivorship of translocated mussels and improve
   reintroduction success.},

Title = {From pattern to process: Towards mechanistic design principles for pest
   suppressive landscapes},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {157-171},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The challenge to reconcile agricultural production with the conservation
   of biodiversity and associated ecosystems services has triggered
   interest in the design of pest suppressive landscapes. However, the
   uniqueness of species -spe-cific responses to management and landscape
   context hamper our ability to make generalizations for landscape design,
   and we often lack quantitative indicators to make inferences about the
   pest suppressive potential of landscape designs. Here I examine the
   literature to underpin design principles based on source-sink theory.
   The potential of landscapes to support herbivore populations is
   associated with the area of source habitat, source strength, and the
   ability of herbivores to detect host plants. The potential of natural
   enemies to suppress herbivore populations is asso-ciated with their
   potential for numerical response, time to colonization and natural enemy
   diversity. Insecticide appli-cations and other intensive management
   practices can turn treated fields into sinks. The analysis reveals that
   landscape features or management practices influence multiple processes
   at the same time, and that well-documented landscape features associated
   with high pest suppression potential generally discourage herbivores
   and/or favour natu-ral enemies. The evaluation of landscapes in terms of
   source habitats for specific herbivores and their natural enemies may
   reveal context-specific information that allow a better quantitative
   understanding of pest suppression potential of landscapes.(c) 2022 The

Title = {Comparative petiole histology using microscopic imaging visualization
   among Amaranthaceous taxa},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {297},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper described the microstructural features of the histological
   vasculature of family Amaranthaceae. The petiole anatomy of 14
   Amaranthaceous species categorized into nine genera, including
   Amaranthus and Cheno-podium (3 species each), Alternanthera (2 species),
   and Aerva, Achyranthes, Atriplex, Bassia, Digera, and Gomphrena (one
   species each). Amaranthaceous species were collected from different
   localities of the Thal desert were examined using a microscopic imaging
   technique. Petiole transverse segments were cut with a Shandon Microtome
   to prepare slides. The distinguishing features of taxonomic significance
   include petiole outline, vascular bundle shape, variation in the number
   of vascular bundles, petiole length and width, trichomes, layers of
   collenchyma, and the shape of parenchyma. Petiole shapes were observed
   as cordate, slender, spherical, and ovoid. Quantitative measurements
   were taken to analyze the data statistically through SPSS software.
   Amar-anthus retroflexus had a petiole of a maximum length of 760 mu m
   and a minimum in Amaranthus viridis 170 mu m. The highest number of
   vascular bundles, 11 were observed in Alternanthera sessilis. The
   polygonal-shaped paren-chyma and the annular type of collenchymatous
   cells were prominent. A maximum of 18 collenchyma layers were present in
   Achyranthes aspera and a minimum of 9 layers in Amaranthus graecizans.
   Trichomes were examined in six species with bulged pointed ends, and
   broad glandular bases. Epidermis cells also show great variation, with
   an irregular shape being dominant. Statistic UPGMA dendrogram and PCA
   clustering of petiole traits show that histological sections can be
   utilized to botanical identify Amaranthaceous species and play an
   important role in future taxonomic and phylogenic relationships.},

Title = {Similar structural complexity of phenols in plant morphotypes with
   contrasting soluble phenol concentration and richness in arid rangelands
   of Patagonia},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Phenols can play a significant role in plant tolerance of drought and
   herbivory. We assessed the concentration, richness and structural
   complexity of soluble phenols (hereafter phenols) in leaves of different
   species representing different plant morphotypes of arid ecosystems. We
   selected seven species representative of the three main plant
   morphotypes of the Patagonia Monte (Argentina): tall evergreen shrubs
   (TES), medium evergreen shrubs (MES), and perennial grasses (PG). These
   morphotypes differed in plant height, rooting depth, proportion of
   photosynthetic tissues, specific leaf area, and concentration of phenols
   and N in leaves. We found 48 compounds belonging to six types of phenols
   differing in structural complexity (low complexity: simple phenols,
   phenolic acids and phenolic esters; medium complexity: hydroxycinnamic
   acids and phenylpropenes; and high complexity: quinones, flavonols and
   flavones). Phenols of low and medium complexity were the most abundant
   in all morphotypes, while those of high complexity, probably the most
   costly for plants, were nearly exclusive of some tall evergreen shrubs.
   In general, PG, MES and TES had low, intermediate and high phenol
   concentration (8.5, 27.2, 202.5 mg g(-1) DW, respectively) and richness
   (15, 25, 37 compounds, respectively) in leaves. The richness of phenols
   was significantly and positively related to phenol concentration.
   However, we did not find distinctive phenol compound patterns among
   morphotypes. Our results suggest that drought and, to some extent,
   herbivory have exerted selective selection pressure on richness and
   phenol concentration in leaves of contrasting morphotypes but the type
   of phenols accumulated probably depends on intrinsic species attributes
   within each morphotype.},

Abstract = {The Buffalo National River is a scenic and ecologically significant
   resource located in the Ozark Plateau of Arkansas, USA. As a
   free-flowing and protected river, the Buffalo offers natural benefits to
   humanity (e.g., food production, carbon storage, recreation), known as
   ecosystem services. Using both market and survey data, we performed the
   first comprehensive valuation of the ecosystem services that the Buffalo
   National River provides to Arkansas residents. The total ecosystem
   services benefits in 2018 USD were valued at \$20.5 million per year
   (\$550/ha). Most of the value was concentrated in cultural services
   (i.e., recreation, aesthetics, cognitive development), which were
   responsible for over 70\% of total value at \$384/ha. Air quality
   regulation and the provisioning of water also made important
   contributions to the total, with values of \$103/ha and \$36/ha,
   respectively. Our study highlights the considerable economic value
   provided by the Buffalo National River in its current state. Recent
   economic activity, in particular intensive agriculture, has threatened
   these services and in the process created conflicts between different
   industries. These values are important to consider when making
   management and policy decisions that affect the region.},

Title = {Development and application of a multilingual electronic

Abstract = {Electronic decision-support tools are becoming an essential component of
   government strategies to tackle non-native species invasions. This study
   describes the development and application of a multilingual electronic
   decision-support tool for screening terrestrial animals under current
   and future climate conditions: the Terrestrial Animal Species
   Invasiveness Screening Kit (TAS-ISK). As an adaptation of the widely
   employed Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), the
   TAS-ISK question template inherits from the original Weed Risk
   Assessment (WRA) and related WRA-type toolkits and complies with the
   `minimum requirements' for use with the recent European Regulation on
   invasive alien species of concern. The TAS-ISK consists of 49 basic
   questions on the species' biogeographical/historical traits and its
   biological/ecological interactions, and of 6 additional questions to
   predict how climate change is likely to influence the risks of
   introduction, establishment, dispersal and impact of the screened
   species. Following a description of the main features of this
   decision-support tool as a turnkey software application and of its
   graphical user interface with support for 32 languages, sample
   screenings are provided in different risk assessment areas for one
   representative species of each of the main taxonomic groups of
   terrestrial animals supported by the toolkit: mammals, birds, reptiles,
   amphibians, annelids, insects, molluscs, nematodes, and platyhelminths.
   The highest-scoring species were the red earthworm Lumbricus rubellus
   for the Aegean region of Turkey and the New Zealand flatworm
   Arthurdendyus triangulatus for Croatia. It is anticipated that adoption
   of this toolkit will mirror that of the worldwide employed AS-ISK, hence
   allowing to share information and inform decisions for the prevention of
   entry and/or dispersal of (high-risk) non-native terrestrial animal
   species - a crucial step to implement early-stage control and
   eradication measures as part of rapid-response strategies to counteract
   biological invasions.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the impacts of off-farm work on the technical
   efficiency (TE) of wheat production, using data collected from 549
   farming households in China. Unlike previous studies that only capture
   one dimension of off-farm work, in this study, we consider multiple
   dimensions, including off-farm work participation status of household
   heads, location choices (local or migrated off-farm work), and off-farm
   work intensity. We employ the stochastic frontier production model to
   estimate the TE of wheat production and a two-stage residual inclusion
   (2SRI) approach to address the endogeneity of the off-farm work
   variables. We find that: (1) household heads' off-farm work
   participation significantly increases TE of wheat production; (2) local
   (rather than migrated) off-farm work participation significantly
   increases TE; (3) off-farm work intensity significantly increases TE
   when household heads work off the farm for more than 9 months.
   Additional analysis reveals that off-farm work participation of
   household heads, rather than other members, plays a significant role in
   improving the TE of wheat production.},

Abstract = {Thermal comfort in outdoor spaces is of vital importance to human health
   and well-being, and affects the livability of cities. In a humid-hot
   region with elevated temperatures, it is difficult to improve the
   thermal experience of urban residents by changing objective conditions
   such as the microclimate. This study created a set of experience indices
   in different dimensions including visual, auditory, and olfactory
   perceptions and psychological cognitions, to explore the influencing
   factors and mechanisms of visitor's thermal comfort in an urban park. We
   found that visual, auditory, and olfactory experience indices and
   psychological cognition indices were both strongly correlated with
   thermal comfort (Pearson correlation coefficients were above 0.3). By
   analyzing a survey data with a structural equation model, we found that
   Visual, auditory, and olfactory experiences have a complete, mediating
   effect on thermal comfort. Explicitly, visual, auditory, and olfactory
   perceptions affect thermal comfort through two mediating variables:
   thermal sensation and psychological cognitions. In turn, thermal
   sensation and psychological cognitions have a direct effect on visitor's
   thermal comfort. Psychological cognitions has the largest direct effect
   on thermal comfort. Quantitatively, a 1-unit increase in psychological
   cognitions produces an increase of 0.601 units in thermal comfort. A
   potential approach is to improve multisensory modalities that affect
   necessary sensory perception and psychological cognitions of visitors.
   The findings of this study provide a valuable reference for the planning
   and design of recreational spaces in humid-hot regions and for the
   studies of outdoor thermal comfort.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is an irreversible and dynamic process which affects the
   availability and quality of ecosystem services (ESs). The link between
   balanced urban growth and ESs is critical for sustainable urban
   development. The study followed pluralist approach for evaluating and
   comparing the land-cover-based economic assessment of sustainable,
   moderately sustainable, and unsustainable cities. The artificial
   intelligence-based future land cover changes were evaluated using
   geographic future land use simulation software with geographic
   information system. A case-specific modification of value coefficients
   for computing ecosystem service value (ESV) was applied on case cities.
   A workable scale was developed by exploring relation of ESs and built-up
   of three extreme cases. The scale has different combinations of ESs and
   built-up from worst to best scenario with related ESV changes for
   optimal utilization of land. The scale helped to assess the spatial
   resource and natural capital balance of any area. The results showed
   that the ideal ratio of ESs and built-up density range for balanced
   sustainable development is between 1.35 and 3.64 with ESVs between INR
   10.00 million/hectare and INR 8.45 million/hectare, respectively. On
   applying the scale, the results showed that only 25\% of the city
   peripheral area comes under ideal range. The study will help urban
   planners in conservation of ESs with economic development for promoting
   sustainable urban development.},

Title = {Frost-Associated Defoliation in Populus tremuloides Causes Repeated
   Growth Reductions Over 185 years},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing a shift to earlier spring budburst in
   deciduous temperate trees, which may predispose them to greater risk of
   damage from growing season frosts. Populus tremuloides may be
   particularly vulnerable to growing season frosts, which can defoliate
   entire canopies and damage woody tissue. These growing season frost
   events may shift in frequency under continued climate change and alter a
   disturbance regime that disproportionately impacts deciduous,
   cold-sensitive vegetation. We used Populus tremuloides tree cores from
   14 sites across the montane and subalpine forests of Utah, USA, to
   identify characteristic tree rings, namely `white rings', associated
   with growing season frost damage over the period 1767-2016. Early
   growing season frost was estimated using a frost intensity index using
   local data sourced from 22 long-term weather stations and was correlated
   with white ring occurrence. Over the last 150 years, the frequency of
   white rings was between 5 and 6\% of all years. Growing season frost
   occurrence was similar in northern and southern Utah and highly
   synchronous across stands indicating widespread defoliation. Populus
   tremuloides radial growth declined nearly 40\% during years of
   frost-associated defoliation. Our results highlight a severe disturbance
   that disproportionately impacts Populus tremuloides. Our methods are
   broadly applicable in identifying historical frost-induced defoliation
   in deciduous trees and emphasize the potential for discrete weather
   events to impact tree health},

Title = {Eyes on the aliens: citizen science contributes to research, policy and
   management of biological invasions in Europe},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are a key driver of global biodiversity
   loss. Reducing their spread and impact is a target of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDG target 15.8) and of the EU IAS Regulation
   1143/2014. The use of citizen science offers various benefits to alien
   species' decision-making and to so-ciety, since public participation in
   research and management boosts awareness, engagement and scientific
   literacy and can reduce conflict in IAS management. We report the
   results of a survey on alien species citizen science initiatives within
   the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology
   (COST) Action Alien-CSI. We gathered metadata on 103 initiatives across
   41 countries, excluding gen-eral biodiversity reporting portals,
   spanning from 2005 to 2020, offering the most comprehensive account of
   alien species citizen science initiatives on the continent to date. We
   retrieved information on project scope, policy relevance, engagement
   methods, data capture, data quality and data management, methods and
   technologies applied and performance indicators such as the number of
   records coming from projects, the numbers of participants and
   publications. The 103 initiatives were unevenly distributed
   geographical-ly, with countries with a tradition of citizen science
   showing more active projects. The majority of projects were contributory
   and were run at a national scale, targeting the general public, alien
   plants and insects, and terrestrial ecosystems. These factors of project
   scope were consistent between geographic regions. Most projects focused
   on collecting species presence or abundance data, aiming to map presence
   and spread. As 75\% of the initiatives specifically collected data on
   IAS of Union Concern, citizen science in Europe is of policy relevance.
   Despite this, only half of the projects indicated sustainable funding.
   Nearly all projects had validation in place to verify species
   identifications. Strikingly, only about one third of the projects shared
   their data with open data repositories such as the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility or the European Alien Species Information Network.
   Moreover, many did not adhere to the principles of FAIR data management.
   Finally, certain factors of engagement, feedback and support, had
   significant impacts on project performance, with the provision of a map
   with sightings being especially beneficial. Based on this dataset, we
   offer suggestions to strengthen the network of IAS citizen science
   projects and to foster knowledge exchange among citizens, scientists,
   managers, policy-makers, local authorities, and other stakeholders.},

Title = {Biominerals in the Cacteae tribe: Chemical-morphological
   characterization, distribution and systematic perspectives},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Biominerals precipitate by biological activity and are found in various
   organisms. In the Cactaceae family, biominerals have been described for
   numerous genera and species and their contribution to systematics has
   recently been demonstrated. The aims of this study are to characterize
   the biominerals in the stem of members of Cacteae by describing their
   shape, position and mineral composition. Twenty-eight genera and 149
   species of Cacteae were studied by bright-field and polarized
   microscopy. The composition of biominerals was analyzed by scanning
   electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in 34
   species representing the Cacteae clades. The biominerals of seven genera
   out of 28 are described for the first time. Only six species of
   Mammillaria have extracellular biominerals. Sixteen genera and 91
   species possess intracellular biominerals in hypodermis, where species
   of Echinocactus and Ferocactus showed silica bodies. Spherulites, prisms
   and druses are present in 28 genera, and are distributed in the cortex
   of 141 species and in the pith of 94 species. Statistical analysis
   revealed differences between genera for the maximum length of
   biominerals in the hypodermis and cortex. Notably, Kadenicarpus
   possesses the smallest biominerals in the cortex and pith (< 35 mu m in
   mean) and the largest mean in the pith for Astrophytum (212 mu m). In
   the Cacteae, calcium oxalates were the most predominant biominerals.
   Other elements such as magnesium, manganese, and aluminum were also
   identified. Lophophora is characterized by crystalline aggregates in the
   cortex of both species with calcium oxalate and traces of silicon and
   iron, which are not found in other crystalline aggregates of other taxa.
   We detected a unique combination of biominerals that allowed for us to
   distinguish the species of some genera, such as Astrophytum and
   Echinocactus. In conclusion, the occurrence, structure and size of
   biominerals provide valuable information for systematics at the generic
   level in Cacteae.},

Title = {Effect of plant composition on epigeal spider communities in northern
   New Zealand forest remnants},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Te Paki Ecological District (TPED) in northern Northland, New Zealand,
   is well known as an ecologically significant centre of endemism.
   However, due to extensive anthropogenic habitat degradation, native
   forest has been reduced to small, isolated remnants and many of its
   endemic species are threatened with extinction. Epigeal spider
   communities (species living on or near the ground) were surveyed within
   TPED by pitfall trapping at seven native forest remnants differing in
   plant composition and apparent seral stage to investigate how spider
   communities varied within them. Surveys were conducted four times over a
   12-month period coinciding with winter, spring, summer and autumn.
   Changes in spider communities were related to differences in plant
   composition, which were in turn associated with differences in apparent
   seral stage of the vegetation. Spider communities in forests at later
   seral stages were dominated by species such as Rinawa sp., Porrhothele
   sp. and Uliodon sp., whereas Euryopis nana, Cambridgea reinga,
   Stanwellia hollowayi and Hypodrassodes apicus were most prevalent in
   remnants at earlier seral stages. These species could potentially serve
   as useful bioindicators of ecological succession or restoration. Apart
   from soil organic matter content none of the predictor variables tested,
   including plant species richness, were significantly correlated with
   spider richness or diversity. Spider richness and diversity are most
   likely determined by a complex interaction of environmental and temporal
   factors that operate at different spatial scales. This study has
   increased our understanding of the ecological associations of spider
   communities and established that TPED is an important centre of endemism
   for spiders in New Zealand. We have also demonstrated the importance of
   forest remnants as reservoirs of indigenous spider diversity and helped
   resolve several historical taxonomic issues. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   the need for taxonomic research in this region of New Zealand and
   highlight the value of such biodiversity surveys.},

Title = {Invasive round goby shows higher sensitivity to salinization than native
   European perch},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {23-38},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Salinity is an influential abiotic environmental factor in aquatic
   species, specifically in freshwater, where salinization causes ecosystem
   degradation. Secondary salinization, that is increases in salinity due
   to an-thropogenic activities, can affect both osmoregulation and
   behaviour in freshwater fishes. It is generally believed that invasive
   species handle climatic change and environmental degradation better than
   native species, which is one reason for their invasion success. However,
   how invasive and native species cope with salinity changes remains
   little understood. Therefore, we investigated how low (500 mu S/cm) and
   high salinity (2000 mu S/cm) conditions affected oxygen consumption and
   behaviour in the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the
   native European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Our results showed that in
   round goby oxygen consumption increased and swimming and non-swimming
   movements changed in response to salinity increments, whereas European
   perch was not affected by salinity. Thus, it seems as if the invasive
   round goby is more sensitive to changes in salinity than the native
   European perch. Our results fit with the minority of studies indicating
   invasive species being less tolerant than some native spe-cies to
   environmental changes. This finding could be explained by the adaptation
   of round goby to low salinity due to its long establishment in River
   Rhine. Further, our results are also confirming that the effect of
   salinity is species-specific. In addition, European perch and round goby
   show diametrically different behavioural response to disturbance which
   could be an effect of holding different ecological niches as well as
   their anatomical differences.},

Title = {The effect of xylem vessel diameter on potential hydraulic conductivity
   in different rice stem longitudinal positions},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The morphological characteristics of the xylem elements influence water
   ascent in the plants. Few models determine the physical process of water
   movement in the vascular system of plants based on the hydraulic
   architecture. This study aims to determine the anatomical
   characteristics of the xylem and potential hydraulic conductivity at
   different positions along the stem of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The xylem
   vessels characteristics were examined in four internodes using three
   segments in each internode. The analogy between Ohm's law and
   Hagen-Poiseuille was used to determine the hydraulic conductivities at
   three temperatures (18, 25, and 33 degrees C). A successive decrease in
   the mean vessel diameters from bottom to top stem was observed, with a
   significant difference between internodes. Between the Internode I and
   II, there was a 12\% reduction in the mean diameter; between the II and
   III, and III and IV, the decrease was 10 and 28\%, respectively. When
   separated into groups (left and right metaxylem), there was variation in
   the hydraulically weighted vessels. There was variation in the estimated
   value of hydraulic conductivity as a function of temperature and along
   the stem from the base (Internode I) to the plant's top (Internode IV).
   The decrease in hydraulic conductivity was 41.1 (I-II), 24 (II-III), and
   73.4\% (III-IV). The estimated value of hydraulic conductivity was
   increasing with increase in temperature. The variation of the hydraulic
   conductivity along the useful length of rice allowed a better
   application of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.},

Title = {d(13)C in above-ground and below-ground organs of Spinulum annotinum
   (Lycopodiaceae)},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Physiological processes in plants and plant-environment interactions can
   be analysed from the composition of stable carbon isotopes (C-13/C-12).
   This ratio can be indicated using the 8 (delta) notation. Substantial
   evidence has been published in recent years demonstrating that
   post-photosynthetic fractionation occurs in plants and leads to
   differences in C-13-enrichment in heterotrophic (as compared with
   autotrophic) organs. Yet our understanding of processes leading to C-13
   divergence between leaves and heterotrophic tissues remains low. Large
   part of the isotope analysis is concerned with angiosperms, but not
   spore-bearing tracheophytes. In this study, we explored the C-12 and
   C-13 isotope distribution in above-ground and below-ground organs of an
   archaic lycophyte Spinulum annotinum (L.) A.Haines (interrupted
   clubmoss). The main objectives of this study were to determine the
   natural distribution of stable carbon isotopes in sporophytes of S.
   annotinum and to discuss possible causes for differences in delta C-13 .
   The study revealed that there are significant differences between delta
   C-13 in different S. annotinum organs. The delta C-13 values varied by
   about 2.4\%o. The highest delta C-13 values were -30.0\%o in roots and
   the lowest were-32.4\%o in plagiotropic shoot leaves. The distance to a
   body of water had no significant effect on delta C-13 delta C-13 values
   in S. annotinum. Outgrowth size did not have a clear relationship with
   delta C-13 in S. annotinum. The Shannon Diversity Index was a
   significant predictor for delta C-13 values in S. annotinum. The
   uncovered delta C-13 and the relationship with abiotic habitat
   conditions and neighbouring plant species in the community provide a
   base for future lycophyte ecophysiology research.},

Title = {Maintained nutrient accumulation in invasive Solidago canadensis in
   response to competition Competition tolerance and nutrient accumulation},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Successful invasions into native plant communities may depend on
   critical functional traits of invaders, such as inherent high growth
   rate and associated massive nutrient absorption and utilization, which
   are affected by species-dependent soil properties. To test these
   hypotheses, we grew the invasive plant Solidago canadensis and its
   co-occurring native species Imperata cylindrica alone or in
   interspecific competition in soils collected from the stands of either
   S. canadensis or I. cylindrica. The soil from the S. canadensis stands
   had much higher available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
   concentrations than that from the I. cylindrica stands, and enhanced the
   growth of both species to a similar magnitude. Interspecific competition
   decreased the growth of both species, but S. canadensis was much more
   tolerant to interspecific competition than I. cylindrica. Soil origin
   had no effect on the magnitude of the competition tolerance of either
   species. Nutrient accumulation in shoots was less negatively affected by
   interspecific competition in S. canadensis than in I. cylindrica and was
   even maintained in S. canadensis when growing in the soil from the S.
   canadensis stands. The maintenance of nutrient accumulation in S.
   canadensis under interspecific competition was mostly achieved through
   increased or unchanged shoot nutrient concentration. These findings
   suggest that the successful invasion of S. canadensis into native plant
   communities is associated with its inherent high capacity of nutrient
   accumulation, while plant-dependent soil properties seem to play less
   important roles.},

Title = {Exploring trade-offs in agro-ecological landscapes: Using a
   multi-objective land-use allocation model to support agroforestry
   research},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Finding the optimal land allocation for providing ecosystem services,
   conserving biodiversity and maintaining rural liveli-hoods is a key
   challenge of agricultural management and land-use planning. Agroforestry
   has been widely discussed as a sus-tainable land-use solution and as one
   strategy to improve the provision of multiple ecological and economic
   functions in agricultural landscapes. In this study, we use the backdrop
   of agroforestry research to evaluate a method from the multi-criteria
   decision analysis toolbox: robust multi-objective optimization. The key
   feature of this modelling approach is its capacity to integrate
   uncertain ecological and socio-economic data. We illustrate the
   optimization model with a case study from eastern Panama, showing how
   the model can bring together scientific and practical knowledge to
   provide potentially desirable land-scape compositions from the
   perspective of farmers, a public perspective, and a compromise solution.
   Example results of our case study show how to assess whether
   agroforestry is a desirable component in a landscape composition to
   satisfy multiple objectives of different interest groups. Furthermore,
   we use the model to demonstrate how different objectives influence the
   optimal area share and type of agroforestry. Due to its parsimonious
   nature, the model could be used as a starting point of an interactive
   co-learning process with decision-makers, researchers and other
   stakeholders. The model, however, is not yet suit-able for an exact
   prediction of future land-use dynamics, for questions of spatially
   explicit land-use configuration, studies going beyond the regional scale
   or for socio-economic interactions of agents. Therefore, we outline
   future research needs and recom-mendations for other types of models or
   hybrid approaches.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Abstract = {In well-established flowering plant invasions, floral phenotypes that do
   not attract pollinators are predicted to be eliminated through natural
   selection. We explored this hypothesis in the invasive plant species
   Scotch broom ( Cytisus scoparius), which has yellow flowers frequented
   by a diverse community of bee species, as well as red-tinged flowers
   that are predicted to be pollinated at a significantly lower rate. We
   predicted that plants with the red-flower phenotype will have fewer
   flowers visited, produce fewer seed pods per flower, and produce fewer
   seeds per pod than the yellow-flowered type. To investigate this, we
   measured the proportion of flowers pollinated for red- and
   yellow-flowered phenotypes, observed the number of seed pods produced
   per flower, and counted seeds per pod. Although we found lower
   pollination in the red-flowered phenotype, we did not see differences in
   female fitness. Scotch broom is an invader predicted to be limited in
   fecundity by the rate of pollinator visits and would be expected to lose
   phenotypes that attract fewer pollinators. We found the persistence of a
   less-attractive phenotype, likely because the reduction in male fitness
   is not paired with a reduction in female fitness.},

Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {297},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Among one of the largest genera of angiosperms, Peperomia has a
   Pantropical distribution. However, studies that analyze the chorological
   details and conservation status of its species still are scarce. Brazil
   is home to 169 species of Peperomia and approximately two thirds (111
   spp.) are considered endemic in the Flora of Brazil. Due to this, the
   present study aims to answer: (1) Are the Peperomia cited in Flora do
   Brasil 2020 as endemic really endemic? (2) How are these species
   distributed? (3) What is the extinction risk of the Peperomia species
   endemic to Brazil? In order to extract and clean the occurrence data, we
   used records available in open databases then applied a workflow method
   developed by CNCFlora (National Center for the Conservation of Flora).
   Based on our data, at current 100 species can be considered endemic to
   Brazil. We found that almost half of the endemic species are threatened
   on some level and that the phytogeographical domain with the greatest
   richness and highest number of records is the Atlantic Forest.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Responses of Wintering Bald Eagles to Changes in Salmon
   Carcass Availability in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {307-316},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Each winter, thousands of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from
   across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed
   on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta).
   However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are
   reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source
   for eagles. The ability of eagles to adjust to these impacts is crucial
   to their survival, and their responses are currently unknown. I
   hypothesized that eagles are responding by redistributing to non-river
   habitat in search of alternative food sources. Specifically, I examined
   the redistribution of over-wintering eagles from river habitat to nearby
   agricultural areas in response to seasonal declines in carcass
   availability. Over two consecutive winters, I conducted weekly eagle
   surveys on a 30-km stretch of the Nooksack River and a 22.5-km stretch
   of farmland northwest of the river. I examined the association between
   salmon carcass distribution and eagle abundance on the Nooksack River,
   and evaluated the temporal relationship between eagle abundance on the
   Nooksack River versus neighboring farmland. I found a strong negative
   association between eagle abundance on the river versus adjacent
   farmland, and observed eagles primarily concentrated near dairy farms
   and waterfowl rafts. My results suggest that eagles are responding to
   declining carcass availability by redistributing to non-river habitat in
   search of alternative food sources, and that a substantial fraction may
   migrate to agricultural areas.},

Title = {A handful of beauty and services: Flower-visiting birds at two small
   urbanised sites in south-eastern Brazil and Australia},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urbanised sites around the world harbour bird assemblages capable to
   tolerate human-induced environmental changes. Assemblages of
   flower-visiting birds at urbanised sites usually are composed of a
   limited number of habitat generalist species that favour open areas and
   edges, a tendency recorded for fruit or insect-eating species as well.
   We compared flower-visiting bird assemblages and their flower resources
   in two small urbanised sites in two almost antipodal countries: Brazil
   and Australia. The flower-visiting birds at the two study sites are
   composed of completely different families and species but have similar
   functional traits. Each study site has flower-visiting bird assemblages
   composed of six species, with predominance of hummingbirds in Brazil and
   honeyeaters in Australia. A large hummingbird in Brazil and a
   medium-sized honeyeater in Australia monopolise the nectar resources and
   aggressively expel other birds. Landscaping and gardening activities
   provide year-round nectar-producing flowers exploited by the birds. The
   two flower-visiting bird assemblages share several simi-larities despite
   their different species composition. At both sites the flower-visiting
   birds retain their ecological functions and deliver ecosystem services.
   Pollination and cultural services are the most prominent ones provided
   by the birds and their flowers. Such natural history-oriented
   comparisons help to understand the poorly known relationships between
   flower-visiting birds and their flowers in small urbanised areas.},

Title = {Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of Anadenanthera colubrina
   var. cebil in the biogeographical context of Neotropical seasonally dry
   forest},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Neotropical seasonally dry forest (dry forest) is a fragmented biome
   that occurs in regions with pronounced seasonal rainfall. There are
   several hypotheses about the evolution of the distribution of these
   forests concerning the influence of climatic changes during the
   Quaternary. Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil is a native tree that is
   considered the most paradigmatic and ecologically specialized key
   species of dry forest.The present work aims to test whether the current
   disjunct distribution of A. colubrina var. cebil is a remnant of a
   formerly widespread range during the cold and dry phases of the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here, we take an approach that combines
   chloroplast DNA, palaeodistribution modelling and fossil evidence to
   understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of the distribution of
   Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil. Seven haplotypes were detected in
   the two non-coding regions of cpDNA analysed and their divergence was
   dated to the Neogene. Maps of climatic suitability for A. colubrina var.
   cebil throughout South America showed that the potential distribution of
   the species was extensive and fragmented from the lower Pleistocene to
   modern times. Data from the fossil record confirm the occurrence of A.
   colubrina var. cebil at the southern limit of the dry forest
   distribution in historical times before the Quaternary. We found that
   climate change during the Pleistocene cannot be considered the main
   cause of molecular divergence of A. colubrina var. cebil haplotypes. We
   also found that A. colubrina var. cebil already had a widespread and
   fragmented distribution in South America during the Pleistocene, and
   that A. colubrina var. cebil was already present in northern Argentina
   in pre-Pleistocene.},

Title = {Mathematical modeling the influence of bracteoles on sepal arrangement},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eichler (1875) hypothesized that the position of the bracteoles
   determines the position of sepals and made a near-exhaustive list of the
   different arrangements found in monocots and dicots. However, he was
   unable to provide a theoretical basis for these observations. Eichler's
   hypothesis has not had much success over the past 150 years. In this
   study, we find that the classical mathematical theory of phyllotaxy
   makes it possible to model all the arrangements listed by Eichler from
   the angular and radial positions of the bracteoles and subtending
   bracts.},

Title = {The activity of a subterranean small mammal alters Afroalpine vegetation

Abstract = {Subterranean rodents can act as ecosystem engineers by shaping the
   landscape due to soil perturbation and herbivory. At the same time,
   their burrow density is affected by environmental conditions, vegetation
   and anthropogenic factors. Disentangling this complex interplay between
   subterranean rodents and their environment remains challenging. In our
   study, we analysed the interplay of abiotic conditions, vegetation
   patterns and human land-use and the burrow density of the giant root-rat
   (GRR; Tachyoryctes macrocephalus), a subterranean rodent endemic to the
   Afroalpine ecosystem of the Bale Mountains in south-east Ethiopia.
   Specifically, we examined the effects of GRR on plant species richness
   and vegetation cover and vice-versa, and how these reciprocal effects
   might be modulated by temperature, habitat wetness and grazing. Our
   results showed that increasing GRR burrow density led to decreased
   vegetation cover, and that effects of GRR on vegetation cover were
   slightly stronger than vice -versa. Considering the reciprocal causation
   models, we found that increasing plant species richness led to increased
   GRR burrow density, while GRR burrow density decreased as vegetation
   cover increased. Increases in habitat wetness and livestock grazing
   intensity also directly led to increased GRR burrow density. Our results
   stress the importance of subterranean ecosys-tem engineers on vegetation
   and highlight the vulnerability of these complex interactions to human
   activity.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Microclimate influences plant reproductive performance via an
   antagonistic interaction},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {13-29},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climatic conditions can influence plant reproduction directly, but also
   via changes in plant traits, interactions with animals, and the
   surrounding environment. Such indirect effects can often be complex and
   involve multiple steps including climatic effects on interacting
   species, and on the context in which these interactions occur. The joint
   effects of climatic variation and indirect effects in terms of
   plant-animal interactions have sometimes been assessed at larger spatial
   scales. However, less is known about how microclimatic variation affects
   within-population variation in reproductive performance, in spite of
   that it is becoming increasingly clear that variation in climatic
   conditions can occur over very short distances. We studied the direct
   and indirect effects of microclimate on withinpopulation variation in
   reproductive performance of the plant Gentiana pneumonanthe in presence
   of the myrmecophagous and seed predator butterfly Phengaris alcon. We
   found that microclimatic effects on plant performance were mainly
   indirect, and that effects of temperature and moisture were interactive.
   The number of seeds per flower of G. pneumonanthe decreased in cold and
   moist microsites, and these effects were mediated by an increased
   oviposition by P. alcon in these microsites. The effects of soil
   temperature and moisture on the incidence of oviposition and plant
   performance were mediated by effects on plant phenology, density and
   phenology of neighbouring host plants, and host ant abundance. Plants
   that flowered earlier and where host ants were more abundant, and
   especially plants surrounded by fewer and later-flowering neighbours,
   produced fewer seeds per flower because of a higher incidence of
   oviposition. Our results demonstrate that effects of microclimatic
   variation on plant reproductive performance can be mostly indirect and
   largely mediated by species interactions. These findings highlight that
   among individual variation in small-scale environmental conditions
   within populations can cause variation in individual plant performance
   through multiple pathways. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {How can mycorrhizal symbiosis mediate multiple abiotic stresses in woody
   plants?{*}},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mycorrhizal symbiosis is an ancient association of plants and
   mycorrhizal fungi central to woody plant evolution and expansion. This
   symbiosis has established a complex exchange of services between plants
   and mycorrhizal fungi that ultimately helps plants thrive in extreme
   abiotic conditions and build resistance against lack of nutrients and
   water, pathogens, herbivores, or pollutants. Here, we briefly comment on
   the roles of mycorrhizal symbiosis as modulators of the responses of
   woody plants to multiple abiotic stress factors typical to ongoing
   global change. We comment on the most studied factors, i.e. drought,
   extreme temperatures, nutrient and light deficiency. There is a general
   lack of understanding of the interaction among stress factors and their
   combined effects on woody plants, their symbiotic interaction with
   mycorrhizal fungi and their impact on ecosystem processes. As a first
   step, identifying and ranking the severity of stress factors and
   situations/locations where multiple stress factors co-occur could guide
   initial expectations and hypotheses to comprehend the mycorrhizal
   benefits to woody species tolerance under multifactorial stress
   combinations. We finally highlight topical areas that require more
   information and research.},

Title = {Threats to UK freshwaters under climate change: Commonly traded aquatic
   ornamental species and their potential pathogens and parasites},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {73-108},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {The aquatic ornamental industry, whilst providing socio-economic
   benefits, is a known introduction path-way for non-native species, which
   if invasive, can cause direct impacts to native species and ecosystems
   and also drive disease emergence by extending the geographic range of
   associated parasites and pathogens and by facilitating host-switching,
   spillover and spill-back. Although current UK temperatures are typically
   below those necessary for the survival and establishment of
   commonly-traded tropical, and some sub-tropical, non-native ornamental
   species, the higher water temperatures predicted under climate-change
   scenarios are likely to increase the probability of survival and
   establishment. Our study aimed primarily to identify which of the
   commonly-traded non-native ornamental aquatic species (fish and
   invertebrates), and their pathogens and parasites, are likely to benefit
   in terms of survival and establishment in UK waters under predicted
   future climate conditions. Out of 233 ornamental species identified as
   traded in the UK, 24 were screened, via literature search, for potential
   parasites and pathogens (PPPs) due to their increased risk of survival
   and establishment under climate change. We found a total of 155 PPPs,
   the majority of which were platyhelminths, viruses and bacteria. While
   many of the identified PPPs were already known to occur in UK waters,
   PPPs currently absent from UK waters and with zoonotic potential were
   also iden-tified. Results are discussed in the context of understanding
   potential impact, in addition to provision of evidence to inform risk
   assessment and mitigation approaches.},

Abstract = {Increasingly large high-severity wildfires in dry forests of the western
   United States have led to concern about how best to regenerate new
   forests after wildfires. Harvesting fire-killed trees, burning woody
   debris, and tree planting are commonly used reforestation strategies.
   This study evaluated the effects of a novel forest restoration approach
   that involved masticating un-merchantable dead trees and spreading the
   woody debris generated across the site to prevent erosion from the 2007
   Angora Fire in Lake Tahoe, California. Woody material covered 82\% of
   the site after treatment, with an average depth of 6.6 cm, and volume of
   190 tonnes per hectare. We found that this treatment reduced shrub
   regrowth, compared to an untreated area nearby, and that shrub regrowth
   was inversely related to fuel depth. Seven years after the fire, shrub
   cover averaged only 50\% on treated plots compared to 92\% on untreated
   plots. The tallest shrubs averaged 69 cm in height on the treated site
   compared to 114 cm on nearby untreated sites. Tree seedlings planted on
   the treated site averaged 141 cm in height, well above the height of the
   shrubs. Advantages of this approach include controlling erosion while
   reducing drought stress, reducing the potential for weed introduction,
   and reducing the need for herbicide to control shrub competition.
   Although leaving a layer of woody material where new trees have been
   planted does constitute a fire hazard, so too does a vigorous shrub
   layer. Managers should consider and weigh these factors when deciding on
   a postfire reforestation strategy.},

Title = {Threats and benefits of invasive alien plant species on pollinators},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {89-102},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invasive alien plant species are usually disliked due to their high
   pressure on native communities. However, their ecological effects on
   pollinators are complex: some species provide abundant floral resources,
   boosting the number of pollinators, while they often disrupt
   plant-pollinator interactions by outcompeting native plants. Our direct
   knowledge is mainly based on singlespecies studies, while understanding
   the mechanism of these complex ecological interactions needs
   multi-species field-based approaches. It is also imperative to clarify
   the pros and cons of invasive plants and drivers of invasion from the
   perspective of pollinators. We conducted a standard protocol-driven
   regional study in Central and Eastern Europe, comparing 6-7 invaded and
   non-invaded sites of 12 herbaceous invasive plant species. We sampled
   floral resources, bees, and hoverflies before and during the flowering
   of the invasive plants. We analysed the effects of plant invasion at the
   invasive plant species level and in combined analyses, and tested
   whether the life span (perennial vs. annual) and flowering time (early-,
   middle-, and late-flowering) of invasive plants affect the abundance,
   species richness, diversity and species composition of native plants and
   pollinators. The combined analyses showed lower abundance and species
   richness of flowering plants and pollinators before, and higher
   abundance of both during the flowering of invasive plants in invaded
   sites. However, invasive plants had significant speciesspecific effects.
   Perennial invasive plants had a stronger negative impact on floral
   resources and pollinators already before their flowering compared to
   annuals. Flowering time of invasive plants affected the pollinator
   guilds differently. We suggest that in certain critical time periods of
   the year, invasive plants might provide the dominant foraging resources
   for pollinators in an invaded ecosystem. But, they also often cause
   significant losses in native floral resources over the year. Instead of
   simple eradication, careful preparation and consideration might be
   needed during removal of invasive plants. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Automated habitat monitoring systems linked to adaptive management: a
   new paradigm for species conservation in an era of rapid environmental
   change},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-22},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Recent increases in ecological disturbances driven by climate
   change and our expanding human footprint make it challenging for natural
   resource managers to keep apprised of current conditions and adjust
   management plans accordingly. To effectively conserve species in highly
   dynamic landscapes requires more timely habitat monitoring and a more
   responsive adaptive management cycle.
   Objectives We introduce a framework to automatically monitor and assess
   species habitats over a range of spatial and temporal scales. We then
   apply this framework by developing an automated habitat monitoring
   system for the Mexican spotted owl (MSO) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA,
   that will be linked to federal agency adaptive management plans.
   Methods We automated the process of monitoring and assessing trends in
   MSO habitat on an annual schedule using the Google Earth Engine
   cloud-based spatial analysis platform and dynamic data repository. We
   ran this system retrospectively on historical data to monitor MSO
   habitat from 1986 to 2020.
   Results The automated habitat monitoring system provided a 35-year MSO
   habitat time series with high accuracy. Widespread habitat gains and
   losses occurred every year, underscoring the need for continuous
   monitoring and the benefits of an automated workflow.
   Conclusions Automated habitat monitoring linked to adaptive management
   holds great promise in helping managers track the impacts of recent
   disturbances and adjust plans to meet goals even in increasingly dynamic
   landscapes. In a companion paper, Jones et al. (2022) demonstrate the
   utility of this approach by analyzing our MSO habitat time series to
   assess trends, drivers of change, and management implications.},

Title = {Examining primate community occurrence patterns in agroforest landscapes
   using arboreal and terrestrial camera traps},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3103-3121},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Forest-agricultural mosaics are now considered critical for
   biodiversity. Within these landscapes, the type of land use surrounding
   remnant forests influences the ability of arboreal non-flying wildlife
   to travel, disperse and ultimately survive, making arboreal species
   disproportionally impacted from habitat change. To inform land
   management strategies we must first understand how wildlife, including
   arboreal taxa, respond to heterogeneous landscapes. Objectives Here, we
   examine the occurrence patterns of four arboreal and three
   semi-terrestrial primate species in response to agroforest landscape
   characteristics in southern Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. Methods We
   combine results from arboreal and terrestrial camera traps across
   Cantanhez National Park (1067 km(2)). We fit occupancy models using
   anthropogenic and environmental covariates generated via remote sensing
   and in-situ vegetation surveys. Results Arboreal camera traps (N = 38
   locations, 1922 camera trap days) detected all seven primate species,
   terrestrial camera traps (N = 62 locations, 3113 camera trap days)
   detected five. Arboreal red colobus (Piliocolobus badius) and
   semi-terrestrial Guinea baboon (Papio papio) were the only species not
   detected at all outside forest blocks. Occupancy of semi-terrestrial
   chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) increased nearer villages, whereas that of
   arboreal king colobus (Colobus polykomos) and Demidoff's galago
   (Galagoides demidoff) decreased. Our models also suggest that
   semi-arboreal Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) increase
   arboreality nearer villages. Conclusions We demonstrate heterogeneous
   spatial responses amongst primates across the agroforest landscape. The
   lack of distinct patterns between groups (arboreal vs. semi-terrestrial
   primates) is likely due to species-specific human-induced anti-predator
   strategies and hunting preferences. Our results highlight the
   contribution of arboreal camera traps to community-based landscape-scale
   studies in anthropogenic environments.},

Abstract = {Genetic analyses have become increasingly powerful, more readily
   available to biologists, and have made ever more degraded DNA
   potentially useful. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are a
   relatively new ``class{''} of markers that show promise for use with
   degraded or archived samples. We sequenced a panel of 298 SNPs from
   Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tissue in three comparative
   studies to determine the effect of DNA quality at sampling, time in
   archive, and tissue type and preservation method on SNP genotyping
   success using logistic regression. The first study evaluated pristine
   DNA from live adults sampled at three hatcheries and archived up to 6
   years. The second study compared samples from carcasses with varying
   levels degradation (i.e., condition) and archived up to 15 years. The
   third study compared heart and fin samples preserved either in ethanol
   or on paper from carcasses with varying levels of degradation and
   processed within 6 months. Genotyping success for fresh tissue did not
   decline over the 6-year archive period at two of the three hatcheries,
   suggesting sample handling techniques may be more influential than time
   in archive. Genotyping success of archived carcass samples depended more
   on carcass condition than time in archive. Heart tissue genotyped
   consistently more often than fin samples from all but poor condition
   carcasses. Based on these results, we make tissuesampling
   recommendations for different intended purposes. We also provide simple,
   post-collection sample handling procedures that can increase genotyping
   success regardless of tissue or preservation method.},

Title = {Spiders in canopy and ground microhabitats are robust to changes in
   understory vegetation management practices in mature oil palm
   plantations (Riau, Indonesia)},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Conversion of natural habitats to oil palm agriculture has caused
   declines in biodiversity and changes in ecosystem functions. To preserve
   biodiversity we must protect natural habitats, but once oil palm
   plantations are established, developing more -environmentally friendly
   management strategies could support higher levels of within-plantation
   biodiversity and boost the delivery of ecosystem services, possibly
   increasing oil palm productivity. In this study, we use a before-after
   control-impact (BACI) experiment to test whether three understory
   vegetation management strategies affect spider abundance, species
   rich-ness, and species-level community composition in canopy and ground
   microhabitats in mature oil palm plantations. Our treatments encompassed
   the range of current management practices and included heavy
   applications of herbicides to eliminate all understory vegetation,
   maintaining some understory vegetation using business-as-usual herbicide
   applications, and enhancing understory vegetation by not applying any
   herbicides. We focussed on spiders, as they are both biologically and
   economically important in oil palm plantations, owing to their important
   pest control services. We identified more than 1000 spiders,
   representing 20 families and 83 morphospecies. The treatments did not
   affect any aspects of spider biodiversity, although the abundance and
   species richness of canopy-dwelling spiders changed between pre-and
   post-treatment sample periods, independent of treatment. Our findings
   indicate that differences in understory vegetation management practices
   do not affect spiders, or the pest management services that they
   provide, in mature oil palm plantations. As such, more extreme changes
   in management would probably be required to enhance spider biodiversity
   in oil palm plantations in the long-term. Further studies are needed to
   determine the practicalities of such approaches, to assess how changes
   in vegetation management practices affect spiders in additional
   microhabitats, and how the impacts of such approaches vary across the
   20-30 year oil palm commercial life cycle.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels in the western US are under-studied compared to their
   eastern cousins, and no western species receive federal protection.
   Mussel distribution throughout Oregon's rivers and streams is poorly
   documented, and there are limited historical records to inform
   assessments of whether, and by how much, current populations may have
   declined. We launched a long-term project to characterize freshwater
   mussel populations throughout the Willamette River basin. Surveys were
   conducted in the mainstem Willamette River and a major tributary, the
   Middle Fork Willamette, during three years. A two-stage sampling process
   was used; transects were surveyed qualitatively, and then 0.25 m(2)
   quadrats were placed randomly in transects for quantitative surveys.
   Mussels visible at the substrate surface were counted using viewing
   scopes and snorkeling, and scuba diving in deeper water. To facilitate
   detection of juveniles (< 3.50 cm long) and calculation of the burial
   factor, some quadrats were double sampled; mussels visible at the
   surface were counted, then the substrate was excavated to a depth of 10
   to 20 cm, and all mussels (surface and buried) were counted and their
   shell length measured. Dense western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata)
   populations were found at all locations, but they differed greatly in
   length class structure, density, and presence of juveniles. Some sites
   also contained small numbers of floaters (Anodonta spp.), and notably, a
   single western ridgemussel (Gonidea angulata) was found in a highly
   urbanized reach. These surveys provide baseline data on the current
   status of several freshwater mussel populations in the Willamette River
   basin.},

Title = {Retention of colour-changed flowers increases pollinator attraction to
   Lantana undulata inflorescences},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many flowers change colour as they age or after pollination, which can
   have direct effects on pollinator behaviour affecting both pollination
   (on the plant side) and foraging efficiency (on the insect side). The
   retention of colour-changed flowers might increase plant attractiveness
   to pollinators over long distances, while directing pollinators at short
   range towards flowers that still present rewards and are sexually
   receptive. In this study, we used Lantana undulata Schrank
   (Verbenaceae), which presents yellow-centered and white flowers within
   an inflorescence, as a model plant species to study the influence of
   floral colour change on pollinator visitation. We first show that colour
   change from yellow to white occurs over a 24 h period regardless of
   pollination, and is associated with reduced stigma receptivity and
   nectar reward availability. We then used pollinator visitor
   ob-servations and experimental manipulations of inflorescence display
   patterns to investigate the effects of floral colour change on
   pollinator attraction, behavior and choices. Pollinators exhibited
   strong preference for visiting yellow-centered flowers, suggesting the
   colour change to white in older flowers is an honest signal directing
   pollinators to rewarding and receptive flowers within the inflorescence.
   In addition, the absence of white flowers on manipulated inflorescences
   significantly reduced their attractiveness to pollinators. Our results
   suggest that the retention of colour-changed white flowers is important
   to attract pollinators at long distances, while the yellow colour of
   young flowers guides pollinators to the sexually viable, rewarding
   flowers on inflorescences at short distances, maximizing both
   pollination and foraging efficiency.},

Abstract = {A deformed rib from a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) was found
   among more than 100 mammoth bones excavated from an alfalfa field at the
   Tonnemaker Hill Farm in the Frenchman Hills north of Royal City, Grant
   County, Washington. The mammoth remains were deposited within
   -fine-grained Missoula flood sediments sometime after 16 ka. We
   performed a detailed examination of the rib, including computerized
   tomography imaging, and investigated the possible etiology of the
   deformity. The deformity consists of hypertrophic bone formation
   localized toward the distal (sternal) end of the rib. The circumference
   of the lesion is nearly twice that of the medial circumference of the
   rib diaphysis. This lesion is consistent with an incompletely healed
   fracture or a fracture nonunion with pseudarthrosis (false joint)
   formation. Gross examination and computerized tomography scan images of
   the proximal aspect of the rib, as well as cursory inspection of the
   other skeletal remains, have yet to reveal definitive evidence of other
   bony abnormalities. We surmise, therefore, that this fracture was the
   consequence of blunt force trauma in a healthy animal. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of a rib fracture with incomplete healing or
   false joint formation in a M. columbi individual in the Pacific
   Northwest. We suspect the incidence of rib fractures among M. columbi
   was greater than the Pacific Northwest literature suggests and encourage
   examination of existing collections for evidence of similar findings.
   The incidence and frequency of such injuries may provide insight into M.
   columbi behavior.},

Title = {The fear diet: Risk, refuge, and biological control by omnivorous weed
   seed predators},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {50-61},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Weed seed biocontrol by omnivorous mice and insects can limit weed
   seedbanks, but this ecosystem service can be difficult to predict given
   the broad diet breadth of seed predators and their potential for
   intraguild predation. Seed foraging behavior is further modified by
   fluctuating cues of predation risk from higher trophic levels and the
   availability of refuge habitat. Uncertainty about whether co-occurring
   insects and mice additively contribute to weed biocontrol or interfere
   with each other via intraguild predation limits our ability to recommend
   habitat management strategies that reliably promote seed destruction.
   Using seed removal assays, fluorescent powder tracking, and stable
   isotope analyses, we assessed effects of a predation risk cue
   (moonlight) on mouse foraging patterns in a patchwork of vegetated and
   exposed plots in a cultivated field. Mouse foraging activity decreased
   on exposed ground during the full moon, compared to dark nights, yet
   foraging movements were unaffected by moon cycle within refuge patches.
   Weed seed consumption was more than three times higher in cover than
   exposed soil, and 78\% of that difference was attributable to
   invertebrate granivores. Mice and invertebrate granivores both exhibited
   higher foraging activity in cover, indicating co-occurrence of
   intraguild predators and prey. However, stable isotope analyses of fecal
   samples revealed that mice captured in refuge habitats fed at slightly
   lower trophic levels than those in exposed habitats (suggesting minimal
   intraguild predation in refuge habitat), and mouse diet was unaffected
   by moonlight. Despite increased availability of invertebrate prey in
   cover patches, mice do not appear to preferentially exploit prey when
   avoiding their own predators or interfere with weed seed predation.
   Therefore, functional redundancy of mice and invertebrate seed predators
   in cover crops and other refuge habitats may strengthen and stabilize
   weed seed biocontrol. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of

Title = {Limited honeybee hive placement balances the trade-off between
   biodiversity conservation and crop yield of buckwheat cultivation},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {28-38},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An increasing number of farmland initiatives aim to aid biodiversity
   conservation through alternative farming practices such as
   nature-inclusive farming. However, these approaches frequently lead to
   trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and crop yield. For
   example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a melliferous crop that
   flowers for a long period in the summer when nectar in agricultural
   areas is generally scarce, and buckwheat cultivation could therefore
   contribute to wild pollinator conservation. However, honeybees (Apis
   mellifera) are placed to ensure sufficient crop pollination, which
   potentially increases resource competition with wild pollinators in and
   around the crop. Here, we have studied this trade-off by surveying
   pollinators in and around 16 small-scale (>> 1 ha) flowering buckwheat
   fields and we determined the contribution of pollinator density to crop
   yield in a nature-inclusive farming project. We found that the buckwheat
   pollinator community was diverse, albeit domi-nated by honeybees. We
   found no clear indications of resource competition between honeybees and
   wild pollinators within the buckwheat fields. Honeybee density in the
   surroundings was generally low, and increased minimally during
   honeybee-hive placement. While densities of honeybees decreased
   non-linearly over the day in buckwheat fields, they did not
   (temporarily) move into the surroundings of the field, suggesting
   limited competition for resources with wild pollinators. Crop yield was
   largely dependent on crop pollinator density, notably of honeybees, and
   to a lesser extent crop biomass (as a proxy for agricul-tural
   management). Our results show that buckwheat cultivation fits well
   within nature-inclusive farming if some simple pre-cautionary measures
   are being taken, such as limiting the honeybee-hive densities and
   placing hives only during the main flowering period. The introduction of
   buckwheat cultivation into crop rotation could then contribute to fill
   an important nectar gap in the summer, which potentially boosts wild
   pollinator populations in the long term.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Title = {Non-crop habitats concurrently drive crop colonization by the millet
   head miner and regulation by natural enemies},

Abstract = {Non-crop habitats, depending on their composition, can enhance the
   abundance and diversity of natural enemies of crop pests, but also at
   the same time provide resources to pests, thereby reducing the effect on
   pest incidence and resulting yield losses. The objective of the present
   study was to test (1) the effect of semi-natural habitats in the
   landscape on crop colonization by pests and natural regulation, and (2)
   the relationship between natural regulation and pest incidence. The
   pearl millet head miner (MHM) was selected as a case study because it is
   a key pest of millet cultivated in traditional pesticide-free tree-crop
   agroforestry systems in which its control mostly relies on the action of
   natural enemies.
   A set of 24 millet fields were selected in a 20x20 km area in Senegal,
   from the analysis of high-resolution satellite images (Pleiades), and
   hypotheses on the relative abundance of semi-natural habitats (here
   trees and rangelands) in the agricultural landscape. Millet fields were
   monitored for pest infestation of panicles and pest natural regulation.
   We used partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-PM) to
   evaluate the relationships between the abundance and diversity of
   semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale, crop colonization, natural
   pest regulation, and pest incidence.
   Panicle colonization by the MHM was generally high (14-92\%) and
   increased with the abundance of trees and to a lesser extent with the
   rangeland area at a 1000 m-radius around millet fields. However,
   regulation provided by natural enemies was amplified by the abundance of
   trees at a local scale (250 m-radius around millet fields). This was
   particularly true at early crop colonization of the MHM with parasitism
   and direct predation on eggs and young larvae. This multi-scale effect
   of semi-natural habitats on crop colonization and natural regulation
   could explain why no clear relationship between crop colonization and
   pest incidence, nor natural regulation and pest incidence, was observed.
   Future studies on the identification of complex species-specific
   interactions between trees and natural enemies should provide a better
   understanding of the ecological processes underlying the performance of
   natural regulation of MHM populations. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {The English sole (Parophrys vetulus, family Pleuronectidae) is an
   abundant ground fish used as a sentinel of marine pollution in the
   inland marine waters of Washington and Oregon. We used 15 microsatellite
   loci to evaluate patterns of genetic variability within and among 17
   collections of sole from coastal sites and within the southern Salish
   Sea. Over 470 alleles were identified in 15 loci, and high levels of
   genetic richness, as estimated by expected heterozygosity (HE) and
   allele richness (AR), were detected. Fish sampled from coastal areas at
   the northern end of our study area had the lowest values of genetic
   richness, in contrast to collections at the southern end. The level of
   differentiation among all collections was low: mean FST value was
   0.0006. Nineteen comparisons had statistically significant FST values
   (mean FST of 0.0029) and involved comparisons involving three locations
   associated with urban areas (Port Gardner {[}Everett, WA], Sinclair
   Inlet {[}Bremerton, WA], and Commencement Bay {[}Tacoma, WA]). A
   statistically significant, but weak, isolation-by-distance pattern was
   seen in the five coastal collections over 1,100 km of coastline. In the
   Salish Sea collections, the pattern of differentiation was patchy and
   marked by several distinctive collections in close proximity to urban
   areas. The pattern of differentiation in the Salish Sea parallels
   differences seen in ecotoxicological characteristics of the English sole
   that inhabit separate urban embayments differing in pollution
   characteristics. Future work can focus on evaluating the stability and
   meaningfulness of this subtle variability in a time of local and global
   environmental changes.},

Title = {The species-specificity of energy landscapes for soaring birds, and its
   consequences for transferring suitability models across species},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {239-252},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Soaring birds depend on atmospheric uplifts and are sensitive to
   wind energy development. Predictive modelling is instrumental to
   forecast conflicts between human infrastructures and single species of
   concern. However, as multiple species often coexist in the same area, we
   need to overcome the limitations of single species approaches.
   Objectives We investigate whether predictive models of flight behaviour
   can be transferred across species boundaries. Methods We analysed
   movement data from 57 white storks, Ciconia ciconia, and 27 griffon
   vultures, Gyps fulvus. We quantified the accuracy of topographic
   features, correlates of collision risk in soaring birds, in predicting
   their soaring behaviour, and tested the transferability of the resulting
   suitability models across species. Results 59.9\% of the total area was
   predicted to be suitable to vultures only, and 1.2\% exclusively to
   storks. Only 20.5\% of the study area was suitable to both species to
   soar, suggesting the existence of species-specific requirements in the
   use of the landscape for soaring. Topography alone could accurately
   predict 75\% of the soaring opportunities available to storks across
   Europe, but was less efficient for vultures (63\%). While storks relied
   on uplift occurrence, vultures relied on uplift quality, needing
   stronger uplifts to support their higher body mass and wing loading.
   Conclusions Energy landscapes are species-specific and more knowledge is
   required to accurately predict the behaviour of highly specialised
   soaring species, such as vultures. Our models provide a base to explore
   the effects of landscape changes on the flight behaviour of different
   soaring species. Our results suggest that there is no reliable and
   responsible way to shortcut risk assessment in areas where multiple
   species might be at risk by anthropogenic structures.},

Title = {Potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors in Eastern North
   America},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {59-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing Midwestern North
   America during the past 3 decades with > 950 cougar confirmations east
   of established populations. Due to an increase in confirmations east of
   current breeding populations, evaluation of cougar habitat suitability
   and connectivity is needed. However, few studies have assessed the
   habitat potential for cougar recolonization in the eastern portion of
   their former range. Objectives We used various habitat quality
   thresholds to model potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors
   throughout eastern North America. Methods Based on expert opinion, we
   used landcover, slope, human density, distance to roads, and distance to
   water as model variables. Least-cost path methods were used to model
   dispersal corridors from western populations to potential eastern
   habitat patches. Results Patches of suitable habitat ranged in size from
   3868 km(2) (Ozark Mountains) to > 2,490,850 km(2) (central and eastern
   Canada). Potential habitats were predominantly forest and shrubland,
   contained little anthropogenic development, and had high stream
   densities. Dispersal corridors were present throughout the study area.
   Corridors largely consisted of forested and cultivated landscapes and
   had higher road densities than habitat patches. Conclusions Our research
   provides conservationists with insights into areas suitable for cougar
   recolonization so they may proactively plan for potential cougar
   populations east of their current range. This work also provides a
   framework for evaluating multiple levels of landscape suitability for
   recolonizing species.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of street light shapes and LED color temperatures on
   nocturnal insects and bats},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Street lights are important light sources that contribute to artificial
   light at night (ALAN). To date, ecological impacts of individual LED
   properties (color temperature, dimmability) have been studied, while
   interactions between light properties or aspects of luminaire design
   have not been addressed. However, the design of luminaires can influence
   ALAN impacts as the shape determines the spatial distribution of light
   and its visibility in the environment. This may cause amplifying or
   mitigating effects. We assessed the relative individual and interacting
   effects of two LED luminaire designs and three LED color temperatures
   (1750 K, 3000 K, 4000 K) on nocturnal insect abundance, bat foraging and
   feeding activity. We considered a standard LED luminaire shape with
   focused light emission and a luminaire shape with a diffusor to scatter
   the light spatially, leading to increased visibility of the light in the
   environment. During 104 nights, we trapped 51263 nocturnal insects of
   which 97\% were caught at lights and 3\% at dark sites. For bats, up to
   44.8\% fewer acoustic signals were recorded at dark sites. We caught
   31\% insects at LEDs with1750 K, 34\% and 35\% at 3000 K and 4000 K,
   respectively. Thus, color temperatures of 1750 K proved less detrimental
   than 3000/4000 K. Effects of luminaire shape led to an increase (16\%)
   of trapped insects for luminaires with diffusors compared to the
   standard shape. In addition, luminaires with diffusors amplified the
   effects of LED color (+12\% insects at 1750 K/3000 K; +25.6\% at 4000
   K). In contrast, bat foraging activity was independent of the light
   treatments while bat feeding activity was increased by 21.5\% at
   standard luminaire shapes. Likely, intense straylight at diffused lights
   negatively affects the target-focused echolocation by deterring the
   bats. We concluded that ecological impacts of luminaire shape are an
   important, yet underestimated variable in light-pollution impact
   research. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft

Title = {Plant functional traits under cattle grazing and fallow age scenarios in
   a tropical dry forest of Northwestern Mexico},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants
   respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability
   associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the
   primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter
   environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and
   nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and
   functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence
   functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood.
   Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant
   functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth
   tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most
   important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in
   both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the
   effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits,
   with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early
   succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation
   (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional
   they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher
   specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced
   successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help
   plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some
   functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry
   weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession
   advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3
   concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits
   responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that
   cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation
   strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and
   cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing
   species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental
   filters in abandoned cattle fields. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Cyclopes didactylus, the smallest of all anteaters, inhabits Amazonian
   and Atlantic forests with an apparently disjunct distribution. Yet,
   phylogeography reveals historical connections through the forests of the
   Northeast Region of Brazil. Its populations in this region are
   classified by the Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient and
   with a trend towards decline. However, Northeast Brazil has a large
   sampling gap, and the potential distribution of this species has yet to
   be evaluated. We investigated the potential distribution of C.
   didactylus to evaluate the hypothesis of a disjunct distribution between
   Amazonian and Atlantic forests and estimate the amount of protected area
   in its predicted distribution. We generated a Maxent distribution model
   using occurrence records, according to the new taxonomic revision of
   Cyclopes, and selected current bioclimatic variables to evaluate the
   continuity of the predicted distribution of the species in Northeast
   Brazil. We also performed past projections to assess historical
   connections and overlapped maps of protected areas onto their current
   distribution. Although its distribution is probably disjunct, at least
   one as-yet-unknown population may be present in the forests of Northeast
   Brazil, an area poorly protected. The results are useful for targeting
   field efforts in this under-sampled region.},

Title = {Landscape-scale connectivity and fragment size determine species

Volume = {65},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat
   fragmentation since the mid-20th century, biological diver-sity has
   declined considerably throughout the world, particularly in Europe. We
   assessed how habitat and landscape-scale heterogeneity, such as
   variation in fragment size (small vs. large) and landscape configuration
   (measured as connectivity index), affect plant and arthropod diversity.
   We focused on arthropods with different feeding behaviour and mobility,
   spi-ders (predators, moderate dispersal), true bugs (mainly herbivores
   and omnivores with moderate dispersal), wild bees (pollinators with good
   dispersal abilities), and wasps (pollinators, omnivores with good
   dispersal abilities). We studied 60 dry grassland fragments in the same
   region (Hungarian Great Plain); 30 fragments were represented by the
   grassland com-ponent of forest-steppe stands, and 30 were situated on
   burial mounds (kurgans). Forest-steppes are mosaics of dry grass-lands
   with small forests in a matrix of plantation forests. Kurgans are
   ancient burial mounds with moderately disturbed grasslands surrounded by
   agricultural fields. The size of fragments ranged between 0.16-6.88 ha
   (small: 0.16-0.48 ha, large: 0.93-6.88 ha) for forest-steppes and
   0.01-0.44 ha (small: 0.01-0.10 ha and large: 0.20-0.44 ha) for kurgans.
   Fragments also represented an isolation gradient from almost cleared and
   homogenous landscapes, to landscapes with rel-atively high compositional
   heterogeneity. Fragment size, connectivity, and their interaction
   affected specialist and gener-alist species abundances of forest-steppes
   and kurgans. Large fragments had higher species richness of
   ground-dwelling spiders, and the effect of connectivity was more
   strongly positive for specialist arthropods and more strongly negative
   for generalists in large than in small fragments. However, we also found
   a strong positive impact of connectivity for generalist plants in small
   kurgans in contrast to larger ones. We conclude that besides the
   well-known effect of enhancing habitat quality, increasing connectivity
   between fragments by restoring natural and semi-natural habitat patches
   would help to maintain grassland biodiversity.},

Title = {Legume plant defenses and nutrients mediate indirect interactions
   between soil rhizobia and chewing herbivores},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil bacteria that associate with plant roots promote host vigor. Legume
   plants form mutualisms with rhizobial bacteria, and legumes grown with
   rhizobia have more nutrients and defenses than those grown without
   rhizobia. However, few studies have tested how stressors such as
   herbivores affect soil rhizobia, and the mechanisms mediating these
   interactions. Here we tested reciprocal interactions between a chewing
   herbivore, Sitona lineatus (pea leaf weevil), and Pisum sativum (pea)
   plants grown with or without rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar.
   viciae), and the plant-defense and nutritional mechanisms mediat-ing
   these interactions. We hypothesized that plants grown with rhizobia
   would have less feeding from S. lineatus due to greater expression of
   phytohormones or physical defenses. We also predicted that herbivory
   might impede the mutualism between P. sativum and rhizobia. Our
   experiments showed that leaf defoliation by S. lineatus was indeed
   lowest on plants with rhizobia. Plants grown with rhizobia had increased
   gene transcript expression associated with hormone-related defense
   (jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid) as well as physical and
   antioxidant-related defense, which may explain reduced feeding by S.
   lineatus. Conversely, S. lineatus feeding reduced the number of root
   nodules and nodule fresh weight, suggesting a disruption of the
   symbiosis between plants and rhizobia. Our study shows that aboveground
   herbivores can engage in mutually antagonistic interactions with soil
   microbes that are mediated through multiple plant-mediated pathways. (c)

Abstract = {Family farms can benefit from the presence of a diverse set of native
   pollinators and associated pollination services. In the present study we
   assessed the effect of flower visitor richness and visitation rate by
   honeybees and native insects on mandarin production ( Citrus reticulata
   `Criolla), in ten citrus family farms located in the Dry Chaco region of
   northwest Argentina. An exclusion experiment was conducted to explore
   how pollinators influence the fruit set and quality of `Criolla
   mandarin. The influence of features such as local richness and abundance
   of flowering plants, farm size, and surrounding natural/semi-natural
   habitats in the diversity of flower visitors was also evaluated. Fruit
   set in open pollination branches was three times higher than in bagged
   branches, where flower visitors were excluded. Moreover, the mandarin
   fruit set increased with a higher native visitation rate, and mandarin
   quality (fruit weight and size) decreased with a higher honeybee
   visitation rate. Flower visitor diversity was higher in farmlands with a
   greater proportion of surrounding natural and semi-natural habitats. Our
   results demonstrate the negative effects of excessive honeybee
   visitation on citrus fruit quality and highlight the importance of
   native pollinators and natural habitat conservation to increase the
   fruit set and quality of mandarin in family farms. (C) 2022 The

Title = {Cellobiase Activity as an Indicator of Fungal Decay in the Wood of
   Woodpecker Nest Cavities in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Woodpeckers require trees and snags with decayed wood in order to
   excavate nest and roost cavities, and interior wood hardness is
   considered an important factor determining where a woodpecker can create
   a cavity. In most ecosystems, saprophytic fungi are responsible for the
   decay and softening of wood, and are thought to be important in
   providing soft wood for woodpecker cavity excavation. We conducted a
   study of cellulose-degrading enzymes in the wood surrounding woodpecker
   nest cavities. We measured wood hardness, percent wood density loss
   (PWDL), and activity of cellobiase (an extracellular fungal cellulase
   that degrades cellulose) within wood surrounding the nest cavities of
   the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), black-backed woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus),
   and hairy woodpecker (D. villosus) in Oregon and Washington. We found
   that mean wood hardness was significantly lower, and cellobiase and PWDL
   were significantly higher, at nest cavities than controls for each
   woodpecker species. Wood hardness was higher and cellobiase lower at
   nests of black-backed woodpecker than northern flicker, but did not
   differ among the other woodpecker species. Our results suggest that
   increased amounts of cellobiase result in softer wood due to the
   increased decay caused by higher fungal enzyme activity and that
   measuring cellobiase can be used to estimate wood decay without directly
   measuring wood hardness. All four woodpecker species selected nest
   substrates with softer wood and higher fungal enzyme activity than
   controls. This supports findings from previous studies of the importance
   of saprophytic fungi for woodpecker cavity excavation.},

Abstract = {The perennial Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae) is a noxious weed worldwide
   that tolerates the extreme environ-ments of the Three Gorges Reservoir,
   China. Using brightfield and epifluorescence microscopy, we investigated
   the anatomical and histochemical features that allow this species to
   thrive in amphibious environments. The apoplastic barriers of C.
   rotundus consisted of an endodermis, a uniseriate exodermis, and a
   cuticle in the roots, rhizomes, and culms, respectively, as well as
   suberized stele and primary xylem poles. These barriers may help C.
   rotundus to retain oxygen and control water-solute exchanges under
   anoxic conditions. The mechanical tissues of C. rotundus included
   lignified sclerenchyma rings and sclerenchyma fibers in the roots,
   shoots, rhizomes, and tubers. The air spaces had lysed aerenchyma in the
   roots, leaves, and rhizomes, while schizogenous aerenchyma was observed
   in the culms. Neither lysed nor schizogenous aerenchyma was found in the
   tubers. C. rotundus is a typical C4 species with Kranz anatomy;
   chloroplasts were present in the inner sheaths and parenchymatous
   sheaths. Thus, our analyses identified several anatomical and
   histochemical features that may facilitate the adaptive success of C.
   rotundus in amphibious environments.},

Title = {Importance of the vertical gradient in the variation of epiphyte
   community structure in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Epiphytes are strongly affected by the microclimate of the forest
   canopy. Therefore, understanding how microclimatic changes are related
   to the functional characteristics of taxa and the patterns of
   communities is essential. Our objective was to examine the
   stratification of the epiphyte community along the vertical gradient of
   the forests and to investigate whether the pattern of species
   distribution in the canopy height zones is similar among forests with
   different characteristics and between the families of epiphytic plants.
   The study was carried out in the Atlantic Forest of Ilha Grande, in
   southeastern Brazil, where we recorded 76 species. The highest richness
   and abundance were found on tree trunks. The high crown had less
   diversity and a characteristic set of species. The vertical
   stratification pattern was similar across forests with different
   phytophysiognomies. The main epiphytic families exhibited different
   patterns of diversity along the canopy. The highest richness of Araceae
   occurred in the trunk zones, while Polypodiaceae, Bromeliaceae, and
   Orchidaceae were more diverse in the trunk and inner crown, and
   Cactaceae were more diverse in the inner crown. Tree height zones select
   epiphytic taxa with distinct characteristics according to the
   fundamental conditions for their survival and, therefore, we suggest
   that the ecological niche theory is adequate to explain the assembly of
   epiphytic communities at a local scale.},

   Mimosa tenuiflora-Lopesia mimosae interaction in Caatinga environment},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Caatinga environment tends to impose constraints on the phenology and
   development of the host plants and their associated galls. Phenological
   synchronism in Mimosa tenuiflora-Lopesia mimosae system, and anatomical,
   cyto-metric, and immunocytochemical analyzes reveal strategies of the
   gall survivorship in Caatinga. As phenological strategies, the peak of
   young galls synchronizes with leaf sprouting in the rainy season, and
   the reproductive phase is concomitant to gall senescence in the dry
   season. As structural strategies, the reorganization and the
   compartmentalization of gall tissues assist gall development in response
   to environmental constraints, and the predominance of periclinal cell
   elongation determined the gall bivalve shape. The distribution of
   pectins, gly-coproteins, and hemicelluloses modulate cell walls toward
   favoring gall resistance to drought stress. The homogalacturonans confer
   high porosity to the cell walls of the typical nutritive tissue. The
   galactans and ara-binans confer flexibility to the cell walls of the
   common storage tissue favoring tolerance to drought. The
   xylogalacturonans and heteromannans in the cell walls of the typical
   nutritive tissue are associated with nutritive reserves directed to the
   galling insect. The phenological synchronism, modulation of leaf tissues
   and cell wall components confer water and nutritional resources to the
   Lopesia mimosae microenvironment, the gall.},

Title = {Pollen collection by honey bee hives in almond orchards indicate diverse
   diets},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Almond is one of the world's most economically valuable crops and many
   varieties require cross pollination for optimal fruit set. For this
   reason, western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives are often placed in
   almond orchards. However, little is known about the usage of almond and
   other pollen sources by individual hives during almond bloom. Here, we
   investigated the timing, identity and quantity of pollen collection
   associated with almond floral abundance and spatial location of
   individual hives by sampling 440 individual pollen tray samples and
   counting 45,072 pollen grains from 13,200 pollen pellets collected from
   80 individual hives across the flowering season in Victoria,
   south-eastern Australia. A large proportion of hives collected nonalmond
   pollen in addition to almond pollen (63/80 = 79\%). The weight of almond
   pollen collected by the hives at each sampling time was positively
   related to the number of concurrently open almond flowers. However,
   non-almond pollen richness and abundance was not related to the number
   of almond flowers but had a positive relationship with the weight of
   almond pollen collected. There was no relationship between the distance
   among hives and identity of pollen collected. Yet, three plant families
   in the study area were found to account for a high percentage of the
   non-almond pollen collected, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae.
   Understanding crop and non-crop pollen collection could inform honey bee
   diet needs and identify the plant species of importance to inform best
   practice bee management during almond flowering. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Title = {Aggregative movement of mesophyll chloroplasts occurs in a wide variety
   of C-4 plant species br},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {C4 plants have two types of photosynthetic cells, mesophyll (M) and
   bundle sheath (BS) cells with different subcellular structures. In C4
   plants, maize and finger millet, the chloroplasts of M cells are
   normally distributed toward the periphery but redistribute toward the BS
   cell side in response to environmental stresses. This directional
   movement of M chloroplasts is called aggregative movement, of which
   physiological significance remains unknown. Furthermore, few C4 plant
   species have been examined for aggregative movement, and it has not been
   established whether this is a common phenomenon in C4 plants. Hence,
   this study aims to investigate whether the aggregative movement is
   widely observed and diverse in C4 plants. Thirty-six monocotyledonous
   and dicotyledonous C4 plant species (Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae,
   and Portulaceae) including all three C4 subtypes were examined. Leaf
   segments were infiltrated with the abscisic acid solution and irradiated
   with blue light to induce aggregative movement of M chloroplasts.
   Aggregative movement of M chloroplasts was observed in 35 C4 species
   across 11 evolutionary lineages. The degree of aggregative movement was
   significantly greater in monocots than that in eudicots;
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase subtype C4 plants showed significantly
   greater aggregative movement than NADP-ME type C4 plants. The
   aggregative movements would be broadly shared stress responses in C4
   plants. The differences in the degree of aggregative movement could be
   related to morphological and physiological differences between monocots
   and eudicots, and among C4 subtypes.},

Title = {Impact of white mistletoe (Viscum album ssp. abietis) infection severity
   on morphology, anatomy and photosynthetic pigment content of the needles
   of cilicican fir (Abies cilicica)},
Journal = {FLORA},

Abstract = {White mistletoe (Viscum album ssp. abietis, Santalaceae) is a
   hemi-parasitic plant and is regarded as one of the most significant
   biotic factors affecting fir forests. Mistletoe affects its host in many
   ways, including changes in leaf development. This paper studies and
   quantifies the effect of white mistletoe on morphological, anatomical
   traits and photosynthetic pigment content of cilicican fir (Abies
   cilicica (Antoine \& Kotschy) Carrie`re, Pinaceae) needles growing on
   uninfected branches of infected and uninfected trees in relation to
   varying mistletoe infection severity. Morphological (needle length and
   width, area and weight, and specific leaf area), anatomical (needle
   width and thickness, epidermis and central vein thickness, needle cross
   sectional and mesophyll area, epidermis plus hypodermis and central vein
   area, xylem and phloem area, transfusion and resin duct area), stomatal
   (number of stomata rows, stomatal band width, stomata length and
   density) traits and photosynthetic pigment content (chlorophyll a and b,
   total chlorophyll (a+b), total carotenoid) were measured in one-year-old
   needles growing on uninfected branches from a total of 48 cilicican fir
   trees. Of the trees, 10 were uninfected, 13 lightly infected, 14
   moderately infected and 11 severely infected. The results indicated that
   morphological dimension of needles decreased steadily with increasing
   infection severity. Stomatal size of needles decreased gradually while
   stomatal density increased gradually with increasing infection severity.
   Reduced anatomical dimension were only evident in needles from moderate
   and severe infection classes, while chlorophyll content decreased in
   only severely infected trees.},

Abstract = {Differences in the arrangement of floral whorls in enantiostylous
   species may affect the levels of between the sexual organs of floral
   morphs and the functionality of the enantiostyly. In this study, we
   investigate enantiostyly in Senna rugosa, evaluating the variation in
   the position of sexual organs. Using spatial measures, we investigated
   the level of herkogamy and used the inaccuracy index to describe
   reciprocity between stigmas and anthers of different floral types and
   within the same floral type. We investigated the proportion of floral
   types within individuals of the population based on the position of the
   curved the stigma. Stigmas of left-styled flowers are more likely to
   capture inter-morph pollen, whereas stigmas styled flowers may receive
   greater proportions of intra-morph pollen. Horizontal distance was most
   for the non-overlap of the sexual organs, whereas height was the measure
   that contributed most to imity. Individuals showed a similar proportion
   of floral types. However, from a morpho-functional perspective, the
   proportion of flowers differed, with a lower proportion of functionally
   left-styled flowers. Both floral have functionally right-, left-, and
   central-styled flowers. Our study is the first report of a possible
   reproductive functions in pollen uptake between opposite floral types, a
   mechanism that may have provide reproductive assurance, and the second
   report of the presence of functionally central styles subtribe
   Cassiinae, which may be related to an increase in the pollen-capturing
   surface area on the body.},

Title = {Single large AND several small habitat patches: A community perspective
   on their importance for biodiversity},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {16-27},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The debate whether single large or several small (SLOSS) patches benefit
   biodiversity has existed for decades, but recent literature provides
   increasing evidence for the importance of small habitats. Possible
   beneficial mechanisms include reduced presence of preda-tors and
   competitors in small habitat areas or specific functions such as
   stepping stones for dispersal. Given the increasing amount of studies
   highlighting individual behavioral differences that may influence these
   functions, we hypothesize that the advantage of small versus large
   habitat patches not only depends on patch functionality but also on the
   presence of animal personalities (i.e., risk-tolerant vs. risk-averse).
   Using an individual-based, spatially-explicit community model, we
   analyzed the diversity of mammal communities in landscapes consisting of
   a few large habitat islands interspersed with different amounts and
   sizes of small habitat patches. Within these heterogeneous environments,
   individuals compete for resources and form home-ranges, with only
   risk-tolerant individuals using habitat edges. Results show that when
   risk-tolerant individuals exist, small patches increase species
   diversity. A strong peak occurs at approximately 20\% habitat cover in
   small patches when those small habitats are only used for foraging but
   not for breeding and home-range core position. Additional usage as
   stepping stones for juvenile dispersal further increases species
   persistence. Over-all, our results reveal that a combination of a few
   large and several small habitat patches promotes biodiversity by
   enhancing land-scape heterogeneity. Here, heterogeneity is created by
   pronounced differences in habitat functionality, increasing edge
   density, and variability in habitat use by different behavioral types.
   The finding that a combination of single large AND several small (SLASS)
   patches is needed for effective biodiversity preservation has
   implications for advancing landscape conservation. Particularly in
   struc-turally poor agricultural areas, modern technology enables precise
   management with the opportunity to create small foraging habitats by
   excluding less profitable agricultural land from cultivation.(c) 2022

Title = {Distribution, Relative Abundance, and Length of Sculpins in the Elwha
   River Watershed Following the Removal of Two Hydroelectric Dams},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Dam removal often shows positive effects for many fish species,
   especially migratory species. In contrast, information regarding the
   effects on less migratory species is lacking. The Elwha River,
   Washington had two hydroelectric dams removed from 2011 to 2014, which
   resulted in the loss of two reservoirs. Because of glacial history, the
   Elwha River system has a depauperate freshwater fish fauna, including
   just two sculpin species (coastrange sculpin {[}Cottus aleuticus] and
   prickly sculpin {[}C. asper]). Both species exhibit a similar migratory
   life history strategy, which includes a planktonic larval stage that
   drifts downstream to a nursery area (e.g., lake, large river, or
   estuary), followed by an upriver movement pattern. Due to these
   characteristics, Elwha River dam removal and loss of the reservoirs may
   have had important effects on these two sculpin species. We sampled
   sculpins with longitudinal electrofishing surveys in 2018 and 2019 to
   evaluate their current distribution, relative abundance, and body size.
   These metrics were generally similar to other river systems in the
   Pacific Northwest, with fewer and larger migratory sculpins upstream.
   Additionally, we compared our findings to pre-dam surveys. After dam
   removal, sculpins in upstream reaches were less abundant and had a
   smaller range of sizes. This suggests the population characteristics of
   sculpins in the Elwha River has changed, but it is unclear how indirect
   effects, such as anadromous salmonid (Salmonidae) increases, may
   influence their overall abundance. This study also provides a baseline
   to monitor sculpin population changes in the future.},

Title = {Floral resource distribution and fitness consequences for two solitary
   bee species in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Floral resources are crucial for wild pollinators. Identifying the
   spatio-temporal floral resource use of wild pollinators and effects of
   resource distribution on their development might help to promote them
   and their pollination services to crops in agri-cultural landscapes.We
   established populations of Osmia cornuta and Osmia bicornis, two
   solitary wild bees, in 24 agricultural landscapes with varying floral
   resource availability. Based on their pollen use, we mapped the
   landscape-scale distribution of the visited plants, estimated pooled
   specific floral resource availabilities and measured its effects on
   reproductive output.Woody semi-natural habitats such as hedgerows
   provided the majority of pollen sources for both Osmia species. Pollen
   use differed strongly between the two species. The offspring of both
   Osmia increased with availability of pooled specific pollen resources.
   In accordance with their preferred pollen types, offspring of O. cornuta
   increased with increasing cover of trees and shrubs of the Rosaceae
   family, and that of O. bicornis with increasing cover of Papaver rhoeas,
   Ranunculus acris and Quercus spp. as well as with the proximity to
   oilseed rape. In spite of their specific responses to pollen resources,
   the offspring of both species decreased with the distance to forest. The
   floral resource availability did not significantly affect the proportion
   of adult females and the weight of the offspring. As forest does not
   appear to be a main foraging habitat for both species, the benefit of
   forest proximity indicates an additional role of forest in addition to
   food availability.Specific flowering plants and forests should thus be
   conserved and enhanced to maintain and support O. cornuta, O. bicornis
   and likely other wild bee populations in agricultural landscapes. The
   combined information of land cover and detailed floral resource
   availability gives a deeper understanding into population processes in
   agricultural landscapes.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

   shade rate into CBAS on citrus Phytophthora foot rot disease (PFRD)
   intensity. The study was carried out in five citrus production basins of
   Cameroon, contrasted by ecology and rainfall regimes. A set of 33 CBAS
   plots was mapped and their species composition and vertical structure
   were determined. Field data were used to reconstruct CBAS in 3D with
   Shademotion 5.1.47 software. Using static simulations with shadow
   overlays, shade rate received by each citrus tree was calculated.
   Subsequently, citrus trees were grouped into three categories according
   to the shade rate they received: (i) full sun, with shade rate < 30\%;
   (ii) light shade with shade rate 30-70\% and, (iii) dense shade, with
   shade rate > 70\%. PFRD intensity was determined by measuring the canker
   extent relatively to the citrus crown circumference. A significant
   difference in PFRD intensity was observed between the different shade
   rates. Citrus trees receiving no shade were significantly more attacked
   by PFRD than those receiving little shade or dense shade. The
   antagonistic effect of shade was demonstrated. At the expense of factors
   related to the specific composition of the CBAS, shade, temperature,
   relative humidity and rainfall were found to be the main factors
   explaining PFRD intensity in CBAS. This study shows that microclimatic
   alterations due to the biodiversity in tropical agroforestry systems
   contribute to sustainable pest management.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Abstract = {Context Ecosystem services (ESs) are the bridge connecting natural
   capital and social development. Incorporating ESs into social-ecological
   management strategy helps to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs). However, there is currently a lack of quantitative exploration
   of the correlations between ES and SDGs, especially from a spatial
   zoning perspective. Objectives This study attempted to explore spatial
   correlations between ESs and SDGs to support sustainable landscape
   planning in Guangdong Province, China. Methods The self-organizing
   feature map neural network analysis was used to characterize the spatial
   clustering of eight types of ESs and three types of SDGs, and the
   spatial explanatory power of ESs for SDGs in different zones was
   analyzed with the application of geographical detector. Results
   Guangdong Province was divided into four zones based on spatial
   clustering: ecological regulation dominant zone (Zone 1),
   production-ecology transition zone (Zone 2), key grain production zone
   (Zone 3), and high well-being zone (Zone 4). The high ESs values were
   concentrated in the Zone 1, and the high SDGs values were concentrated
   in the Zone 4. In the Zone 1, habitat quality and soil conservation had
   high explanatory power for no poverty, while water yield and soil
   conservation had high explanatory power for zero hunger. In the Zone 2,
   water yield and habitat quality had high explanatory power for no
   poverty. In the Zone 3, grain production and tropical cyclone impact
   mitigation had high explanatory power for no poverty, while soil
   conservation had high explanatory power for zero hunger. In the Zone 4,
   grain production had high explanatory power for no poverty, while
   landscape recreation had high explanatory power for good health.
   Conclusions The spatial correlations between ESs and SDGs were obviously
   different among regions with different social-ecological backgrounds.
   When implementing SDGs-oriented sustainable landscape planning, targeted
   strategies are needed based on the correlations between ESs and SDGs in
   different regions.},

Title = {Numbers and presence of guarding dogs affect wolf and leopard predation
   on livestock in northeastern Iran},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Livestock predation can pose socio-economic impacts on rural livelihoods
   and is the main cause of retaliatory killings of carni-vores in many
   countries. Therefore, appropriate interventions to reduce livestock
   predation, lower conflict and promote coexistence are needed. Livestock
   guarding dogs have been traditionally used to reduce predation, yet
   details regarding the use of dogs, espe-cially the number of dogs per
   herd effectively required, are rarely studied. In this study, we
   assessed how the number and presence of guarding dogs in a herd can
   reduce livestock losses to leopard and wolf in corrals at night and on
   grazing grounds in day-time. Using systematic interview surveys
   (2016-2019), we documented sheep/goat losses per attack (predation
   rates) from 139 shepherds across 32 villages around Golestan National
   Park, Iran. We analysed the effects of the number of dogs, presence of
   dogs, presence of shepherds, seasons, corral quality, livestock number,
   dog size, distance to villages and distance to reserve on predation
   rates using generalized linear models. For the leopard model, dog
   presence significantly decreased (beta = -1.80, 95\% confidence interval
   -2.61 to -0.81) predation rates during day-time to 1.41 individuals per
   attack. For wolf attacks in corrals at night, predation rates
   significantly decreased (beta = -0.29, -0.54 to -0.04) with increasing
   dog numbers. Also, shepherd presence (beta = -0.56, -1.10 to -0.10) and
   herd size (0 = -0.36, -0.60 to -0.12) significantly reduced predation
   rates. In the wolf day-time model, shepherd presence significantly
   decreased (beta = -0.93, -1.74 to -0.10) predation rates. Our study
   suggests that (1) using dogs can reduce, but not eliminate, predation by
   leopards during day-time; (2) with every additional dog, predation rates
   by wolves in corrals at night are likely to decrease on average by
   25.2\%; and (3) the presence of shepherds in corrals at night and during
   day-time can reduce predation rates.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Understanding the biogeography of species in space and time is essential
   for the development of evidence-based conservation and management plans.
   In this paper we propose a biogeographical spatial modelling approach
   based on the favourability function, and developed under a fuzzy logic
   framework, to unravel the historical biogeography of the two European
   wild rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus (Oca) and
   Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus (Occ), in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We
   first reviewed published and unpublished information (PhD theses,
   scientific papers, technical reports, etc.) on the occurrence of each
   rabbit subspecies throughout the IP. We compiled data from 201 Iberian
   rabbit populations and from genetic information of 4348 rabbits that was
   used to identify subspecies. Only populations in which all rabbits
   surveyed belonged to one subspecies were considered in the modelling
   procedure. We modelled rabbit subspecies' distribution separately for
   populations in which nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences were
   available. We employed a trend surface analysis developed by logistic
   regressions, which applied the favourability function and fuzzy logic
   operations. Using our approach we indentify the expansion cores from
   which both rabbit subspecies would have expanded after isolation during
   the last glaciations. Furthermore, we reveal the possible existence of a
   competitive exclusion zone between both rabbit subspecies that may have
   prevented their further expansion. Finally, our study shows that the Oca
   subspecies is distributed in north-western areas previously attributed
   to Occ. This assessment of the actual and historical distribution of
   each rabbit subspecies may allow more specific conservation
   interventions, as the two subspecies are not just genetically distinct
   but also ecologically and behaviourally different. Our methodological
   approach could be useful in unravelling the historical biogeography of
   other lesser-known species.},

Title = {Effective hawkmoth pollination in the primarily bee-pollinated Salvia
   daiguii-an example of adaptive generalization},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Many plants exhibit floral traits that are directed to specific
   pollinator groups. Nevertheless, they can also attract less-adapted
   pollinators and gain benefits under certain conditions, resulting in
   adapted generalization. This may be the case in Salvia daiguii
   (Lamiaceae), an endangered, bee-pollinated species native to the
   Tianmenshan National Forest Park, China. The flower appears
   phenotypically specialized to bees but is also visited by Macroglossum
   bombylans. In the present study, we test whether the moth is an
   effective pollinator of S. daiguii. We quantified and compared the
   frequency of flower visits by bees and moths and the number of pollen
   grains deposited on the stigma after a single visit. We also recorded
   the movements of pistils and stamens of S. daiguii and the behavior of
   the hawkmoth at the flowers. We found that Apis cerana was the
   predominant pollinator, depositing an average of 4.74 pollen grains on
   the stigma after a single visit. However, as the style bends downward
   during anthesis and reaches the same level as the anthers, Macroglossum
   individuals hovering around the flowers were also able to effectively
   transfer pollen to the stigma. On average, 1.38 pollen grains were
   deposited on the stigma during a single visit. We demonstrate for the
   first time that the hawkmoth is an effective secondary pollinator in the
   primarily bee-pollinated S. daiguii. Style bending allows a nectar thief
   to become a secondary pollinator. The extent of pollinator
   generalization is thus increased without affecting the fundamental
   phenotype adapted to bees as the main pollinators.},

Abstract = {Context Habitat loss is a major factor influencing declines in landscape
   connectivity for many species, but forest patch configuration and
   changes in matrix permeability can also represent important drivers. An
   evaluation of which of these factors are predominant is key to guiding
   landscape planning at a regional scale. Objectives We aimed to quantify
   the loss of jaguar (Panthera onca) habitat connectivity and to analyse
   the drivers behind this process in the Atlantic Forest. Methods We
   analysed trends in jaguar habitat connectivity between 1973 and 2015 in
   the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest and the three countries that comprise
   the eco-region (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay). We used graph-based
   indices and jaguar movement data to evaluate changes in forest area,
   forest patch configuration and matrix permeability. Results Jaguar
   habitat connectivity decreased throughout the entire period, with a loss
   of up to 93\% of connectivity. Changes in forest patch configuration and
   forest area loss were the main drivers of this trend, but the effect of
   decreased matrix permeability was also significant. These processes
   together largely increased the negative effect of forest area declines
   on jaguar habitat connectivity. Connectivity trends for the three
   countries in the study area were negative, with the highest forest
   decline in Paraguay and Brazil compared to Argentina. Conclusions
   Analysing landscape dynamics using metrics that go beyond measuring net
   forest area is key when assessing landscape connectivity for jaguars.
   Future studies evaluating landscape connectivity should incorporate
   habitat patch configuration and matrix permeability in addition to
   forest loss, aspects that should also be considered when undertaking
   habitat restoration measures.},

Abstract = {Context Urbanization and its associated impacts on biodiversity are
   increasing globally. There is a need to enhance our understanding of
   species responses to inform strategies for sustainable urbanization.
   Objectives Three extensive bird monitoring campaigns took place over the
   last three decades in the city of Naples, Italy, providing a
   comprehensive longitudinal dataset to analyse occurrence trends of urban
   birds. We aimed to assess both species-specific and assemblage-level
   changes in urban birds according to land cover dynamics. Methods We
   extracted bird data for the periods 1990-95, 2000-05, and 2014-18, and
   explored the spatial and temporal relationships between bird
   presence/avian assemblage composition, and land cover variation. Results
   The species richness of breeding birds remained stable over time,
   despite a notable species turnover, influenced by changes in the
   species' key land cover classes. Species associated with forest and
   urban land cover tended to colonise the area, while those dependent on
   abandoned and cultivated areas decreased or went locally extinct. Birds
   changed their degree of dependence upon their key habitat type over
   time, as species from marginal and open habitat types needed larger
   amounts of habitat to persist within the area, while forest species
   showed an opposite trend. Conclusions Habitat-driven changes in avian
   assemblages within the urban landscape led to an increase in
   forest-associated species, and a decrease in birds associated with
   declining habitat types. Our findings may inform urban planning to
   promote more wildlife-friendly cities, which for our study area should
   prioritise open and marginal habitats.},

Abstract = {Context Grasslands of the North American Great Plains are among the
   world's most imperiled ecosystems. Determining landscapes at risk of
   grassland loss will benefit grassland conservation programs by enabling
   prioritization of parcels for acquisition.
   Objectives We hypothesized that gradients in the amount of grass in
   local landscapes resulting from past conversion would be a useful
   predictor of future conversion. We developed simple, intuitive models
   predicting grassland conversion across the United States northern Great
   Plains.
   Methods We used the grassland/herbaceous, pasture/hay, and emergent
   herbaceous wetland classes from the National Land Cover Database to
   evaluate grassland loss from 2001 to 2016. We classified the amount of
   grass in 13.2-km(2) landscapes in 2001 into percentage bins and used
   generalized additive models to relate these values to the total and
   proportion of grassland lost, by percentage bin. We applied models to
   landcover data to create spatial surfaces predicting conversion.
   Results Area of grass lost was highest in 40-60\% grass bins, except for
   heavily cropped states, where highest losses occurred in 10-20\% grass
   bins. Percentage of grass in local landscapes was generally a strong
   predictor of state-level total grassland loss and proportion of
   grassland lost. Predicted conversion for remaining grasslands varied
   within and among states.
   Conclusion The amount of grass in local landscapes can be a useful
   indicator of grassland conversion. Our simple models complement species
   distribution models used to guide conservation in the region.
   Mechanistic models of conversion can be improved by including amount of
   grass in local landscapes.},

Title = {Evaluating climate-driven fallowing for ecological connectivity of
   species at risk},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3059-3077},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Climate change and agricultural land use change are modifying
   the configuration of natural lands within agricultural landscapes,
   impacting species' ability to move freely between remaining (semi-)
   natural areas. Working lands are inherently costly to set aside for
   biodiversity, making the establishment of additional permanent reserves
   that facilitate connectivity challenging. Yet, even temporary increases
   in connectivity may enable increased gene flow with long-term benefits
   for species health and persistence.
   Objectives Here we explore the potential for dynamic conservation
   reserves, in the form of either temporarily or semi-permanently fallowed
   croplands, to increase connectivity in intensive agricultural regions.
   Methods We evaluate the potential for fallowed lands to facilitate
   functional habitat connectivity for an at-risk species in the San
   Joaquin Valley, an intensive agricultural landscape in California, USA.
   We perform landscape connectivity analyses to examine how
   drought-induced fallowing between 2011 and 2017 may have impacted
   connectivity within Kern County for the endangered San Joaquin kit fox
   (Vulpes macrotis mutica).
   Results We found that an increase in fallowed lands from 2011 to
   2015/2017 in Kern County likely corresponded to increased functional
   connectivity for the kit fox, including significant decreases in
   cumulative cost to distance traveled (-0.8 to 18\% and 0.3 to 12.2\% in
   2015/2017 respective to 2011 across different model scenarios). These
   significant reductions indicate that cumulative energy costs incurred by
   kit foxes traveling between core habitats likely decreased with an
   increase in fallowing, with the estimated benefits from semi-permanently
   fallowed lands on average 2.4 times greater than for more temporarily
   fallowed lands.
   Conclusions Our results highlight that opportunistic and dynamic
   conservation actions have the potential to reduce conflict between
   biodiversity preservation and agricultural production in working
   landscapes by increasing landscape connectivity via temporarily or
   semi-permanently fallowed parcels. Agri-environmental programs
   incentivizing the creation of dynamic, fallowing-based reserves could
   help landowners manage reduced groundwater availability while improving
   species' mobility in the face of climate change.},

   compared avian diversity in beach, saltmarsh, shrub, a Juniperus

   forest at nearby Mashomack Preserve. Maritime forest was highest in bird
   species richness followed by saltmarsh, interior forest, shrub, and
   beach. Habitat variables best explaining avian species richness were
   sand cover, vegetation cover, visibility, and height of nearest
   vegetation. The peninsular shape of the maritime forest supported
   greater edge habitat compared to the interior forest, encouraging
   greater avian diversity. This study provides baseline information for

Abstract = {ContextClimate and land use changes often interact, yet our ability to
   predict their combined effects on biodiversity is currently limited. In
   particular, the combined effects of climate and land use on key
   ecosystem dynamics, such as disturbance regimes, that shape biodiversity
   across large spatial scales, are poorly understood. ObjectivesWe assess
   how indirect climate-land use interactions influence disturbance regimes
   by examining the mechanistic pathways by which climate and proximity to
   cropland interact to shape fire size in a West African grassland
   ecosystem, the W-Arly-Pendjari transboundary protected area complex.
   MethodsWe use remotely sensed indicators of burned area, rainfall,
   cropland distribution, and vegetation dynamics to test two spatially
   explicit hypotheses about the interaction between climate and land use
   effects on fire dynamics. ResultsWe demonstrate that in areas where wet
   season grass production (which is driven by rainfall) is higher, fires
   are larger, but that this relationship depends on the distance to
   cropland. Close to cropland, environmental drivers of fire size (wet
   season grass production, and progressive loss of fire fuel during the
   fire season) have little effect on fire size, as fuel breaks induced by
   cropland limit fire size. ConclusionOur results suggest that the extent
   to which climate factors control fire dynamics in this African grassland
   depends on the spatial distribution of land use. More broadly,
   considering the relative spatial distributions of interacting stressors
   may be key to improving predictions of their combined impacts on
   ecosystem functioning.},

Title = {Interpolating resident attitudes toward exurban roadside forest
   management},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Context Knowledge about spatial patterns of human dimensions data within
   landscape ecology is nascent despite its importance in natural resources
   management. We explored this topic within the context of utility
   roadside forest management, a complex situation involving ecological,
   cultural, and aesthetic aspects of forests and reliable power.
   Objectives We applied spatial interpolation to investigate patterns of
   human attitudes toward roadside vegetation management data across an
   exurban landscape. Methods Mail surveys (n = 1962) were used to collect
   social science data from residents in four areas of Connecticut, USA.
   For each area, three attitudes variables were evaluated for spatial
   autocorrelation using Moran's I statistic. Based on identified
   autocorrelation distance or scale, attitudes were interpolated using
   inverse distance weighting. Model validation of interpolated surfaces
   was completed using root mean square error. Results Significant spatial
   autocorrelation was present for five of 12 study area-attitude pairings
   (one focused on professionalism; two focused on safety; three focused on
   tradeoffs between reliable power and maintaining trees) at distances
   ranging from 200 to 2400 m. Accuracy of interpolations varied among
   study areas, suggesting that the choice of spatial scale of analysis
   influenced model results. Conclusions Social processes influencing
   attitudes were spatially heterogeneous, existing at disparate scales for
   the same variables in different locations. Collectively, ``enough{''}
   roadside forest may exist to ameliorate intermittent vegetation
   management aesthetically, yet underlying social processes influencing
   roadside forest outcomes likely are not mutually exclusive.
   Interpolation assumptions often applied toward ecological studies did
   not work well for social processes studied in this analysis.},

Abstract = {Covariation among discrete phenotypes can arise due to selection for
   shared functions, and/or shared genetic and developmental underpinnings.
   The consequences of such phenotypic integration are far-reaching and can
   act to either facilitate or limit morphological variation. The
   vertebrate brain is known to act as an ``organizer{''} of craniofacial
   development, secreting morphogens that can affect the shape of the
   growing neurocranium, consistent with roles for pleiotropy in
   brain-neurocranium covariation. Here, we test this hypothesis in cichlid
   fishes by first examining the degree of shape integration between the
   brain and the neurocranium using three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics in an F-5 hybrid population, and then genetically mapping
   trait covariation using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We
   observe shape associations between the brain and the neurocranium, a
   pattern that holds even when we assess associations between the brain
   and constituent parts of the neurocranium: the rostrum and braincase. We
   also recover robust genetic signals for both hard- and soft-tissue
   traits and identify a genomic region where QTL for the brain and
   braincase overlap, implicating a role for pleiotropy in patterning trait
   covariation. Fine mapping of the overlapping genomic region identifies a
   candidate gene, notch1a, which is known to be involved in patterning
   skeletal and neural tissues during development. Taken together, these
   data offer a genetic hypothesis for brain-neurocranium covariation, as
   well as a potential mechanism by which behavioral shifts may
   simultaneously drive rapid change in neuroanatomy and craniofacial
   morphology.},

Abstract = {Context Conservation scientists recommend maintaining and restoring
   ecological connectivity to sustain biodiversity in the face of land-use
   and climate change. Alternative connectivity assessments conducted at
   multiple spatial scales are needed to understand consequences of varying
   assumptions and for use in multi-scale conservation planning. Objectives
   We compared mapped output from different model scenarios conducted to
   identify areas important for ecological connectivity across North
   America. We asked how areas important for connectivity vary with spatial
   scale and assumptions regarding the way in which human modification
   affects landscape resistance. Methods We conducted a factorial
   experiment using omnidirectional connectivity analyses across North
   America where we crossed ``treatments{''} represented by four moving
   window sizes and three resistance surfaces. The three resistance
   surfaces represent a gradient in species' sensitivity to human
   modification. Results Maps of connectivity importance varied among
   scenarios. The effects of moving window size were more conspicuous than
   effects of different resistance surfaces. Outputs from small moving
   windows revealed mottled patterns of connectivity importance, while
   outputs from larger moving windows revealed broad swaths of connectivity
   importance across mountainous and boreal areas of North America.
   Patterns of connectivity importance tended to be more channelized from
   resistance surfaces produced to represent more human-sensitive species
   and more diffuse from resistance surfaces produced to represent more
   human-tolerant species. Conclusions Our scenarios and output represent
   alternative hypotheses and predictions about how multiple species may
   move in response to varying degrees of human modification. Our output
   can be compared to species-specific models to investigate which of our
   scenarios best matches observed movements of organisms. Our output can
   also be used as coarse-filter and multi-scale connectivity assessments
   for conservation plans. Notably, our outputs highlight the importance of
   small and isolated fragments of relatively natural land while
   simultaneously identifying broad regions important for maintaining
   connectivity across natural areas of North America.},

Abstract = {Context Accurate mapping of mountain agriculture is important for both a
   food-security and an environmental degradation perspective. Remote
   sensing provides a large and diverse data source for these complex
   regions and enables large-scale mapping of mountain agriculture.
   However, obtaining good mapping accuracy is challenging in mountain
   terrain. Objectives The main objective is to analyse the effect of
   mapping scale or resolution, landscape heterogeneity and terrain
   complexity on the accuracy of agriculture extraction in the
   Western-Himalayan region. Methods A similarity-based technique was
   applied on time-series MODIS NDVI for extracting agriculture area at 250
   m, 500 m and 1000 m resolution. Further, Pareto boundary-based accuracy
   was estimated from reference high-resolution agriculture data. The
   agriculture area extracted at multiple scales was utilized to compute
   landscape heterogeneity indicators, and ASTER DEM was used to estimate
   the terrain complexity indicators. Finally, the dependency of mapping
   accuracy on landscape heterogeneity and terrain complexity were analyzed
   through linear regression. Results Mapping accuracy gradually decreases
   with coarseness of scale mainly due to higher omission error. Spatial
   visualization of landscape heterogeneity and mapping accuracy reveals
   that higher patch fragmentation increases omission error causing lower
   accuracy. Regression analysis revealed that heterogeneity has a negative
   relationship with mapping accuracy such that higher fragmentation lowers
   the accuracy. Terrain complexity significantly (p < 0.05) influences the
   mapping accuracy only at 250 m resolution. Conclusion Analysis explains
   that the effect of scale on mapping accuracy for mountain agriculture
   mapping is mainly controlled by landscape heterogeneity such that patch
   fragmentation is the cause for introducing negative bias towards mapping
   accuracy with the coarseness of resolution.},

Title = {Landscape-level honey bee hive density, instead of field-level hive
   density, enhances honey bee visitation in blueberry},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},

Volume = {38},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {ContextTo date, managing honey bees and wild bees within crop fields
   remains challenging. Landscape structure is often overlooked when
   studying the pollination contribution of honey bees. Increasing our
   understanding on how to predict honey bee visitation in crops is crucial
   for sustainable management of agroecosystems. ObjectivesWith this study
   we investigated which landscape and field-level variables determine
   honey bee and wild bee visitation, and whether honey bee or wild bee
   visitation influence crop pollination. MethodsSixteen highbush blueberry
   fields were surveyed for honey bees, wild bees, and crop pollination in
   Washington, USA. Additionally, within a radius of 1000 m around each
   field all honey bee hives were located and the surrounding landscape was
   characterized. ResultsHoney bee hive numbers in the landscape positively
   correlate with the proportion of blueberry in the landscape. Honey bee
   visitation was best predicted by landscape-level hive density within a
   radius of 1000 m, whereas semi-natural habitat and field-level hive
   density did not impact honey bee visitation. The amount of semi-natural
   habitat and blueberry within a radius of 1000 m had a positive and
   negative impact, respectively, on wild bee visitation. Honey bee
   visitation had a positive effect on blueberry seed set. ConclusionWe
   conclude that honey bee visitation is determined by the number of honey
   bee hives in the surrounding landscape. Hence, field-level hive density
   recommendations miss contributions from other hives in the landscape.
   Furthermore, semi-natural habitat did not impact honey bee visitation
   and contributes to diversifying pollinator diets and provides wild bee
   habitat.},

Abstract = {Among social insects, army ants are exceptional in their voracious
   coordinated predation, nomadic life history and highly specialized
   wingless queens: the synthesis of these remarkable traits is referred to
   as the army ant syndrome. Despite molecular evidence that the army ant
   syndrome evolved twice during the mid-Cenozoic, once in the Neotropics
   and once in the Afrotropics, fossil army ants are markedly scarce,
   comprising a single known species from the Caribbean 16 Ma. Here we
   report the oldest army ant fossil and the first from the Eastern
   Hemisphere (EH), Dissimulodorylus perseus, preserved in Baltic amber
   dated to the Eocene. Using a combined morphological and molecular ultra
   conserved elements dataset spanning doryline lineages, we find that D.
   perseus is nested among extant EH army ants with affinities to Dorylus.
   Army ants are characterized by limited extant diversification throughout
   most of the Cenozoic; the discovery of D. perseus suggests an unexpected
   diversity of now-extinct army ant lineages in the Cenozoic, some of
   which were present in Continental Europe.},

Title = {Selection on embryonic haemoglobin in an elevational generalist songbird},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Animals developing at high elevation experience a suite of environmental
   challenges, most notably the low partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in
   ambient air. In low PO2, bird species with high-elevation ancestry
   consistently demonstrate higher hatching success than lowland
   counterparts, suggesting highland birds are adapted to restricted O-2
   (hypoxia) in early development. Haemoglobin (Hb), the critical
   oxygen-transport protein, is a likely target of PO2-related selection
   across ontogeny since Hb isoforms expressed at distinct developmental
   stages demonstrate different O-2 affinities. To test if Hb function is
   under PO2-related selection at different ontogenetic stages, we sampled
   a songbird, the hooded siskin (Spinus magellanicus), across two
   approximately 4000 m elevational transects. We sequenced all of the loci
   that encode avian Hb isoforms, and tested for signatures of spatially
   varying selection by comparing divergence patterns in Hb loci to other
   loci sampled across the genome. We found strong signatures of
   diversifying selection at non-synonymous sites in loci that contribute
   to embryonic (alpha(pi), beta(H)) and definitive (beta(A)) Hb isoforms.
   This is the first evidence for selection on embryonic haemoglobin in
   high-elevation Neoaves. We conclude that selection on Hb function at
   brief, but critical stages of ontogeny may be a vital component to high
   elevation adaptation in birds.},

   reproductive behaviours in the dung beetle Phanaeus vindex},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Temperature profoundly impacts insect development, but plasticity of
   reproductive behaviours may mediate the impacts of temperature change on
   earlier life stages. Few studies have examined the potential for adult
   behavioural plasticity to buffer offspring from the warmer, more
   variable temperatures associated with climate change. We used a field
   manipulation to examine whether the dung beetle Phanaeus vindex alters
   breeding behaviours in response to temperature changes and whether
   behavioural shifts protect offspring from temperature changes. Dung
   beetles lay eggs inside brood balls made of dung that are buried
   underground. Brood ball depth impacts the temperatures offspring
   experience with consequences for development. We placed adult females in
   either control or greenhouse treatments that simultaneously increased
   temperature mean and variance. We found that females in greenhouse
   treatments produced more brood balls that were smaller and buried deeper
   than controls, suggesting brood ball number or burial depth may come at
   a cost to brood ball size, which can impact offspring nutrition. Despite
   being buried deeper, brood balls from the greenhouse treatment
   experienced warmer mean temperatures but similar amplitudes of
   temperature fluctuation relative to controls. Our findings suggest adult
   behaviours may partially buffer developing offspring from temperature
   changes.},

Title = {Evidence that gecko setae are coated with an ordered nanometre-thin
   lipid film},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The fascinating adhesion of gecko to virtually any material has been
   related to surface interactions of myriads of spatula at the tips of
   gecko feet. Surprisingly, the molecular details of the surface chemistry
   of gecko adhesion are still largely unknown. Lipids have been identified
   within gecko adhesive pads. However, the location of the lipids, the
   extent to which spatula are coated with lipids, and how the lipids are
   structured are still open questions. Lipids can modulate adhesion
   properties and surface hydrophobicity and may play an important role in
   adhesion. We have therefore studied the molecular structure of lipids at
   spatula surfaces using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
   imaging. We provide evidence that a nanometre-thin layer of lipids is
   present at the spatula surfaces of the tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) and
   that the lipids form ordered, densely packed layers. Such dense, thin
   lipid layers can effectively protect the spatula proteins from
   dehydration by forming a barrier against water evaporation. Lipids can
   also render surfaces hydrophobic and thereby support the gecko adhesive
   system by enhancement of hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions with
   surfaces.},

Title = {Monitoring changes in landscape structure in the
   Adirondack-to-Laurentians (A2L) transboundary wildlife linkage between
   1992 and 2018: Identifying priority areas for conservation and
   restoration},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context Although many species have transboundary geographic ranges, most
   conservation initiatives do not cross political boundaries. The
   landscape between the Adirondack Mountains in New York and the
   Laurentian Mountains in Quebec includes one of three potential
   north-south transboundary wildlife movement linkages that connect
   wilderness areas in northeastern USA and southeastern Canada. Although
   this region still maintains habitats of high ecological integrity and
   biodiversity, increasing land-cover changes and fragmentation are
   putting landscape connectivity at risk. Objectives We measured changes
   in landscape composition and configuration within the
   Adirondack-to-Laurentians transboundary wildlife linkage (A2L) between
   1992 and 2018 to identify priority areas for conservation and
   restoration. Methods Land-cover change was calculated by measuring area
   and proportion of land-cover classes, and landscape fragmentation was
   determined by measuring patch number, mean patch size, the effective
   mesh size, and road density, at three spatial scales and four
   fragmentation geometries (i.e., combinations of fragmenting elements).
   Results Extensive changes in land-cover and landscape fragmentation
   occurred within the A2L between 1992 and 2018. Forest areas declined by
   1363 km(2) and wetlands declined by 1365 km(2) (69\%). This was most
   pronounced in the Quebec portion of the A2L where wetland areas declined
   by 872 km(2) (88.5\%). Forest areas in the Quebec portion experienced
   the greatest amount of fragmentation with a m(eff\_CUT) decline of
   3262.5 km(2) (58.5\%) since 2000. Conclusions Coordinated and
   collaborative transboundary conservation efforts help improve protection
   of species with transboundary ranges. Monitoring of land-cover changes
   and landscape fragmentation is an effective way to identify priority
   areas for conservation and support transboundary coordination.
   Strengthening conservation strategies that enhance landscape
   connectivity and protect ecosystems at the local level will help achieve
   post-2020 biodiversity commitments at the national and transboundary
   levels.},

Abstract = {Context Landscape ecologists have long realized the importance of scale
   when studying spatial patterns and the need for a science of scaling.
   Remotely sensed data, a key component of a landscape ecologist's toolbox
   used to study spatial patterns, often requires scaling to meet study
   requirements. Objectives This paper reviews methods for scaling remote
   sensing-based data, with a specific focus on spatial pattern analysis,
   and distills the numerous approaches based on data type. It also
   discusses knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods Key papers were
   identified through a systematic review of the literature. Trends,
   developments, and key methods for scaling remotely sensed data and
   spatial products derived from these data were identified and synthesized
   to detail the general progression of a science of scaling in landscape
   ecology. Results Upscaling both continuous and categorical data can
   oversimplify data, creating challenges for spatial pattern analysis.
   Object-based and neighborhood approaches can help, and since patch
   boundaries are more likely to align with objects than pixels, these may
   be better options for landscape ecologists. Many downscaling methods
   exist, but these approaches are not being widely employed for spatial
   pattern analysis. Conclusions A diverse range of scaling methods are
   available to landscape ecologists, but work remains to integrate them
   into spatial pattern analysis. Moving forward, advances in computer
   science and engineering should be explored and cross-disciplinary
   research encouraged to further the science of scaling remotely sensed
   data.},

Title = {Serotiny as a reproductive strategy in the specially protected species
   Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {361-368},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Plant species with aerial seed banks are commonly referred to as
   ``serotinous,{''} an adaptation in which seed release happens in
   response to an environmental trigger. Individuals of Ariocarpus
   kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae), a specially protected species, store some
   seeds on the plant over 1 year. We examined the seed retention time, the
   release mechanism, and the germination behavior of this species in
   Central Mexico. Flowers produced in a population of A. kotschoubeyanus
   were monitored, and the number of fruits retained or expelled was
   determined to calculate the serotiny degree (the number of seeds
   retained in the tubercules of the plant divided by the total number of
   seeds produced per plant). The seed retention in previous years was
   estimated for 30 individuals. The dynamics of retained seeds in the
   mother plant (seed age in ``rings{''}) were determined from the annual
   average production of tubercules per individual, using observations for
   5 years. A germination test employing the seeds collected from recently
   formed fruits and those obtained from different rings was conducted. We
   observed that 86.6\% of the plants showed seed retention (aerial seed
   bank) in some ring of the aerial stems. The serotiny degree was 37.3,
   having 32.68 seeds per plant. Seeds retained in the ``rings{''} from 1-
   to 24-year-old plants had a higher germination proportion (between 0.40
   and 0.73) than fresh seeds (0.13). Seeds increase their germination
   proportion with age; thus, seed retention by tubercules (serotiny)
   represents a reproductive strategy to conserve germplasm until favorable
   conditions to germinate are present.},

Abstract = {Context Treeless areas in forested landscapes are an enduring ecological
   puzzle globally. A fire-mediated alternative stable state (FMASS) model
   has been proposed to explain mosaics of forest and sedgeland in
   Tasmania, whereby shifts in fire frequency change vegetation and soil
   patterns. This model is controversial, and a key step in proving it
   demands elucidating post-fire vegetation dynamics at landscape-scales
   and over historical timeframes. Objectives To quantify historical
   changes in extent of a large sedgeland patch surrounded by tall
   Eucalyptus forest and evaluate post-fire recovery after a large wildfire
   burned the area in 2019. Methods We mapped historical vegetation changes
   by analysing sequences of aerial photography from 1947 to 2010, and in
   2020 used UAS LiDAR to geolocate the current forest boundary. Satellite
   imagery, field measures of char: canopy height ratio, and stem mortality
   were used to gauge fire severity, while vegetative and seedling
   regeneration were used to assess post-fire recovery. Results
   Forest-sedgeland boundaries were stable over the 73-year period.
   Sedgeland and scrub communities experienced high severity fires,
   reflecting their low stature compared to taller forest, which suffered
   minimal canopy impact. The dominant sedge and tree species in the three
   communities were post-fire resprouters, resulting in rapid recovery of
   vegetation structure, with prolific seeding of species killed by the
   fire. Conclusion Forest-sedgeland boundaries in western Tasmania are
   resilient to fire because of keystone resprouter species, and
   geographically stable in historical time frames, a finding inconsistent
   with the FMASS model. Our study contributes to global question of
   treeless area in climate zones suitable for forest.},

Abstract = {Many studies of rodents rely on the use of live trapping. Comparative
   studies of trap type provide researchers with information that can
   inform their trapping design, yet relatively few comparative studies
   include economical mesh traps, such as Fitch traps. I compared the
   effectivess of Sherman box traps and Fitch mesh traps for rodent
   sampling in a grassland ecosystem. Between 2016 and 2017, I set 120 trap
   stations with both Fitch and Sherman traps for a total of 6000 trap
   nights at a single tallgrass prairie-restoration site in northern
   Illinois. I compared trap effectivess overall and for each species
   captured. Fitch traps were significantly better at capturing ground
   squirrels than Sherman traps and comparable to Sherman traps at
   capturing voles and jumping mice. These results demonstrate Fitch traps
   provide a viable alternative to Sherman traps for sampling at this
   location and indicate they should be considered in future comparative
   studies to further assess their effectiveness, especially in grasslands.},

Abstract = {Peromyscus leucopus (White-Footed Deermouse) and Peromyscus maniculatus
   ( North American Deermouse) are 2 widespread rodent species in North
   America, with North American Deermice more ecologically diverse and
   widely distributed than White-footed Deermice. Commonly, White-Footed
   Deermice are ecological generalists, and North American Deermice are
   ecological specialists. In the Inner Bluegrass Region of Kentucky, these
   2 species are sympatric in agroecosystems habitats, including the
   University of Kentucky North Farm. This farm was the most trapped
   location in central Kentucky from 1950 to 1968, with results indicating
   the White-Footed Deermoouse was the more common of these species.
   Trapping from 1995 to 2015 found that North American Deermice were
   caught rarely. Our study examined agroecosystems habitats at the UK
   North Farm, including all perennial and annual habitats, to determine
   the relative abundance and habitat use by both these species. In our
   study, North American Deermice was the most commonly captured species;
   it was trapped rarely in perennial habitats but much more frequently in
   annual crops. Perennial clover fields and Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) were
   the 2 exceptions; however, these are short crops with exposed soil
   between rows. Essentially, North American Deermice were observed in the
   agricultural equivalent of early successional habitat. In contrast,
   White-Footed Deermice were captured in both perennial and annual
   habitats, but more commonly in perennial habitats, the exception being
   annual Salvia hispanica (Chia) fields where dense, green plants produced
   a thick canopy. Overall, the best predictor of habitat for North
   American Deermice was bare, exposed soil, whereas the best predictor for
   White-Footed Deermice was dense growth and overhead cover.},

Volume = {29},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There are few undisturbed, freshwater habitats remaining in the
   populated areas of the United States. Aquatic organisms, such as
   dragonflies (Odonata), have therefore either had to adapt to disturbed
   and modified secondary habitats, such as farms, golf courses,
   storm-water remediation basins, and community-park ponds, or risk
   extirpation. The species that readily adapt to these habitats are
   usually widespread common species. However, other aquatic habitats
   inadvertently created at abandoned work sites often evolve distinctive
   characteristics over time that provide refuge for species rarely or
   never found at deliberately created pond habitats. For 17 years, we have
   monitored the diverse Odonata fauna at several floristically distinct
   ponds formed in depressions left from the dredging of the Chesapeake and
   Delaware Canal in the 1960s. Among the species found are ones not known
   elsewhere locally or ones found in unusual abundance at 1 or more of the
   ponds, though infrequently encountered regionally. These dredge-spoil
   ponds are important for conserving regional Odonata biodiversity by
   providing unique habitats in an increasingly urbanized environment.},

Title = {Which interventions contribute most to the net effect of England's

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {271-291},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Agri-environment schemes support land management interventions
   that benefit biodiversity, environmental objectives, and other public
   goods. Process-based model simulations suggest the English scheme, as
   implemented in 2016, increased wild bee pollination services to
   pollinator-dependent crops and non-crop areas in a geographically
   heterogeneous manner. Objectives We investigated which interventions
   drove the scheme-wide predicted pollination service increase to oilseed
   rape, field beans and non-cropped areas. We determined whether the
   relative contribution of each intervention was related to floral and/or
   nesting resource quality of the intervention, area of uptake, or
   placement in the landscape. Methods We categorised interventions into
   functional groups and used linear regression to determine the
   relationship between predicted visitation rate increase and each
   category's area within a 10 km grid tile. We compared the magnitude of
   the regression coefficients to measures of resource quality, area of
   uptake nationally, and placement to infer the factors underpinning this
   relationship. Results Hedgerow/woodland edge management had the largest
   positive effect on pollination service change, due to high resource
   quality. Fallow areas were also strong drivers, despite lower resource
   quality, implying effective placement. Floral margins had limited
   benefit due to later resource phenology. Interventions had stronger
   effects where there was less pre-existing semi-natural habitat.
   Conclusions Future schemes could support greater and more resilient
   pollination service in arable landscapes by promoting hedgerow/woodland
   edge management and fallow interventions. Including early-flowering
   species and increasing uptake would improve the effect of floral
   margins. Spatial targeting of interventions should consider landscape
   context and pairing complimentary interventions to maximise whole-scheme
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Context Maintenance of connectivity is a commonly recommended strategy

   such an analysis have the potential to influence applied management
   practices. Objectives We use a large (n = 1902) genetic dataset to
   identify population level and sex-specific functional connectivity for
   cougars in Washington, USA. Methods We conducted a landscape genetics
   analysis that pseudo-optimized resistance surfaces for the full sample
   of cougars as well as for male and female groups. We then modeled
   connectivity across the top performing resistance surfaces with
   resistant kernels. Results The top resistance surface for females had
   higher resistance and lower connectivity than the males and had more
   spatial variability. However, we also observed greater resistance to
   movement and a lack of connectivity for males in and around the Olympic
   Peninsula. The resistance surface and connectivity models for all
   cougars contained both the broad features of the male models and the
   more heterogeneous features of the female models, indicating the
   importance of both local and regional dispersal and breeding.
   Conclusions In species with sex-specific differences in movement and
   dispersal, accounting for these differences can be important for
   understanding functional connectivity. For cougars in Washington, this
   revealed depressed connectivity for males on the Olympic Peninsula which
   may indicate a more immediate management concern for the future of this
   population than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Context Understanding habitat dynamics is essential for effective
   conservation as landscapes rapidly change. In a companion paper in this
   issue, Shirk et al. (2022) introduced an automated habitat monitoring
   system using Google Earth Engine and applied this framework to develop a
   dynamic model of Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) habitat
   across the southwestern US from 1986 to 2020. Objectives We explored the
   application of this dynamic model of Mexican spotted owl habitat in the
   context of the species' ecology.
   Methods We evaluated environmental correlates of Mexican spotted owl
   habitat, assessed potential spatial non-stationarity in habitat
   selection, estimated long-term trends in habitat by quantifying changes
   in habitat amount and quality between 1986 and 2020, and evaluated the
   extent to which habitat changes over the past 35 years have been driven
   by wildfire.
   Results Topography and climate appeared to outweigh reflectance-based
   (vegetation) metrics in describing Mexican spotted owl habitat and
   habitat selection was non-stationary across modeling subregions. Total
   habitat area for Mexican spotted owls declined by -21\% since 1986
   (0.6\% annually), but trends varied spatially and some even reversed
   over the past decade. Wildfire was responsible for between 8 and 35\% of
   total habitat loss, depending on the subregion considered.
   Conclusions The automated habitat monitoring system allowed trend
   estimation and accurate assessment of current habitat status for Mexican
   spotted owls; maps were accurate, spatially detailed, and current. The
   ability to continually produce accurate maps for large land areas for
   threatened species such as the Mexican spotted owl facilitates
   science-based land management on public lands in the southwestern US.},

Title = {The role of habitat features in patterns of population connectivity of
   two Mediterranean amphibians in arid landscapes of central Iberia},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Context Mediterranean wetland ecosystems are in continuous decline due
   to human pressure. Amphibians are key elements of biotic communities of
   Mediterranean temporary ponds and streams, and their persistence depends
   on the availability and inter-connectivity of breeding sites. Objectives
   We investigated the role of different factors potentially driving
   functional connectivity patterns in two amphibian species at the
   landscape and local scales. We focused on two Mediterranean endemic
   pond-breeding amphibians inhabiting semi-arid landscapes of central
   Spain, the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus) and the common
   midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans). Methods We genotyped 336 individuals
   of P. punctatus and 318 of A. obstetricans from 17 and 16 breeding
   populations at 10 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. We used
   remotely sensed vegetation/moisture indices and land use/cover data to
   derive optimized resistance surfaces and test their association with
   estimates of gene flow and migration rates across populations. Results
   We found evidence for higher population connectivity in common midwife
   toads than in common parsley frogs, with a strong effect of water
   availability in patterns of population connectivity of both species.
   However, the two species differ in the role of landscape features on
   population connectivity, with the distance and spatial distribution of
   artificial land-use types positively influencing connectivity in A.
   obstetricans and meadows/pastureland favouring P. punctatus. This is in
   line with reported breeding site preferences for the two species, with
   A. obstetricans successfully breeding in artificial water bodies that P.
   punctatus generally avoid. Conclusions This study highlights the
   importance of assessing species-habitat relationships shaping
   connectivity when developing and implementing conservation and
   management actions to benefit fragmented amphibian populations in the
   Mediterranean region. Our results show that amphibian species respond
   differently, even contrastingly to landscape features and thus require
   alternative, complementary strategies to improve population connectivity
   and ensure long-term viability.},

Abstract = {Ediacaran embryo-like spherical fossils exhibit diverse cell adhesion
   patterns resembling partial cleavage-stage embryos of living animals.
   Two three-celled specimens characterized by a pair of small cells
   overlying a large cell have been recovered from the Ediacaran Zhenba
   microfossil assemblage. Their cell adhesion pattern is highly comparable
   to a phenomenon reported from the Weng'an biota that was interpreted as
   fossil embryos undergoing discoidal cleavage. However, our specimens
   contain fewer cells and thus probably represent developmental precursors
   of the Weng'an counterparts. Additionally, new material shows several
   anatomical features that are inconsistent with an embryo interpretation,
   including (1) an unusually large volume of ``blastomeres,{''} (2) a
   putative nucleus preserved within the large ``yolk cell,{''} and (3)
   completely separated cells. Collectively, the Zhenba embryo-like
   specimens permit a reconstruction of the consecutive developmental
   sequence from single-celled individuals to the three-celled individuals,
   leading us to interpret the newly found specimens as products of
   abnormal development of Ediacaran embryo-like organisms whose affinity
   remains unresolved.},

Title = {Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation based on Marxan

Abstract = {Context According to Global Biodiversity Outlook 5, the Aichi
   Biodiversity Target regarding protected areas (PAs) has been partially
   achieved with limited progress in valid performance for biodiversity
   conservation and effective management. This suggests that not only the
   spatial planning of PAs but also the spatial prioritization for PAs
   under different management scenarios need more prudent decision-making.
   Objectives We aim to develop a comprehensive approach to identify and
   prioritize PAs to maximize the effectiveness of biodiversity
   conservation while minimize the conservation costs. Methods Taking
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as a case study, we consider the supply and
   demand of ecosystem services, and landscape connectivity to identify
   PAs. Systematic conservation planning decision support tool Marxan was
   employed to identify the priority areas of PAs under multi-target
   scenarios. The conservation costs, the critical step in the planning
   process, was estimated using habitat quality evaluation module embedding
   in InVEST model. Results The results showed that the conservation costs
   for construction land and unused land were the highest, while the costs
   for forest land, grassland, and farmland were very low. Sensitivity
   analysis confirmed the most appropriate conservation goal was 50\% of
   the total area. Therefore, we generated spatial prioritization outcomes
   based on this target. The highest priority area was mainly located in
   the northwest of Beijing, the north of Chengde, and the east of
   Zhangjiakou. Conclusions It is concluded that the proposed approach
   helps decision-makers to identify spatial prioritization for
   biodiversity conservation based on different scenarios and also yields
   insights into systematic conservation planning and management.},

Abstract = {Context Effectively estimating the influences of urban expansion on
   multiple ecosystem services (ESs) is of great importance for improving
   urban planning in drylands. However, there are some shortcomings in the
   existing urban expansion models, which lead to great uncertainties in
   the assessment of the influences of urban expansion on multiple ESs.
   Objectives This study sought to effectively estimate the influences of
   urban expansion on multiple ESs in drylands. Methods We combined the
   land use scenario dynamics-urban model and ES models to estimate the
   influences of urban expansion on habitat quality, food production, water
   retention, air quality regulation, sand fixation, and aesthetics.
   Results The results showed that (1) our method can effectively evaluate
   the influences of urban expansion on multiple ESs in drylands, and the
   accuracy increased by more than 20\% on average. (2) Under the impacts
   of future urban expansion, the annual average loss per unit area of
   habitat quality, food production, water retention, air quality
   regulation, sand fixation, and aesthetics will increase. (3) Future
   urban expansion will occupy more cropland and grassland, which will be
   the main reason for the intensified degradation of multiple ESs.
   Conclusions We suggest that the local government should focus on
   protecting key ecosystems, especially grasslands, from urban expansion
   to mitigate the potential influences on multiple ESs in drylands.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {For species primarily regulated by a common predator, the P{*} rule of
   Holt \& Lawton (Holt \& Lawton, 1993. Am. Nat. 142, 623-645.
   (doi:10.1086/285561)) predicts that the prey species that supports the
   highest mean predator density (P{*}) excludes the other prey species.
   This prediction is re-examined in the presence of temporal fluctuations
   in the vital rates of the interacting species including predator attack
   rates. When the fluctuations in predator attack rates are temporally
   uncorrelated, the P{*} rule still holds even when the other vital rates
   are temporally auto-correlated. However, when temporal auto-correlations
   in attack rates are positive but not too strong, the prey species can
   coexist due to the emergence of a positive covariance between predator
   density and prey vulnerability. This coexistence mechanism is similar to
   the storage effect for species regulated by a common resource. Negative
   or strongly positive auto-correlations in attack rates generate a
   negative covariance between predator density and prey vulnerability and
   a stochastic priority effect can emerge: with non-zero probability
   either prey species is excluded. These results highlight how temporally
   auto-correlated species' interaction rates impact the structure and
   dynamics of ecological communities.},

Abstract = {We assessed Alosa pseudoharengus (Alewife) upstream passage during
   2016-2019 spawning runs using radio frequency identification (RFID)
   tracking through a periodically submerged and a constantly submerged
   top-hinged tide gate in the LaPlanche and Missaquash rivers,
   respectively, on the Chignecto Isthmus, Canada. First detection of
   individuals tagged in previous years (i.e., returnees) revealed
   synchronous upstream run timing in both rivers during 2015 and 2018.
   Greater delays of migrants attempting passage through the periodically
   submerged tide gate prompted temporary removal of 1 flapper door during
   2016-2019 runs. During a 7-day period following door removal, the number
   of individuals passing per day increased 4- to 6-fold during 2016-2017
   and less than 2-fold during 2018-2019. More than 80\% of returnees
   passed the periodically submerged gate following door removal,
   decreasing mean delay to less than that of migrants attempting passage
   of the constantly submerged gate. Most individuals passed the
   periodically submerged gate during mid-flood daily tide phases and none
   passed during low-tide outflow due to high water velocities. Passage of
   the constantly submerged gate occurred during all tide phases, with 77\%
   passing during ebb and low tides. The constantly submerged tide gate
   provided greater windows of opportunity, resulting in relatively shorter
   delays compared to the periodically submerged tide gate. Long-term
   monitoring in this study highlighted the effectiveness of temporary
   and/or adaptive mitigation when addressing issues in river connectivity
   and fish passage.},

Title = {Social buffering of the stress response: insights from fishes},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Social buffering of stress refers to the effect of a social partner in
   reducing the cortisol or corticosterone response to a stressor. It has
   been well studied in mammals, particularly those that form pair bonds.
   Recent studies on fishes suggest that social buffering of stress also
   occurs in solitary species, gregarious species that form loose
   aggregations and species with well-defined social structures and bonds.
   The diversity of social contexts in which stress buffering has been
   observed in fishes holds promise to shed light on the evolution of this
   phenomenon among vertebrates. Equally, the relative simplicity of the
   fish brain is advantageous for identifying the neural mechanisms
   responsible for social buffering. In particular, fishes have a
   relatively small and simple forebrain but the brain regions that are key
   to social buffering, including the social behaviour network, the
   amygdala and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal axis, are
   functionally conserved across vertebrates. Thus, we suggest that insight
   into the mechanistic and evolutionary underpinnings of stress buffering
   in vertebrates can be gained from the study of social buffering of
   stress in fishes.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {15-31},

Abstract = {Reptilian skull morphology is highly diverse and broadly categorized
   into three categories based on the number and position of the temporal
   fenestrations: anapsid, synapsid, and diapsid. According to recent
   phylogenetic analysis, temporal fenestrations evolved twice
   independently in amniotes, once in Synapsida and once in Diapsida.
   Although functional aspects underlying the evolution of tetrapod
   temporal fenestrations have been well investigated, few studies have
   investigated the developmental mechanisms responsible for differences in
   the pattern of temporal skull region. To determine what these mechanisms
   might be, we first examined how the five temporal bones develop by
   comparing embryonic cranial osteogenesis between representative extant
   reptilian species. The pattern of temporal skull region may depend on
   differences in temporal bone growth rate and growth direction during
   ontogeny. Next, we compared the histogenesis patterns and the expression
   of two key osteogenic genes, Runx2 and Msx2, in the temporal region of
   the representative reptilian embryos. Our comparative analyses suggest
   that the embryonic histological condition of the domain where temporal
   fenestrations would form predicts temporal skull morphology in adults
   and regulatory modifications of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in osteogenic
   mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating
   morphological diversity in the temporal skull region of reptiles.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {As temperatures increase, there is growing evidence that species across
   much of the tree of life are getting smaller. These climate
   change-driven size reductions are often interpreted as a temporal
   analogue of the observation that individuals within a species tend to be
   smaller in the warmer parts of the species' range. For ectotherms, there
   has been a broad effort to understand the role of developmental
   plasticity in temperature-size relationships, but in endotherms, this
   mechanism has received relatively little attention in favour of
   selection-based explanations. We review the evidence for a role of
   developmental plasticity in warming-driven size reductions in birds and
   highlight insulin-like growth factors as a potential mechanism
   underlying plastic responses to temperature in endotherms. We find that,
   as with ectotherms, changes in temperature during development can result
   in shifts in body size in birds, with size reductions associated with
   warmer temperatures being the most frequent association. This suggests
   developmental plasticity may be an important, but largely overlooked,
   mechanism underlying warming-driven size reductions in endotherms.
   Plasticity and natural selection have very different constraining
   forces, thus understanding the mechanism linking temperature and body
   size in endotherms has broad implications for predicting future impacts
   of climate change on biodiversity.},

Title = {Defensible-space treatment of < 114,000 ha 40 m from high-risk buildings

Abstract = {Context WUI wildfire disasters are increasing, as fires are pushed by
   strong winds and drier fuels across landscapes and into communities.
   Possible disasters make maintaining and restoring landscape-scale fire
   in fire-adapted ecosystems difficult. Rapid action is needed to reduce
   building loss in WUI wildfire disasters. Objectives In a Colorado study,
   I used distance-based empirical modeling to refine potential risk of
   building loss in WUI wildfire disasters to focus risk-reduction efforts.
   Methods New empirical modeling showed 95\% of USA building loss in WUI
   wildfire disasters was within 100 m of wildland vegetation. I used
   modeling to estimate and map potential relative risk of a WUI wildfire
   disaster for each of 2,185,953 buildings in Colorado. Results High-risk
   buildings were 241,375 or 11\% of total buildings. However, the 20-40 m
   essential defensible space around these buildings covered only
   46,767-114,084 ha. Area within 100 m of wildland vegetation, containing
   these buildings, covered 475,840 ha or 1.8\% of Colorado's 27 million
   ha. About 95\% of at-risk land within 100 m of wildland vegetation is
   not federally owned, and WUI wildfire disasters are mostly from fires
   started on private land. Conclusions Treating <= 114,084 ha of
   defensible space could leave the 27 million ha of Colorado with lower
   WUI wildfire disaster-risk to buildings. High risk of building loss is
   rarely a federal land-management problem. If the goal is rapid reduction
   of building loss in WUI wildfire disasters, focus resources on
   defensible space 20-40 m from WUI buildings within 100 m of wildland
   vegetation.},

Title = {Potential cheatgrass abundance within lightly invaded areas of the Great

Abstract = {Context Anticipating where an invasive species could become abundant can
   help guide prevention and control efforts aimed at reducing invasion
   impacts. Information on potential abundance can be combined with
   information on the current status of an invasion to guide management
   towards currently uninvaded locations where the threat of invasion is
   high. Objectives We aimed to support management by developing predictive
   maps of potential cover for cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a problematic
   invader that can transform plant communities. We integrated our
   predictions of potential abundance with mapped estimates of current
   cover to quantify invasion potential within lightly invaded areas.
   Methods We used quantile regression to model cheatgrass abundance as a
   function of climate, weather, and disturbance, treating outputs as low
   to high invasion scenarios. We developed a species-specific set of
   covariates and validated model performance using spatially and
   temporally independent data. Results Potential cheatgrass abundance was
   higher in areas that had burned, at low elevations, and when fall
   germination conditions were more favorable. Our results highlight the
   extensive areas across the Great Basin where cheatgrass abundance could
   increase to levels that can alter fire behavior and cause other
   ecological impacts. Conclusions We predict potential cheatgrass
   abundance to quantify relative invasion risk. Our model results provide
   high and low scenarios of cheatgrass abundance to guide resource
   allocation and planning efforts across shrubland ecosystems of the Great
   Basin that remain relatively uninvaded. Combining information on an
   invasive species' current and potential abundance can yield spatial
   predictions to guide resource allocation and management action.},

Title = {Experimental hyperoxia (O-2 supersaturation) reveals a gill diffusion
   limitation of maximum aerobic performance in fish},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that hyperoxia increases the maximal
   O-2 consumption rate (<(M) over dot>O-2max) in fish, but exactly how
   this occurs remains to be explained. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
   hyperoxia improves arterial oxygenation in rainbow trout during
   exhaustive exercise. We demonstrate a 35\% higher <(M) over dot>O-2max
   in hyperoxia (200\% air saturation) relative to normoxia, which was
   achieved through a combined 15\% increase in cardiac output due to
   elevated peak heart rate, and a 19\% increase of the arterial-venous
   (A-V) O-2 content difference. While arterial O-2 partial pressure (PaO2)
   and O-2 saturation of haemoglobin declined post-exhaustive exercise in
   normoxia, this did not occur in hyperoxia. This protective effect of
   hyperoxia on arterial oxygenation led to a 22\% higher arterial O-2
   content post-exhaustive exercise, thereby allowing a higher A-V O-2
   content difference. These findings indicate that <(M) over dot>O-2max is
   gill diffusion limited in exhaustively exercised rainbow trout.
   Moreover, as previous studies in salmonids have demonstrated collapsing
   PaO2 in normoxia at maximal swimming speed and at acutely high
   temperatures, a diffusion limitation may constrain <(M) over dot>O-2 in
   other situations eliciting peak metabolic demand. These findings, along
   with the fact that hyperoxia increases <(M) over dot>O-2max in several
   other fishes, suggest that gill diffusion limitations of <(M) over
   dot>O-2max may be widespread in fishes.},

Abstract = {In 2020, the first male-type mitochondrial genome from the clam Macoma

   these data by NGS DNA sequencing and explore further the expression of
   the long cox2 gene. In our study, we report an even longer cox2 gene
   (over 5.5 kbp) with no stop codon separating conserved cox2 domains, as
   well as, based on the rtPCR, a lower relative gene expression pattern of
   the middle part of the gene (5 ` = 1; mid = 0.46; 3 ` = 0.89). Lastly,
   we sequenced the cox2 gene transcript proving the excision of the

Title = {Crop mixtures outperform rotations and landscape mosaics in regulation

Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {77-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Crop rotations, within-field mixtures, and landscape mosaics
   including susceptible and resistant crops are three commonly adopted
   crop diversification strategies that can limit crop epidemics.
   Typically, the effects of crop diversification at these three scales
   have been studied separately, on single pathogen species, and with low
   environmental variability. Objectives We aim to compare the
   disease-limitation effect of these three types of crop diversification
   on two highly damaging fungal pathogens of wheat Puccinia recondita
   (WLR) and Zymoseptoria tritici (STB) and under varying weather
   conditions (warmer or cooler climate for WLR, wetter or drier conditions
   for STB). Methods We built a dynamic mathematical model of epidemics at
   the field scale (based on classical
   Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed epidemiological models) embedded
   in a spatially explicit landscape grid framework. We use it to simulate
   an agricultural landscape in which diversification translates into
   different proportions of wheat and resistant crops in the landscape.
   Results In our simulations, for both pathogens and in all weather
   conditions, within-field crop mixtures had the greatest impact in
   limiting epidemics, crop rotations were second-best, while landscape
   mosaics were the least effective. We also found that the threshold above
   which further addition of resistant plants to crop mixtures would not
   cause further disease limitation to be dependent on weather conditions.
   The more favorable the weather is for pathogens the more resistant
   plants are required. Conclusions Our findings imply that interactions
   between spatial scale of crop diversification, pathogen characteristics
   and weather conditions should be considered in order to maximize
   benefits from disease-regulation properties of diversified cropping
   systems under climate change.},

Title = {Beyond facial width-to-height ratios: bizygomatic width is highly
   sexually dimorphic when adjusting for allometry},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {A large and ever-growing literature implicates male facial
   width-to-height ratio (bizygomatic width divided by facial height) as a
   secondary sexual trait linked to numerous physical and psychological
   perceptions. However, this research is based entirely on the premise
   that bizygomatic width is sexually dimorphic, which recent research has
   called into question. Unfortunately, statisticians for the last 125
   years have noted that morphological ratio measurements may engender
   spurious correlations and biased effect-size estimates. In the current
   study, we find that bizygomatic width is highly sexually dimorphic
   (equivalent d = 1.39), even after adjusting for 92 allometric
   measurements, including multiple facial height and other craniofacial
   measurements (equivalent d = 1.07) in a sample of 6068 men and women. By
   contrast, facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) measurements demonstrated
   a statistical pattern consistent with the age-old argument that
   morphological ratio measurements may engender spurious correlations and
   biased effect-size estimates. Thus, when avoiding facial ratio
   measurements and adjusting for allometry in craniofacial measures, we
   found strong support for a key premise in the human evolutionary and
   behavioural sciences that bizygomatic width exhibits male-biased sexual
   dimorphism.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Lachesillidae is one of the largest families of bark lice and includes
   more than 420 described species, in 26 genera and three subfamilies.
   This family belongs in the suborder Psocomorpha, infraorder
   Homilopsocidea. The classification of Lachesillidae is based on male and
   female genital morphologies, but questions remain regarding the
   monophyly of the family and some of its genera. Here, we used whole
   genome and transcriptome data to generate a 2060 orthologous gene data
   matrix of 2,438,763 aligned bp and used these data to reconstruct the
   phylogenetic relationships of species of Lachesillidae and relatives.
   Taxon sampling included 24 species from Lachesillidae and 23 additional
   species belonging to related families from the infraorders
   Homilopsocidea and Caeciliusetae. Phylogenetic relationships
   reconstructed with maximum likelihood and coalescent-based analyses
   indicated paraphyly of Lachesillidae, and monophyly of the tribe
   Graphocaeciliini and the genus Lachesilla were also never recovered.
   Instability was observed in the position of Eolachesilla chilensis,
   which was recovered either as sister to Elipsocidae or to Mesopsocidae
   species, so we cannot conclusively determine the position of this genus
   within the Homilopsocidea. Given our results, a reclassification is
   necessary, but more taxon sampling of other species in Mesopsocidae and
   Peripsocidae would be useful to add to a tree in future before proposing
   a new classification.},

Title = {Fine-scale spatial heterogeneity shapes compensatory responses of a
   subalpine forest to severe bark beetle outbreak},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {253-270},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Growth releases of individuals that survive disturbances are
   important compensatory response mechanisms that contribute to ecological
   resilience. However, the role of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in
   shaping compensatory growth responses is poorly understood for many
   broad-scale disturbances.
   Objectives We quantified how fine-scale spatial structure affects
   individual and aggregate tree growth leading up to and following a
   severe mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak. We
   asked: (1) How does individual tree growth vary with tree- and
   neighborhood-scale characteristics? (2) How do within-stand aggregate
   growth and overstory recruitment vary with neighborhood-scale
   characteristics?
   Methods We used a spatially explicit long-term monitoring dataset of a
   subalpine lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest (in
   Colorado, USA) in which every tree >= 5 cm diameter was measured and
   mapped prior to (1989, 2004) and following (2018) a severe MPB outbreak
   (2003-2011). We used spatial regression to characterize drivers of
   growth.
   Results Overall, we found strong evidence for post-outbreak compensatory
   responses across spatial scales. Neighborhood characteristics shaped
   both individual and aggregate growth, with the magnitude of growth
   strongly mediated by pre-outbreak neighborhood structure and
   neighborhood mortality. Variation in tree-scale growth, combined with
   the spatial arrangement of surviving trees, resulted in highly variable
   emergent patterns of aggregate growth and recruitment.
   Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of fine-scale landscape
   configuration in shaping forest resilience. Quantifying compensatory
   responses in a spatially explicit framework at different scales is
   critical for modeling post-disturbance forest dynamics, which is
   increasingly important as climate warms and forest disturbance regimes
   change.},

Title = {Mapping, quantifying and comparing seascape heterogeneity of Southwest

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Seamounts are abundant geomorphological features creating seabed
   spatial heterogeneity, a main driver of deep-sea biodiversity. Despite
   its ecological importance, substantial knowledge gaps exist on the
   character of seamount spatial heterogeneity. Objectives This study aimed
   to map, quantify and compare seamount seascapes to test whether
   individual habitats and seamounts differ in geomorphological
   structuring, and to identify spatial pattern metrics useful to
   discriminate between habitats and seamounts. Methods We mapped and
   classified geomorphological habitat using bathymetric data collected at
   five Southwest Indian Ridge seamounts. Spatial pattern metrics from
   landscape ecology are applied to quantify and compare seascape
   heterogeneity in composition and configuration represented in resulting
   habitat maps. Results Whilst part of the same regional geological
   feature, seamounts differed in seascape composition and configuration.
   Five geomorphological habitat types occurred across sites, which within
   seamounts differed in patch area, shape and clustering, with ridge
   habitat most dissimilar. Across seamounts, the spatial distribution of
   patches differed in number, shape, habitat aggregation and intermixing,
   and outcomes were used to score seamounts on a gradient from low to high
   spatial heterogeneity. Conclusions Although seamounts have been
   conceptualised as similar habitats, this study revealed quantitative
   differences in seascape spatial heterogeneity. As variations in relative
   proportion and spatial relationships of habitats within seamounts may
   influence ecological functioning, the proposed quantitative approach can
   generate insights into within-seamount characteristics and seamount
   types relevant for habitat mappers and marine managers focusing on
   representational ecosystem-based management of seamounts. Further
   research into associations of sessile and mobile seamount biodiversity
   with seascape composition and configuration at relevant spatial scales
   will help improve ecological interpretation of metrics, as will
   incorporating oceanographic parameters.},

Abstract = {Context Management for positive biodiversity outcomes under a changing
   climate requires a shift of perspective relative to traditional
   conservation. Here we develop a repeatable indicator for measuring the
   capacity of landscapes to retain biodiversity under a range of plausible
   climate futures, as a function of the condition and spatial
   configuration of native habitat. Methods The Spatial Resilience Index
   extends an existing approach to assessing the potential for biodiversity
   associated with any location in a region to access suitable habitat in
   the surrounding landscape under climate change, incorporating multiple
   dispersal rates integrated over time and an optimised spatial structure.
   Derivation of the indicator is demonstrated for an Australian case
   study, covering the entire State of New South Wales, drawing on existing
   spatial datasets and models. Results Mapping of the Spatial Resilience
   Index across New South Wales suggests that different regions, and
   locations within these regions, vary markedly in their expected capacity
   to retain biodiversity, depending on the direct rate of climate change,
   the degree of climatic buffering (or reduction of climate velocity)
   afforded by landscape heterogeneity, and the degree of anthropogenic
   impacts on the connectedness of habitat in the landscape. The developed
   approach accounts for the interplay between these processes by treating
   them within a unified framework. Conclusions The index highlights areas
   which can potentially benefit from adaptive management (e.g. habitat
   restoration) to enhance capacity to retain biodiversity under climate
   change, and offers an objective means of monitoring any resulting change
   in this capacity over time.},

Abstract = {Pollinators play an important role in the reproduction of zoophilous
   plants. A shift in pollinators has often been observed for oceanic
   island plants, probably because of the differences in fauna. In this
   study, we obtained data on pollinator shifts from insects to birds in
   Orobanche boninsimae (Orobanchaceae), a holoparasitic plant species
   endemic to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, oceanic islands in the
   Pacific. We observed pollination and measured seed viability in O.
   boninsimae and its continental sister species O. coerulescens. We found
   that two passerine birds, the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus)
   and bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis squameiceps), visited the flowers and
   sucked the nectar of O. boninsimae, while only insects visited those of
   O. coerulescens. Viable seeds were produced under pollinator-excluded
   treatments in the two Orobanche species, indicating that the seeds were
   produced by automatic self-pollination and/or apomixis. These results
   suggest that O. boninsimae may be pollinated by birds and can produce
   seeds by automatic self-pollination/apomixis. This is the first record
   of visitation of the genus Orobanche by birds. Studies of pollination
   systems in native plants on the Bonin Islands are few compared to those
   on other oceanic islands, and O. boninsimae may provide a valuable
   example of pollinator shifts in the Bonin Islands.},

Title = {Comparing alternative methods of modelling cumulative effects of oil and

Abstract = {Context Oil and gas activity is increasing in the western boreal forest
   of North America. To manage cumulative effects of this industry, a
   better quantification of footprint effects on wildlife is needed.
   Objectives We used point-count surveys to evaluate how well footprint
   amounts within 150 m, and proximity to seismic lines, pipelines, well
   sites, roads, and energy facilities predicted the abundance of 48 bird
   species. Methods We developed models for each species, evaluating the
   best functional forms for different footprint effects, then predicted
   how different model structures influenced estimates of regional
   population size. Results Most species exhibited at least one nonlinear
   response to footprint amount (79\% of species) or distance (88\%).
   Species associated with older coniferous forests decreased more often
   with increased footprint amount and closer proximity to footprint, while
   species associated with open lands and young forests increased with
   greater footprint and closer proximity. In one-third of species, bird
   abundance versus distance changed from a positive to negative
   relationship (or reverse) at a threshold distance from at least one
   footprint. Models based on footprint proximity had better fit than those
   based on footprint amount for 29 of 48 species, but both model types
   produced similar population estimates. Conclusions Both footprint amount
   and proximity models were useful for assessing cumulative effects on
   wildlife and mechanisms causing change. Models of distance to footprint
   can provide evidence of positive or negative edge effects for developing
   management buffers. Models of footprint amount provide important
   information on functional changes in habitat.},

Title = {Prolonged coastal inundation detected with synthetic aperture radar
   significantly retarded functional recovery of mangroves after major

Abstract = {Context Hurricanes are major threats to coastal mangrove ecosystems.
   Inundation has been implicitly reported to associate with mangrove
   damages and mortality. However, there have been no spatial statistical
   analyses of the impact of inundation on mangrove recovery at landscape
   scales. Objectives Our objectives are to detect spatiotemporal patterns
   of inundation after major hurricanes and to explore explicitly the role
   of inundation in mangrove recovery at landscape scale. Methods Using
   C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar images, we detected the spatiotemporal
   pattern of surface flood and derived the spatial distribution of
   inundation depth under mangrove canopies based on surrounding surface
   flood and elevation along northern Puerto Rico coasts after major
   hurricanes in 2017. Based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, we derived
   the short-term hurricane impact and the recovery ratio from 2018 to
   2021, and analyzed the impact and the recovery of mangrove greenness by
   means of spatial error models. Results The identification of surface
   flood reached very high accuracy. The severe impact is significantly
   explained by greater gust windspeed during the hurricane and lower
   elevation. More importantly, retarded mangrove greenness recovery is
   significantly explained by severer impacts, longer and deeper
   inundation, and heavier hurricane rainfall. Conclusions Spatiotemporal
   heterogeneity in flood depth plays a significant and essential role in
   mangrove recovery and delayed mortality after major hurricanes. The
   derived flood depth turns out to be a better explanator of mangrove
   recovery than elevation, which highlights importance of landscape
   hydrology and topography with respect to mangrove response and
   restoration after major hurricanes.},

Abstract = {Context Cross-boundary subsidies create important growth opportunities
   for a range of taxa. In modified river systems, remnant patches of
   floodplain and flood bypasses become ephemeral hotspots of zooplankton
   production, however, the extent to which these prey items are (or could
   be) transported downstream is unclear. Objectives We investigated the
   diet of juvenile salmon under varying hydroclimatic conditions to assess
   the importance of floodplain-produced prey subsidies in an otherwise
   food-scarce region. Methods Juvenile salmon (n = 3033) and zooplankton
   were sampled across the California Central Valley Sacramento-San Joaquin
   River Delta in 2014-2018, incorporating a range of climatic conditions
   including drought and flood. Salmon stomach fullness and diet
   composition, and ambient zooplankton densities were used to assess
   spatiotemporal patterns in prey production and consumption. Results
   Floodplain-produced cladocerans provided ephemeral food pulses to
   juvenile salmon in downstream riverine habitats. Salmon had the fullest
   stomachs in wetter years (2016-2017) and the emptiest stomachs in the
   final year of a multi-year drought (2015). Cladoceran abundances in the
   water column and salmon diets were highest during wet periods and below
   floodplains, and decreased with increasing distance downstream,
   consistent with flow-mediated trophic subsidies. Conclusions These data
   emphasize the importance of maintaining diverse, interconnected habitats
   to support resilient fish populations and the potential for managing
   floodplains to boost prey production and delivery. Here, the inundation
   of a flood bypass (or lack of) played a pivotal role shaping the
   juvenile salmon foodscape. As freshwater ecosystems are increasingly
   transformed by large-scale engineering, it is important to coordinate
   infrastructure, habitat and flow modifications to maximize climate
   resilience and trophic benefits to target species.},

Abstract = {Context Old-growth forest loss drives the global biodiversity crisis.
   Nevertheless, this impact could be buffered by the increasing expansion
   of secondary (regenerating) forests, which can provide supplementary
   habitat for wildlife. Objectives We tested this hypothesis assessing the
   effect of old-growth and secondary forest cover on the abundance and
   immature-to-female ratio (proxy of reproductive success) of two
   endangered primates: Geoffroy' spider monkeys and black howler monkeys.
   Methods We measured the response and predictor variables across 18 whole
   landscapes (landscape-scale approach) in the Lacandona rainforest,
   Mexico. As there could be tipping points of forest loss beyond which
   species extinction is accelerated (extinction thresholds), we separately
   tested the linear and non-linear effect of forest cover on each
   response, independently for three spatial scales. Results We found
   stronger and larger-scale negative responses to forest loss in spider
   monkeys than in howler monkeys. However, the data were better predicted
   by linear models, giving no support to the extinction threshold
   hypothesis. In both species, forest loss had stronger negative impacts
   on monkey abundance when considering old-growth forest, than when
   considering secondary forest cover, or total (old-growth + secondary)
   forest cover. Yet, the immature-to-female ratio was weakly related to
   forest cover in both species. Conclusion Secondary forests seem to have
   a weak buffering effect in both species, possibly because they are
   relatively young (< 30 years old) and do not have large trees. This
   implies that old-growth forests are irreplaceable for preventing primate
   extirpation, especially for species with specialized diet and large
   spatial requirements, such as spider monkeys.},

   mechanosensory feedback in hawkmoths, each operating as a
   negative-feedback-control loop. As in any negative-feedback system, the
   head stabilization system possesses inherent oscillatory dynamics that
   depend on the rate at which the sensorimotor components of the reflex
   operate. Consistent with this expectation, we observed small-amplitude
   oscillations in the head motion (or head wobble) of the oleander
   hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii, which are accentuated when sensory feedback is
   aberrant. Here, we show that these oscillations emerge from the inherent
   dynamics of the multimodal reflex underlying gaze stabilization, and
   that the amplitude of head wobble is a function of both the visual
   feedback and antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston's
   organs. Our data support the hypothesis that head wobble results from a
   multimodal, dynamically stabilized reflex loop that mediates head
   positioning.},

Title = {Effects of the egg incubation environment on turtle carapace development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developing organisms are often exposed to fluctuating environments that
   destabilize tissue-scale processes and induce abnormal phenotypes. This
   might be common in species that lay eggs in the external environment and
   with little parental care, such as many reptiles. In turtles,
   morphological development has provided striking examples of abnormal
   phenotypic patterns, though the influence of the environment remains
   unclear. To this end, we compared fluctuating asymmetry, as a proxy for
   developmental instability, in turtle hatchlings incubated in controlled
   laboratory and unstable natural conditions. Wild and laboratory
   hatchlings featured similar proportions of supernumerary scales (scutes)
   on the dorsal shell (carapace). Such abnormal scutes likely elevated
   shape asymmetry, which was highest in natural nests. Moreover, we tested
   the hypothesis that hot and dry environments cause abnormal scute
   formation by subjecting eggs to a range of hydric and thermal laboratory
   incubation regimes. Shape asymmetry was similar in hatchlings incubated
   at five constant temperatures (26-30 degrees C). A hot (30 degrees C)
   and severely Dry substrate yielded smaller hatchlings but scutes were
   not overtly affected. Our study suggests that changing nest environments
   contribute to fluctuating asymmetry in egg-laying reptiles, while
   clarifying the conditions at which turtle shell development remains
   buffered from the external environment.},

Title = {The effects of inbreeding depression and pollinator visitation on the

Abstract = {The evolutionary transition from outcrossing in heterostylous morphs to
   selfing in homostylous morphs has occurred in many plant lineages.
   Homostylous variants with a low degree of herkogamy may increase the
   reproductive advantage of autonomous self-pollination when there is
   little inbreeding depression and/or low pollinator visitation. Oxalis
   corniculata, a self-compatible perennial herb derived from a tristylous
   ancestor, is reported to have two floral morphs. Homostyled plants are
   broadly distributed in Japan, whereas long-styled plants are reported to
   occur only in coastal areas. We examined the hypothesis that a
   reproductive advantage in avoiding inbreeding depression and/or frequent
   pollinator visits enables long-styled plants to live in some areas.
   Studies on floral variation revealed that the degree of herkogamy varied
   widely and continuously within and among populations. Homostyled and
   long-styled morphs were functionally defined based on the ability of
   autonomous self-pollination. Homostyled plants were widely distributed,
   whereas long-styled plants were found in and around the two coastal
   populations and relatively inland populations. Pollination experiments
   provided no evidence of inbreeding depression in either homostyled or
   long-styled plants. Pollinator visitation frequency was higher in the
   two coastal populations than in the other populations. Thus,
   reproductive disadvantage in long-styled plants lacking autonomous
   self-pollination has reduced in the two coastal populations, and
   long-styled plants may be maintained due to a competitive advantage of
   large seed size. In contrast, we recorded no comparable frequencies of
   pollinator visitation in other populations containing long-styled
   plants, indicating that there are other factors contributing to the
   maintenance of long-styled plants in these areas.},

Abstract = {Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle) is a species that congregates in
   communal roosting sites during the non-breeding periods of its life
   cycle. Wildlife agencies are directed to protect roosts, but their
   nocturnal usage and remote locations make them challenging to identify
   and monitor. We remotely identified and ground-truthed roost sites using
   satellite telemetry data. We delineated 13 confirmed roosts and another
   34 suspected roosts. Volunteers observed 12 roosts with ground surveys
   and confirmed 92\% were in use by eagles during their first observation.
   These results suggest use of eagle-tracking data to remotely identify
   communal roosts is a promising tool for finding and protecting eagle
   roosting habitat. This method can be complemented with volunteer surveys
   to confirm ongoing roost use.},

Title = {Parasitism shapes selection by drastically reducing host fitness and
   increasing host fitness variation},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Determining the effects of parasites on host reproduction is key to
   understanding how parasites affect the underpinnings of selection on
   hosts. Although infection is expected to be costly, reducing mean
   fitness, infection could also increase variation in fitness costs among
   hosts, both of which determine the potential for selection on hosts. To
   test these ideas, we used a phylogenetically informed meta-analysis of
   118 studies to examine how changes in the mean and variance in the
   outcome of reproduction differed between parasitized and non-parasitized
   hosts. We found that parasites had severe negative effects on mean
   fitness, with parasitized hosts suffering reductions in fecundity,
   viability and mating success. Parasite infection also increased variance
   in reproduction, particularly fecundity and offspring viability.
   Surprisingly, parasites had similar effects on viability when either the
   male or female was parasitized. These results not only provide the first
   synthetic, comparative, and quantitative summary of the strong
   deleterious effects of parasites on host reproductive fitness, but also
   reveal a consistent role for parasites in shaping the opportunity for
   selection.},

   demonstrate that rhesus monkeys, much like humans, attend to events of
   moderate surprisingness over both more and less surprising events. They
   do this in the absence of any specific goal or contingent reward,
   indicating that the behavioural pattern is spontaneous. We suggest this

Title = {Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a

   geomorphological constriction},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food
   production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms
   through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly
   understood. A better understanding of the relationship between
   zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in
   Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability
   of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the
   Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of
   two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a
   geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture
   farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12
   h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background
   of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial
   dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities
   and in water column variables were identified between the two sections
   of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we
   found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species
   richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between
   sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward
   asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified
   in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time
   periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition
   were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time
   scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the
   asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier
   favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic
   variables between the two sections of the channel.},

Abstract = {Populations of freshwater gastropods are decreasing globally. To
   investigate one aspect of decline, we exposed the benthic dwelling
   hermaphroditic snail Planorbella (= Helisoma) trivolvis (Say) (Marsh
   Rams-horn) to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Marsh Rams-horn is a
   simultaneous hermaphrodite, suggesting that disruption of reproductive
   success is independent of snail interaction and more dependent on
   internal controls. We examined the impact of exposure to PCBs on
   mortality, reproductive success, and tissue hormone concentrations.
   Exposure to Aroclor (R) 1254 in concentrations found in natural habitats
   caused higher mortality and reduced reproductive success. Additionally,
   tissue estrogens were significantly elevated while testosterone remined
   unchanged in PCB-exposed snails. Given the importance of hermaphroditic
   freshwater gastropods in ecosystems, worldwide population decline, and
   ubiquity of PCBs, identifying the impact of exposure informs our ability
   to combat population loss.},

Title = {Reproductive aspects and pollination biology in endoparasitic Pilostyles
   thurberi (Apodanthaceae)},
Journal = {PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {40-53},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biotic pollination is typically a mutualism between plants and their
   pollinators, where each partner receives a benefit. However, plants can
   resort to various reproductive strategies to attract pollinators. Within
   angiosperms, a group of plants known as endoparasites is comprised of
   only flowers or inflorescences. These plants exhibit various
   reproductive strategies, such as different sexual systems and
   attractants, and most are dependent on animals for pollination. In the
   endoparasitic plants of the family Apodanthaceae, unisexual flowers are
   predominant, resulting in dependence on pollinators. Pilostyles thurberi
   is characterized by small flowers, but limited information exists about
   its reproductive strategies. This study investigated various
   reproductive aspects of P. thurberi. We described and compared its
   hosts, sexual flower arrangement, floral concentration, rewards, and
   reproductive success in different populations. Furthermore, we
   determined whether the floral display operates as an attractant by
   monitoring pollinators for two years. Our results revealed that P.
   thurberi has unisexual flowers with male, female, and mixed sex
   arrangements. Bees and wasps are the effective pollinators and are
   attracted by the floral display independently of flower sex. This study
   was the first to record the production of small amounts of crystallized
   nectar by the nectary disk of both floral sexes. Moreover, the findings
   were compared with those of other endoparasitic plants, such as
   Cytinaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Rafflesiaceae, and other Apodanthaceae. It
   is necessary to continue studying the plant-pollinator interactions and
   reproductive strategies of parasitic plants such as Apodanthaceae, since
   not much evidence on how they reproduce and survive in the wild exists.},

Title = {Navigating agricultural landscapes: responses of critically endangered

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Context Interactions between wildlife and anthropogenic infrastructure,
   such as roads, fences, and dams, can influence wildlife movement, and
   potentially cause human-wildlife conflict. In the Galapagos archipelago,
   two species of critically endangered giant tortoise encounter
   infrastructure and human-modified vegetation in farms, which could
   influence movement choices. Objectives We investigated factors
   influencing tortoise movement and habitat selection in the agricultural
   landscape of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Methods We examined the
   movement of 27 tortoises collected using GPS tracking between 2014 and
   2020, in relation to the location of vegetation, ponds, fences, and
   roads. Results We found that tortoises preferred pasture over native
   vegetation, but there was little difference among their preferences for
   native vegetation, crops, or invasive vegetation. Tortoises also
   travelled slower in pasture, and faster in invasive vegetation, compared
   to crops and native vegetation. Tortoises were more likely to be found
   closer to ponds than predicted by chance. Our results indicated that
   most fences were porous to tortoises, with limited impact on their
   movement. Tortoises were more likely to use areas near roads with
   low-traffic. Conclusions Pastures, and ponds are important habitat for
   tortoises in farms and are likely to be used preferentially by
   tortoises. Overall, fences and roads did not strongly obstruct tortoise
   movements, however, this may lead to potential injury to tortoises on
   roads and property damage for farmers. To best identify priority areas
   for managing wildlife on farms, we recommend evaluating the combined
   effects of multiple anthropogenic landscape features on wildlife
   movements.},

Title = {The social system of the lava lizard, Microlophus atacamensis: the
   interplay between social structure and social organization},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background Animal social systems can be described through four main
   components: social structure, social organization, mating system, and
   care system. Social structure describes the relationships between
   individuals in a population, while social organization describes the
   group composition, size, and spatiotemporal variation of a population.
   We use the frameworks of social structure and social organization to
   study the social system of Microlophus atacamensis, a lizard found in
   the rocky intertidal zone along the Chilean coast. The area M.
   atacamensis inhabits poses specific challenges stemming from their use
   of two distinct habitat types in the intertidal zone: they forage in the
   cool areas near the water's edge and use large rocks in more inland
   areas for basking and refuge. Methods Our assessment of their social
   system focused on two separate populations: one to characterize social
   structure by means of focal observations and social network analysis,
   and a second to assess social organization via home range and core area
   analyses. Further, we examined the social system in two habitat types
   that comprise the intertidal zone: cobble fields and interspersed large
   rocks. Results Social network analysis revealed an interconnected
   network with a few highly central individuals. Body size influenced the
   outcomes of aggressive interactions, with interactions being more common
   in cobble fields where males had more associates and more repeated
   interactions than females. Spatial analyses revealed that the social
   organization of M. atacamensis is characterized by (1) high home range
   overlap, specifically in the cobble fields and (2) relatively exclusive
   core areas dispersed across both habitat types. Conclusion A social
   system is composed of both cooperative and competitive behaviors. While
   our study focused on competitive interactions, the extent and influence
   of cooperative behaviors is still unclear and merits future research. We
   suggest that M. atacamensis has a variable social system in which
   territoriality on large rocks affects access to stationary resources in
   that habitat (e.g., basking sites and refuges), while competition in the
   cobble fields could lay the foundation for a system of dominance
   relationships controlling access to variable food resources in cobble
   field areas of the intertidal zone.},

Abstract = {(1) We monitored post-fire shrubland recovery responses to changes in
   rainfall seasonality using a multi-year field experiment in the Cape
   Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. A primary objective was to test
   the utility of UAVs for monitoring ultra-fine-scale vegetation changes
   in the early post-fire context. (2) By comparison with detailed
   ground-based measurements, we showed that UAVs improved detection of
   integrated community growth responses, given that the appropriate
   relative radiometric normalisation techniques were applied to repeated
   imagery data. UAVs supported ground-based findings and, moreover, helped
   to identify previously undetected growth form responses. However, due to
   the limitations in detecting species-specific demographic changes, UAVs
   could not completely replace ground-based measurements. (3) Our combined
   UAV-based and ground-based monitoring approaches indicated strong
   coupling between post-fire shrubland recovery and seasonal rainfall
   patterns in the CFR but also demonstrated that sensitivity to rainfall
   seasonality could differ between neighbouring shrubland communities
   occurring on different soil types. (4) The careful integration of
   UAV-based and ground-based monitoring approaches provided the fullest
   understanding of early post-fire shrubland recovery patterns.},

Abstract = {The associated species to Senecio glaucus in the newly reclaimed desert
   near to Wadi El-Assiuty of the Eastern Desert at Assiut Governorate,
   Egypt were investigated over two years (2018 and 2019). The allelopathic
   potential of S. glaucus against two crop plants (Triticum aestivum and
   Eruca sativa) was also evaluated. Floristically, 65 species within 59
   genera and 22 families were recorded (21 perennials and 44 annuals).
   Four families Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae captured
   about 54\% of this flora. Therophytes are the predominant life form
   followed by phanerophytes. Chorological analysis revealed that
   cosmopolitan and Saharo-Arabian elements constitute the main bulk of the
   total flora of the studied area. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct
   groups. Stands of group A characterized by the absence of S. glaucus and
   highest species diversity. Stands of group B, C and D included the
   associated species of S. glaucus and characterized by the dominance of
   cosmopolitans, grasses and salt tolerant species. The ordination
   techniques revealed the significant difference between group A and the
   others and showed the strong correlation between its flora with organic
   matter. The other three groups were highly correlated with coarse soil
   texture and total salts. Thirteen species were absent from stands of
   groups B, C and D in which S. glaucus was dominant. Phytochemical
   analysis of S. glaucus showed the prevalence of total phenolics and
   flavonoids in its shoots, while terpenoids were the highest in its
   flowers. All fractions of the plant components completely prevented
   germination of E. sativa seeds but exerted different magnitude of
   inhibition on germination of T. aestivum caryopses (especially with
   MeOH, capitula and shoot extracts). Estimation of phytotoxicity revealed
   that aqueous, ethyl acetate and capitula extracts significantly
   inhibited the germination of wheat caryopses and reduced the elongation
   rates of hypocotyl and epicotyl, and hence the whole length of
   seedlings.},

Title = {Impact of increasing temperature on the taxonomic and metabolic

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most severe threats for ecosystems
   worldwide. Lakes can be studied as indicators of climate change. The
   prokaryotic compartment of lakes is affected by climate change, and the
   metabolic processes of prokaryotes could both attenuate or exacerbate
   the negative impacts of climate change on the ecosystem. However, in
   contrast to studies on the impact of global warming on eukaryotes,
   prokaryotes have been rarely studied in the context of climate change.
   In our study, we tested the impact of short-term temperature increases
   on taxonomic and physiological bacterial diversity and their
   relationships. We conducted an experiment with different temperature
   treatments using mesocosms filled with lake water from the same water
   reservoir. We monitored physicochemical parameters for 2 wk and examined
   taxonomic diversity using Illumina next-generation sequencing and
   metabolic diversity using 31 carbon sources by the Biolog EcoPlate (R)
   method. We showed that a continuous increase in water temperature for 14
   d significantly affected the taxonomic structure of bacteria that
   inhabit lake water. Even when the water temperature was within the
   temperate zone of 26 to 29 degrees C, a slight increase in biodiversity
   in the first few days was observed, and after 14 d, the change in
   temperature drastically decreased biodiversity. In the case of
   physiological diversity, the differences were relatively small.
   Similarly, we did not find a statistically significant correlation
   between the taxonomic and physiological diversity of lake bacteria in
   the context of climate change. This may indicate redundancy of aquatic
   bacteria communities.},

Abstract = {Didynamous stamens are separated into two pairs of different length, and
   the implication of this arrangement has not been well understood. The
   functional advantages of didynamous stamens were investigated in
   Brandisia hancei. Change of stamens during floral aging was recorded;
   the quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains were
   tested; the anther arrangement was manipulated into four types based on
   stamen category and number, and fruit set and number of seeds per fruit
   were measured. Didynamous stamens exhibited staggered anther
   arrangement, and pollen sacs dehisced gradually. There was no difference
   for quantity, viability, and siring ability of pollen grains between the
   two pairs of anthers. Seed production after the removal of one long and
   one short stamen was higher than that of two long or two short stamens.
   Through prolonging pollen presentation and promoting delayed
   self-pollination, staggered arrangement and sequential dehiscence of
   anthers in didynamous stamens facilitate reproductive fitness of B.

Title = {Nitrate availability modulates induced defenses in Phaeocystis globosa
   against protozoan grazers},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Colony formation by Phaecoystis has been widely considered an induced
   defense mechanism against various grazers and contributes to the
   occurrence of algal blooms in nitrate-enriched waters. However, the
   effects of nitrate availability on these induced defenses against
   protozoan grazers remain unclear. Four P. globosa strains isolated from
   4 off-coast areas of the South China Sea were exposed to grazing cues
   associated with the ciliate Euplotes vannus and the heterotrophic
   dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina under nitrate-sufficient and
   nitrate-deficient conditions to evaluate whether nitrate availability
   modulates the expression and costs of induced defenses. Except for one
   strain exposed to ciliate cues under nitrate-deficient conditions, all
   strains expressed defensive responses to grazing cues. Colony numbers
   consistently increased in the presence of grazing cues regardless of
   nitrate availability, although the amplitude of the increase was greater
   under nitrate-deficient conditions. Negative linear relationships were
   observed between colony numbers and population growth rates for 2
   strains under nitrate-deficient conditions, suggesting increased
   energetic costs of defenses. The other 2 strains that did not exhibit
   negative relationships between colony numbers and growth nevertheless
   exhibited decreased cellular particulate organic carbon, particulate
   organic nitrogen, and chlorophyll a content in addition to smaller
   cellular diameters, suggesting that P. globosa can save energetic costs
   by adjusting physiological processes and cell sizes. These results
   suggest that nitrate availability strongly modulates the expression of
   induced grazing defenses and substantially influences the partitioning
   of cells into colonial or solitary forms in Phaeocystis, thereby also
   modulating their ecological roles in local food webs.},

Title = {Nest survival and productivity of translocated and resident burrowing
   owls in Arizona},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Development activities associated with urbanization can directly
   displace animals, causing high mortality and dispersal rates. Wildlife
   managers have attempted to mitigate the impacts of development on
   burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), a species susceptible to
   ground-disturbing activities, by translocating them away from areas
   slated for development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of
   translocation on burrowing owl reproduction by comparing nest survival
   and productivity of owls involved in an ongoing translocation program in
   Arizona, USA, with that of resident owls. We used nest survival models
   to evaluate differences in nest survival and generalized linear models
   with Poisson error to assess differences in productivity. In 2017,
   cumulative nest survival (CNS) was lower among current-year translocated
   owls (i.e., owls translocated within the last year; CNS = 0.34, 95\% CI
   = 0.18, 0.51) compared to non-translocated resident owls (0.83, 95\% CI
   = 0.71, 0.94), but CNS was similar between previously translocated owls
   (i.e., those translocated >1 yr ago, CNS = 0.81, 95\% CI = 0.64, 0.98)
   and residents. Likewise, in 2018, CNS was lower for current-year
   translocated owls (CNS = 0.12, 95\% CI = 0.00, 0.24) compared to
   residents (CNS = 0.68, 95\% CI = 0.50, 0.87) and previously translocated
   owls (CNS = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.40, 0.90). Productivity was significantly
   lower for current-year translocated owls ( x <overline> = 0.5
   fledglings/nest) compared to residents ( x <overline> = 2.4
   fledglings/nest) and previously translocated owls ( x <overline> = 1.5
   fledglings/nest) across sites and years. With the current methods of
   translocation, owls had poor reproductive success in the first year
   after release, but if they survived 2 years after release, they had
   similar nest survival and productivity compared to residents. Our
   results demonstrate that the current practice of releasing translocated
   burrowing owls in the Phoenix, Arizona area during the breeding season
   depresses reproduction and should be substantially changed. Nest
   survival was low and this was mainly attributed to nest establishment of
   translocated owls within release tents (acclimation structures used in
   translocations that involve soft release) where 85\% of nests failed
   following tent removal. Translocation approaches that reflect a closer
   fit to the timing and behavior of the species should be tested to
   determine whether they result in better success. In particular, future
   studies should examine the translocation results of releasing owls as
   male-female pairs or single birds during the nonbreeding period.},

Title = {Striped hyaena den site selection in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {The den is a multi-purpose critical space of carnivores and provides a
   growth conducive refuge which ensures both substances and protection
   from interspecific predation and harsh climate. Selection of optimal den
   sites determined by various site-specific factors potentially reduces
   aversive interspecific interactions and provides cost-effective access
   to food sources. In this study, we have assessed the factors determining
   the den site selection by a small population of striped hyaena, Hyaena
   hyaena in a shared landscape dominated by large carnivores. We assessed
   den site selection as a function of vegetation patch characteristics,
   site-specific anthropogenic threats/activities and topographical
   variables using Bayesian algorithm through field collected binomial data
   on den use by the species. Our model suggested that hyaenas select rocky
   refugia surrounded by trees and tall grasses, situated on mountain
   slopes proximate to a water body. Our study consolidated the importance
   of undulating terrain in the species ecology and postulated the slope as
   an `energy-expensive' terrain that refrains frequent movement of other
   carnivores, in turn providing more affordable denning space for the
   striped hyaena. This study provides critical information on denning
   ecology of last remaining major breeding population striped hyaena of
   southern India.},

   flowering, with 65\% displaying chasmogamous flowering exclusively.
   Cleistogamous flowering was displayed by 27\% of the plants, with 19\%
   being exclusively cleistogamous. Both conditions were displayed by 8\%
   of the plants, and 8\% remained vegetative. Among the plants assessed,
   20 chasmogamous and 7 cleistogamous capsules were excised and removed,

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {In this work, we focused on the functional characterization of
   unicellular eukaryotic assemblages that had previously been
   taxonomically characterized by 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a
   eutrophic coastal site with marked plankton blooms. Biological traits of
   different functional groups were assigned to the retrieved operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). The traits included size, trophic strategy, the
   presence of spines, mucilage production, colony formation, motility,
   spore formation, and potential harmfulness. Functional diversity indices
   were calculated and compared to analogous taxonomic diversity indices,
   indicating a strong positive coupling of richness and dominance and a
   negative coupling of evenness, even at a low taxonomic resolution (at
   the family/genus/species level). Biological trait trade-offs and
   co-occurrences of specific traits were evident during the succession of
   plankton blooms. The trophic strategy dominating in the assemblages
   frequently alternated between autotrophy, mixotrophy, and a few recorded
   cases of parasitism. Given that there was no indication of nutrient
   limitation, we suggest that biotic pressures force marine eukaryotes to
   exploit narrow niches by adopting specific strategies/traits that favour
   their survival. These traits act by increasing resource acquisition
   potential and via predator avoidance. This leads to a unique succession
   of blooms in the system, characterized by adaptations of the bloom taxa
   that are a direct response to the preceding assemblage.},

Title = {Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in visual obstruction in
   line-transect distance sampling of gopher tortoises},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Line-transect distance sampling (LTDS) surveys are commonly used to
   estimate abundance of animals or objects. In terrestrial LTDS surveys of
   gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrows, the presence of
   ground-level vegetation substantially decreases detection of burrows of
   all sizes, but no field or analytical methods exist to control for
   spatially heterogeneous vegetation obstruction as a source of variation
   in detection. We propose the addition of a simple measurement of
   ground-level vegetation that serves as a covariate for the detection
   function. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model in which covariates
   burrow width and nearby vegetation height help to account for detection
   bias and improve precision of estimated density. We investigate the
   performance of this covariate by simulation and by using real LTDS data
   collected before and after application of prescribed fire. We collected
   data in 2018 at the Jones Center at Ichauway in Newton, Georgia, USA.
   Across all simulations, our model including both covariates produced the
   most accurate density point estimates of any of the models tested. For
   our case study, our Bayesian model with vegetation covariates tended to
   produce similar estimates of density before and after burns. Our study
   indicates that any level of spatial variation in vegetation obstruction
   decreases detection of burrows and may lead to underestimation in
   population size (<= 68\%) and proportion of individuals with small
   burrow sizes (<= 32\%) when not considered during analysis. Our work is
   extensible to other terrestrial sampling efforts where systematic
   measurement of a spatially distributed obstructing feature is feasible
   during the LTDS survey.},

Title = {Historical account and current ecological knowledge of the southernmost
   lizard in the world, Liolaemus magellanicus (Squamata: Liolaemidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Background The systematics of Liolaemus magellanicus has been relatively
   well researched, but despite its recognition as the southernmost lizard
   in the world, scant attention has been paid to the discovery,
   distribution, biogeography, and ecology of this lizard at the southern
   tip of South America. I hereby research such aspects and collate the
   most relevant information reported in the primary literature. Methods
   and Results I conducted a selective review of the history of discovery,
   distributional records, biogeography, and ecological features of L.
   magellanicus, as recorded in mainstream journals and landmark monographs
   and books. I specifically omitted the work on the systematics of the
   species and genus because its complexity warrants separate treatment. I
   found scattered references to this lizard starting with the chronicles
   of several overseas expeditions (British, French, and Swedish), with
   Darwin, Jacquinot and Guichenot, and Anderson and Ohlin acting as
   informers; and culminating with Skottsberg, a traveler, and Bridges, an
   early settler in Tierra del Fuego Island. Modern treatment of this
   species started with Hellmich in the 1930s and Donoso-Barros in the
   1960s in Chile, and with Cei in Argentina in the 1960s and has continued
   chiefly in the latter country until today. Discussion I propose this
   species as a model ectothermic vertebrate that may serve to test
   hypotheses about: (a) Resource allocation strategies to deal with a
   harsh environment that affords limited opportunities for foraging and
   reproductive activities of a lizard. (b) Behavioral strategies for
   dealing with thermoregulation, food, and mate acquisition, and care -if
   any-of offspring. (c) Its place within the rather impoverished food web
   of which this species forms part of. This relatively new species, which
   persisted in glacial refuges before being cut off into two
   subpopulations-one mainlander, another islander-also offers fertile
   ground for testing population genetic, evolutionary, and phylogeographic
   hypotheses. I think that biogeographers, systematists, evolutionists,
   physiologists, and ecologists should take advantage of this uniquely
   positioned species in the southernmost margin of the world.},

Title = {Migratory hoverflies orientate north during spring migration},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Migratory hoverflies are long-range migrants that, in the Northern
   Hemisphere, move seasonally to higher latitudes in the spring and lower
   latitudes in the autumn. The preferred migratory direction of hoverflies
   in the autumn has been the subject of radar and flight simulator
   studies, while spring migration has proved to be more difficult to
   characterize owing to a lack of ground observations. Consequently, the
   preferred migratory direction during spring has only been inferred from
   entomological radar studies and patterns of local abundance, and
   currently lacks ground confirmation. Here, during a springtime arrival
   of migratory insects onto the Isles of Scilly and mainland Cornwall, UK,
   we provide ground proof that spring hoverfly migrants have an innate
   northward preference. Captured migratory hoverflies displayed northward
   vanishing bearings when released under sunny conditions under both
   favourable wind and zero-wind conditions. In addition, and unlike autumn
   migrants, spring individuals were also able to orientate when the sun
   was obscured. Analysis of winds suggests an origin for insects arriving
   on the Isles of Scilly as being in western France. These findings of
   spring migration routes and preferred migration directions are likely to
   extend to the diverse set of insects found within the western European
   migratory assemblage.},

Abstract = {Past climatic change as a driving force of marine diversification is
   still largely unclear, particularly for Southern Hemisphere species.
   Here, we present a case using the brown fur seal, Arctocephalus
   pusillus, assessing the geographical structure and demographic history
   using mitochondrial and nuclear data. Results show the two previously
   defined subspecies (one from Australia and the other from southern
   Africa) are phylogeographically distinct. Migration analyses based on
   nuclear data suggest the absence of migrants among the two genetically
   close assemblages. The demographic history of A. pusillus is
   characterized by a glacial population expansion (approx. 18 kya) in the
   southern African lineage, which coincides with time estimates of
   population expansion of prey species of seals. Approximate Bayesian
   calculations support an eastward dispersal event during the Last Glacial
   Maximum when sea levels were lower, followed by a postglacial divergence
   event, approximately 13 kya. The demographic history of the brown fur
   seal in the Southern Oceans provides support that recent palaeoclimatic
   changes could have facilitated expansions in some marine species and
   that postglacial sea-level rise may have acted as a dispersal barrier
   for species mostly confined to continental shelves.},

Title = {Microalgal characterization during a mucilaginous bloom on deep
   gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo MPA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {161-165},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in frequency, but despite an
   extreme increase in research on this topic, general knowledge on HABs is
   still scarce. Mucilaginous algal blooms, in particular, are ever more
   present and can heavily affect marine ecosystems. Gorgonians appear
   significantly affected, as their branches are easily entangled (pelagic
   aggregates) and overgrown (benthic aggregates) by mucilage. Moreover,
   their proximity to the bottom makes them susceptible to benthic anoxia.
   In the present study, we investigated the mucilaginous bloom that
   affected the gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo Marine
   Protected Area (MPA) (NE coast of Sardinia) in summer 2020. We focused
   mainly on the characterization of dominant benthic microalgae,
   identifying those responsible for the bloom. Sampling was performed
   considering the colonies of Paramuricea clavata present on hard
   substrata along 2 transects near the Secca del Papa, in the B Zone of
   the MPA. The characterization of the microalgal community and the count
   of the most abundant species (>10 cells ml-1) were carried out using the
   Utermohl sedimentation method. The community was mainly composed of
   diatoms (Bacillariophyta) belonging to the genera Pseudo-nitzschia,
   Nitzschia and Cylindrotheca. C. closterium appeared to be the most
   abundant species. These results confirm the importance of diatoms during
   Tyrrhenian mucilaginous blooms, which could be particularly harmful to
   gorgonians.},

Title = {Meiotic drive adaptive testes enlargement during early development in
   the stalk-eyed fly},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {The sex ratio (SR) X-linked meiotic drive system in stalk-eyed flies
   destroys Y-bearing sperm. Unlike other SR systems, drive males do not
   suffer fertility loss. They have greatly enlarged testes which
   compensate for gamete killing. We predicted that enlarged testes arise
   from extended development with resources re-allocated from the accessory
   glands, as these tend to be smaller in drive males. To test this, we
   tracked the growth of the testes and accessory glands of wild-type and
   drive males over 5-6 weeks post-eclosion before males attained sexual
   maturity. Neither of the original predictions is supported by these
   data. Instead, we found that the drive male testes were enlarged at
   eclosion, reflecting a greater allocation of resources to the testes
   during pupation. Testes grow at a higher rate during early adult
   development in drive males, but there was no evidence that this retards
   the growth of the accessory glands. Further experiments are proposed to
   investigate whether smaller accessory glands only arise in drive males
   post-copulation or when flies are subjected to nutritional stress. Our
   experimental findings support the idea that enlarged testes in drive
   males arise as an adaptive allocation of resources to traits that
   enhance male reproductive success.},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Ancient, species-poor lineages persistently occur across the Tree of
   life. These lineages are likely to contain unrecognized species
   diversity masked by the low rates of morphological evolution that
   characterize living fossils. Halecomorphi is a lineage of ray-finned
   fishes that diverged from its closest relatives before 200 Ma and is
   represented by only one living species in eastern North America, the
   bowfin, Amia calva Linnaeus. Here, we use double digest
   restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing and morphology to illuminate
   recent speciation in bowfins. Our results support the delimitation of a
   second living species of Amia, with the timing of diversification dating
   to the Plio-Pleistocene. This delimitation expands the species diversity
   of an ancient lineage that is integral to studies of vertebrate genomics
   and development, yet is facing growing conservation threats driven by
   the caviar fishery.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Rhythm and vocal production learning are building blocks of human music
   and speech. Vocal learning has been hypothesized as a prerequisite for
   rhythmic capacities. Yet, no mammalian vocal learner but humans have
   shown the capacity to flexibly and spontaneously discriminate rhythmic
   patterns. Here we tested untrained rhythm discrimination in a mammalian
   vocal learning species, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina). Twenty
   wild-born seals were exposed to music-like playbacks of conspecific call
   sequences varying in basic rhythmic properties. These properties were
   called length, sequence regularity, and overall tempo. All three
   features significantly influenced seals' reaction (number of looks and
   their duration), demonstrating spontaneous rhythm discrimination in a
   vocal learning mammal. This finding supports the rhythm-vocal learning
   hypothesis and showcases pinnipeds as promising models for comparative
   research on rhythmic phylogenies.},

Abstract = {We sampled the vertebrate community of a 20-ha conservation easement in
   Venango County, PA, from April through August 2021. The restoration and
   management efforts on this easement were designed to improve the meadow
   habitat for one of the few remaining populations of Sistrurus catenatus
   (Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake) in Pennsylvania, and our sampling
   efforts were focused on evaluating the potential prey base available to
   the rattlesnakes at this site. We identified 9 amphibian species, 10
   reptile species, and 11 small mammal species. For amphibians, Anaxyrus
   americanus (American Toad) was the most abundant species, accounting for
   32.6\% of the total, followed by Notophthalmus viridescens (Red-Spotted
   Newt) with 30.6\% of total abundance. Thamnophis brachystoma
   (Short-Headed Gartersnake) comprised more than half (53.7\%) of all
   reptiles sampled, followed by Thamnophis sirtalis (Eastern Gartersnake;
   22.7\%). Peromyscus leucopus (White- Footed Mouse) was the most abundant
   mammal species, accounting for 37.4\% of all mammals surveyed, followed
   by Microtus pennsylvanicus (Eastern Meadow Vole; 24.8\%). Mammals had
   the greatest species richness (S = 11), while reptiles had the greatest
   total abundance (TA = 361), and amphibians had the greatest species
   evenness (E = 0.799). Species accounts for Venango County indicate that
   we sampled 40.9\% (9/22), 37.0\% (10/27), and 21.2\% (11/52) of the
   known amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian species, respectively, within
   this restored meadow habitat. Our results suggest that the restoration
   efforts on this easement study site have been extremely effective in
   creating meadow habitat that supports a diversity of prey species for
   the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake.},

Title = {Biological adaptations for cultural transmission?},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {According to several interlinked and influential lines of argument,
   human minds have been shaped by natural selection so as to include
   biological adaptations with the evolved, naturally selected function to
   facilitate the transmission of cultural knowledge. This `cultural minds'
   hypothesis has proved highly influential, and if it is correct it is a
   major step forward in understanding how and why humans have survived and
   prospered in a hugely diverse range of ecologies. It can be contrasted
   with a `social minds' hypothesis, according to which cultural
   transmission occurs as an outcome, but not the biologically evolved
   function, of social cognition the domain of which is relatively
   small-group interaction. Here, I critique the cultural minds hypothesis
   and I argue that the data favour the social minds perspective. Cultural
   phenomena can clearly emerge and persist over time without cognitive
   adaptations for cultural transmission. Overtly intentional communication
   plays an especially pivotal role.},

Title = {Mothers modify the cost of reproduction by dynamic changes in
   antioxidant function and filial cannibalism},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Investment in current reproduction may negatively influence subsequent
   fitness. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a potential mediator of
   this trade-off between current and future reproductive success. However,
   evidence of reproduction causing oxidative stress is limited, possibly
   owing to compensatory mechanisms that counteract oxidative insults. Here
   we test the idea that organisms protect against oxidative challenges
   through a dynamic interaction between behavioural and physiological
   adjustments at different stages of reproduction. To test this idea, we
   manipulated maternal care in the mouthbrooding cichlid fish
   Astatotilapia burtoni by allowing females to continue care (brooders) or
   by preventing care (non-brooders). We found that brooders depleted the
   pool of antioxidants as brood care progressed; however, we only observed
   increased oxidative DNA damage at the early stage of care relative to
   non-brooders, possibly owing to upregulated antioxidant protection
   during later stages of care. Most brooders adjusted parental investment
   by consuming some of their offspring during mouthbrooding. Intriguingly,
   the level of filial cannibalism was positively related to liver
   antioxidant function. These changes in antioxidant function and filial
   cannibalism allow parents to manage the cost of reproduction and are
   important for our understanding of how oxidative stress mediates
   life-history trade-offs.},

Title = {Spontaneous relational and object similarity in wild bumblebees},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Being able to abstract relations of similarity is considered one of the
   hallmarks of human cognition. While previous research has shown that
   other animals (e.g. primates) can attend to relational similarity, they
   struggle to focus on object similarity. This is in contrast with humans.
   And it is precisely the ability to attend to objects that it is argued
   to make relational reasoning uniquely human. What about invertebrates?
   Despite earlier studies indicating that bees are capable of learning
   abstract relationships (e.g. `same' and `different'), no research has
   investigated whether bees can spontaneously attend to relational
   similarity and whether they can do so when relational matches compete
   with object matches. To test this, a spatial matching task (with and
   without competing object matches) previously used with children and
   great apes was adapted for use with wild-caught bumblebees. When object
   matches were not present, bumblebees spontaneously used relational
   similarity. Importantly, when competing object matches were present,
   bumblebees still focused on relations over objects. These findings
   indicate that the absence of object bias is also present in
   invertebrates and suggest that the relational gap between humans and
   other animals is due to their preference for relations over objects.},

Title = {Dance-communicated distances support nectar foraging as a supply-driven
   system},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Much like human consumers, honeybees adjust their behaviours based on
   resources' supply and demand. For both, interactions occur in
   fluctuating conditions. Honeybees weigh the cost of flight against the
   benefit of nectar and pollen, which are nutritionally distinct resources
   that serve different purposes: bees collect nectar continuously to build
   large honey stores for overwintering, but they collect pollen
   intermittently to build modest stores for brood production periods.
   Therefore, nectar foraging can be considered a supply-driven process,
   whereas pollen foraging is demand-driven. Here we compared the foraging
   distances, communicated by waggle dances and serving as a proxy for
   cost, for nectar and pollen in three ecologically distinct landscapes in
   Virginia. We found that honeybees foraged for nectar at distances 14\%
   further than for pollen across all three sites (n = 6224 dances, p <
   0.001). Specific temporal dynamics reveal that monthly nectar foraging
   occurs at greater distances compared with pollen foraging 85\% of the
   time. Our results strongly suggest that honeybee foraging cost dynamics
   are consistent with nectar supply-driven and pollen demand-driven
   processes.},

Title = {The influence of burial depth on germination and establishment of seeds
   in chimpanzee faeces, Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {One of the many ecosystem services provided by dung beetles is that of
   secondary seed dispersal. This paper experimentally evaluates the
   effectiveness of this service using the chimpanzee-dung beetle seed
   dispersal system in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. The study focussed
   on the germination rate and success of four species of seeds contained
   in the faeces of Pan troglodytes verus: Dacryodes klaineana (Pierre)
   H.J. Lam, Diospyros mannii Hiern, Pycnanthus angolensis (Welw.) Warb.,
   and Uapaca guineensis Muell. Arg. For each species, 600 seeds, half from
   chimpanzee faeces and half from mother trees, were sown in nurseries at
   depths of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 cm (i.e. 120 seeds per depth; 60 from
   chimp and 60 from mother trees). After germination, only the seeds of
   Uapaca guineensis and Diospyros mannii sown at 2 and 5 cm had a >14\%
   rate (between 14.2 and 30.8\%) of germination and seedling
   establishment, regardless of seed origin. An increase in the depth of
   seed burial appears to negatively affect the probability of seedling
   emergence and establishment. This study shows that dung beetles have
   positive impacts on seed fate. However, for these plant species, the
   chimpanzee's role is limited to that of primary seed dispersal.},

Abstract = {Accurately documenting aquatic insects is of the utmost importance given
   recent proposals for a paradigm shift in conservation to protect
   less-charismatic species that are necessary for ecosystem functioning.
   We used both field techniques and molecular methods to assess
   biodiversity in a stream in southwest Virginia. We used emergence traps
   to collect organisms that emerged from the stream as reproducing adults
   over a 4-week period and collected environmental samples (e.g., water,
   sediment) to sequence the DNA found in the samples. Emerging aquatic
   insect abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time. More
   family richness was detected using environmental DNA (eDNA) than
   traditional field sampling; however, many families detected using field
   techniques were not recovered using eDNA, furthering support that both
   protocols are necessary for fully documenting biodiversity. We did not
   have much success in identifying eDNA sequences to species with high
   sequence similarity, suggesting that invertebrate biodiversity of
   southwest Virginia is not well-documented in open-source DNA sequence
   databases. In addition to documenting insect biodiversity, we measured
   the levels of heavy metals in the stream sediment. Sediment values for
   cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury and lead were within regulatory
   limits and were not significantly correlated with biodiversity measures.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Mammals almost always have seven cervical vertebrae. The strong
   evolutionary constraint on changes in this number has been broken in
   sloths and manatees. We have proposed that the extremely low activity
   and metabolic rates of these species relax the stabilizing selection
   against changes in the cervical count. Our hypothesis is that strong
   stabilizing selection in other mammals is largely indirect and due to
   associated pleiotropic effects, including juvenile cancers. Additional
   direct selection can occur due to biomechanical problems (thoracic
   outlet syndrome). Low metabolic and activity rates are thought to
   diminish these direct and indirect effects. To test this hypothesis
   within the primates, we have compared the number of cervical vertebrae
   of three lorisid species with particularly low activity and metabolic
   rates with those of more active primate species, including with their
   phylogenetically closest active relatives, the galagids (bushbabies). In
   support of our hypothesis, we found that 37.6\% of the lorisid specimens
   had an abnormal cervical count, which is a higher percentage than in the
   other nine primate families, in which the incidence varied from zero to
   2.2\%. We conclude that our data support the importance of internal
   selection in constraining evolvability and of a relaxed stabilizing
   selection for increasing evolvability. Additionally, we discuss that
   there is no support for a role of the muscularized diaphragm in the
   evolutionary constraint.},

Abstract = {Climate warming imposes a serious threat, especially to freshwater
   ecosystems in temperate and (sub)polar regions, which are often
   dominated by cold-adapted ectotherms. Although relatively intense
   warming during winter is common across the climatic regions, comparably
   little focus has been put on the organismal impacts of winter warming.
   Embryonic development, which is exceptionally susceptible to ambient
   temperature, occurs during winter in various freshwater ectotherms. Yet,
   our knowledge of the effects of increased temperature during
   embryogenesis on later life stages is limited. Using brown trout (Salmo
   trutta), we examined how a 1.5 degrees C temperature increase from
   fertilization to hatching affects various traits at the onset of the
   free-swimming stage (i.e. a comparison between 3.5 and 5.0 degrees C
   treatments). Although all hatchlings were kept at the same temperature
   (7.0 degrees C) from hatching to the onset of the free-swimming stage
   for about two months, the temperature increase during embryogenesis
   substantially reduced key ecological behaviours, i.e. activity and
   exploration levels, at the onset of the free-swimming stage despite only
   marginal temperature effects on morphological and physiological traits
   at this stage. Given the importance of behavioural traits in early
   growth and survival, our study suggests a likely pathway through which
   subtle changes in mean winter temperature affect early fitness.},

Title = {Advancing the missed mutualist hypothesis, the under-appreciated twin of
   the enemy release hypothesis},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Introduced species often benefit from escaping their enemies when they
   are transported to a new range, an idea commonly expressed as the enemy
   release hypothesis. However, species might shed mutualists as well as
   enemies when they colonize a new range. Loss of mutualists might reduce
   the success of introduced populations, or even cause failure to
   establish. We provide the first quantitative synthesis testing this
   natural but often overlooked parallel of the enemy release hypothesis,
   which is known as the missed mutualist hypothesis. Meta-analysis showed
   that plants interact with 1.9 times more mutualist species, and have 2.3
   times more interactions with mutualists per unit time in their native
   range than in their introduced range. Species may mitigate the negative
   effects of missed mutualists. For instance, selection arising from
   missed mutualists could cause introduced species to evolve either to
   facilitate interactions with a new suite of species or to exist without
   mutualisms. Just as enemy release can allow introduced populations to
   redirect energy from defence to growth, potentially evolving increased
   competitive ability, species that shift to strategies without mutualists
   may be able to reallocate energy from mutualism toward increased
   competitive ability or seed production. The missed mutualist hypothesis
   advances understanding of the selective forces and filters that act on
   plant species in the early stages of introduction and establishment and
   thus could inform the management of introduced species.},

Title = {Bird carcass detection from integrated trials at multiple wind farms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is often necessary to estimate the number of wind turbine collision
   fatalities to assess impacts to birds following construction of wind
   farms. Detection of bird carcasses at wind turbines in the field is
   affected by carcass persistence and searcher detection rate. Integrated
   detection trials, which integrate carcass persistence and searcher
   detection trials into the periodic fatality search, have been proposed
   as an effective method for estimating these parameters. The purpose of
   our study was to test whether and how environmental factors affect
   integrated detection trial outcomes at multiple wind farms. We conducted
   this study at 10 wind farms in various environments of Japan. Binary
   data on trial outcomes in open versus forested areas served as our
   response variable in a generalized additive mixed model informed by days
   into trial, carcass body mass, season, whether snow covered the ground,
   and precipitation. For both ground cover types, days into trial and body
   mass were included in all the top models, suggesting that these factors
   most influenced bird carcass detection probability in integrated trials.
   The best model in open areas included days into trial, body mass, snow,
   and precipitation, and the best model in forested areas included days
   into trial, body mass, snow, precipitation, and season. Values of area
   under the curve indicated high accuracy of the best model for both
   ground cover types. The survey design needs to be appropriate to the
   size of the target species and to the environment in which the impacts
   will occur, such as the site's seasonality, its ground cover, and
   whether snow will cover the ground. Frequency of post-construction
   fatality monitoring should also be set cautiously, especially at wind
   farms located on small-bird migration routes, at wind farms in open
   areas, in areas with snow-covered ground in winter, or in forested areas
   during spring and summer because detection probabilities decline fastest
   under such conditions.},

Title = {Satellite tracking reveals sex-specific migration distance in green
   turtles (Chelonia mydas)},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Satellite tracking is a key tool for studying sea turtles in the wild.
   Most tracking has been performed on adult females however, leaving
   knowledge gaps regarding other population segments, such as adult males.
   By satellite tracking 12 male green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at a
   breeding site in West Africa, we describe their movements from the
   breeding to the foraging grounds and compare migrations with those of 13
   females tracked in the same season. During the mating period, some males
   remained near the focal nesting site, while others performed exploratory
   movements, apparently to visit other nearby rookeries. Males migrated on
   average shorter distances to foraging grounds (377 km, range 50-1081, n
   = 9) compared to females (1038 km, range 957-1850, n = 11]).
   Importantly, male foraging areas overlapped with previously described
   areas for females, suggesting sex-specific migration distances are not
   derived from differences in habitat selection. Strong support for
   differential migration by sex in sea turtles has hitherto been found in
   just one other species, but indications are that it may be a general
   feature in this group. These findings have important implications for
   our understanding of the interplay between reproductive roles and
   movement ecology of these emblematic animals.},

Title = {Linking tree cover change to historical management practices in urban
   parks},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 11},
Abstract = {Context Urban tree canopy (UTC) in parks is shaped by complex
   interactions between social and ecological processes over decades. To
   understand UTC change in parks, it is critical to identify and
   characterize the unique set of social processes that drive long-term
   change. Objectives We sought to uncover the feedbacks between social
   processes and long-term UTC changes in parks of a post-industrial city
   that experienced substantial population loss and park disinvestment.
   Methods Our mixed-methods approach involved quantifying spatiotemporal
   UTC changes and connecting those changes to historical management
   practices for three parks in Philadelphia, PA (US). We delineated UTC
   using aerial imagery between 1959 and 2018, and synthesized information
   from archival records and semi-structured interviews about historical
   management practices. Results We found substantial UTC gains between
   1959 and 1980, due to both: (a) budget cuts, mowing cessation, and
   associated unintended forest emergence; and (b) purposeful tree planting
   and reforestation activities. While some UTC gains were purposeful,
   others were unintentional and reflect successional processes on
   unmaintained lands. Contrary to literature suggesting that financial
   investment would lead to UTC gain, we saw declining UTC following an
   influx of new funding post-2000 due to construction and ecological
   restoration. Conclusions We found differing pathways leading to
   convergent outcomes of UTC gains. Across the three parks, differing
   historical processes and management goals for park landscapes had
   important ramifications for UTC. Our work suggests that landscape
   management could benefit from an improved understanding of how
   historical processes impact land cover over the long-term.},

   dinosaurs},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Ankylosaurid dinosaurs were heavily armoured herbivores with tails
   modified into club-like weapons. These tail clubs have widely been
   considered defensive adaptations wielded against predatory theropod
   dinosaurs. Here we argue instead that ankylosaurid tail clubs were
   sexually selected structures used primarily for intraspecific combat. We
   found pathological osteoderms (armour plates) in the holotype specimen
   of Zuul crurivastator, which are localized to the flanks in the hip
   region rather than distributed randomly across the body, consistent with
   injuries inflicted by lateral tail-swinging and ritualized combat. We
   failed to find convincing evidence for predation as a key selective
   pressure in the evolution of the tail club. High variation in tail club
   size through time, and delayed ontogenetic growth of the tail club
   further support the sexual selection hypothesis. There is little doubt
   that the tail club could have been used in defence when needed, but our
   results suggest that sexual selection drove the evolution of this
   impressive weapon. This changes the prevailing view of ankylosaurs,
   suggesting they were behaviorally complex animals that likely engaged in
   ritualized combat for social dominance as in other ornithischian
   dinosaurs and mammals.},

Title = {Differential changes in life cycle-event phenology provide a window into
   regional population declines},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},

Abstract = {Climate change affects the phenology of annual life cycle events of
   organisms, such as reproduction and migration. Shifts in the timing of
   these events could have important population implications directly, or
   provide information about the mechanisms driving population
   trajectories, especially if they differ between life cycle event. We
   examine if such shifts occur in a declining migratory passerine bird
   (willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus), which exhibits latitudinally
   diverging population trajectories. We find evidence of phenological
   shifts in breeding initiation, breeding progression and moult that
   differ across geographic and spring temperature gradients. Moult
   initiation following warmer springs advances faster in the south than in
   the north, resulting in proportionally shorter breeding seasons,
   reflecting higher nest failure rates in the south and in warmer years.
   Tracking shifts in multiple life cycle events allowed us to identify
   points of failure in the breeding cycle in regions where the species has
   negative population trends, thereby demonstrating the utility of
   phenology analyses for illuminating mechanistic pathways underlying
   observed population trajectories.},

Title = {Host genetics and pathogen species modulate infection-induced changes in
   social aggregation behaviour},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Identifying how infection modifies host behaviours that determine social
   contact networks is important for understanding heterogeneity in
   infectious disease dynamics. Here, we investigate whether group social
   behaviour is modified during bacterial infection in fruit flies
   (Drosophila melanogaster) according to pathogen species, infectious
   dose, host genetic background and sex. In one experiment, we find that
   systemic infection with four different bacterial species results in a
   reduction in the mean pairwise distance within infected female flies,
   and that the extent of this change depends on pathogen species. However,
   susceptible flies did not show any evidence of avoidance in the presence
   of infected flies. In a separate experiment, we observed genetic- and
   sex-based variation in social aggregation within infected, same-sex
   groups, with infected female flies aggregating more closely than
   infected males. In general, our results confirm that bacterial infection
   induces changes in fruit fly behaviour across a range of pathogen
   species, but also highlight that these effects vary between fly genetic
   backgrounds and can be sex-specific. We discuss possible explanations
   for sex differences in social aggregation and their consequences for
   individual variation in pathogen transmission.},

Title = {Habitat selection and space use overlap between feral horses, pronghorn,
   and greater sage-grouse in cold arid steppe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Populations of feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) in the western United
   States have increased during the past decade, consequently affecting
   co-occurring wildlife habitat. Feral horses may influence 2 native
   wildlife species, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus;
   sage-grouse) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) through mechanisms of
   habitat alteration and competition. Wyoming, USA, contains the largest
   populations of pronghorn and sage-grouse of any state and also has the
   highest degree of range overlap between feral horses and these species.
   Consequently, the effects that horses may have on pronghorn and
   sage-grouse populations in Wyoming have implications at local, state,
   and population-wide levels. Managers need information concerning habitat
   selection and space use overlap among these species to develop
   appropriate management strategies; yet this information is absent for
   most feral horse management areas. To address this knowledge need, we
   attached global positioning system (GPS) transmitters to horses,
   pronghorn, and sage-grouse within the greater Bureau of Land
   Management-Adobe Town Herd Management Area in southern Wyoming and
   northern Colorado, USA, between 2017 and 2021 to evaluate habitat
   selection and space use of all species during 3 biologically relevant
   seasons: spring (Apr-Jun; sage-grouse breeding, nesting, and early-brood
   rearing; pronghorn late gestation and early parturition), summer
   (Jul-Oct; sage-grouse summer and late-brood rearing; pronghorn late
   parturition and breeding), and winter (Nov-Mar; non-breeding season).
   Feral horses selected flatter slopes and shorter mean shrub height
   across all seasons and were closer to water in spring and summer.
   Pronghorn habitat selection was similar to horses, but they also avoided
   oil and gas well pads year-round. During spring, sage-grouse selected
   greater herbaceous cover, flatter slopes, and areas farther from well
   pads. In summer, sage-grouse selected greater mean shrub height, flatter
   slopes, and were closer to water. In winter, sage-grouse selected
   flatter slopes and areas with greater vegetation production during the
   preceding summer. Our results indicate strong year-round overlap in
   space use between horses and pronghorn, whereas overlap between horses
   and sage-grouse is greatest during the summer in this region.
   Consequently, managers should recognize the potential for horses to
   influence habitat quality of pronghorn and sage-grouse in the region.},

Title = {Widespread convergent evolution of alpha-neurotoxin resistance in
   African mammals},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Convergent evolution is central to the study of adaptation and has been
   used to understand both the limits of evolution and the diverse patterns
   and processes which result in adaptive change. Resistance to snake venom
   alpha-neurotoxins (alpha NTXs) is a case of widespread convergence
   having evolved several times in snakes, lizards and mammals. Despite
   extreme toxicity of alpha NTXs, substitutions in its target, the
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), prevent alpha NTX binding and
   render species resistant. Recently, the published meerkat (Herpestidae)
   genome revealed that meerkats have the same substitutions in nAChR as
   the venom-resistant Egyptian mongoose (Herpestidae), suggesting that
   venom-resistant nAChRs may be ancestral to Herpestids. Like the
   mongoose, many other species of feliform carnivores prey on venomous
   snakes, though their venom resistance has never been explored. To
   evaluate the prevalence and ancestry of alpha NTX resistance in mammals,
   we generate a dataset of mammalian nAChR using museum specimens and
   public datasets. We find five instances of convergent evolution within
   feliform carnivores, and an additional eight instances across all
   mammals sampled. Tests of selection show that these substitutions are
   evolving under positive selection. Repeated convergence suggests that
   this adaptation played an important role in the evolution of mammalian
   physiology and potentially venom evolution.},

Title = {Longevity of a solitary mole-rat species and its implications for the

   (Bathyergidae)},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Sociality and cooperative breeding are associated with enhanced
   longevity in insects and birds, but whether this is also true for
   mammals is still subject to debate. African mole-rats (Bathyergidae)
   have recently been claimed to be the only mammalian family in which such
   an association may exist because cooperatively breeding bathyergids seem
   to be substantially longer lived than solitary bathyergids. However,
   although ample longevity data are available for several social
   bathyergids, almost nothing is known about mortality distribution and
   lifespan in solitary bathyergids. Here we present robust long-term data
   on the longevity of a solitary African mole-rat, the silvery mole-rat
   Heliophobius argenteocinereus. Our findings show that this species is
   much longer-lived than previously believed. Nonetheless, our comparative
   analysis suggests that sociality has indeed a positive effect on
   longevity in this family. We argue that the extreme longevity seen
   particularly in social bathyergids is probably caused by a combination
   of subterranean lifestyle and cooperative breeding.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {In modern vertebrates, the craniofacial skeleton is complex, comprising
   cartilage and bone of the neurocranium, dermatocranium and
   splanchnocranium (and their derivatives), housing a range of sensory
   structures such as eyes, nasal and vestibulo-acoustic capsules, with the
   splanchnocranium including branchial arches, used in respiration and
   feeding. It is well understood that the skeleton derives from neural
   crest and mesoderm, while the sensory elements derive from ectodermal
   thickenings known as placodes. Recent research demonstrates that neural
   crest and placodes have an evolutionary history outside of vertebrates,
   while the vertebrate fossil record allows the sequence of the evolution
   of these various features to be understood. Stem-group vertebrates such
   as Metaspriggina walcotti (Burgess Shale, Middle Cambrian) possess eyes,
   paired nasal capsules and well-developed branchial arches, the latter
   derived from cranial neural crest in extant vertebrates, indicating that
   placodes and neural crest evolved over 500 million years ago. Since that
   time the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton has evolved, including
   different types of bone, of potential neural crest or mesodermal origin.
   One problematic part of the craniofacial skeleton concerns the evolution
   of the nasal organs, with evidence for both paired and unpaired nasal
   sacs being the primitive state for vertebrates.},

   (Mareca strepera) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) females that bred in
   the Suisun Marsh (Suisun) of California, USA, to determine molt site
   selection and wing molt chronology. We attached backpack transmitters
   with global positioning system and global system for mobile
   communications (GPS-GSM) technology to female gadwalls and mallards
   within Suisun and tracked the birds following the breeding season during
   2015-2018. We determined molt locations for 52 female gadwalls and 112
   female mallards. Thirty of the marked gadwall females selected 2 regions
   within southern Oregon-northeastern California (SONEC) to undergo molt;
   16 molted in the Upper Klamath Basin (southern OR) and 14 in the Lower
   Klamath Basin (northeastern CA). A large portion of female mallards
   molted in Suisun (n = 34) and the Sacramento Valley in California (n =
   31) but also used the Upper Klamath Basin (n = 13), Lower Klamath Basin
   (n = 12), and the Yolo-Delta region in California (n = 12). On average,
   gadwalls departed Suisun on 30 July (+/- 17.82 days {[}SD]), and
   mallards departed on 24 July (+/- 22.69 days). Mean start date of molt
   for each species was similar: 27 August (+/- 16.09 days) for gadwalls
   and 26 August (+/- 21.03 days) for mallards. Molt end date was analogous
   for each species as well. Molt ended on average 1 October (+/- 15.52
   days) for gadwalls and on 5 October (+/- 18.34 days) for mallards.
   Gadwalls and mallards showed intraspecific differences in average molt
   start and end date within the 3 main geographical zones: Suisun, Central
   Valley of California (Central Valley), and SONEC. Mean duration of wing
   molt for gadwalls was 34.72 +/- 8.62 days and 41.09 +/- 12.54 days for
   mallards. Both species primarily selected permanent marsh to undergo
   wing molt (gadwalls = 90.4\%, mallards = 63.4\%). Conservation and
   active management of these high-use molting areas used by California's
   primary breeding waterfowl species could enhance postbreeding survival,
   leading to increased breeding waterfowl populations.},

Title = {Demographic response of brown treesnakes to extended population
   suppression},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {From a management perspective, reptiles are relatively novel invasive
   taxa. Few methods for reptile control have been developed and very
   little is known about their effectiveness for reducing reptile
   populations, particularly when the goal is eradication. Many reptiles,
   and especially snakes, are cryptic, secretive, and undergo extended
   periods of inactivity, traits that decrease detection probabilities and
   create challenges in estimating population size or evaluating management
   effects. The brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is a notorious invasive
   species that continues to cause major ecological and economic harm
   following their introduction to the island of Guam after World War II.
   They have been the subject of intensive research on the effectiveness of
   various techniques to control snakes, including the first ever aerial
   system for the distribution of toxic acetaminophen baits for reptile
   control. We provide a cohort-based life table for a cryptic and invasive
   reptile undergoing extended population control using toxic baits from
   March 2017-2020. We also evaluated the effects of single (toxic bait)
   versus multi-tool (toxic bait and live trapping) management efforts on
   population trajectories, and estimated which population vital rates are
   most important for influencing population growth or decline in a treated
   landscape. Treatment of the population with acetaminophen-laced baits
   resulted in an immediate reduction followed by a gradual population
   decline that suggested that eradication was the probable outcome given
   sufficient treatment time but that the period of treatment was decades
   in magnitude. Inclusion of live trapping reduced the predicted time
   required to achieve eradication by more than half. Preventing the
   transition of 1,000-mm snout-vent length (SVL) females to larger sizes
   was predicted to have the greatest effect on population reduction based
   on integral projection modeling. Our results suggest that toxic baits
   are capable of eradicating brown treesnakes in an enclosure, although
   inclusion of trapping reduced overall treatment time required. Tools
   that effectively target females >1,000 mm SVL may have the greatest
   effect on reducing overall treatment timelines.},

Abstract = {The strength of species interactions may have profound effects on
   population dynamics. Empirical estimates of interaction strength are
   often based on the assumption that the interaction strengths are
   constant. Barents Sea (BS) cod and capelin are two fish populations for
   which such an interaction has been acknowledged and used, under the
   assumption of constant interaction strength, when studying their
   population dynamics. However, species interactions can often be
   nonlinear in marine ecosystems and might profoundly change our
   understanding of food chains. Analysing long-term time series data
   comprising a survey over 37 years in the Arcto-boreal BS, using a
   state-space modelling framework, we demonstrate that the effect of
   capelin on cod is not linear but shifts depending on capelin abundance:
   while capelin is beneficial for cod populations at high abundance; below
   the threshold, it becomes less important for cod. Our analysis therefore
   shows the importance of investigating nonlinearity in species
   interactions and may contribute to an improved understanding on species
   assemblages.},

   during explosive breeding events in toads},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Many animals communicate by rapidly (within minutes or seconds) changing
   their body coloration; however, we know little about the physiology of
   this behaviour. Here we study how catecholaminergic hormones regulate
   rapid colour change in explosive breeding toads (Duttaphrynus
   melanostictus), where large groups of males gather and quickly change
   their colour from brown to bright yellow during reproduction. We find
   that both epinephrine (EP) and/or norepinephrine (NE) cause the toads'
   skin to become yellow in minutes, even in the absence of social and
   environmental cues associated with explosive breeding. We hypothesize
   that natural selection drives the evolution of rapid colour change by
   co-opting the functional effects of catecholaminergic action. If so,
   then hormones involved in `fight or flight' responses may
   mechanistically facilitate the emergence of dynamic visual signals that
   mediate communication in a sexual context.},

Title = {An early nimravid from California and the rise of hypercarnivorous
   mammals after the middle Eocene climatic optimum},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Carnivoraforms (crown carnivorans and their closest relatives) first
   occupied hypercarnivorous niches near the dawn of the late Eocene, 40-37
   Ma. This followed the decline or extinction of earlier carnivorous
   groups, Mesonychia and Oxyaenodonta, leaving carnivoraforms and
   hyaenodontan meat-eaters as high trophic level consumers. The pattern of
   this change and the relative contributions of the taxonomic groups has
   hitherto been unclear. We report a new genus and species of the
   sabretoothed mammalian carnivore family Nimravidae, Pangurban egiae,
   from the Eocene Pomerado Conglomerate of southern California, with
   strongly derived hypercarnivorous features. While geochronologically the
   oldest named nimravid in North America, Pangurban egiae is recovered as
   phylogenetically derived, with affinities to Hoplophoneus. This provides
   unequivocal evidence for rapid radiation and spread of nimravid
   carnivores across Asia and North America and constrains the timing of
   early divergences within the family. Pangurban egiae narrows the gap
   between convergent iterations of sabretoothed mammalian carnivores and
   demonstrates swift diversification of the hypercarnivorous nimravids
   during a period of global climatic instability. Furthermore, it
   highlights the top-to-bottom restructuring North American ecosystems
   underwent during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, resulting in
   carnivoraforms taking positions as trophic specialists for the first
   time, a niche they still occupy today.},

Title = {Group augmentation on trial: helpers in small groups enhance
   antipredator defence of eggs},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Mechanisms selecting for the evolution of cooperative breeding are hotly
   debated. While kin selection theory has been the central paradigm to
   explain the seemingly altruistic behaviour of non-reproducing helpers,
   it is increasingly recognized that direct fitness benefits may be highly
   relevant. The group augmentation hypothesis proposes that alloparental
   care may evolve to enhance group size when larger groups yield increased
   survival and/or reproductive success. However, there is a lack of
   empirical tests. Here we use the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher, in which group size predicts survival and group
   stability, to test this hypothesis experimentally by prompting two
   cooperative tasks: defence against an egg predator and digging out sand
   from the breeding shelter. We controlled for alternative mechanisms such
   as kin selection, load lightening and coercion. As predicted by the
   group augmentation hypothesis, helpers increased defence against an egg
   predator in small compared with large groups. This difference was only
   evident in large helpers owing to size-specific task specialization.
   Furthermore, helpers showed more digging effort in the breeding chamber
   compared with alternative personal shelters, indicating that digging is
   an altruistic service to the dominant breeders.},

Abstract = {I observed mobbing of Glaucomys volans (Southern Flying Squirrel), upon
   removal and release from nesting boxes designed for them, by various
   bird species (1-9 total individual birds) on 33 occasions during winter
   surveys for the squirrels in southeast Ohio. I observed instances of
   mobbing by 1-3 species of primary and/or secondary cavity-nesting
   songbirds and woodpeckers. Mobbing behavior included flights within 1-2
   m of a flying squirrel briefly positioned on a tree trunk as well as
   vocalizations. Mobbing episodes lasted 5-180 seconds, which largely
   depended on the amount of time a flying squirrel remained visible before
   retreating into a natural cavity. In light of the mobbing response
   reported here, perhaps more consideration should be given to the
   potential impacts that Southern Flying Squirrels may have on bird
   communities.},

Abstract = {In June 2020, we monitored a nest in Southampton, MA, that contained 2
   Dumetella carolinensis (Gray Catbird) and 3 Turdus migratorius (American
   Robin) eggs. Females of both species alternately incubated the mixed
   clutch, and 2 catbird and 2 robin young successfully hatched and fledged
   from the nest. Adults of both species provided both intra- and
   interspecific parental care (e.g., nestling provisioning, brooding, and
   nest sanitation). The catbirds, in particular, often did not
   preferentially provision their own young. In fact, following earlier
   fledging of the catbird young, an adult catbird continued to visit the
   nest to care for the robin nestlings, including fecal sac removal on at
   least 2 occasions. After the 2 robin young fledged, we did not observe
   any crossover post-fledging care. Our study represents the most detailed
   and protracted account among the very few documented cases of nest
   sharing between these species.},

Title = {Does shading on great argus Argusianus argus feathers create a
   three-dimensional illusion?},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Many animals use shading to infer the three-dimensional (3D) shape of
   objects, and mimicking natural shading patterns can produce the illusion
   of 3D form on a flat surface. Over 150 years ago, Charles Darwin noted
   that the ocelli (eyespots) on the feathers of the great argus Argusianus
   argus, when held vertically during courtship displays to females, were
   perfectly shaded to resemble 3D hemispheres to human viewers. We tested
   whether these ocelli appear 3D to birds by training chickens Gallus
   gallus domesticus to select images of either convex or concave shapes
   using shading cues, and then presenting them with images of great argus
   ocelli. Chickens successfully learned how to discriminate between convex
   and concave shapes, and treated the great argus pheasant ocelli in the
   same way as convex training stimuli. Our findings are consistent with
   previous studies that birds can perceive 3D shape from shading cues in a
   similar manner to humans. The perception of great argus ocelli as
   consistent with 3D shape by avian viewers suggests that shape illusions
   can play a role in male courtship.},

Title = {Species-specific effects and the ecological role of programmed cell
   death in the microalgae Ankistrodesmus (Sphaeropleales, Selenastraceae)},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Reports of programmed cell death (PCD) in phytoplankton raise questions
   about the ecological evolutionary role of cell death in these organisms.
   We induced PCD by nitrogen deprivation and unregulated cell death
   (non-PCD) in one strain of the green microalga Ankistrodesmus densus and
   investigated the effects of the cell death supernatants on
   phylogenetically related co-occurring organisms using growth rates and
   maximum biomass as proxies of fitness. PCD-released materials from A.
   densus CCMA-UFSCar-3 significantly increased growth rates of two
   conspecific strains compared to healthy culture (HC) supernatants and
   improved the maximum biomass of all A. densus strains compared to
   related species. Although growth rates of non-A. densus with PCD
   supernatants were not statistically different from HC treatment, biomass
   gain was significantly reduced. Thus, the organic substances released by
   PCD, possibly nitrogenous compounds, could promote conspecific growth.
   These results support the argument that PCD may differentiate species or
   subtypes and increases inclusive fitness in this model unicellular
   chlorophyte. Further research, however, is needed to identify the
   responsible molecules and how they interact with cells to provide the
   PCD benefits.},

Title = {Carbon dioxide and blood-feeding shift visual cue tracking during
   navigation in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Haematophagous mosquitoes need a blood meal to complete their
   reproductive cycle. To accomplish this, female mosquitoes seek
   vertebrate hosts, land on them and bite. As their eggs mature, they
   shift attention away from hosts and towards finding sites to lay eggs.
   We asked whether females were more tuned to visual cues when a
   host-related signal, carbon dioxide, was present, and further examined
   the effect of a blood meal, which shifts behaviour to ovipositing. Using
   a custom, tethered-flight arena that records wing stroke changes while
   displaying visual cues, we found the presence of carbon dioxide enhances
   visual attention towards discrete stimuli and improves contrast
   sensitivity for host-seeking Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Conversely,
   intake of a blood meal reverses vertical bar tracking, a stimulus that
   non-fed females readily follow. This switch in behaviour suggests that
   having a blood meal modulates visual attention in mosquitoes, a
   phenomenon that has been described before in olfaction but not in
   visually driven behaviours.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mass capture of flightless geese during the summer is a common trapping
   technique to obtain large numbers of individuals for research and
   marking, but few studies have assessed the impacts of this method on the
   survival of after-hatch-year geese. We evaluated the effects of holding
   time and captured flock size on the survival of >26,000 subadult (second
   yr) and adult (>= third yr) greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons
   frontalis) banded in Alaska, USA, 1999-2017. We constructed models with
   and without capture effects to analyze our band-recovery data and used
   Akaike's Information Criterion to rank our model set. Models that
   included both capture-related variables ranked highest. Longer
   individual holding times negatively affected survival during the first
   year after banding, and effects were greatest during the earliest years
   of our study when holding times were generally longer and protocols to
   minimize negative capture effects were less refined. There was a
   positive relationship between survival and captured flock size. We
   suggest practitioners reduce holding times of geese during mass captures
   to the extent practicable and continually evaluate and refine their
   methods to minimize negative capture effects.},

Volume = {88},
Pages = {149-160},

Abstract = {Marine transport has the potential to alter the geographic range of
   microorganisms through ballast water movement. Recent
   culture-independent studies investigated the bacteriome of ballast
   water, but no prior studies have examined the mycobiome. Here were
   examined 60 ballast and harbor samples from 4 major ports and 5 ocean
   samples using culture-independent techniques to determine (1) the
   composition of harbor and ballast water mycobiomes; (2) if ballast
   contained human and environmentally relevant fungal pathogens; and (3)
   the potential risk of introduction to coastal ecosystems. Results
   indicate that ballast water and harbor water contain a diverse mycobiome
   and that ballast water may contain fungal taxa that are relevant human
   and marine fish pathogens. Fungal genera were identified that contain
   known coral and coastal plant pathogen species; however, species-level
   identification of these potential pathogens could not be conclusively
   resolved. Ballast and harbor mycobiomes contained similar taxa,
   suggesting that environmental filtering may not inhibit the spread of
   fungal taxa between these ecosystems. This study highlights the
   potential risks of ballast movement and suggests further research of the
   ballast mycobiome is needed.},

   in space use because fitness requirements influence resource selection;
   however, details on how phenology affects space use are often only
   cursorily addressed during development of space- and resource-use
   estimates. Moreover, space-use assessments often aggregate distinct,
   phenology-specific behaviors into generalized realizations of biological
   processes, such as reproduction. Therefore, to improve the relevance and
   accuracy of biological inferences for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
   space use at the population level, we defined 12 distinct
   phenology-specific periods to compare and contrast variations in
   space-use estimates. We calculated 1,568 individual space-use estimates
   using dynamic Brownian Bridge movement models for Rio Grande wild
   turkeys (M. g. intermedia; n = 255 females) across Texas, USA, during
   2012-2018. Females in each pre-laying state used larger areas than
   during all other phenological states, suggestive of exploratory
   movements related to reproductive activities and resource acquisition.
   Incubation core areas were consistently <1.5 ha and incubation range
   sizes ranged from 10 ha to 48 ha. Core area and range sizes during the
   brooding period doubled from 15 days after hatch (3.1 ha and 42 ha) to
   30 days after hatch (6.5 ha and 89 ha). Post-breeding and wintering
   period ranges were >30\% smaller than reproductive period ranges. Mean
   daily distance traveled was similar across phenological states except
   during incubation and brooding periods. Our results indicate that
   examining wild turkey space use at identifiable, phenology-specific
   temporal scales will help mitigate against biases in estimates of
   resource selection based on arbitrary phenology definitions that
   aggregate data across multiple, distinct, phenological states.},

Title = {Mammal use of riparian corridors in semi-arid Sonora, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildlife populations in semi-arid regions are increasingly challenged by
   human activities and dependent on the connectivity of riparian corridors
   for access to surface water. The Madrean Archipelago is a biodiversity
   hotspot along the arid United States-Mexico borderlands that support
   both Neotropical and Nearctic wildlife. Infrastructure development
   (e.g., the border wall and the expansion of Mexican Federal Highway 2)
   in this region inhibits wildlife movement along the transnational
   mountain archipelago by disconnecting habitat. To explore the
   relationship between habitat variables and mammal use of riparian
   corridors in northern Sonora, Mexico, we collected data from 19
   motion-sensitive cameras between October 2018 and April 2019 and used
   single-season occupancy models and Royle-Nichols abundance estimation
   models to analyze our data. We recorded 21 species of mammals, including
   the first sighting of jaguar (Panthera onca) in this region in 25 years.
   River characteristics (distance from river, riparian corridor width,
   water availability), remoteness (distance from highway, productivity,
   elevation), and topographic variety (vertical elevation difference)
   influenced patterns of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of
   mammals >1 kg, but the strength and direction of these relationships
   varied by species. Additionally, intermittently wet desert washes were
   comparable in species richness to the perennial system. These results
   highlight the importance of examining physical and biological aspects of
   habitat. This is especially true when identifying corridors where
   mitigation structures should be placed to improve wildlife connectivity
   in biodiversity hotspots like the Madrean Archipelago and semi-arid
   ecosystems worldwide.},

Title = {Branching coral morphology affects physiological performance in the
   absence of colony integration},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {For nearly 50 years, analyses of coral physiology have used small coral
   fragments (nubbins) to make inferences about larger colonies. However,
   scaling in corals shows that linear extrapolations from nubbins to whole
   colonies can be misleading, because polyps in nubbins are divorced of
   their morphologically complex and physiologically integrated corallum.
   We tested for the effects of integration among branches in determining
   size-dependent calcification of the coral Pocillopora spp. under
   elevated P<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF>. Area-normalized net calcification
   was compared between branches (nubbins), aggregates of nubbins (complex
   morphologies without integration) and whole colonies (physiologically
   integrated) at 400 versus approximately 1000 mu atm
   P<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF>. Net calcification was unaffected by
   P<INF>CO<INF>2</INF></INF>, but differed among colony types. Single
   nubbins grew faster than whole colonies, but when aggregated, nubbins
   changed calcification to match whole colonies even though they lacked
   integration among branches. Corallum morphology causes the phenotype of
   branching corals to differ from the summation of their branches.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The causes and consequences of the evolution of placentotrophy
   (post-fertilization nutrition of developing embryos of viviparous
   organisms by means of a maternal placenta) in non-mammalian vertebrates
   are still not fully understood. In particular, in the fish family
   Poeciliidae there is an evolutionary link between placentotrophy and
   superfetation (ability of females to simultaneously bear embryos at
   distinct developmental stages), with no conclusive evidence for which of
   these two traits facilitates the evolution of more advanced degrees of
   the other. Using a robust phylogenetic comparative method based on
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of adaptive evolution and data from 36
   poeciliid species, we detected a clear causality pattern. The evolution
   of extensive placentotrophy has been facilitated by the preceding
   evolution of more simultaneous broods. Therefore, placentas became
   increasingly complex as an adaptive response to evolutionary increases
   in the degree of superfetation. This finding represents a substantial
   contribution to our knowledge of the factors that have shaped placental
   evolution in poeciliid fishes.},

Title = {Integrating dispersal, breeding and abundance data with graph theory for
   the characterization and management of functional connectivity in
   amphibian pondscapes},

Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Robust assessment of functional connectivity in amphibian
   population networks is essential to address their global decline. The
   potential of graph theory to characterize connectivity among amphibian
   populations has already been confirmed, but the movement data on which
   modelled graphs rely are often scarce and inaccurate. While
   probabilistic methods that account for intraspecific variability in
   dispersal better reflect the biological reality of functional
   connectivity, they must be informed by systematically recorded
   individual movement data, which are difficult to obtain for secretive
   taxa like amphibians. Objectives Our aim is to assess the applied
   potential of probabilistic graph theory to characterize overall
   connectivity across amphibian pondscapes using fine-scale
   capture-recapture data, and to inform conservation management based on
   the role of ponds on functional connectivity. Methods We monitored an
   amphibian community in a pondscape located in a Spanish ``dehesa{''} for
   2 years. Photoidentification was used to build capture histories for
   individuals of six species, from which dispersal kernels and population
   sizes were estimated to model probabilistic graphs. Results We obtained
   kernels of variable robustness for six species. Node importance for
   connectivity varied between species, but with common patterns such as
   shared road crossing areas and the presence of coincident interconnected
   pond clusters. Conclusions The combination of photoidentification,
   capture-recapture data and graph theory allowed us to characterize
   functional connectivity across the pondscape of study accounting for
   dispersal variability and identify areas where conservation actions
   could be most efficient. Our results highlight the need to account for
   interspecific differences in the study and management of amphibian
   pondscapes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Effective species management and conservation require knowledge of
   species distribution and status. We used point-transect distance
   sampling surveys of the endangered palila (Loxioides bailleui), a
   honeycreeper currently found only on the Island of Hawai'i, USA, to
   generate robust estimates of total abundance and simultaneously model
   the distribution, abundance, and spatial correlation of the species as a
   density surface model (DSM). Point-transect distance sampling is a
   widely applied method to estimate bird densities accounting for
   imperfect detection probability. For the DSM we used a generalized
   additive model framework and soap film smoothers to control the effects
   of boundary features. This modeling approach allowed us to account for
   imperfect detection and propagate detection probability uncertainty. We
   compared the uncertainty in palila abundance estimates using standard
   point-transect distance sampling to estimates from the DSM. The DSM,
   accounting for both distance-sampling-derived detection probability
   variance and the generalized additive model density estimate variance,
   did not improve population estimator precision; however, it provided
   insight into the species' distribution, density, and uncertainty. We
   also applied excursion sets analysis to objectively identify areas where
   the species occurs in high densities. The 2017 global population of
   <2,000 individuals was limited to an excursion area of 1,500 ha. Our
   findings can help management and regulatory agencies by simultaneously
   mapping a species' distribution and density, improving survey protocols,
   and providing information important to species conservation.},

   science determined through retroductive and inductive hypotheses. Such
   recommendations are not frequently tested, potentially resulting in the
   implementation of unreliable practices for management of imperiled
   species. The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) is an
   imperiled shrubland-obligate species whose recovery efforts include
   habitat management and restoration. Researchers suggest former best
   management practices for the species may result in ecological traps and
   new recommendations have been developed. We evaluated these newly
   revised best management practices designed to retain higher tree canopy
   closure to promote New England cottontails without encouraging eastern
   cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus). We compared New England and eastern
   cottontail density between management plots (tree canopy thinned with
   all downed trees left on the ground, with or without invasive shrub
   treatment) and control plots (unmanaged) and examined the influence of
   management on resource selection and survival. Management strategies
   retaining higher canopy closure promoted stronger selection by New
   England cottontails than by eastern cottontails. Catch per unit effort
   of New England cottontails was greater than for eastern cottontails in
   management plots (P = 0.002). For both species, the proportion of the
   95\% home range overlapping managed areas was greater than the
   proportion of managed area in the habitat patch; however, for the 50\%
   core area of the home range, this was only true for New England
   cottontails. When post-treatment canopy cover was >75\%, New England
   cottontails selected canopy-thinning treatments without invasive shrub
   removal over unmanaged areas, but selection by eastern cottontails was
   unaffected by management treatment or canopy cover. Survival probability
   of both species was high and uncorrelated with time spent in management
   areas. Survival probability decreased as the average distance a rabbit
   moved in a 7-day period increased. Our results illustrate the need to
   revise management strategies that emphasize eliminating canopy cover
   when improving New England cottontail habitat is an objective,
   particularly where they are sympatric with eastern cottontails.},

   relationships and future perspectives},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {275-298},
Abstract = {Aims: We aimed to detect the environmental drivers conditioning plant
   diversity and to predict how modifications in habitat conditions and
   ongoing global warming could lead to vegetation changes or biodiversity
   losses in a region especially rich in peatlands despite its relatively
   low latitude. Study area: The study area was located in the Northern
   Apennines, Northern Italy (about 44 degrees 45' N; 10 degrees 20' E).
   The vegetation study was carried out at 12 peatland sites where 206
   plots were set up. Species composition in the 206 plots were recorded in
   the field and classified with cluster analysis. Data on hydrology, water
   chemistry and peat chemistry were collected at a subset of 127 plots and
   statistically analysed by a multivariate ordination method. Species
   richness and evenness were calculated for all plots. Relationships
   between species composition and environmental variables were analysed by
   stepwise multiple regression. Results: The cluster analysis defined 17
   vegetation units. Water table depth represented the major environmental
   factors accounting for vegetation patterns, with the vegetation units
   being grouped in four main blocks based on vegetation physiognomy and
   species composition: Sphagnum hummocks, Sphagnum lawns, fens and pools.
   Water chemistry and peat chemistry both presented moderate variations
   among the vegetation units with mean water pH ranging from 4.9 to 6.3.
   Concentrations of major cations in the pore water showed that all of the
   habitats investigated were influenced by telluric water, with no
   evidence of ombrotrophic conditions. Species richness and evenness both
   presented poor relations with the environment while responses of
   individual species to environmental factors were more informative on
   vegetation changes triggered by climate change. Conclusions: Prolonged
   drought events associated with high temperature in summer months are
   expected to exert a strong impact on peatland vegetation. The main
   effect of climate change on the vegetation of the peatlands investigated
   consists in the spreading of vascular plants at the expense of Sphagnum
   mosses.},

Title = {Urban coyotes select cryptic den sites near human development where
   conflict rates increase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The establishment of coyote (Canis latrans) populations in urban areas
   across North America has been accompanied by increased rates of
   human-coyote conflict. One factor thought to promote physical conflict
   between coyotes and people or pets is the presence of coyote pups near
   natal dens; however, this idea has not been tested, and no multivariate
   study of den selection within cities has occurred. Our objectives were
   to conduct a multivariate analysis of third- (i.e., home range) and
   fourth-order (i.e., den sites) habitat selection at dens and determine
   whether proximity to dens is associated with reports of physical
   conflict with coyotes. We found 120 dens by following coyote trails
   using snow tracking within urban green spaces that comprise presumed
   high-quality habitat for coyotes in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We used
   resource selection functions to assess habitat selection for dens,
   testing variables related to land cover and anthropogenic features at
   the third order, and testing microsite habitat features via paired sites
   at the fourth order. We defined conflict encounters from comments in a
   community reporting database and used general linear models to assess
   their spatial proximity to the nearest den and prevalence during the
   pup-rearing period compared to the rest of the year. Habitat selection
   was strongest at the fourth order, wherein coyotes selected for abundant
   hiding cover, steep slopes, and eastern exposure. The prevalence of
   physical conflict with coyotes increased during the pup-rearing period.
   Conflict also increased near known dens as an overall effect and when
   reports occurred outside of naturalized urban areas. These results
   suggest that coyotes in Edmonton den in green spaces near human
   development in microsites that minimize detection by people via steep
   slopes and dense vegetation. We suggest urban wildlife managers increase
   public safety education about recognition of coyote denning habitat and
   coyote defensive behaviors, especially outside of naturalized urban
   areas, because of the observed increase in physical conflict near dens.},

Title = {Local differences in maximum temperature determine water use among
   desert bighorn sheep populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The availability of surface water is assumed by many wildlife managers
   to be important to desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Yet
   scientific evidence suggests bighorn sheep populations can sometimes
   fulfill their water requirements from forage alone. To investigate how
   water use changes with environmental conditions, we analyzed the surface
   water use and movement patterns of 4 desert bighorn populations across a
   range of meteorological conditions in the Mojave Desert in California,
   USA. We compared ground-based weather data to the daily use of surface
   water sources for 65 known individuals, and examined the movement
   patterns of 18 of these individuals with global positioning system
   collars in relation to visitation to surface water sources. Maximum
   daily temperature most closely predicted the percent of bighorn visiting
   water daily, with visitation increasing approximately 30\% between 30
   degrees C and 40 degrees C. Individual animals switched from a tortuous
   foraging movement to directed movement when accessing surface water. Day
   length, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, solar
   radiation, and the interaction between day length and minimum
   temperature explained the distance desert bighorn were located from the
   nearest water source. Our results indicate that local meteorological
   conditions are important determinants of desert bighorn surface water
   use, and that managers should monitor water sources when the maximum
   daily temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Individual animals meet their
   water requirements with surface water under hot and dry conditions,
   likely because it is temporally or energetically efficient given their
   other resource needs.},

Abstract = {We monitored the reproduction, dispersal, and regeneration of a wild
   population of Castanea dentata (American Chestnut), established from 4
   seed-bearing trees planted in a western Maine forest in 1982. The
   40-year-old parent trees, sourced from wild stock of a relict population
   in northern Michigan, show no obvious signs of blight and have been
   producing viable seeds now for >20 years. Over the course of 2 surveys
   conducted in 2019 and 2020, we mapped and measured 1348 offspring,
   varying in size from seedlings to nearly mature trees. As of October
   2020, the natural spread of this population had expanded to at least 370
   m from the parent trees, with an average dispersal distance of 124 m.
   While previous publications have focused on the scatter-hoarding
   behavior that gave rise to this expanding wild population, we report on
   possible factors affecting their spread, their fate, and prognosis for
   the future. Given the absence of other reproductive populations of
   American Chestnut in the immediate vicinity, our data provide rare
   insights into natural seed dispersal from a known point of origin while
   documenting the return of a functionally extinct species to a northern
   hardwood forest ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Many experimental aquatic ecologists are familiar with the commonly used
   model system Sarracenia purpurea (Purple Pitcher Plant), as this plant
   contains an entire aquatic ecosystem with obligate invertebrates in its
   pitcher-shaped leaves. An obligate herbivore of the Purple Pitcher
   Plant, Exyra fax (Pitcher Mining Moth), consumes plant tissue and chews
   a hole at the base of the pitcher, draining the pitcher of fluid and
   thereby creating unsuitable habitat for obligate aquatic invertebrates.
   Historically, it has been noted that the obligate aquatic invertebrate
   larvae within the Purple Pitcher Plant are incapable of leaving the
   pitcher they were initially deposited in as eggs. The objective of this
   experiment was to determine if larvae of the obligate invertebrate
   Metriocnemus knabi (Pitcher Plant Midge) is capable of emigrating to new
   pitchers when faced with pitcher drainage as a result of damage from the
   Pitcher Mining Moth. We placed midge larvae of varying abundances in
   experimental pitchers that were drained in a way similar to the work of
   Pitcher Mining Moth larvae. After drainage, larval midges were allowed 2
   weeks to emigrate. At the end of 2 weeks, as much as 38.2\% of the
   initial abundance of M. knabi larvae had emigrated out of drained
   pitchers to new, viable, fluid-filled pitchers and survived. We present
   here the first evidence that the obligate Pitcher Plant Midge larvae are
   capable of emigration when faced with unsuitable habitat.},

Title = {Sociality, ecology and developmental constraints predict variation in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-155},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Conflicting theories have been proposed to explain variation in relative
   brain size across the animal kingdom. Ecological theories argue that the
   cognitive demands of seasonal or unpredictable environments have
   selected for increases in relative brain size, whereas the `social brain
   hypothesis' argues that social complexity is the primary driver of brain
   size evolution. Here, we use a comparative approach to test the relative
   importance of ecology (diet, foraging niche and migration), sociality
   (social bond, cooperative breeding and territoriality) and developmental
   mode in shaping brain size across 1886 bird species. Across all birds,
   we find a highly significant effect of developmental mode and foraging
   niche on brain size, suggesting that developmental constraints and
   selection for complex motor skills whilst foraging generally imposes
   important selection on brain size in birds. We also find effects of
   social bonding and territoriality on brain size, but the direction of
   these effects do not support the social brain hypothesis. At the same
   time, we find extensive heterogeneity among major avian clades in the
   relative importance of different variables, implying that the
   significance of particular ecological and social factors for driving
   brain size evolution is often clade- and context-specific. Overall, our
   results reveal the important and complex ways in which ecological and
   social selection pressures and developmental constraints shape brain
   size evolution across birds.},

Title = {Is drift `directional'? Unequal breeding sex ratio revisited},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {347-354},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Unequal breeding sex ratio can significantly reduce effective population
   size, allowing a rare neutral allele to jump to a high frequency through
   genetic drift. However, this one-way alteration to allele frequency
   appears inconsistent with the concept that drift is non-directional.
   Based on binomial sampling distribution, this study developed a method
   to directly and exhaustively measure drift by calculating the mean
   deviation of change in allele frequency, then applied it to cases of
   unequal breeding sex ratio. The result shows that, under those cases,
   (1) the mean deviation can always be divided into two halves that are
   equal in size but opposite in direction; (2) each half consists of one
   or several categories represented by various allele proportions in the
   rare sex; (3) this proportion is another factor that determines the
   outcome of drift, in addition to effective population size and allele
   frequency; (4) drift is non-directional on a global scale, but whether
   an allele will drift up or down can be predicted based on the above
   factors. This method enables us to dissect every component of the
   expected change in allele frequency caused by drift and to find out the
   combined effect of population size, allele frequency and allele
   proportion in the rarer sex under neutrality but unequal breeding sex
   ratio.},

Abstract = {Zooplankton play a key role in aquatic ecosystems constituting an
   essential intermediate component in aquatic food webs. Cladocerans in
   particular are widely studied as model of generalist filter feeders. At
   the regional level, the cladoceran Daphnia spinulata is found in
   numerous habitats with wide conductivity range (160 mu S cm(-1) to
   14.000 mu S cm(-1)), but information about the species's tolerance range
   or life history is scarce. Our objective was to generate essential
   information about D. spinulata's life history and the main parameters
   related to two contrasting salinity levels representative of water
   bodies of the pampean plain. Results obtained in laboratory bioassays
   showed that individuals at low conductivity (700 mu S cm(-1)) had more
   moults, a lower mortality and a higher life expectancy at birth, a
   higher generation time, and an earlier peak density than those at
   high-conductivity treatments (5000 mu S cm(-1)). The maximum density
   reached was similar for both conductivities indicating a similar growth
   capability attained by different strategies. Moreover, the results
   indicated that D. spinulata at different conductivities was able to
   reproduce, with the offspring thus contributing to population growth.
   This study provided a knowledge of the life history strategies of this
   endemic cladoceran at two different conductivities, thus generating
   crucial information on the population dynamics and for evaluating the
   species's role as a possible salinity indicator in pampean water bodies.
   Nevertheless, future investigations will be necessary in order to
   identify the absolute limits of tolerance and the optimum conductivity
   for this species and determinate which stressors will act as a mictic
   stimuli.},

Abstract = {A new genus of Neotropical Satyrinae butterflies, Viloriodes Pyrcz \&
   Espeland gen. n. is described in the Pedaliodes Butler complex
   comprising 11-13 genera and more than 400 species. Support for the new
   genus is provided by a phylogenetic analysis based on target enrichment
   (TE) data including 618 nuclear loci with a total of 248,940
   nucleotides, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
   (COI). Five species, whose DNA sequences were obtained by TE during this
   study, form a strongly supported clade sister to the large clade
   comprising Pedaliodes and four other genera. Complementary COI analysis
   confirms the monophyly of Viloriodes gen. n., with the above five plus
   eight other species clustering in highly supported clades in both
   Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses, and a TE + COI
   concatenated tree. Based on molecular and morphological data, 30 species
   are assigned to Viloriodes gen. n. The new genus can be recognized by a
   set of subtle morphological characteristics of colour patterns and male
   and female genitalia. An analysis of divergence times indicates that
   Viloriodes gen. n. and Steromapedaliodes Forster separated around 5.9
   Mya. Viloriodes gen. n. has a wider geographic distribution than any
   other genus of the Pedaliodes complex, being found from central Mexico
   to northern Argentina and to the Guyana Shield, typically occurring at
   lower elevations than Pedaliodes.},

Title = {A tale of two populations: vital rates of fishers in British Columbia,
   Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fishers (Pekania pennanti) are a forest-dependent carnivore of
   conservation concern in British Columbia, Canada. Ecological, spatial,
   and genetic evidence suggests that there are 2 distinct populations
   (Boreal and Columbian) that occur in forests at low to moderate
   elevations in the boreal and central interior regions of the province.
   In British Columbia, fishers occur at low densities relative to other
   parts of their range in North America, are trapped for their fur, and
   are sensitive to habitat change. Despite these factors, little
   demographic information exists to assist with management decisions for
   these populations. We collated and analyzed survival and reproductive
   data from 100 radio-tagged fishers from 5 independent studies conducted
   between 1990 and 2012 in British Columbia: 2 in the Boreal population,
   and 3 in the Columbian population. We also collated litter size data
   from 1 den box study and a translocation project of fishers from the
   Columbian population. Annual survival rates were not significantly
   different between the populations or between males and females; however,
   adult survival rates were higher than subadults (0.79 and 0.63,
   respectively). Subadult females had significantly lower survival rates
   than other sex or age classes. Reproductive rates were significantly
   different between the 2 populations (denning rate = 0.54 {[}Columbian],
   0.82 {[}Boreal]; x over bar \$\textbackslash{}bar\{x\}\$ litter size =
   1.7 {[}Columbian], 2.6 {[}Boreal]). These differences resulted in net
   reproductive rates in the Columbian population that were less than half
   of those in the Boreal population (0.92 kits/reproductive season
   compared to 2.13, respectively). Population growth rates suggest that
   the Columbian population may have been declining during the studies,
   whereas the Boreal population may have been increasing (0.96 compared to
   1.20). Consequently, we suggest that focused and intensive habitat and
   population management for fishers are needed in British Columbia to
   ensure population sustainability, particularly for the Columbian
   population.},

Title = {Summer elk calf survival in a partially migratory population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Decomposing variation in juvenile recruitment is a key component of
   understanding population dynamics for partially migratory ungulates. We
   investigated reproductive parameters of adult female elk (Cervus
   canadensis) with calves at heel, and survivorship, cause-specific
   mortality, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting risk of
   mortality for calves in a partially migratory elk population from
   2013-2016 in Alberta, Canada. Elk calves born to resident mothers had
   45\% lower survivorship on average compared to migrant calves (0.24 vs.
   0.69) and nearly twice the mortality rate (0.37 vs. 0.19) from bears
   (Ursus spp.), the dominant source of mortality. Contrary to our
   predictions, we found that increasing levels of maternal ingesta-free
   body fat were associated with increasing risk of calf mortality,
   indicating predation may have overwhelmed nutritional effects. We found
   no evidence that timing of calf birth or birth weight differed between
   migratory tactics or influenced mortality risk. We found that as
   percentage of cut forest increased, risk of calf mortality marginally
   decreased, which benefited migrant elk that were exposed to more
   clear-cuts compared to residents. Exposure to bear predation risk was
   unimportant during the hiding phase (<= 10 days after birth) for either
   migratory tactic, presumably because neonatal hiding behavior reduced
   vulnerability. In contrast, bear predation risk was important for
   mortality risk after 10 days in age, especially for resident elk calves,
   which were exposed to higher bear predation risk compared to migrants.
   We conclude that relative differences in bear predation between
   migratory tactics are contributing to the dynamics of partial migration
   in this population through additive effects on calf mortality. Thus,
   wildlife managers should anticipate that recovering grizzly bear (U.
   arctos) populations may substantially lower elk recruitment through
   effects on summer calf survival, especially in areas with diverse
   carnivore assemblages.},

Abstract = {This paper mainly explores the complex impacts of spatial heterogeneity,
   vector-bias effect, multiple strains, temperature-dependent extrinsic
   incubation period (EIP) and seasonality on malaria transmission. We
   propose a multi-strain malaria transmission model with diffusion and
   periodic delays and define the reproduction numbers R-i and (R) over cap
   (i = 1, 2). Quantitative analysis indicates that the disease-free
   omega-periodic solution is globally attractive when R (i) < 1 , while if
   R (i) > 1 > R j ( i not equal j , i , j = 1 , 2 ), then strain i
   persists and strain j dies out. More interestingly, when R-1 and R-2 are
   greater than 1, the competitive exclusion of the two strains also
   occurs. Additionally, in a heterogeneous environment, the coexistence
   conditions of the two strains are (R) over cap (1) > 1 and (R) over cap
   (2) > 1 . Numerical simulations verify the analytical results and reveal
   that ignoring vector-bias effect or seasonality when studying malaria
   transmission will underestimate the risk of disease transmission.},

Title = {Piping plover chick ecology following landscape-level disturbance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Population declines of disturbance-dependent species due to suppression
   of natural disturbances are realized across ecosystems. The piping
   plover (Charadrius melodus; plover), a disturbance-dependent and
   conservation-reliant shorebird that nests on sandy beaches and barrier
   islands on the Atlantic Coast, was listed under the United States
   Endangered Species Act in 1986. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy landed on Fire
   and Westhampton islands, barrier island nesting sites for plovers in New
   York, USA. Hurricane Sandy was a natural disturbance in this system,
   creating abundant nesting habitat. The number of chicks produced by a
   pair, or a population, is a direct measure of reproductive output, and
   gaining a better understanding of productivity and chick behavior
   following large-scale habitat creation may improve plover habitat
   management and potentially species persistence. We evaluated the effects
   of landscape features on habitat selection, behavior, and survival of
   plover broods using logistic regression, generalized linear mixed
   effects models, and survival models. Plover broods selected flatter
   sites with less dense vegetation than available at random. Chick
   foraging rates were highest in moist substrates and were lower in areas
   of higher nesting plover density. Chick survival was greater for broods
   that hatched earlier in the breeding season and increased as chicks
   aged. Generally, providing access to sites with flatter, moist
   substrates will likely result in higher quality brood rearing habitat on
   the landscape. Ultimately, vegetation removal and habitat management may
   be needed to reduce plover nesting density and ensure sufficient
   habitat, which may in turn improve plover chick survival. Moreover,
   sustaining natural landscape disturbances such as those resulting from
   storms, and not taking actions to prevent hurricane-created overwash,
   will allow these landscape features to persist.},

Title = {Is direct bodyguard manipulation a parasitoid-induced stress sleep? A
   new perspective},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Bodyguard manipulation is a behavioural manipulation in which the host's
   behaviour is altered to protect the inducer's offspring from imminent
   biotic threats. The behaviour of a post-parasitoid-egressed host
   resembles a quiescence state with a characteristic reduction in motor
   activities like feeding, locomotion, respiration, and metabolic rate.
   Yet, they respond aggressively through a defensive response when
   disturbed, which ensures better fitness for the parasitoid's offspring.
   The behavioural changes in the parasitized host appear after the
   parasitoid egression. Several hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate
   how the parasitized host's behaviour is manipulated for the fitness
   benefits of the inducers, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. We
   review evidence to explain the behavioural changes and their mechanism
   in the parasitized hosts. The evidence suggests that parasitoid
   pre-pupal egression may drive the host to stress-induced sleep. The
   elevated octopamine concentration also reflects the stress response in
   the host. Given the theoretical links between the behavioural and the
   physiological changes in the post-parasitoid-egressed host and
   stress-induced sleep of other invertebrates, we suggest that behavioural
   studies combined with functional genomics, proteomics, and histological
   analyses might give a better understanding of bodyguard manipulation.},

Title = {Females alter their mate preferences depending on hybridization risk},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Mating with another species is often maladaptive because it generally
   results in no or low-fitness offspring. When hybridization is
   sufficiently costly, individuals should avoid mating with
   heterospecifics even if it reduces their ability to mate with
   high-quality conspecifics that resemble heterospecifics. Here, we used
   spadefoot toads, Spea multiplicata, to evaluate whether females alter
   their preferences for conspecific male sexual signals (call rate)
   depending on heterospecific presence. When presented with conspecific
   signals against a background including both conspecific and
   heterospecific signals, females preferred male traits that were most
   dissimilar to heterospecifics-even though these signals are potentially
   associated with lower-quality mates. However, when these same females
   were presented with a background that included only conspecific signals,
   some females switched their preferences, choosing conspecific signals
   that were exaggerated and indicative of high-quality conspecific mates.
   Because only some females switched their preferences between these two
   chorus treatments, there was no population-level preference for
   exaggerated conspecific male signals in the absence of heterospecifics.
   These results show that hybridization risk can alter patterns of mate
   choice and, consequently, sexual selection on male signals. Moreover,
   they emphasize that the strength and expression of reproductive barriers
   between species (such as mate choice) can be context-dependent.},

Title = {Changes in invertebrate food web structure between high- and
   low-productivity environments are driven by intermediate but not
   top-predator diet shifts},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Predator-prey interactions shape ecosystem stability and are influenced
   by changes in ecosystem productivity. However, because multiple biotic
   and abiotic drivers shape the trophic responses of predators to
   productivity, we often observe patterns, but not mechanisms, by which
   productivity drives food web structure. One way to capture mechanisms
   shaping trophic responses is to quantify trophic interactions among
   multiple trophic groups and by using complementary metrics of trophic
   ecology. In this study, we combine two diet-tracing methods: diet DNA
   and stable isotopes, for two trophic groups (top predators and
   intermediate predators) in both low- and high-productivity habitats to
   elucidate where in the food chain trophic structure shifts in response
   to changes in underlying ecosystem productivity. We demonstrate that
   while top predators show increases in isotopic trophic position (delta
   N-15) with productivity, neither their isotopic niche size nor their DNA
   diet composition changes. Conversely, intermediate predators show clear
   turnover in DNA diet composition towards a more predatory prey base in
   high-productivity habitats. Taking this multi-trophic approach
   highlights how predator identity shapes responses in predator-prey
   interactions across environments with different underlying productivity,
   building predictive power for understanding the outcomes of ongoing
   anthropogenic change.},

Title = {Attractiveness of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) to faeces from

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Dung beetles are predominantly coprophagous and use mammalian faeces as
   their main food resource and for offspring rearing. However, these
   resources are generally ephemeral and scarce. The objective of this
   study was to verify the attractiveness to dung beetles of the faeces of
   nine native mammal species of the Cerrado biome in different trophic
   guilds. This study was conducted during the rainy season (October 2016
   to March 2017) in two sensu stricto areas of the Cerrado in the Brasilia
   National Park (PNB), Federal District, Brazil. Pitfalls containing
   faeces of nine mammals native to the region were used as bait (from
   three herbivores, three carnivores and three omnivores) for the
   collection of dung beetles. We collected 203 individuals and 19 species,
   and the most abundant species were Uroxys aff. thoracalis, Oxysternon
   palemo, Coprophanaeus spitzi and Diabroctis mirabilis. The most
   attractive faecal bait was from the omnivorous Chrysocyon brachyurus
   (32.67\% of the individuals and 13 species). This study reveals
   variation in the attraction of dung beetles to native mammal dung of the
   Cerrado, with more abundance in the faeces of omnivores and carnivores
   and less in the faeces of herbivores. The species composition in the
   carnivore baits did not differ from that of the omnivore baits. These
   data indicate that changes in Scarabaeinae assemblages result from
   changes in mammal species such as those that have occurred in the
   Cerrado biome with the conversion to cattle production, which in recent
   years has caused intense fragmentation of habitats, expansion of
   agricultural and livestock activities and the introduction of exotic
   species. The mammal C. brachyurus, vulnerable to extinction in Brazil,
   should be a focus for future research, since its faeces support a great
   diversity of dung beetles in the Cerrado.},

   effort has been made to verify that P<INF>crit</INF> measurements, the
   vast majority of which are obtained using respirometry in resting
   animals, actually reflect the predictions of zero aerobic scope and a
   transition to increasing reliance on anaerobic ATP production. To test
   these predictions, we compared aerobic scope and levels of whole-body
   lactate at oxygen partial pressures (P<INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF>s)
   bracketing P<INF>crit</INF> obtained in resting fish during progressive
   hypoxia in the tidepool sculpin, Oligocottus maculosus. We found that
   aerobic scope falls to zero at P<INF>crit</INF> and, in resting fish
   exposed to P<INF>O<INF>2</INF></INF>s < P<INF>crit</INF>, whole-body
   lactate accumulated pointing to an increased reliance on anaerobic ATP
   production. These results support the interpretation of P<INF>crit</INF>
   as a key oxygen threshold at which aerobic scope falls to nil and, below
   P<INF>crit</INF>, survival is time-limited based on anaerobic metabolic
   capacity.},

Title = {Influence of roads on space use by European hares in different

Abstract = {Context Roads are ubiquitous in human inhabited landscapes, and can
   impact animal movement and population dynamics, due to barrier effects,
   road mortality, but also by providing resources at road verges. Thus, we
   need a better understanding of how roads, in interaction with seasonal
   changes in habitat structure, affect space use and habitat selection of
   the animals that persist in these landscapes. Objectives Here, we used
   the European hare (Lepus europaeus) as model species to investigate how
   human-induced changes in landscape composition-measured as road density,
   land cover type, and field size-affect home range location, seasonal
   habitat selection and road crossings, which are likely to correlate with
   wildlife-vehicle collision risk. Methods We collected > 240,000 GPS
   positions of 90 hares from three populations (one in Denmark and two in
   Germany) that differed regarding agricultural intensification and road
   density. Using this data, we analyzed home range location and habitat
   selection (using step-selection functions) in relation to roads, habitat
   composition, and seasonality, and quantified how these factors affected
   road crossings by hares. Results In comparatively more heterogeneous
   landscapes, hares established home ranges in areas with lower road
   densities compared to the surrounding area, but not in more simple
   landscapes. Moreover, hares generally avoided main roads and selected
   for minor roads during the vegetation growth seasons, especially in
   areas with comparatively less heterogeneous habitat structure. Hares
   crossed more main roads when moving greater distances, with movement
   distances being comparatively larger in simpler landscapes. Conclusions
   Our findings emphasize that it is important to distinguish between road
   types, as different roads can have different impacts on animals (e.g.,
   small roads providing foraging opportunities via roadside vegetation and
   large roads being avoided). Moreover, animals in comparatively more
   heterogeneous landscapes are better able to adjust their habitat
   selection to avoid main roads than animals inhabiting simpler
   landscapes. More generally, homogenous landscapes increase the space use
   requirements of animals, leading to increased probability of road
   crossings, which in turn might affect population dynamics via increased
   road mortality risk.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Habitat fragmentation is a leading threat to biodiversity, yet
   the impacts of fragmentation on most taxa, let alone interactions among
   those taxa, remain largely unknown. Objectives We studied how three
   consequences of fragmentation-reduced patch connectivity, altered patch
   shape, and edge proximity-impact plant-dwelling mite communities and
   mite-plant-fungus interactions within a large-scale habitat
   fragmentation experiment. Methods We sampled mite communities from the
   leaves of Quercus nigra (a plant species that has foliar domatia which
   harbor fungivorous and predacious mites) near and far from edge within
   fragments of varying edge-to-area ratio (shape) and connectivity via
   corridors. We also performed a mite-exclusion experiment across these
   fragmentation treatments to test the effects of mite presence and fungal
   hyphal abundance on leaf surfaces. Results Habitat edges influenced the
   abundance and richness of leaf-dwelling mites; plants closer to the edge
   had higher mite abundance and species richness. Likewise, hyphal counts
   were higher on leaves near patch edges. Despite both mite and fungal
   abundance being higher at patch edges, leaf hyphal counts were not
   impacted by mite abundance on those leaves. Neither patch shape nor
   connectivity influenced mite abundance, mite species richness, or the
   influence of mites on leaf surface fungal abundance. Conclusion Our
   results suggest that mites and foliar fungi may be independently
   affected by edge-structured environmental gradients, like temperature,
   rather than trophic effects. We demonstrate that large-scale habitat
   fragmentation and particularly edge effects can have impacts on multiple
   levels of microscopic communities, even in the absence of cascading
   trophic effects.},

Title = {Fishes of Northern New York and the Adirondacks},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1-46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the fishes of northern New York can help with conservation
   planning and landscape interpretations. This report draws from fish
   surveys from the 1930s to 2018 to summarize and interpret the
   distribution of fishes in the region surrounding and including the
   Adirondacks. The study area, with its broad elevational gradient,
   includes lowland and upland ecoregions, for which we compare fish
   assemblages. Lowlands are the waters downstream of historic barriers to
   migration into the uplands (elevations of 62-215 m, depending on
   landscape slope). Uplands are the waters at higher elevations than the
   lowlands (above 168 m) that include the transitional and Adirondacks'
   elevations (above 305 m). In total, 114 fish species and 2 hybrids have
   been documented in northern New York; for the sake of convenience, the
   hybrids are tabulated as species here. Of the 116 taxa, 111 are in
   lowlands. Eighty percent are native to New York State, although patterns
   of nativity differ between the lowlands and the uplands. Specifically,
   natives make up 80\% of the lowland group and 51\% of upland group. Many
   of the species that are native to the lowlands do not occur naturally in
   the uplands, becoming widespread there only after transferal or
   stocking. The continued expansion of non-native species has caused
   changes in fish communities and losses of native species. In the
   uplands, 3 native species have been lost and 3 others dramatically
   reduced. In the lowlands, there has been relatively little change in
   species status over time. Brief annotations are provided for each of the
   116 taxa, including summaries of recent studies, changes in their status
   before and after December 1989, and proposed conservation
   classifications.},

Abstract = {Marine macroalgae are a polyphyletic group of photosynthetic eukaryotes
   and play critical roles in oxygen production, as primary producers, and
   in providing physical habitat structure. They harbor diverse microbial
   communities, including mutualistic, commensalistic, and parasitic fungi.
   These fungi may be obligately or facultatively marine and symbiotic. In
   this investigation, we isolated endophytic algicolous fungi from marine
   macroalgae collected from 5 intertidal sites in Nova Scotia. Fungi were
   cultured from surface-sterilized algal tissue and identified using ITS
   rDNA barcoding. From 21 marine macroalgal species collected, 11 algal
   species harbored endophytic fungi. We identified 23 endophytic
   algicolous fungi from the Bay of Fundy and Atlantic coasts of Nova
   Scotia. Marine endophytes are a promising new resource for bioactive

Abstract = {In North America, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) has
   experienced precipitous declines from white-nose syndrome. As these bats
   become rare and difficult to capture, additional day-roost assessments
   to inform management may fill gaps in our understanding, particularly in
   habitats and regions where such roosts have never been surveyed. Over 2
   summers, we radio-tracked 16 individuals from a maternity colony on Long
   Island, NY, in a small forested patch surrounded by development and
   ocean. These bats disproportionately selected small, suppressed Robinia
   pseudoacacia (Black Locust) trees or snags for roosting. Generally,
   roosts occurred within the interior or edges of this forest patch,
   rather than surrounding suburbia, reinforcing the hypothesis that
   Northern Long-eared Bats are forest adapted. Our study shows even small
   tracts of forest in coastal, urban areas may have conservation value in
   providing day-roost and foraging habitat.},

Abstract = {Large quantities of dead wood can be generated by disturbances such as
   wildfires. Dead trees created by disturbances play many critical
   ecological roles in forest ecosystems globally. The ability of deadwood
   to serve its ecological roles is contingent, in part, on the length of
   time trees remain standing following disturbance. Here, we briefly
   outline the results of a 10-year study that aimed to quantify the rate
   of collapse of trees killed in a major wildfire in the wet ash forests
   of mainland south-eastern Australia. We also quantified the factors
   associated with dead tree collapse. Our analyses revealed that 23\% of
   417 measured trees collapsed between 2011 and 2021. The most
   parsimonious model of the factors influencing tree collapse revealed a
   strong effect of diameter; smaller diameter trees were more likely to
   collapse over the 10 years of our study than larger diameter trees. In
   addition, trees in small and large patches were more likely to collapse
   than trees in contiguous forest (where there had been no logging in the
   surrounding area). If current rates of tree fall are maintained, then
   many of trees initially measured will have collapsed by 2030. Such
   losses of dead trees will have major negative effects on key values of
   ash-type forests such as biodiversity conservation.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {With extensive and ongoing human development in coastal areas, effective
   shoreline-protection strategies against erosion and rising sea level
   that also provide natural ecosystem services will become increasingly
   important. Constructed living shoreline marshes can serve as successful
   management solutions when implemented correctly, but studies comparing
   these created estuarine habitats to their natural marsh counterparts are
   needed to assess their ecological functionality. We compared adult
   Palaemonetes pugio (Daggerblade Grass Shrimp) population demographics
   and diets from 13 pairs of living shoreline and natural marsh sites in
   the southwestern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. No significant
   differences were observed in demographics including abundance, weight,
   length, number of gravid females, and egg abundance and quality.
   Gut-content analysis detected significantly more terrestrial debris in
   shrimp from living shorelines, but the omnivorous dietary needs appeared
   met in all marsh sites. Overall, shrimp populations differed more among
   site pairs from different shorescape settings than between created and
   natural marshes from the same settings, suggesting that living
   shorelines are approaching ecosystem functionality similar to natural
   marsh habitats. However, the observed negative effect of agricultural
   land use on shrimp abundance and the discovery of microplastics in gut
   contents from all sites sampled indicate the need for further
   consideration of human impacts in both constructed and natural coastal
   habitats.},

Abstract = {In 2016, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) was listed as
   federally threatened in the United States, due largely to declines from

   Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an
   adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD,
   located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This
   finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal
   Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this
   species in the era of WNS.},

Title = {Hard to predict! No clear effects of home-field advantage on leaf litter
   decomposition in tropical heath vegetation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 12},
Abstract = {The home-field advantage (HFA) hypothesis establishes that plant litter
   decomposes faster at `home' sites than in `away' sites due to more
   specialized decomposers acting at home sites. This hypothesis has
   predominantly been tested through `yes or no' transplanting experiments,
   where the litter decomposition of a focal species is quantified near and
   away from their conspecifics. Herein, we evaluated the occurrence and
   magnitude of home-field effects on the leaf litter decomposition of
   Myrcia ramuliflora (O.Berg) N. Silveira (Myrtaceae) along a natural
   gradient of conspecific litterfall input and also if home-field effects
   are affected by litter and soil traits. Litter decomposition of M.
   ramuliflora was assessed through litterbags placed in 39 plots in a
   tropical heath vegetation over a period of 12 months. We also
   characterized abiotic factors, litter layer traits, and litter
   diversity. Our results indicated the occurrence of positive (i.e.
   Home-field advantage) and negative (i.e. Home-field disadvantage)
   effects in more than half of the plots. Positive and negative effects
   occurred in a similar frequency and magnitude. Among all predictors
   tested, only the community weighted mean C/N ratio of the litterfall
   input was associated with home-field effects. Our results reinforce the
   lack of generality for home-field effects found in the literature and
   thus challenge the understanding of litter-decomposer interaction in
   tropical ecosystems.},

Title = {The origin of modern patterns of continental diversity in Mauritiinae
   palms: the Neotropical museum and the Afrotropical graveyard},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {While the latitudinal diversity gradient has received much attention,
   biodiversity and species richness also vary between continents across
   similar latitudes. Fossil information can be used to understand the
   evolutionary mechanisms that generated such variation between continents
   of similar latitudes. We integrated fossil data into a phylogenetic
   analysis of the Mauritiinae palms, whose extant diversity is restricted
   to the Neotropics, but extended across Africa and India during most of
   the Cenozoic. Mauritiinae diverged from its sister lineage Raphiinae ca
   106 Ma. Using ancestral state estimation and a lineage through time
   analysis, we found that diversity arose globally during the late
   Cretaceous and Palaeocene across South America, Africa and India. The
   Palaeocene-Eocene transition (ca 56 Ma) marked the end of global
   Mauritiinae expansion, and the beginning of their decline in both Africa
   and India. Mauritiinae disappeared from the Indian subcontinent and
   Africa at the end of the Eocene and the Miocene, respectively. By
   contrast, Neotropical diversity steadily increased over the last 80 Myr.
   Taken together, our results suggest that the Neotropics functioned as a
   continental-scale refuge for Mauritiinae palms, where lineages survived
   and diversified while global climatic changes that drastically reduced
   rainforests led to their demise on other continents.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Certain plants exhibit rapid movement in response to mechanical
   stimulation; however, the ecological functions of this behaviour are
   largely unknown. Here, we show that the rapid flower closure of Drosera
   tokaiensis (Droseraceae) in response to mechanical stimulation functions
   as a physical defence against a specialist herbivore Buckleria paludum
   (Pterophoridae) caterpillar. Following feeding damage on fruits,
   flowers, flower stalks and buds by B. paludum, D. tokaiensis closed its
   flowers nine times faster than during natural circadian closure. The
   extent of damage to ovules was significantly reduced when the flowers
   were able to close compared with the condition in which closure was
   physically inhibited by the application of a resin. Nonetheless, flower
   closure had no effect on the feeding damage to stamens and styles and
   promoted further damage to petals. Given that feeding on petals, stamens
   and styles had no significant effect on the number of mature seeds,
   rapid flower closure leading to the protection of ovules had an overall
   positive effect on the reproductive success of D. tokaiensis. Our study
   showed rapid plant movement as a novel case of induced physical defence
   against herbivory.},

Title = {Ranavirus infection-induced avoidance behaviour in wood frog juveniles:
   do amphibians socially distance?},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Hosts may limit exposure to pathogens through changes in behaviour, such
   as avoiding infected individuals or contaminated areas. Here, we tested
   for a behavioural response to ranavirus infection in juvenile wood frogs
   (Rana sylvatica) because the majority of dispersal between populations
   occurs during this life stage. We hypothesized that if infections are
   transmissible and detectable at this life stage, then susceptibles would
   display avoidance behaviours when introduced to an infected conspecific.
   Despite no apparent signs of infection, we observed a greater distance
   between susceptible-infected pairs, compared to pairs of either two
   infected or two susceptible animals. Further, distances between
   susceptible-infected pairs were positively related to the infection
   intensity of the focal exposed frog, suggesting the cue to avoid
   infected conspecifics may become more detectable with more intense
   infections. Although we did not quantify whether the transmission was
   affected by their distancing, our findings suggest that juvenile frogs
   have the potential to reduce terrestrial transmission of ranaviruses

Abstract = {Scleractinian corals are essential ecosystem engineers, forming the
   basis of coral reef ecosystems. However, these organisms are in decline
   globally, in part due to rising disease prevalence. Most corals are
   dependent on symbiotic interactions with single-celled algae from the
   family Symbiodiniaceae to meet their nutritional needs, however,
   suppression of host immunity may be essential to this relationship. To
   explore immunological consequences of algal symbioses in scleractinian
   corals, we investigated constitutive immune activity in the
   facultatively symbiotic coral, Astrangia poculata. We compared immune
   metrics (melanin synthesis, antioxidant production and antibacterial
   activity) between coral colonies of varying symbiont density. Symbiont
   density was positively correlated to both antioxidant activity and
   melanin concentration, likely as a result of the dual roles of these
   pathways in immunity and symbiosis regulation. Our results confirm the
   complex nature of relationships between algal symbiosis and host
   immunity and highlight the need for nuanced approaches when considering
   these relationships.},

Abstract = {While many species of animals can solve food-baited problems, most
   studies are conducted in captivity, which may not reflect the natural
   behavioural and cognitive abilities of wild animals. As few studies have
   explored problem solving of Australian animals generally, we
   investigated the problem solving abilities of native Australian species
   in natural rainforest in the Wet Tropics of Queensland. We baited
   multiple types of puzzles (matchbox task, cylinder task, and tile and
   lever tasks on a Trixie Dog Activity Board) with different food types
   (seeds, fruit, sardines) and placed the puzzles in front of trail
   cameras. We noted the species captured on camera, whether or not
   individuals interacted with the puzzles, the number of interactions with
   puzzles, and whether or not different animals solved them. We found that
   seven species from multiple taxa (mammals, birds, reptiles) could solve
   food-baited problems in the wild, providing the first evidence of
   problem solving in these native species. As problem solving may help
   animals cope with anthropogenic threats, these results provide some
   insights into which Wet Tropics species may potentially be more
   vulnerable and which ones might be better at coping with changing
   conditions.},

Title = {Evaluating risks associated with capture and handling of mule deer for
   individual-based, long-term research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Capture and handling techniques for individual-based, long-term research
   that tracks the life history of animals by recapturing the same
   individuals for several years has vastly improved study inferences and
   our understanding of animal ecology. Yet there are corresponding risks
   to study animals associated with physical trauma or capture myopathy
   that can occur during or following capture events. Rarely has empirical
   evidence existed to guide decisions associated with understanding the
   magnitude of capture-related risks, how to reduce these risks when
   possible, and implications for mortality censoring and survival
   estimates. We used data collected from 2,399 capture events of mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) via helicopter net-gunning to compare daily
   survival probabilities within a 10-week period centered on a capture
   event and evaluated how animal age, nutritional condition (body fat),
   and various handling methods influenced survival before, during, and
   following a capture event. Direct mortality resulting from capture
   efforts was 1.59\%. Mean daily survival was 0.9993 +/- 0.0001 (SE)
   during the 5-week pre-capture window, was depressed the day of capture
   at 0.9841 +/- 0.0004, and rebounded to 0.9990 +/- 0.0008 during the
   5-week post-capture window. Neither capture nor handling had a
   detectable effect on post-capture survival, including handling time (x
   over bar \$\textbackslash{}bar\{x\}\$ = 13.30 +/- 1.87 min), capture
   time of year (i.e., Dec or Mar), tooth extraction, and the number of
   times an animal had been recaptured (2-17 times). Although mortality
   rate was slightly elevated during capture (resulting from physical
   trauma associated with capture), age and nutritional condition did not
   influence the probability of mortality during a capture event. Following
   a capture event, nutritional condition influenced survival; however,
   that relationship was consistent with expected effects of nutritional
   condition on winter survival and independent of capture and handling.
   Overall survival rates 5 weeks before capture and 5 weeks after capture
   were not different. A specified window of time with depressed survival
   following capture and handling was not evident, which contradicts the
   implementation of a predetermined window often used by researchers and
   managers for censoring mortalities that occur after capture. Previous
   notions that censorship of all mortality data in the 2 weeks following
   capture is unwarranted and risks removal of meaningful data. With
   previous evidence guiding our protocols for capture (e.g., reduced chase
   time) and handling (e.g., temperature mitigation), low direct mortality
   and almost undetectable indirect mortality post capture reinforces the
   efficacy of helicopter net-gunning for capture and recapture of mule
   deer in long-term, individual-based studies.},

Title = {Growth of the invasive Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus) under

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus), a perennial monocot plant native to
   tropical Africa, is a major weed in pasture and cropping areas in the
   wet tropical regions of Australia and South Pacific countries. In
   grazing pasture lands, rapid growth and reproduction of unpalatable
   Navua sedge leads to displacement of co-occurring pasture species and
   depletion of livestock carrying capacity and production. Understanding
   the interspecific competitive ability of Navua sedge with co-occurring
   desirable grasses and in response to varying ecological scenarios (e.g.,
   grazing and plant density) is critical for the management of the weed in
   pasture situations. In a glasshouse setting, two co-occurring pasture
   species-humidicola (Urochloa humidicola) and Rhodes grass (Chloris
   gayana) were grown with Navua sedge, in pots using a replacement series
   model. For each Navua sedge weed-pasture species pair, the experimental
   setup comprised of four ratios in two densities under simulated grazing
   and nongrazing conditions of the pasture grasses. Navua sedge growth and
   reproduction was highest when it grew as a monoculture or when
   co-occurring pastures were exposed to simulated grazing as this action,
   reduced the competitiveness of the pasture grasses. Overall and using
   biomass gained, tiller production and relative yield as indices of
   growth dynamics, Rhodes grass was more competitive against Navua sedge
   than humidicola in both grazed and nongrazed conditions especially under
   high plant density. These results suggest the potential to include
   competitive pastures in integrated management strategies for Navua
   sedge, but species selection and grazing practices may influence the
   effectiveness of this approach.},

Title = {Concordant genetic structures of sika deer and Japanese land leeches
   suggest that the current range expansion of Haemadipsa japonica is
   dependent on sika deer migration: A case study from Tochigi Prefecture,
   Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {38},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Haemadipsa japonica is a Japanese land leech that feeds on the blood of
   host animals, mainly the sika deer (Cervus nippon). The distribution of
   H. japonica has expanded since the 1990s, possibly due to sika deer
   population increases. Haemadipsa japonica populations were found in the
   northern and southern regions of Tochigi Prefecture, central Japan.
   Previous investigations reported that these populations are genetically
   differentiated between the north and south, although the sika deer
   distribution extends throughout the northern and southern regions. We
   hypothesized that the migration of sika deer might be limited, thus
   maintaining the two H. japonica genetic groups and restricting its range
   expansion. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the genetic
   structure of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellites
   (nSSR) of sika deer samples collected from Tochigi Prefecture and from
   H. japonica bloodmeal samples (invertebrate-derived DNA; iDNA). The sika
   deer mtDNA presented two haplotypes (G- and A-haplotypes) without a
   clear genetic structure. Conversely, the sika deer nSSR analysis
   indicated clear genetic differentiation between deer in the northern and
   southern regions, corresponding to the two H. japonica genetic groups.
   This indicates that sika deer movement is restricted to narrow regions
   in Tochigi Prefecture. Therefore, we conclude that the current H.
   japonica expansion in the prefecture likely depends on the migration of
   sika deer, only occurring within the northern and southern regions, even
   though this is driven by sika deer migration.},

Abstract = {Vegetation disturbance during infrastructure construction can cause
   serious ecological problems, especially in fragile environments. The
   Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau is an oil industry base in China with a
   fragile ecosystem. Vegetation restoration on the disturbance area can
   effectively control soil erosion and ensure the safety of oil pipelines.
   In the linear disturbance area, surrounding vegetation traits and
   topography may play an important role in vegetation restoration by
   influencing propagules and recruitment microsites. This study aimed to
   reveal the influence of vegetation type and topography on vegetation
   restoration in the disturbance area along the oil pipeline. The results
   showed that 89 species were recorded, and they belonged to 30 families
   and 74 genera. These species were mainly native herbaceous plants,
   especially perennial herbs. The species number and species diversity
   index in the disturbance area had a positive relationship with the
   undisturbed area. The lateral undisturbed vegetation type and species
   reproductive strategies influenced the vegetation restoration in the
   disturbance area. The species that produce a large number of seeds or
   regenerate by rhizome recolonized quickly in the disturbance area.
   However, the shrubs and arbor species that need seeds for recruitment
   will take a long time for restoration. The topographic factor had an
   obvious influence on the vegetation restoration and species diversity in
   the disturbance areas. On the sunny and steep slopes, vegetation
   restoration was difficult and slow, and artificial measures were needed
   to control soil erosion and maintain soil moisture to help seedling
   recruitment and survival.},

   different groups of wetlands supported different birds. There was also
   strong evidence for patterns in daily and seasonal movement patterns of

   waterbirds they support, as each individual had strong fidelity to a
   single wetland. In addition, for Hawaiian coots and stilts, which were
   documented moving among multiple wetlands, a network of wetlands may be
   key for long-term persistence of these endangered species, and
   coordinated regional management of waterbirds as a shared resource could
   provide greater benefits to waterbirds than independent management of

Title = {Dispersal limitations increase vulnerability under climate change for
   reptiles and amphibians in the southwestern United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Species conservation plans frequently rely on information that spans
   political and administrative boundaries, especially when predictions are
   needed of future habitat under climate change; however, most species
   conservation plans and their requisite predictions of future habitat are
   often limited in geographical scope. Moreover, dispersal constraints for
   species of concern are not often incorporated into distribution models,
   which can result in overly optimistic predictions of future habitat. We
   used a standard modeling approach across a suite of 23 taxa of
   amphibians and reptiles in the North American deserts (560,024 km(2)
   across 13 ecoregions) to assess impacts of climate change on habitat and
   combined landscape population dispersal simulations with species
   distribution modeling to reduce the risk of predicting future habitat in
   areas that are not available to species given their dispersal abilities.
   We used 3 general circulation models and 2 representative concentration
   pathways (RCPs) to represent multiple scenarios of future habitat
   potential and assess which study species may be most vulnerable to
   changes forecasted under each climate scenario. Amphibians were the most
   vulnerable taxa, but the most vulnerable species tended to be those with
   the lowest dispersal ability rather than those with the most specialized
   niches. Under the most optimistic climate scenario considered (RCP 2.6;
   a stringent scenario requiring declining emissions from 2020 to near
   zero emissions by 2100), 76\% of the study area may experience a loss of
   >20\% of the species examined, while up to 87\% of the species currently
   present may be lost in some areas under the most pessimistic climate
   scenario (RCP 8.5; a scenario wherein greenhouse gases continue to
   increase through 2100 based on trajectories from the mid-century). Most
   areas with high losses were concentrated in the Arizona and New Mexico
   Plateau ecoregion, the Edwards Plateau in Texas, and the Southwestern
   Tablelands in New Mexico and Texas, USA. Under the most pessimistic
   climate scenario, all species are predicted to lose some existing
   habitat, with an average of 34\% loss of extant habitat across all
   species. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we detected an average
   loss of 24\% of extant habitat across all species, suggesting that
   changing climates may influence the ranges of reptiles and amphibians in
   the Southwest.},

   task},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Transitive inference (TI) describes the ability to infer relationships
   between stimuli that have never been seen together before. Social
   cichlids can use TI in a social setting where observers assess dominance
   status after witnessing contests between different dyads of
   conspecifics. If cognitive processes are domain-general, animals should
   use abilities evolved in a social context also in a non-social context.
   Therefore, if TI is domain-general in fish, social fish should also be
   able to use TI in non-social tasks. Here we tested whether the
   cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher can infer
   transitive relationships between artificial stimuli in a non-social
   context. We used an associative learning paradigm where the fish
   received a food reward when correctly solving a colour discrimination
   task. Eleven of 12 subjects chose the predicted outcome for TI in the
   first test trial and five subjects performed with 100\% accuracy in six
   successive test trials. We found no evidence that the fish solved the TI
   task by value transfer. Our findings show that fish also use TI in
   non-social tasks with artificial stimuli, thus generalizing past results
   reported in a social context and hinting toward a domain-general
   cognitive mechanism.},

Title = {Artificial light at night may decrease predation risk for terrestrial

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) is thought to be detrimental for
   terrestrial insect populations. While there exists evidence for lower
   abundance under ALAN, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One
   mechanism by which ALAN may contribute to insect declines may be through
   facilitating increased predation. We investigated this by experimentally
   manipulating insect-substitute abundance under differential levels of
   light. We used insect-containing birdfeed placed at varying distances
   from streetlights as a proxy for terrestrial insects, inspecting the
   rate of predation before and after dusk (when streetlights are,
   respectively, off and on). We found that there was a significantly
   greater effect of increasing distance on predation after dusk,
   suggesting that predation was actually reduced by greater levels of
   artificial light. This may occur because ALAN also increases the
   vulnerability of insectivores to their own predators. Implications for
   foraging behaviour and alternative explanations are discussed.},

Title = {Selfish herd effects depend on prey crypsis},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Determining why some animals form groups while others remain solitary is
   a longstanding goal in behavioural ecology. Group formation can help
   mitigate predation risk through various mechanisms, including risk
   dilution and group vigilance. The selfish herd hypothesis proposes that
   prey can reduce their risk by minimizing the area around which all
   points in that area are closer to them than to another conspecific (i.e.
   by minimizing their `domain of danger' (DOD)). This hypothesis assumes
   that an individual's predation risk is proportional to the size of its
   DOD; however, the relationship between risk and proximity to
   conspecifics may depend on additional factors. Specifically, approaching
   conspecifics may be costly for prey that rely on crypsis because group
   formation increases detectability. Using plasticine model prey, we
   experimentally manipulated prey coloration as well as the DOD, and then
   tracked their `survival' under natural field conditions. We found that
   an individual's predation risk increased with their DOD for conspicuous
   (red) prey, but decreased with the DOD in cryptic (green) prey. Our
   results are consistent with patterns in natural systems and indicate
   that the relationship between predation risk and DOD depends on
   additional factors like prey coloration.},

Abstract = {Sphaeriusidae (Coleoptera: Myxophaga) is a group of shiny, blackish and
   hemispherical riparian beetles, known for their miniaturized bodies.
   They are worldwide in distribution, but very limited information is
   available about taxonomic and morphological diversity, and natural and
   evolutionary history. The aim of this study is to help fill in these
   gaps. We examined the external morphology of modern representatives
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reconstructed the
   phylogeny of the family using five DNA markers (cytochrome oxidase I,
   18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, CAD and wingless). Our results suggest a larger
   morphological diversity than previously expected, corresponding to the
   deep genetic divergences of principal lineages. We also examined two
   inclusions in 99-million-year-old Burmese amber. The integration of all
   evidence allows us to recognize three genera: the extinct genus \&
   DAG;Burmasporum Kirejtshuk, the newly defined genus Bezesporum gen.nov.
   preserved in Burmese amber (B. burmiticum sp.nov.) and present in the
   modern fauna of Southeast Asia, and the genus Sphaerius Waltl with a
   world-wide distribution. Sphaerius species are morphologically highly
   uniform, with the exception of species from Australia and South Africa,
   which share some characteristics with Bezesporum gen.nov. despite being
   resolved as deeply nested lineages of Sphaerius by DNA data. The
   presence of Bezesporum gen.nov. in Burmese amber and in recent fauna
   indicates that Sphaeriusidae largely maintained their specific
   morphology and specialized riparian lifestyle for at least 100 million
   years. Therefore, they can be considered an exceptionally conserved
   group, with a minimum of evolutionary changes over a long period. Our
   study also demonstrates that the species numbers and fine-scale
   morphological diversity of Sphaeriusidae are larger than expected in
   both the past and present-day faunas. Both were apparently
   underestimated due to the minute body size and cryptic habits of these
   beetles.},

Title = {Effect of population size and selection on Toll-like receptor diversity

Abstract = {The interactions of evolutionary forces are difficult to analyse in
   free-living populations. However, when properly understood, they provide
   valuable insights into evolutionary biology and conservation genetics.
   This is particularly important for the interplay of genetic drift and
   natural selection in immune genes that confer resistance to disease. The
   Galapagos Islands are inhabited by four closely related species of
   mockingbirds (Mimus spp.). We used 12 different-sized populations of
   Galapagos mockingbirds and one population of their continental relative
   northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) to study the effects of genetic
   drift on the molecular evolution of immune genes, the Toll-like
   receptors (TLRs: TLR1B, TLR4 and TLR15). We found that neutral genetic
   diversity was positively correlated with island size, indicating an
   important effect of genetic drift. However, for TLR1B and TLR4, there
   was little correlation between functional (e.g., protein) diversity and
   island size, and protein structural properties were largely conserved,
   indicating only a limited effect of genetic drift on molecular
   phenotype. By contrast, TLR15 was less conserved and even its putative
   functional polymorphism correlated with island size. The patterns
   observed for the three genes suggest that genetic drift does not
   necessarily dominate selection even in relatively small populations, but
   that the final outcome depends on the degree of selection constraint
   that is specific for each TLR locus.},

Abstract = {Secondary contact between incipient species and selection against
   maladaptive hybridization can drive reinforcement between populations in
   contact and result in reproductive character displacement (RCD).
   Resultant divergence in mating traits within a species may generate
   downstream reproductive isolation between populations with displaced and
   non-displaced traits, referred to as the cascade reinforcement
   hypothesis. We examined this hypothesis using three allopatric
   populations of the ground beetle Carabus maiyasanus with a genital
   lock-and-key system. This species shows RCD in male and female genital
   morphologies in populations in contact with the sister species C.
   iwawakianus. In a reciprocal mating experiment using three allopatric
   populations with differences in male and female genital sizes,
   insemination failure increased as the difference in genital size
   increased. Based on the reproductive isolation index, insemination
   failure was the major postmating-prezygotic isolation barrier, at least
   in one population pair with comparable total isolation to those of other
   species pairs. By contrast, there was only incomplete premating
   isolation among populations. These results suggest that RCD in genital
   morphologies drives incipient allopatric speciation, supporting the
   cascade reinforcement hypothesis. These findings provide insight into
   the roles of interspecific interactions and subsequent trait
   diversification in speciation processes.},

Title = {Stand dynamics over 15 years including an outlying population of Fagus
   crenata at the northern margin of its distribution range in Hokkaido,
   Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Fagus crenata, a dominant tree species in cool-temperate deciduous
   broad-leaved forest of Japan, is continuously distributed northward to
   the Kuromatsunai lowland of Hokkaido, beyond which its distribution is
   patchy and isolated. We analyzed stand dynamics over 15 years
   (2006-2021) in a plot (0.75 ha) including one such outlying population
   of F. crenata. At the stand level over 15 years, stem density decreased,
   but aboveground biomass increased. The dominance of F. crenata
   consistently increased in stem density and aboveground biomass. Change
   in the relationship between stem density and mean stem mass indicated a
   successional nature of the stand undergoing self-thinning. Increasing F.
   crenata dominance and the associated compositional shift was due to the
   higher growth rates and lower mortality of F. crenata compared to other
   tree species. Judging from tree-ring analysis, the oldest F. crenata
   tree in the plot established in 1821, but the density of F. crenata
   remained low till ca. 1895. The stand started to be affected by
   persistent disturbance since ca. 1895, with the waves of tree
   establishment and growth release both peaking at ca. 1930-1960. The F.
   crenata population mirrored the pattern of the stand, with more
   pronounced increases during these waves. We suggest that the
   long-lasting episode of tree establishment and growth release over ca.
   1930-1960 was caused by human disturbance, most likely selective logging
   for fuelwood. The results support the ``northward expansion{''}
   hypothesis, implying that F. crenata potentially can become dominant
   beyond the current northern limit of continuous distribution and that
   disturbance facilitates the range expansion.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {121-130},

Abstract = {Reproductive isolation (RI) is a critical component of speciation and
   varies strongly in timing and strength among different sister taxa,
   depending on, for example the geography of speciation and divergence
   time. However, these factors may also produce variation in timing and
   strength among populations within species. Here we tested for variation
   in the expression of RI among replicate population pairs between the
   sister taxa Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and A. arenicola. While the
   former is predominantly outcrossing, the latter is predominantly
   selfing. We focused on intrinsic prezygotic and postzygotic RI as both
   species occur largely in allopatry. We assessed RI by performing
   within-population crosses and interspecific between-population crosses,
   and by raising offspring. RI was generally high between all
   interspecific population pairs, but it varied in timing and strength
   depending on population history. Prezygotic isolation was strongest
   between the closest-related population pair, while early postzygotic
   isolation was high for all other population pairs. Furthermore, the
   timing and strength of RI depended strongly on cross direction. Our
   study provides empirical support that reproductive barriers between
   species are highly variable among population pairs and asymmetric within
   population pairs, and this variation seems to follow patterns typically
   described across species pairs.},

Title = {Ineffectiveness of ants in protecting two sympatric myrmecophilous
   plants against endophytic beetles},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 22},
Abstract = {Extrafloral nectarized plants attract ants, which may protect them
   against herbivory and increase plant fruit set production. In some
   cases, however, ants are ineffective against herbivores. Such events
   occur, for instance, when herbivores present adaptations to avoid ant
   predation. Thus, the outputs of these interactions depend on factors
   such as ant identity, plant phenology and herbivore features. Here, we
   investigated the endophytic florivorous beetles' impact on the
   reproductive success of their host plants, two sympatric Banisteriopsis
   (Malpighiaceae) species, depending on the action of extrafloral
   nectaries (EFNs) visiting ants. We experimentally manipulated the
   presence of ants and herbivores on B. malifolia and B. laevifolia
   species during their reproductive period to test the effectiveness of
   ants-EFNs mutualism on plant fruit set production. We performed
   treatments where three similar inflorescences were selected to be (I)
   control branch, with no manipulations, (II) beetle-free branch, isolated
   with textile cover and (III) ant-free branch, isolated at the base with
   atoxic wax. We hypothesized that endophytic herbivores have a negative
   impact on the plant reproductive success because they escape the action
   of ants (biotic defences). As a result, we observed (i) that florivorous
   Anthonomus beetles have a negative impact on Banisteriopsis reproductive
   success; (ii) ants fail in protecting plants against floral endophytic
   beetles; and (iii) most of the results were species-specific. Our
   results indicate that these systems present very conditional outcomes
   that depend on the intrinsic factors of each plant species.},

Title = {Interspecific variation in fish spatial synchrony relates to
   reproductive traits in a highly fragmented river},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Spatial synchrony occurs when the abundance of populations in different
   locations rise and fall together. This pattern is caused mainly by
   dispersal and spatially correlated environmental stochasticity. The
   levels of spatial synchrony can vary between species, yet little is
   known about which species traits can explain this interspecific
   variation. In addition, traits may have different degrees of influence
   on spatial synchrony levels because of their differences in plasticity.
   We hypothesized that conservative traits-reproductive and
   morphological-will best explain interspecific variation in synchrony,
   while those that may vary according to the environment-feeding and
   habitat preference-will be weakly related to this interspecific
   variation. We evaluated the spatial synchrony of freshwater fish species
   in a highly fragmented river in the Neotropical region and related the
   levels of synchrony to seven predictors: diet, reproductive traits
   (migration, fecundation, parental care and spawning), position in the
   water column, niche breadth, body size, body shape and average temporal
   occurrence of each species. The fish species showed low levels of
   spatial synchrony but a high interspecific variation (correlation values
   ranging from -0.11 to 0.41). We found that this variation was mainly
   related to species' reproductive traits, that is, sedentary species with
   partial spawning and without parental care had higher mean spatial
   synchrony than species with the opposite characteristics. In contrast,
   more plastic traits (diet and habitat preferences) were poor predictors
   of mean spatial synchrony. We speculate that, despite the low spatial
   synchrony found, if extreme impacts continue to occur in the basin at
   the regional scale, it may negatively affect local fish populations in a
   synchronous manner, resulting in increased risk of simultaneous
   declines.},

Title = {Population size and survival of the Brazilian Torrent Frog Hylodes
   heyeri (Anura, Hylodidae)},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Population dynamics are influenced by environmental variability and
   understanding the abundance and persistence of individuals and
   populations is a fundamental goal of population ecology. Thus,
   estimating demographic parameters to identify the factors important for
   population variability is required to understand temporal and spatial
   dynamics. The stream-living diurnal frog Hylodes heyeri is endemic to
   the Atlantic Forest of Brazil in the states of Parana, Sao Paulo and
   Santa Catarina. Here we use capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate
   survival rates and population size of this Brazilian Torrent Frog in
   Pico do Marumbi State Park, Parana. We used CJS models for an open
   population to estimate apparent survival, capturability and population
   size in two streams. The number of captures during each session was
   positively correlated with the minimum weekly temperature. Despite that
   correlation, the most parsimonious model of survival and capturability
   was the constant model for both parameters, resulting in a monthly
   survival rate of 0.38 (95\% CI = 0.30-0.46). Thus, only the abundance of
   the frog differed in the two streams (79 vs. 36), with the population
   size estimate of 187 individuals. Reproduction is seasonal in the
   Brazilian Torrent Frog and so the low monthly survival rate suggests
   that animals move over time rather than die, because 38\% month(-1)
   survival should result in <1\% of the population remaining after 5
   months. Thus, researchers must recognize that populations are labile and
   individuals often move or are washed downstream during heavy rainfall,
   generating apparently rapid local turnover that is unlikely to reflect
   true mortality.},

Abstract = {Which reduced-mixing strategy maximizes economic output during a disease
   outbreak? To answer this question, we formulate an optimal-control
   problem that maximizes the difference between revenue, due to healthy
   individuals, and medical costs, associated with infective individuals,
   for SIS disease dynamics. The control variable is the level of mixing in
   the population, which influences both revenue and the spread of the
   disease. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we find a closed-form
   solution for our problem. We explore an example of our problem with
   parameters for the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus in dairy cows,
   and we perform sensitivity analyses to determine how model parameters
   affect optimal strategies. We find that less mixing is preferable when
   the transmission rate is high, the per-capita recovery rate is low, or
   when the revenue parameter is much smaller than the cost parameter.},

Title = {Post-emergence movements and habitat use by hatchling diamondback
   terrapins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) inhabit estuarine
   environments, and adult females typically nest in coastal uplands.
   Hatchlings emerging from nests overwinter on land and in coastal salt
   marshes, but the proportions that use each land cover type is not well
   documented. From 2019 to 2021, we tracked movements and habitat use of
   hatchlings post-emergence to determine the importance of upland
   overwintering sites to a terrapin population in Rhode Island, USA. In
   late summer and early fall, we attached a radio-transmitter and passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) tag (n = 46) or only a PIT tag (n = 132) to
   carapaces of hatchlings emerging from nests. From August to June, we
   tracked the hatchlings via radio-telemetry and a sweeping PIT tag
   antenna, successfully documenting the fates of 46.6\% of them (n = 83).
   This group included 23 hatchlings that overwintered in the upland, 11
   hatchlings that moved to the salt marsh in fall, 46 predated hatchlings,
   and 3 hatchlings dead from unknown causes. Upon emergence from their
   nests, 68\% of hatchlings dispersed toward water and 32\% of hatchlings
   dispersed away from water. In the uplands, hatchlings typically
   overwintered within about 2 m of habitat edges. Movement in the uplands
   peaked from late August to early October, then ceased until hatchlings
   re-emerged in late April through early June. To protect terrapins, we
   recommend limiting the use of heavy equipment (e.g., mowers, tillers) in
   vegetated uplands near nest sites, and scheduling vegetation management
   for colder months (Nov-Mar in New England, USA) when hatchlings are
   inactive.},

Abstract = {The conversion of Brazilian savanna into exotic pastures leads to the
   loss of dung beetles and a decrease in their contribution to ecological
   functions. We hypothesized that the dung beetle communities from exotic
   pastures would show greater significant differences between climatic
   zones, when contrasted to communities from Brazilian savanna in the same
   region, since dung beetle assemblages in pastures are more simplified.
   We assessed which variables (purpose of production, type of management,
   percentage the habitat per buffer, soil penetration resistance, pasture
   area and herd size) affect more the dung beetle community in exotic
   pastures. We carried out this study in 48 areas of native Brazilian
   savannas and exotic pastures distributed across four bioclimatic zones:
   BZ1, hot with three dry months; BZ2, hot with 4-5 dry months; BZ3,
   sub-hot with 4-5 dry months and BZ4, meso-thermal with 4-5 dry months of
   Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In each BZ, six areas of Brazilian savannas
   and six areas of exotic pasture were selected. In the Brazilian savanna
   areas, the species richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles did
   not differ between the bioclimatic zones, unlike the exotic pastures.
   The composition of the dung beetle community was different between land
   use systems and between bioclimatic zones; the interaction between the
   two factors was also significant. Our results provide evidence that dung
   beetle communities active in exotic pastures are more susceptible to
   climatic environmental variations than communities from more complex and
   stable habitats, such as savannas. Finally, the best model suggested
   that all the six variables combined explained about 91\% of the total
   variability in species composition observed between sampling sites.},

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-232},

Abstract = {This study evaluated how the edge effect influences the structuration of
   fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in swamp forest fragments of the
   subtropical Atlantic Forest, Southern Brazil. Sampling was carried out
   twice in 10 fragments using baited traps placed in sampling units both
   at the forest edge and 50 m within the forest interior, with the
   habitats being defined by a set of environmental variables. Richness and
   abundance were higher for edge habitats with an effect of temperature
   depending on humidity and luminosity. The subfamily/tribe composition of
   fruit-feeding butterflies was segregated between edge and interior and
   was predicted by wind speed and the interaction between humidity and
   luminosity. Fifty meters within the forest interior is not sufficient to
   cause homogenization of butterfly composition between the edge and
   interior of swamp forest fragments, indicating distinct assemblages in
   each habitat. The interior harboured forest-loving butterfly groups
   while the edge harboured generalist sun-loving and common butterflies
   associated with disturbed areas, suggesting resistance to the effects of
   habitat fragmentation. We highlight the importance of using
   fruit-feeding butterfly groups, instead of species, to evaluate edge
   effects. We also suggest that a heterogeneous matrix with native
   habitats and distinct semi-natural land-use systems be maintained to
   manage subtropical areas by increasing connectivity within the
   landscape. Considering the impacts that the Atlantic Forest suffers,
   increased knowledge of modifications caused at small and regional scales
   is crucial for the maintenance of ecological processes and represents a
   tool for conservation planning and environmental agendas.},

Title = {Systematics and evolution of predatory flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae)

Abstract = {Flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are one of the most species-rich
   dipteran families and provide important ecosystem services such as
   pollination, biological control of pests, recycling of organic matter
   and redistributions of essential nutrients. Flower fly adults generally
   feed on pollen and nectar, but their larval feeding habits are
   strikingly diverse. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was
   used to capture and enrich phylogenetically and evolutionary informative
   exonic regions. With the help of the baitfisher software, we developed a
   new bait kit (SYRPHIDAE1.0) to target 1945 CDS regions belonging to 1312
   orthologous genes. This new bait kit was successfully used to exon
   capture the targeted loci in 121 flower fly species across the different
   subfamilies of Syrphidae. We analysed different amino acid and
   nucleotide data sets (1302 loci and 154 loci) with maximum likelihood
   and multispecies coalescent models. Our analyses yielded highly
   supported similar topologies, although the degree of the SRH (global
   stationarity, reversibility and homogeneity) conditions varied greatly
   between amino acid and nucleotide data sets. The sisterhood of
   subfamilies Pipizinae and Syrphinae is supported in all our analyses,
   confirming a common origin of taxa feeding on soft-bodied arthropods.
   Based on our results, we define Syrphini stat.rev. to include the genera
   Toxomerus and Paragus. Our divergence estimate analyses with beast
   inferred the origin of the Syrphidae in the Lower Cretaceous (125.5-98.5
   Ma) and the diversification of predatory flower flies around the K-Pg
   boundary (70.61-54.4 Ma), coinciding with the rise and diversification
   of their prey.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Leafmining insects have extraordinarily intimate relationships with
   their host plants and are therefore prime candidates for potential
   ecological speciation in sympatry, but how commonly this mode of
   speciation occurs in any group of life remains debated. Prior research
   on the pygmy moth (Nepticulidae) genus Ectoedemia using morphology, DNA
   barcoding, and multi-marker phylogenetic approaches left two unresolved
   species complexes, each with each four described species. In this study,
   we thoroughly sampled each complex across a range of host plants and
   localities across Europe. We used a double digest restriction-site
   associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach to clarify species
   boundaries. In the E. rubivora complex, ddRAD data resolved all four
   species, contrary to morphological and COI data, which supports a
   potential scenario of host plant-driven speciation where the host plant
   specialization provides an ecological barrier to hybridization. However,
   we found no indication of host race formation within the oligophagous E.
   atricollis (Stainton). In the E. subbimaculella complex, SNP data only
   partly distinguishes between the parapatric E. subbimaculella (Haworth)
   and E. heringi (Toll), but with some statistical overlap, suggesting
   incomplete lineage sorting which may represent early phases of
   host-based ecological speciation, or admixture following a period of
   isolation.},

Abstract = {Context Semi-arid landscapes are naturally heterogeneous with several
   factors influencing this variation. Fauna responses and adaptations vary
   in xeric environments, and the scale of observation is important.
   Biodiversity monitoring at several scales can be challenging, and
   acoustics are an alternative to this issue. Objectives We investigated
   how audible biodiversity is influenced by environmental factors (e.g.:
   vegetation metrics, climatic variables, etc.) across a fine spatial
   scale, aiming to provide a better understanding of the variation in
   audible species across recording locations placed close together. These
   results will improve the current knowledge on ecoacoustics as a tool for
   measuring ecological processes in this biome, and better inform
   conservation plans. Methods We collected data in the semi-arid region in
   Queensland, Australia placing 24 recorders 200 m apart for 48 h. We also
   sampled environmental attributes (e.g.: temperature and vegetation
   structure metrics) and used acoustic indices in a time-series algorithm
   to categorise sound into classes. Bird species and feeding guilds were
   also identified. Results We found significant differences between
   proximate sensors, demonstrating that soundscape differences occur
   across fine spatial scales. Birds and insects were the predominant
   biophonic sound observed and both groups were associated with shrub
   cover and subcanopy height. Environments with higher shrub and subcanopy
   cover had a higher percentage of all birds' feeding guilds and insects.
   Sixty-three bird species were identified, including a threatened bird
   species in Queensland. Conclusion We show biodiversity is influenced by
   vegetation heterogeneity across fine spatial scales in semi-arid
   regions, identifying which attributes sustain higher levels of
   biodiversity activity. Our study reveals the practicality of acoustic
   surveys for this biodiversity monitoring by covering a large area in 48
   h. However, we caution that scale is an important consideration when
   designing surveys.},

Title = {Tigers on the edge: mortality and landscape change dominate

Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Reductions in the tiger's (Panthera tigris) range in Southeast
   Asia have been concurrent with large infrastructure expansion and
   landscape change. Thailand's Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex
   (DPKY), a landscape of tiger conservation priority, may be particularly
   vulnerable to such changes, necessitating investigations into effects on
   population dynamics. Objectives Evaluate relative effects of landscape
   change scenarios on the probability of tiger persistence in DPKY and
   sensitivity of predictions to spatially-explicit mortality risk,
   landscape resistance, and tiger population density. Methods We utilize
   individual-based, spatially-explicit population modelling to evaluate
   the trajectory of tiger population dynamics across 11 landscape change
   scenarios. Concurrently, we evaluate sensitivity of predictions to
   landscape resistance transformation, maximum population density, and
   spatially-explicit mortality across 20 generations. Results
   Spatially-explicit mortality risk dominated predictions of population
   persistence, frequently resulting in population declines/extinction.
   Adjustment of moderate mortality risk to slightly convex and concave
   forms shifted extinction rates from 46 to 12\% and 85\%, respectively.
   Holding mortality constant at moderate levels, strong negative effects
   were predicted in landscape change scenarios incorporating road
   expansion (46\%-74\% extinction) and construction of dams (52\%). Strong
   negative effects of combined development persisted even when habitat
   restoration measures were applied (96\% extinction). Adjusting
   resistance and maximum population density had marginal effects.
   Conclusions The high sensitivity and variability of predictions to
   spatial patterns of mortality risk suggest a population on a proverbial
   knife's edge. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating
   spatial patterns of mortality risk in population modelling, highlighting
   their potentially dominating influence on population dynamics and
   extinction risk.},

Abstract = {The method of clearing alien species and the nature of the soil seedbank
   influence the quality of restoration outcomes, particularly in
   fire-prone ecosystems heavily invaded with fire-adapted alien species.
   One of the challenges encountered is reducing the likelihood of
   reinvasions when the invading species are equally responsive to
   restoration treatments. By simulating the fire effects that are required
   to regenerate native vegetation, the study tested whether the recovery
   of the native species could be initiated without conducting a prescribed
   ecological burn. In a case study of South African Cape Flats Sand Fynbos
   with a heavy invasion of Acacia saligna, the felled acacia were stacked
   into brush piles, with the litter raked off from the sowing areas and
   the collected seeds were pre-treated for germination. Despite the lack
   of a fire, the sowing of pre-treated seeds on raked plots led to good
   recovery of native vegetation over time. This was indicated by the
   recovery of higher density, cover and richness of native species in sown
   plots compared with unsown treatments. However, the recovery of native
   species had not approached the vegetation structure comparable to a
   reference site after 2 years; that is, only partial fynbos structure was
   recovered. The recruitment of acacia was less dense without fire, as
   hypothesised, and independent of treatment. However, over time, control
   plots had higher acacia cover than other treatments. Despite this sparse
   recruitment of acacia, the acacia seedbank decreased naturally to about
   50\% of the initial size over 2 years in control plots. Raking off
   litter during site preparation removed 50\% of the acacia seedbank which
   decreased slightly thereafter. Consequently, the residual acacia
   seedbank was relatively similar across treatments after 2 and a half
   years. In conclusion, circumventing prescribed burns in heavily degraded
   fynbos ecosystems is a scalable restoration strategy, as recruitment of
   alien acacia was minimized, its seedbank declined significantly, and
   good native cover developed after clearing and sowing.},

Abstract = {The species endangerment listing process is governed not solely by
   causal factors but also by human perception, particularly as it relates
   to observability. Because human perception is important in species
   detection, we hypothesized that ecological indicators associated with
   human perception would change noticeably over time. Testing our
   hypothesis on species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, we
   found that - in general and across (not within) different taxa - body
   mass and geographic range of listed species decreased over time and that
   animals that produced vocalizations and exhibited grouping behavior were
   listed earlier than silent and solitary animals. Specifically, since the
   year of their listing, the body mass of birds, mammals, and reptiles
   decreased, whereas the body mass of amphibians increased; likewise, the
   geographic range of insects, mammals, and plants contracted, whereas the
   geographic range of amphibians, bivalves, birds, and fish slightly
   expanded. Our results demonstrate a temporal shift in endangered species
   listings, suggesting that approaches to listing species may need to be
   reevaluated and methodologically revised.},

Title = {Interpopulation variation in inbreeding is primarily driven by tolerance
   of mating with relatives in a spermcasting invertebrate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The degree to which individuals inbreed is a fundamental aspect of
   population biology shaped by both passive and active processes. Yet, the
   relative influences of random and non-random mating on the overall
   magnitude of inbreeding are not well characterized for many taxa. We
   quantified variation in inbreeding among qualitatively accessible and
   isolated populations of a sessile marine invertebrate (the colonial
   ascidian Lissoclinum verrilli) in which hermaphroditic colonies cast
   sperm into the water column for subsequent uptake and internal
   fertilization. We compared estimates of inbreeding to simulations
   predicting random mating within sites to evaluate if levels of
   inbreeding were (1) less than expected because of active attempts to
   limit inbreeding, (2) as predicted by genetic subdivision and passive
   inbreeding tolerance, or (3) greater than simulations due to active
   attempts to promote inbreeding via self-fertilization or a preference
   for related mates. We found evidence of restricted gene flow and
   significant differences in the genetic diversity of L. verrilli colonies
   among sites, indicating that on average colonies were weakly related in
   accessible locations, but their levels of relatedness matched that of
   first cousins or half-siblings on isolated substrates. Irrespective of
   population size, progeny arrays revealed variation in the magnitude of
   inbreeding across sites that tracked with the mean relatedness of
   conspecifics. Biparental reproduction was confirmed in most offspring
   (86\%) and estimates of total inbreeding largely overlapped with
   simulations of random mating, suggesting that interpopulation variation
   in mother-offspring resemblance was primarily due to genetic subdivision
   and passive tolerance of related mates. Our results highlight the
   influence of demographic isolation on the genetic composition of
   populations, and support theory predicting that tolerance of biparental
   inbreeding, even when mates are closely related, may be favoured under a
   broad set of ecological and evolutionary conditions.},

Title = {Effects of anthropogenic disturbance on group densities of Thomas'

   Sumatra},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecosystems around the globe are facing irreversible impacts due to
   climate change, habitat destruction, hunting, and an ever-increasing
   human population. Estimating densities of species across their
   geographical range helps us to understand natural variation and
   anthropogenic effects on species densities and to assess the
   effectiveness of existing conservation measures. Various methods have
   been used to produce accurate and precise population density estimates,
   each with associated limitations. Acoustic surveys for species producing
   loud calls have become common due to their ease of use, low cost, and
   reduced timescale. Relative to many other mammal taxa, primate species
   have been studied extensively, producing a wealth of data on
   socioecology and behavior, but for most species, density estimates over
   large geographical ranges are still lacking. We used an acoustic spatial
   capture-recapture model to estimate group density of unhabituated
   Thomas' langurs (Presbytis thomasi), a primate endemic to the Indonesian
   island of Sumatra, over a 60 km(2) area of lowland dipterocarp forest.
   We then assessed if vegetation structure and distance from human
   habitation affected density estimates. Estimates of group density
   differed almost threefold between survey locations (from 2.79 to 8.08
   groups/km(2)); there was no clear relationship with forest structure,
   but there was a significantly positive relationship between group
   density and distance from human habitation, with an increase of 0.38
   groups/km(2) for every km of distance. Although large-scale logging
   within the Sikundur region ceased similar to 30 years ago, the impacts
   of logging continue to have detrimental effects on the species within
   the area.},

Title = {Signal detection shapes ornament allometry in functionally convergent

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1508-1523},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Visual ornaments have long been assumed to evolve hyper-allometry as an
   outcome of sexual selection. Yet growing evidence suggests many sexually
   selected morphologies can exhibit other scaling patterns with body size,
   including hypo-allometry. The large conspicuous throat fan, or dewlap,
   of arboreal Caribbean Anolis lizards was one ornament previously thought
   to conform to the classical expectation of hyper-allometry. We
   re-evaluated this classic example alongside a second arboreal group of
   lizards that has also independently evolved a functionally equivalent
   dewlap, the Southeast Asian Draco lizards. Across multiple closely
   related species in both genera, the Anolis and Draco dewlaps were either
   isometric or had hypo-allometric scaling patterns. In the case of the
   Anolis dewlap, variation in dewlap allometry was predicted by the
   distance of conspecifics and the light environment in which the dewlap
   was typically viewed. Signal efficacy, therefore, appears to have driven
   the evolution of hypo-allometry in what was originally thought to be a
   sexually selected ornament with hyper-allometry. Our findings suggest
   that other elaborate morphological structures used in social
   communication might similarly exhibit isometric or hypo-allometric
   scaling patterns because of environmental constraints on signal
   detection.},

Abstract = {Climate change is already seen as one of the biggest threats to
   biodiversity in the 21st century. Not many studies direct attention to
   its effects on whole communities of threatened hotspots. In this work,
   we combine climate niche modelling (ENM) with a future climate scenario
   of greenhouse gases emissions to study the future changes in alpha and
   beta diversity of birds of the Brazilian Cerrado biome, a hot spot of
   biodiversity with high velocity of climate change and agricultural
   expansion. We expected Southern Cerrado (highly modified) to present
   most negative changes. In general, we found heterogeneous results for
   changes in species richness, spatial and temporal taxonomic and
   functional beta diversity, and mean ecological distinctiveness. We
   analysed 1301 birds, 1115 Least Concern, 83 Near Threatened, 63
   Vulnerable, 33 Endangered, five Critically Endangered and two Extinct in
   the Wild. Contrary to a previous study on Cerrado mammals, species
   richness is expected to increase in Northern Cerrado, where
   homogenization of communities (decreasing spatial turnover) is also
   expected to occur especially through local invasions. We show that
   biotic homogenization increasing (similarity among communities) will
   occur in two biological groups but through different subprocesses: local
   extinctions for mammals and local invasions for birds. Distinct
   conservation management actions should be directed depending on the
   outcomes of analyses of alpha and spatial and temporal beta diversity,
   for example controlling species invasions in Northern Cerrado. We also
   show species-level priorities for Cerrado birds. Conservation studies
   should continue evaluating Cerrado in Brazil even under covid pandemic,
   as environmental situation in the country is not good and incentives for
   scientific studies are almost nonexistent. We also consider that
   Northern Cerrado could be seen as a potential refuge for other
   organismal groups (bats, butterflies, frogs, etc). Therefore, ambitious
   conservation actions by decision-makers are now crucial.},

Title = {Can extreme climatic events induce shifts in adaptive potential? A
   conceptual framework and empirical test with Anolis lizards},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Multivariate adaptation to climatic shifts may be limited by trait
   integration that causes genetic variation to be low in the direction of
   selection. However, strong episodes of selection induced by extreme
   climatic pressures may facilitate future population-wide responses if
   selection reduces trait integration and increases adaptive potential
   (i.e., evolvability). We explain this counter-intuitive framework for
   extreme climatic events in which directional selection leads to
   increased evolvability and exemplify its use in a case study. We tested
   this hypothesis in two populations of the lizard Arias scriptus that
   experienced hurricane-induced selection on limb traits. We surveyed
   populations immediately before and after the hurricane as well as the
   offspring of post-hurricane survivors, allowing us to estimate both
   selection and response to selection on key functional traits: forelimb
   length, hindlimb length, and toepad area. The direct selection was
   parallel in both islands and strong in several limb traits. Even though
   overall limb integration did not change after the hurricane, both
   populations showed a non-significant tendency toward increased
   evolvability after the hurricane despite the direction of selection not
   being aligned with the axis of most variance (i.e., body size). The
   population with comparably lower between-limb integration showed a less
   constrained response to selection. Hurricane-induced selection, not
   aligned with the pattern of high trait correlations, likely conflicts
   with selection occurring during normal ecological conditions that
   favours functional coordination between limb traits, and would likely
   need to be very strong and more persistent to elicit a greater change in
   trait integration and evolvability. Future tests of this hypothesis
   should use G-matrices in a variety of wild organisms experiencing
   selection due to extreme climatic events.},

Title = {Male agility in relation to mating success in two non-territorial
   damselflies},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Male body size is usually correlated with mating success in insects. For
   non-territorial species, the small male advantage hypothesis predicts
   that smaller males may be favoured in sexual selection because small
   body size may predict agility and manoeuvrability. Consequently,
   selection for male size may drive the evolution of female-biased sexual
   size dimorphism (SSD). Nevertheless, recent evidence shows that
   non-territorial male damselflies that actively search for females may be
   larger and more agile than those that perch and wait for females to
   appear. Thus, here we addressed whether the male size is an indicator of
   male agility and if it may be used to predict male reproductive success
   in two non-territorial damselflies. To this end, we conducted a field
   study with Acanthagrion truncatum Selys, 1876 and A. lancea Selys, 1876
   (Zygoptera, Coenagrionidae). Males of A. truncatum adopt a sit-and-wait
   mating strategy, while the males actively search for females in A.
   lancea. Hence, we expected different selective forces acting on male
   body size and agility in these species. We compared the body size and
   wing length of mated and unmated males, and between sexes, to describe
   their patterns of SSD. Our results suggest that wing length can be used
   as a proxy for male body size and agility in both species. However, we
   have found no evidence for the small male advantage that could explain
   wing dimorphism in A. truncatum, nor selection for larger males in A.
   lancea. In conclusion, this study corroborates other studies that
   suggest agility cannot explain SSD in non-territorial damselflies and
   fail to support the small male advantage hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Soil respiration is one of the most important operations controlling
   carbon (C) erosion from territorial ecosystems and a useful index of
   whole underground allocation of C and stand efficiency. However, how
   tree species effects root (i.e., autotrophic respiration) and soil
   microbial respiration (i.e., heterotrophic respiration), based on
   precise experiential schemes, are still restricted, even though crucial
   to guide the selection of species for reforestation and C management
   purposes. This research was done to study how tree species effect soil
   characteristics and function at stand level and which are the main
   drivers of soil CO2 emission in mixed temperate forests in northern Iran
   (Mazandaran province). Four most common tree species at the experimental
   site (Parrotia persica, Ulmus minor, Quercus castaneifolia, and Populus
   caspica) that surrounded by same species, were selected. Around each
   selected tree, four replicates of soil and litter samples were taken
   from (30 x 30 x 15 cm) and mixed to characterize soil physicochemical
   characteristics (i.e., bulk density, texture, water content, pH,
   electrical conductivity, N, organic carbon, and available P, K, Mg, and
   Ca), basal respiration and substrate (i.e., D-manitol, D-glucose,
   L-asparagine, L-arginine, gluconic acid, quinic acid, succinic acid,
   malonic acid, D-glucosamine, L-glutamine) induced respiration. In the
   litter characteristics, total N, C (OC), and C/N ratio were measured.
   Our results confirmed that soil chemical properties are more sensitive
   to species composition than soil physical ones. Moreover, individual
   tree species in mixed deciduous forests strongly influence induced
   microbial respiration, independently of the used substrates. On the
   contrary, season was the major factor explaining variations of basal
   respiration.},

Title = {Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) diversity along a rainy season and edge

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Knowledge on the distribution of mosquito communities over time and
   across human-modified landscapes is important in determining the risk
   for vector-borne disease. The diversity of mosquitoes along a rainy
   season and edge effects were evaluated in a riparian forest in the
   Cerrado biome, Southeastern Brazil. Mosquito communities were sampled
   with Shannon traps in three distinct habitats (forest interior, forest
   edge and pasture) throughout an entire rainy season, comprising five
   sampling months (December 2015 to April 2016). A total of 13 549
   mosquitoes belonging to 54 species were sampled. Mosquito species
   richness and abundance were greater in February, which coincided with
   the middle of the rainy season and just after the months with greater
   rainfall. Mosquito species richness did not differ among habitats for
   any particular month. In February, month when 74\% of individuals were
   recorded, mosquito abundance was lower in the pasture compared with the
   forest edge and interior, which did not differ statistically from each
   other. Four of the six most abundant mosquito species (which account for
   93.5\% of the sampled individuals) had more individuals collected in the
   forest edge, and 28 species were more abundant at the edge compared with
   15 species in the forest interior. Months with high rainfall probably
   allowed the availability and maintenance of high-water level in breeding
   sites leading to a further increase in mosquito populations. While the
   pasture did not seem to have the ideal abiotic conditions and/or
   resources (e.g. food and breeding sites) for mosquito species, edge
   effects appear to favour mosquito populations. Therefore, the risk of
   mosquito-borne diseases is expected to be greater in the middle of the
   rain season at the riparian forest-pasture edge, when and where a
   greater number of disease-vectoring species are present.},

Abstract = {Chronic anthropogenic disturbances and climate change have been
   recognized as drivers of biological reorganization across human-modified
   tropical landscapes, also negatively affecting the reproductive output
   of some plant species. Here, we investigated to what extent these
   drivers affect the reproductive output of Cenostigma microphyllum, a
   disturbance-adapted tree species endemic to the Caatinga dry forest. The
   production of flowers/inflorescence, fruits and seeds was estimated for
   105 plants (>= 3 cm diameter at soil height) across 11 forest stands (20
   x 50 m each), covering gradients of chronic disturbances (e.g. goat and
   livestock herbivory; wood extraction; and removal of non-timber forest
   products) and aridity at the Catimbau National Park. We documented that
   when the drivers were analysed in isolation, the fruit-set was
   positively associated with increased wood extraction, and the fruit-set
   and total number of seeds/plots were reduced under increasing aridity.
   We also verified a complex interaction between wood extraction and
   aridity emerged. In forest stands, the combination of high levels of
   aridity and wood extraction leads to a decrease in the fruit-set and
   total number of seeds/plots. Conversely, the fruit-set and total number
   of seeds/plots increased in stands exposed to lower aridity but high
   levels of wood extraction. Our results suggest that chronic disturbances
   and aridity affect plant fitness in a complex way including both
   negative and positive effects on attributes related to plant
   reproductive performance, which could result in both proliferation and
   population decline in the same landscape. Although C. microphyllum
   benefits from anthropogenic disturbances and is considered a
   disturbance-adapted species, it apparently does not benefit from
   increases in aridity, which is an expected future scenario for the
   Caatinga dry forest.},

Abstract = {When females mate with multiple partners within a single reproductive
   cycle, sperm from rival males may compete for fertilization of a limited
   number of ova, and females may bias the fertilization of their ova by
   particular sperm. Over evolutionary timescales, these two forms of
   selection shape both male and female reproductive physiology when
   females mate multiply, yet in monogamous systems, post-copulatory sexual
   selection is weak or absent. Here, we examine how divergent mating
   strategies within a genus of closely related mice, Peromyscus, have
   shaped the evolution of reproductive traits. We show that in promiscuous
   species, males exhibit traits associated with increased sperm production
   and sperm swimming performance, and females exhibit traits that are
   predicted to limit sperm access to their ova including increased oviduct
   length and a larger cumulus cell mass surrounding the ova, compared to
   monogamous species. Importantly, we found that across species, oviduct
   length and cumulus cell density are significantly correlated with sperm
   velocity, but not sperm count or relative testes size, suggesting that
   these female traits may have coevolved with increased sperm quality
   rather than quantity. Taken together, our results highlight how male and
   female traits evolve in concert and respond to changes in the level of
   post-copulatory sexual selection.},

Abstract = {Aposematic species combine a conspicuous signal with a secondary
   defence, the majority of which are studied in the context of a visual
   signal. While multimodality of the aposematic signal appears to be
   common in invertebrate species, we know very little about the presence
   or absence of multimodality in vertebrates. Here, we examine the
   possibility of multimodality of aposematism in the green-and-black
   poison frog, Dendrobates auratus. Using a non-visual predator (the
   cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira annulata) and extractions of chemicals in
   frog skins, we test whether there is sufficient non-visual information
   for predators to avoid this aposematic species without using visual
   cues. We found that experienced predators avoid chemicals in this poison
   frog's skin by olfactory cues alone in trials with live frogs and
   extracts from captive poison frogs, whereas extracts from wild poison
   frogs did not lead to avoidance behaviours in predators. Further, in our
   limited sampling, naive predators demonstrate no avoidance. This not
   only indicates that predators can make informed decisions from the
   frog's odour, but also indicates that avoidance based on olfactory cue
   is a learned response.},

Title = {Mutation and selection processes regulating short tandem repeats give

Volume = {36},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Short tandem repeats (STRs) are units of 1-6 bp that repeat in a tandem
   fashion in DNA. Along with single nucleotide polymorphisms and large
   structural variations, they are among the major genomic variants
   underlying genetic, and likely phenotypic, divergence. STRs experience
   mutation rates that are orders of magnitude higher than other
   well-studied genotypic variants. Frequent copy number changes result in
   a wide range of alleles, and provide unique opportunities for modulating
   complex phenotypes through variation in repeat length. While classical
   studies have identified key roles of individual STR loci, the advent of
   improved sequencing technology, high-quality genome assemblies for
   diverse species, and bioinformatics methods for genome-wide STR analysis
   now enable more systematic study of STR variation across wide
   evolutionary ranges. In this review, we explore mutation and selection
   processes that affect STR copy number evolution, and how these processes
   give rise to varying STR patterns both within and across species.
   Finally, we review recent examples of functional and adaptive changes
   linked to STRs.},

Title = {Inferring temperature adaptation from thermal performance curves of
   somatic growth rate: The importance of growth measurements and mortality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {424-431},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {When comparing somatic growth thermal performance curves (TPCs), higher
   somatic growth across experimental temperatures is often observed for
   populations originating from colder environments. Such countergradient
   variation has been suggested to represent adaptation to seasonality, or
   shorter favourable seasons in colder climates. Alternatively,
   populations from cold climates may outgrow those from warmer climates at
   low temperature, and vice versa at high temperature, representing
   adaptation to temperature. Using modelling, we show that distinguishing
   between these two types of adaptation based on TPCs requires knowledge
   about (i) the relationship between somatic growth rate and population
   growth rate, which in turn depends on the scale of somatic growth
   (absolute or proportional), and (ii) the relationship between somatic
   growth rate and mortality rate in the wild. We illustrate this by
   quantifying somatic growth rate TPCs for three populations of Daphnia
   magna where population growth scales linearly with proportional somatic
   growth. For absolute somatic growth, the northern population
   outperformed the two more southern populations across temperatures, and
   more so at higher temperatures, consistent with adaptation to
   seasonality. In contrast, for the proportional somatic growth TPCs, and
   hence population growth rate, TPCs tended to converge towards the
   highest temperatures. Thus, if the northern population pays an
   ecological mortality cost of rapid growth in the wild, this may create
   crossing population growth TPCs consistent with adaptation to
   temperature. Future studies within this field should be more explicit in
   how they extrapolate from somatic growth in the lab to fitness in the
   wild.},

Title = {Evolution of physical linkage between loci controlling ecological traits
   and mating preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1537-1547},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coupling of multiple barriers to gene-flow, such as divergent local
   adaptation and reproductive isolation, facilitates speciation. However,
   alleles at loci that contribute to barrier effects can be dissociated by
   recombination. Models of linkage between diverging alleles often
   consider elements that reduce recombination, such as chromosomal
   inversions and alleles that modify recombination rate between existing
   loci. In contrast, here, we consider the evolution of linkage due to the
   close proximity of loci on the same chromosome. Examples of such
   physical linkage exist in several species, but in other cases, strong
   associations are maintained without physical linkage. We use an
   individual-based model to study the conditions under which the physical
   linkage between loci controlling ecological traits and mating
   preferences might be expected to evolve. We modelled a single locus
   controlling an ecological trait that acts also as a mating cue. Mating
   preferences are controlled by multiple loci, formed by mutations that
   are randomly placed in the ``genome{''}, within varying distances from
   the ecological trait locus, allowing us to examine which genomic
   architectures spread across the population. Our model reveals that
   stronger physical linkage is favoured when mating preferences and
   selection are weaker. Under such conditions mating among divergent
   phenotypes is more frequent, and matching ecological trait and mating
   preference alleles are more likely to become dissociated by
   recombination, favouring the evolution of genetic linkage. While most
   theoretical studies on clustering of divergent loci focus on how
   physical linkage influences speciation, we show how physical linkage
   itself can arise, establishing conditions that can favour speciation.},

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {One-third of the world's trees are at risk of extinction, with large,
   old, long-lived trees among the most vulnerable. Long-lived trees in
   arid and semi-arid biomes are particularly at risk, including Australian
   sandalwood (Santalum spicatum, Santalaceae), which is experiencing
   substantial population decline due to a suite of natural and
   anthropogenic drivers, with no appreciable recruitment estimated for
   more than 80 years. To contextualize this range-wide collapse and
   quantify regional variation in population dynamics across Australia's
   western rangelands, we investigated the size-class profiles of 12
   sandalwood populations in a 1,500-kilometre arc between Shark Bay and
   the Gibson Desert in central Western Australia including Indigenous
   Protected Areas, pastoral leases and public and private conservation
   parks and reserves. Stem diameters, indicative of age using known growth
   rates, were recorded for 1,355 sandalwood plants, along with a set of
   another plant structural and ecological parameters. Using size-class
   profiles and associated demographic data, we estimated the population
   age structure and trajectory to determine whether each population was
   increasing, stable or declining. Our surveys revealed sandalwood
   populations are declining and are composed almost entirely of very old
   trees in advanced states of senescence. Of 1,355 plants sampled, 1,198
   (88.4\%) individuals were large (old) trees. A total of 23 seedlings and
   21 saplings were recorded across all sites, almost all of which (22 and
   19, respectively) were in one population, and located under the canopies
   of parent trees where they would not be expected to survive to maturity.
   Our findings reinforce the urgent need to list Santalum spicatum as a
   threatened species in Western Australia (where wild plants are still
   being commercially harvested) and to initiate effective conservation
   actions to secure the species' continued existence across its natural
   range.},

Title = {An ephemerality paradox: Evidence of virtual semelparity in ephemeral

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {47},

Pages = {1591-1608},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Oviparous species that reproduce in unpredictably variable environments
   risk depositing their eggs in situations that may become unsuitable for
   offspring survival at any time. This uncertainty often leads to
   selection for iteroparity as a form of bet-hedging to spread offspring
   development spatially and temporally, thereby improving the odds of some
   cohorts experiencing optimal conditions. Paradoxically, an iteroparous
   mode appears to be the exception for a small number of amphibians that
   exploit temporary aquatic systems. In this study, we provide evidence of
   this paradox in an Australian anuran, the sandpaper frog, Lechriodus
   fletcheri, which breeds almost exclusively in small, highly ephemeral
   pools that often dry before the completion of tadpole development. A
   capture-mark-recapture study was conducted on a population over three
   consecutive breeding seasons, to determine how often adults returned to
   breeding sites within and between years and the extent of iteroparity.
   We found practically no adult returns between seasons, even though
   recapture events often occurred within season, suggesting that this
   species is virtually semelparous. A similar life history is apparent in
   other amphibians, suggesting that some species are able to persist in
   unpredictable environments by likely taking advantage of other forms of
   bet-hedging in the absence of iteroparity. For L. fletcheri, we suggest
   that an extended breeding season may lend itself to the process of
   cohort splitting at a population level, resulting in the future
   reproductive activity of offspring from each generation being spread
   across multiple seasons. Our study shows how an iteroparous life history
   is not the only way to deal with environmental uncertainty.},

Title = {Integration of mitogenomic and morphological data disentangles the
   systematics of Pollenia and establishes a revised phylogenetic
   hypothesis for the Polleniidae},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Polleniidae (Diptera) are a family of flies best known for species
   of the genus Pollenia, which overwinter inside human dwellings.
   Previously divided across the Calliphoridae, Tachinidae and
   Rhinophoridae, the polleniid genera have only recently been united.
   Several studies have utilized molecular data to analyse polleniid
   phylogenetic relationships, although all have suffered from low taxon
   sampling or insufficient phylogenetic signal in molecular markers. To
   alleviate these problems, we utilized two automated organellar genome
   extraction software, GetOrganelle and MitoFinder, to assemble
   mitogenomes from genome skimming data from 22 representatives of the
   polleniid genera: Dexopollenia, Melanodexia, Morinia, Pollenia and
   Xanthotryxus. From these analyses, we provide 14 new mitogenomes for the
   Polleniidae and perform phylogenetic analyses of 13 protein-coding
   mitochondrial genes using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   inference. Subfamilial phylogenetic relationships within the Polleniidae
   are interrogated and Pollenia is found to form a monophyletic clade
   sister to Melanodexia, Morinia and Dexopollenia, providing no evidence
   for the synonymisation of any of these genera. Our topology conflicts
   with previous morphology-based cladistic interpretations, with the
   amentaria, griseotomentosa, semicinerea and viatica species-groups
   resolving as non-monophyletic. We provide support for our topology
   through analysis of adult morphology and male and female terminalia,
   while identifying new diagnostic characters for some of the clades of
   the Pollenia. To test the validity of the current diagnostic morphology
   in the Polleniidae, newly assembled cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
   data are combined with a polleniid COI barcode reference library and
   analysed using the species delimitation software ASAP. COI barcodes
   support the current morphologically defined species within the Pollenia.},

Title = {Prescribed take levels of downy and hairy woodpeckers in the eastern
   United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hairy (Dryobates villosus) and downy (Dryobates pubescens) woodpeckers
   occur in high densities in residential areas of the eastern United
   States. In many areas of their range, they cause damage to wooden
   structures through foraging, excavation of nesting cavities, and
   drumming behaviors, causing requests for allowable take permits. Both
   species hold year-round territories, which could make them vulnerable to
   local extirpation with excess take. To meet the requirements of the
   Migratory Bird Treaty act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
   (USFWS) requested scientifically informed evaluation of take to minimize
   population effects as part of its approach to reduce human-wildlife
   conflict. We used a prescribed take approach, which uses data from
   population, demographic, and management parameter estimates to determine
   the allowable take from Louisiana to Minnesota and all states east.
   Furthermore, we used 2 different methods of estimating growth rates to
   control for demographic uncertainties. The resulting estimates provide
   take at the state and USFWS regional scales to improve stakeholder
   choices when setting allowable take. Current authorized take (2016-2018)
   is below the take that could be sustained by current populations, and
   current rates of take are not likely to cause population-level effects.
   These results were largely consistent across methodologies for
   calculating the rate of growth for both species. Take still needs to be
   managed to prevent local extirpation of these resident species.
   Allowable take estimates should be periodically updated to reflect
   changing management and population needs for both species.},

Title = {Origins of harvested American black ducks: stable isotopes support the
   flyover hypothesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Waterfowl management is more effective when based on detailed
   information on population connectivity between breeding, wintering, and
   stopover sites. For the American black duck (Anas rubripes), a species
   of conservation concern, estimates for the fall age ratio at harvest
   differed depending on whether harvest data were derived from Canada or
   the United States, suggesting regional differences. Within Canada,
   hunters in Atlantic Canada were more likely to harvest black ducks from
   nearby breeding locations compared to hunters in southern Ontario and
   Quebec, Canada, who were more likely to harvest individuals from the
   Boreal Softwood and Taiga Shield of eastern Canada. Black ducks
   harvested in the United States are thought to originate predominantly
   from northern portions of the breeding range, leading to the flyover
   hypothesis, which postulates that black ducks produced in the Boreal
   Softwood and Taiga Shield region are less susceptible to harvest by
   hunters in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. To test the
   flyover hypothesis, we examined regional and temporal differences in the
   origins of harvested black ducks using feathers from wings (n = 664)
   submitted by hunters to the species composition and parts collection
   surveys across 3 hunting seasons (2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020). We
   used a likelihood-based assignment method that relied on feather
   stable-hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) and stable-carbon isotopes (delta
   C-13) to determine the natal or molt origin of individuals harvested
   within eastern Canada and the United States. We also used a spatial
   clustering technique to group harvested individuals by area of origin
   without a priori knowledge of such regions. Adult female black ducks
   originated farther south compared to males and juveniles. All sexes and
   ages of black ducks harvested in Atlantic Canada showed predominantly
   southern origins, while those harvested in the United States and other
   Canadian provinces primarily originated farther north within the boreal,
   supporting the flyover hypothesis. By contrast, we found no relationship
   between timing of harvest or peaks of migration and individual origin.
   After combining band returns and stable isotopes, we inferred 2 distinct
   stocks: the Mississippi flyway stock and the Atlantic flyway stock. We
   recommend that regional demographic parameters, particularly for
   Atlantic Canada, be directly measured to promote more effective
   conservation of black ducks and optimize harvest opportunities in the
   United States and Canada.},

Title = {Massive gene rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes and implications

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {278-295},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used for phylogenetic
   reconstruction and evolutionary analysis in various groups of Insecta.
   Gene rearrangements in the mitogenome can be informative characters for
   phylogenetic reconstruction and adaptive evolution. Trichoptera is one
   of the most important groups of aquatic insects. Prior to this study,
   complete mitogenomes from Trichoptera were restricted to eight families,
   resulting in a biased view of their mitogenome structure and evolution.
   Here, we assemble new mitogenomes for 66 species by high-throughput
   sequencing. The mitogenomes of 19 families and 47 genera are documented
   for the first time. Combined with 16 previously published mitogenomes of
   Trichoptera, we find 14 kinds of gene rearrangement patterns novel for
   Trichoptera, including rearrangement of protein-coding genes, tRNAs and
   control regions. Simultaneously, we provide evidence for the occurrence
   of tandem duplication and non-random loss events in the mitogenomes of
   three families. Phylogenetic analyses show that Hydroptilidae was
   recovered as a sister group to Annulipalpia. The increased nucleotide
   substitution rate and adaptive evolution may have affected the
   mitochondrial gene rearrangements in Trichoptera. Our study offers new
   insights into the mechanisms and patterns of mitogenome rearrangements
   in Insecta at large and into the usefulness of mitogenomic gene order as
   a phylogenetic marker within Trichoptera.},

Title = {Species distribution modelling of the endangered Mahogany Glider
   (Petaurus gracilis) reveals key areas for targeted survey and
   conservation},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) is one of the most endangered
   marsupials in Australia. Its known distribution is an approximately 120
   km strip of fragmented coastal woodland in north-east Queensland, from
   north of Townsville to the Tully area. Records are clustered in a number
   of well-surveyed areas, with significant areas of lowland habitat
   unsurveyed. Around 30\% of historic records fall in areas that were
   subsequently cleared for farmland, and ongoing clearing and
   fragmentation of lowland sclerophyll forest continues within the
   potential distribution. Resolving the distribution is an urgent
   requirement to guide conservation but Mahogany Gliders are difficult to
   detect in the field. Species distribution modelling offers a technique
   for estimating the fine-scale distribution and for targeting further
   field survey and conservation efforts. We used known occurrence records
   (N = 481) to predict the distribution of Mahogany Gliders across the Wet
   Tropics bioregion. We used climatic, topographic and other environmental
   predictors to generate distribution models using Maxent and Random
   Forest algorithms, each with two bias correction methods. The
   predictions revealed that many unknown populations may exist within the
   currently defined distribution and in important areas beyond this (e.g.
   Hinchinbrook Island). There was reasonable congruence between models,
   and we include syntheses of the models to present the most likely
   current distribution. The most important predictor variables across the
   models were precipitation seasonality (high seasonality), elevation
   (generally <100 m), soil type (hydrosols) and vegetation type (including
   Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands). Our results identify core habitat
   and reveal key areas that require targeted field surveys. Importantly,
   the predicted suitable habitat is highly fragmented and ongoing
   conservation efforts need to improve habitat connectivity and limit
   further fragmentation.},

Title = {Effect of forest areas configuration on the community of insectivorous
   bats in agroforestry landscapes},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 20},
Abstract = {In Chile, many aspects of the ecology of bats and their distribution are
   unknown, despite their ecological and economic importance. This
   situation does not allow a correct implementation of conservation
   efforts even when they are legally recognized as beneficial animals for
   agriculture. Here, we studied the bats' activity and community in two
   agricultural landscape types (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) in a
   hotspot of biodiversity in the centre-south of Chile. We monitored four
   transects of 10 km per landscape type with 10 listening points separated
   by 1 km. These transects were repeated 5 times, once per month. We
   evaluated the bats activity according to the forest cover type (native,
   mixed and plantations) and the isolated trees density. Our results
   showed that the heterogeneous landscape was dominated by T. brasiliensis
   while the homogeneous landscape was by Lasiurus spp. However, only the
   species T. brasiliensis was affected by the landscape type. In the
   heterogeneous landscape, only the forest cover variables had
   significance in the activity of the bat species, where Lasiurus spp. and
   M. chiloensis had a positive response for native and mixed forest, as
   well as Lasiurus spp. had a negative response for plantations. The
   density of isolated trees had a negative effect on the activity of T.
   brasiliensis and Lasiurus spp. in the homogeneous landscape type. Our
   results showed the importance of considering the forest elements in
   agroforestry landscape to conserve bat communities.},

Abstract = {The influence of resource availability on ecosystem function varies
   spatially and temporally, among and within ecosystems. Dramatic shifts
   in moisture-driven resources can drive bottom-up effects on animal
   behaviours and distributions. Further, complexity arises when landscapes
   are influenced by large mammalian grazers and predator-induced trophic
   cascades, such as those mediated by the dingo (Canis familiaris (Dingo))
   in the eastern arid Strzelecki Desert in Australia. During the driest
   two-year period on record for this region, we investigated the
   persistence of avian communities associated with structurally distinct
   dunes and swale habitats, and across two different land management
   regimes (pastoral land with livestock and dingoes, and Sturt National
   Park managed for conservation without these animals). We grouped all
   birds into dietary functional groups to infer patterns of habitat use
   associated with available resources. We also compared incidental
   observations of the `winter' bird community in part of the study region
   between the extended dry period of 2018/2019 and wet period of
   2020/2021. Despite habitat partitioning, the avian community did not
   differ between land management regimes except in species richness during
   the dry period, likely driven by the low numbers of birds present during
   the surveys. Incidental observations indicated that insectivorous and
   omnivorous species dominated the bird community in the dry period, with
   granivorous species forming a greater proportion of the bird community
   during wet times. Birds with completely or partially insectivorous diets
   dominated avian species composition on surveys in the dry period, but
   there were distinct structural vegetation associations among functional
   groups, indicating that heterogeneity in vegetation structure was likely
   important for the conservation of refuges, which enable the persistence
   of avifauna during extended dry periods. Distinct habitat type,
   structure and available resources shaped avian communities in this
   landscape, during the extremely resource-limited extended dry period,
   with implications for conservation and management, particularly given
   the increasing drying effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {To address uncertainties surrounding the impacts of unprecedented
   2019-20 bushfires in south-eastern Australia, we convened a symposium on
   field-measured impacts on biodiversity for the 2020 Ecological Society
   of Australia conference. Nine presentations covered a range of studies
   on plant species and communities, and reptiles and mammals. Here, we
   summarize the presentations and review other field studies from NSW,
   some of which are currently unpublished. The impacts were extensive, but
   results also estimated survival rate perhaps higher than first reported
   in the media. More than half of individual mammal, reptile and
   threatened rainforest trees may have survived the fire, though small
   populations remain very vulnerable to second fire in the near future.
   Comprehensive understanding of the impacts of these fires requires much
   more field study, and for the results to be interpreted in the context
   of the broader fire regime. The symposium was an important early step in
   that understanding.},

Title = {Pioneer palm tree as an ecosystem engineer: Effects on ant community

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Ecosystem engineer species can affect the assembly and maintenance of
   biological communities by altering local environmental conditions.
   Several palm tree species play this role in changing the surrounding
   environment mainly through the fall of entire rachis and the formation
   of a thick and homogeneous leaf litter layer beneath the canopy.
   However, their impact on soil animal communities remains unclear. In
   particular, soil organisms (e.g. ants) can be negatively affected by
   palm-driven local changes, since they are especially susceptible to leaf
   litter changes. Our objective was to test if the presence of palm trees
   reduces alpha and beta diversities of ant communities at taxonomic and
   morphometric levels. We also tested if palm tree understory mound
   (debris pile just below the canopy) area and population density reduce
   ant community alpha and beta diversities (at the taxonomic and
   morphometric levels) in tropical rainforests. To do so, we described
   taxonomic and morphometric diversity patterns of ant communities in a
   relictual landscape of the Atlantic Rainforest (northeastern Brazil)
   using Hill's numbers approach in two habitats: understory mounds
   surrounding the palm tree species Acrocomia intumescens, and forest
   understory without A. intumescens (non-palm understory). Our main
   findings were: (1) Taxonomic and morphometric alpha diversity were
   similar between A. intumescens understory mound and non-palm understory;
   (2) Ant communities in non-palm understory presented higher beta
   diversity than communities from A. intumescens understory mounds
   considering both rare species and morphometric traits; (3) A.
   intumescens understory mound area negatively affected common and
   dominant ant species; and (4) the interaction between understory mound
   area and the population density of A. intumescens affected dominant ant
   species in complex ways and the outcomes depend on the balance between
   both predictors. Our findings point to an important role of palm trees
   as ecosystem engineers in reducing ant biodiversity and changing the
   functional signature of human-modified tropical rainforests.},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Historically unprecedented areas of forest habitat have been impacted by
   fire, as climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances drive
   increases in fire burned area and severity. Although 88\% of Australia's
   land mammals are threatened by inappropriate fire regimes, calculations
   of animal mortality resulting from specific events have been impeded by
   knowledge gaps relating to both the direct (first-order) and long-term
   (second-order) effects of fire on different species. This study
   addresses the need for a quantified, mechanistic understanding of
   first-order effects, presenting an extension of the Fire Research and
   Modelling Environment (FRaME) to allow prediction of species-specific
   mortality. FRaME is demonstrated and tested here by replicating an
   incident in which a prescribed burn caused 77\% mortality of a
   population of the critically endangered ngwayir (Pseudocheirus
   occidentalis, Pseudocheiridae). FRaME correctly predicted heavy
   mortality (62-79\%) arising from partial and full-thickness burns and
   asphyxiation due to burns in the respiratory tract. Mortality varied
   with animal fire-avoidance strategies (p < 0.001) and the thickness of
   tree hollow walls (r = -0.95, p < 0.001). Although management guidelines
   specified low intensity fire, mortality had no significant relationship
   with Byram intensity and larger flames due to `torching' were most
   frequent when fire spread was slowest. FRaME modelling predicted that
   individuals would be impacted by temperatures exceeding 500 degrees C
   for several minutes. Fire management that is premised on discredited
   notions of fire behaviour and overly simple models can lead to
   catastrophic management outcomes such as those documented here. FRaME
   addresses this need by providing a platform to account for heterogeneous
   fire behaviour as well as animal behaviour and habitat quality,
   calculating fire risk to fauna and guiding management that maximizes
   safe habitat.},

Abstract = {Tropical and subtropical regions shelter high levels of biodiversity. A
   combination of biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors
   influences tree community diversity and composition. Here, we use data
   from the IFFSC project to test the effect of conspecific and
   heterospecific density dependence, canopy cover and distance to edge on
   saplings populations of 229 woody species in 159 plots distributed
   across three forest types in Southern Brazil. All plots were measured
   twice with a standardized time interval of 5 years. We fitted one
   ordinary least square regression model to each species to test the
   strength of each predictor on the species' population growth rate, and
   one global mixed effect model including forest type, ecological group
   and the interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density to
   test their impact in the overall trend of the species. Our analysis
   provided circumstantial evidence that conspecific density dependence is
   shaping diversity of forest fragments. This mechanism was present for
   75.5\% of the species, while heterospecific density affected 10\% of the
   species. Canopy cover affected the population dynamics of 9.2\% of the
   species and distance to edge affected 7.4\% of the species. Forest type
   had a significant effect in the global model, suggesting that population
   dynamics differ between different forest formations. Ecological group
   was not significant in the global model suggesting that the mechanism
   affects species similarly despite their ecological group. The
   interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density was
   significant in the global model, suggesting that this mechanism differs
   between interior and edge of fragments. This work represents one of the
   few large-scale analyses of conspecific density dependence in fragmented
   secondary forests. Our results show that, once the forest is stablished,
   conspecific density dependence is crucial in sapling population
   dynamics, despite high levels of fragmentation.},

Title = {Parapatry of Phanaeus splendidulus and P. dejeani (Coleoptera:

Abstract = {Parapatry occurs when species exhibit adjacent distributions in space,
   with contact in their boundaries, with or without overlapping. Many
   factors can generate this pattern, such as environmental conditions and
   interspecific competition. Mountains are excellent systems to study
   parapatry because they exhibit large environmental heterogeneity within
   a small geographical area. Phanaeus splendidulus and P. dejeani are two
   similar dung beetle species with apparent sympatric distributions at
   geographical scale, but with a hypothesized parapatric distribution in
   mountains. We assessed whether P. splendidulus and P. dejeani indeed
   exhibit a parapatric distribution in two mountain ranges in the Atlantic
   Forest. We also tested the effects of environmental conditions and
   interspecific competition on the observed pattern of abundance for both
   species for one mountain. We placed pitfall traps at every 50 m of
   elevation from 600 to 2400 m a.s.l. at Itatiaia National Park and from
   100 to 2050 m a.s.l. at Serra dos \& Oacute; rgaos National Park in
   Brazil. We used temperature, vegetation cover, litter volume and soil
   granulometry as environmental predictors of each species abundance and
   the abundance of its congeneric species as a measure of interspecific
   competition. Phanaeus splendidulus and P. dejeani indeed exhibited a
   parapatric distribution and a small overlapping area, with P.
   splendidulus reaching up to 1450 m a.s.l. in Itatiaia National Park and
   1250 m a.s.l. in Serra dos \& Oacute; rgaos National Park, and P.
   dejeani occurring above to 1000 m a.s.l. Only maximum temperature was
   significantly related to species abundance. Maximum temperature affected
   positively P. splendidulus abundance and negatively P. dejeani,
   suggesting that these species have opposite climate preferences. The
   abundance of the congeneric species was not significant for either
   species. Understand species distributions and what drives them is
   critical to understand the evolution of species interaction, their
   responses to the environment and for conservation, in a world of climate
   change.},

Title = {Selection on sperm size in response to promiscuity and variation in
   female sperm storage organs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sperm cells are exceptionally morphologically diverse across taxa.
   However, morphology can be quite uniform within species, particularly
   for species where females copulate with many males per reproductive
   bout. Strong sexual selection in these promiscuous species is widely
   hypothesized to reduce intraspecific sperm variation. Conversely, we
   hypothesize that intraspecific sperm size variation may be maintained by
   high among-female variation in the size of sperm storage organs,
   assuming that paternity success improves when sperm are compatible in
   size with the sperm storage organ. We use individual-based simulations
   and an analytical model to evaluate how selection on sperm size depends
   on promiscuity level and variation in sperm storage organ size
   (hereafter, female preference variation). Simulations of high
   promiscuity (10 mates per female) showed stabilizing selection on sperm
   when female preference variation was low, and disruptive selection when
   female preference variation was high, consistent with the analytical
   model results. With low promiscuity (2-3 mates per female), selection on
   sperm was stabilizing for all levels of female preference variation in
   the simulations, contrasting with the analytical model. Promiscuity
   level, or mate sampling, thus has a strong impact on the selection
   resulting from female preferences. Furthermore, when promiscuity is low,
   disruptive selection on male traits will occur under much more limited
   circumstances (i.e. only with higher among-female variation) than many
   previous models suggest. Variation in female sperm storage organs likely
   has strong implications for intraspecific sperm variation in highly
   promiscuous species, but likely does not explain differences in
   intraspecific sperm variation for less promiscuous taxa.},

Abstract = {Regeneration is the process by which many animals are able to restore
   lost or injured body parts. After amputation of the posterior part of
   its body, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is able to regenerate the
   pygidium, the posteriormost part of its body that bears the anus, and a
   subterminal growth zone containing stem cells that allows the subsequent
   addition of new segments. The ability to regenerate their posterior part
   (posterior regeneration) is promoted, in juvenile worms, by a hormone
   produced by the brain and is lost when this hormonal activity becomes
   low at the time the worms undergo their sexual maturation. By
   characterizing posterior regeneration at the morphological and molecular
   levels in worms that have been decapitated, we show that the presence of
   the head is essential for multiple aspects of posterior regeneration, as
   well as for the subsequent production of new segments. We also show that
   methylfarnesoate, the molecule proposed to be the brain hormone, can
   partially rescue the posterior regeneration defects observed in
   decapitated worms. Our results are therefore consistent with a key role
   of brain hormonal activity in the control of regeneration and growth in
   P. dumerilii, and support the hypothesis of the involvement of
   methylfarnesoate in this control.},

   EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 23},
Abstract = {Yak has evolved specific adaptative mechanisms to high-altitude
   environment. Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation
   in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and
   transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle
   tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan
   cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs
   potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis.
   Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly
   involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood
   pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA
   repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes
   associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle,
   suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes. Overall, the
   present study contributes basic data at the DNA methylation level to
   further understand the physiological metabolism in yak.},

Title = {Drought limits large trees in African savannas with or without elephants},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Consumers, including megaherbivores and fire, are considered important
   limiting forces for woody plants and canopy closure in African savannas.
   However, climatic events like drought can also play a significant role
   in limiting trees and maintaining tree-grass coexistence in savannas.
   The extent to which top-down control (e.g. megaherbivores) and bottom-up
   resource limitation through drought and competition interact to
   influence savanna tree mortality and woody structure is unclear. Here,
   we compared the change in the number of large trees before and after a
   severe drought in a savanna with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and one
   without elephants. Elephants and drought both limited the number of
   large trees at our sites, but contrary to our predictions, there was no
   interactive effect of these drivers on overall changes in tree
   densities. However, there was a synergistic effect on the dominant tree
   species, Senegalia nigrescens, such that tree loss post-drought was
   greater where elephants were present compared to where they were absent.
   Hence, our results suggest that species-specific differences in drought
   resistance, as well as density-dependent factors, likely impact the
   severity of drought effects on savanna tree communities. In savannas,
   drought has the potential to exert strong control on tree survival and
   prevent canopy closure, thus partially filling the role of
   megaherbivores in limiting large trees when these consumers are absent.
   As drought severity and frequency are predicted to increase in the
   future, the influence of drought on savanna vegetation structure becomes
   increasingly important to consider.},

Title = {Defensive spines are associated with large geographic range but not
   diversification in spiny ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Polyrhachis)},

Abstract = {Several prominent evolutionary theories propose mechanisms whereby the
   evolution of a defensive trait or suite of traits causes significant
   shifts in species diversification rate and niche evolution. We
   investigate the role of cuticular spines, a highly variable
   morphological defensive trait in the hyperdiverse ant genus Polyrhachis,
   on species diversification and geographic range size. Informed by key
   innovation theory and the escape-and-radiate hypothesis, we predicted
   that clades with longer spines would exhibit elevated rates of
   diversification and larger range sizes compared to clades with shorter
   spines. To address these predictions, we estimated phylogenetic
   relationships with a phylogenomic approach utilizing ultraconserved
   elements and compiled morphological and biogeographic trait databases.
   In contrast to the first prediction, we found no association between
   diversification rate and any trait (spine length, body size and range
   size), with the sole exception of a positive association between range
   size and diversification in one of three trait-based diversification
   analyses. However, we recovered a positive phylogenetic correlation
   between spine length and geographic range size, suggesting that spines
   promote expanded geographic range. Notably, these results were
   consistent across analyses using different phylogenetic inference
   approaches and spine trait measurement schemes. This study provides a
   rare investigation of the role of a defensive trait on geographic range
   size, and ultimately supports the hypothesis that defensive spines are a
   factor in increased range size in Polyrhachis ants. Furthermore, the
   lack of support for an association between spines and diversification,
   which contrasts with previous work demonstrating a positive association
   between spines and diversification rate, is intriguing and warrants
   further study.},

Title = {Measuring, comparing and interpreting phenotypic selection on floral

Abstract = {Natural selection on floral scent composition is a key element of the
   hypothesis that pollinators and other floral visitors drive scent
   evolution. The measure of such selection is complicated by the
   high-dimensional nature of floral scent data and uncertainty about the
   cognitive processes involved in scent-mediated communication. We use
   dimension reduction through reduced-rank regression to jointly estimate
   a scent composite trait under selection and the strength of selection
   acting on this trait. To assess and compare variation in selection on
   scent across species, time and space, we reanalyse 22 datasets on six
   species from four previous studies. The results agreed qualitatively
   with previous analyses in terms of identifying populations and scent
   compounds subject to stronger selection but also allowed us to evaluate
   and compare the strength of selection on scent across studies. Doing so
   revealed that selection on floral scent was highly variable, and overall
   about as common and as strong as selection on other phenotypic traits
   involved in pollinator attraction or pollen transfer. These results are
   consistent with an important role of floral scent in pollinator
   attraction. Our approach should be useful for further studies of
   plant-animal communication and for studies of selection on other
   high-dimensional phenotypes. In particular, our approach will be useful
   for studies of pollinator-mediated selection on complex scent blends
   comprising many volatiles, and when no prior information on the
   physiological responses of pollinators to scent compounds is available.},

Abstract = {Intraspecific predation is a special case of prey-predator system that
   is taxonomically widespread. While a heterospecific predator's main goal
   is to achieve nutrition, intraspecific predation provides conspecifics
   with other benefits including elimination of competitors for resources
   and mates. Traditionally intraspecific predation is termed based on the
   context they occur within, for example egg cannibalism, infanticide and
   sexual cannibalism. These diverse forms of intraspecific predation and
   the strategies by which animals are known to deter them are summarized
   categorically in this review. The diversity of defence strategies
   animals deploy against conspecific predators is appreciable and raises
   interesting questions on their evolution for future research.},

Abstract = {Sex-based differences in physiological traits may be influenced by both
   evolutionary and environmental factors. Here we used male and female
   flies from >80 Drosophila species reared under common conditions to
   examine variance in a number of physiological traits including size,
   starvation, desiccation and thermal tolerance. Sex-based differences for
   desiccation and starvation resistance were comparable in magnitude to
   those for size, with females tending to be relatively more resistant
   than males. In contrast thermal resistance showed low divergence between
   the sexes. Phylogenetic signal was detected for measures of divergence
   between the sexes, such that species from the Sophophora clade showed
   larger differences between the sexes than species from the Drosophila
   clade. We also found that sex-based differences in desiccation
   resistance, body size and starvation resistance were weakly associated
   with climate (annual mean temperature/precipitation seasonality) but the
   direction and association with environment depended on phylogenetic
   position. The results suggest that divergence between the sexes can be
   linked to environmental factors, while an association with phylogeny
   suggests sex-based differences persist over long evolutionary
   time-frames.},

Title = {Arms race and fluctuating selection dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1475-1487},

Abstract = {Experimental evolution studies have examined coevolutionary dynamics
   between bacteria and lytic phages, where two models for antagonistic
   coevolution dominate: arms-race dynamics (ARD) and fluctuating-selection
   dynamics (FSD). Here, we tested the ability for Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   to coevolve with phage OMKO1 during 10 passages in the laboratory,
   whether ARD versus FSD coevolution occurred, and how coevolution
   affected a predicted phenotypic trade-off between phage resistance and
   antibiotic sensitivity. We used a unique ``deep{''} sampling design,
   where 96 bacterial clones per passage were obtained from the three
   replicate coevolving communities. Next, we examined phenotypic changes
   in growth ability, susceptibility to phage infection and resistance to
   antibiotics. Results confirmed that the bacteria and phages coexisted
   throughout the study with one community undergoing ARD, whereas the
   other two showed evidence for FSD. Surprisingly, only the ARD bacteria
   demonstrated the anticipated trade-off. Whole genome sequencing revealed
   that treatment populations of bacteria accrued more de novo mutations,
   relative to a control bacterial population. Additionally, coevolved
   bacteria presented mutations in genes for biosynthesis of flagella,
   type-IV pilus and lipopolysaccharide, with three mutations fixing
   contemporaneously with the occurrence of the phenotypic trade-off in the
   ARD-coevolved bacteria. Our study demonstrates that both ARD and FSD
   coevolution outcomes are possible in a single interacting bacteria-phage
   system and that occurrence of predicted phage-driven evolutionary
   trade-offs may depend on the genetics underlying evolution of phage
   resistance in bacteria. These results are relevant for the ongoing
   development of lytic phages, such as OMKO1, in personalized treatment of
   human patients, as an alternative to antibiotics.},

Abstract = {Plants often associate with multiple arthropod mutualists. These
   partners provide important services to their hosts, but multiple
   interactions can constrain a plant's ability to respond to complex,
   multivariate selection. Here, we quantified patterns of genetic variance
   and covariance among rewards for pollination, biotic defence and seed
   dispersal mutualisms in multiple populations of Turnera ulmifolia to
   better understand how the genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms
   might influence their evolution. We phenotyped plants cultivated from 17
   Jamaican populations for several mutualism and mating system-related
   traits. We then fit genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices for the
   island metapopulation and the five largest individual populations. At
   the metapopulation level, we observed significant positive genetic
   correlations among stigma-anther separation, floral nectar production
   and extrafloral nectar production. These correlations have the potential
   to significantly constrain or facilitate the evolution of multiple
   mutualisms in T. ulmifolia and suggest that pollination, seed dispersal
   and dispersal mutualisms do not evolve independently. In particular, we
   found that positive genetic correlations between floral and extrafloral
   nectar production may help explain their stable coexistence in the face
   of physiological trade-offs and negative interactions between
   pollinators and ant bodyguards. Locally, we found only small differences
   in G among our T. ulmifolia populations, suggesting that geographic
   variation in G may not shape the evolution of multiple mutualisms.},

Title = {Generative production and evaluation of ornamental plant potential of an
   endemic flax species for ecological landscape applications},

Abstract = {The flax genus consists of several natural species, which have the
   potential as ornamental plants for ecological landscape applications.
   Linum pamphylicum subsp. olympicum is an endemic, naturally occurring
   flax species that can only be found in Bursa, Turkey. The aim of the
   study is to examine the morphological and biological characteristics of
   L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum in relation to its cultivation and
   ornamental plant potential, and to reveal the best germination
   practices, as well as to establish an ex situ conservation garden.
   According to the results, in natural conditions, L. pamphylicum subsp.
   olympicum taxon forms a spreading habitus that is resistant to infertile
   and arid soil conditions. It covers the soil surface with an average
   width of 40.50 cm and average height of 16.63 cm foliage. It grows an
   average of 50.80 annual flowering branches. It is a natural taxon that
   draws attention with its bright yellow and long-lasting flowers.
   Germination of L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds suffers due to
   physical and physiological dormancy. By this study, the germination of
   L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds was improved up to 92.33\% by
   using 4000 ppm gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatments. Both cold-wet
   stratifications with soaking in 4000 or 2000 ppm GA(3) provided the
   fastest germination speed of T-50 = 14 days. With the current study
   germination of L. pamphylicum subsp. olympicum seeds was improved
   significantly, the phenological and morphological characteristics were
   determined and a seed resource garden was established for ornamental
   plant studies.},

Title = {Applicability of the source-sink population concept to marine intertidal
   macro-invertebrates with planktonic larval stages},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Local populations of marine benthic macro-invertebrates with planktonic
   larvae are believed to be in source-sink relationships via larval
   dispersal in a regional population complex. Practically, such a region
   is definable only after connectivity of constituent local populations is
   explored. Numerical simulations abound for hydrodynamic connectivity by
   larvae between local/regional populations. Empirical studies have
   scarcely integrated inter-local connectivity and intra-local population
   dynamics into demographic connectivity analysis. I review the current
   research and indicate fundamental and technical problems to demonstrate
   that some source-sink systems in intertidal shores, which are most
   accessible among benthic habitats, are a good model. The challenge in
   benthic source-sink research comes from that existent local populations
   may not be self-sustaining because of low larval self-seeding rates
   and/or low benthos' survival rates and yet can persist as latent sinks.
   They may receive larvae leaking from sources at good-quality habitat
   patches with stationary larval retention areas for self-recruitment. On
   an intertidal sandflat in an estuary-coastal ocean region, Kyushu, Japan
   during 1979-2019, the population of a trochid gastropod with 3- to 9-day
   larval duration became extinct and recovered. The extinction was caused
   by sediment destabilization by a callianassid shrimp population which
   increased in the early 1980s. The gastropod recovery was owing to the
   shrimp decline by stingray predation and the transport of larvae from
   some self-sustainable populations with lower shrimp densities 30 km
   away. It was estimated that the gastropod population before the shrimp
   proliferation on that sandflat might be a latent sink requiring
   allochthonous larval subsidy due to epi-benthic predation on juveniles.},

Title = {Vegetation change on mountaintops in northern Sweden: Stable
   vascular-plant but reordering of lichen and bryophyte communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Alpine ecosystems harbor remarkably diverse and distinct plant
   communities that are characteristically limited to harsh, and cold
   climatic conditions. As a result of thermal limitation to species
   occurrence, mountainous ecosystems are considered to be particularly
   sensitive to climate change. Our understanding of the impact of climate
   change is mainly based on vascular plants however, whereas cryptogams
   (i.e., lichens and bryophytes) are generally neglected or simply
   considered as one functional group. Here we aimed to improve our
   understanding of the drivers underlying temporal changes in vegetation
   of alpine ecosystems. To this end, we repeatedly surveyed the vegetation
   on four mountain summits along an elevational gradient in northern
   Sweden spanning a 19-year period. Our results show that the vascular
   plant communities remained relatively stable throughout the study
   period, despite fluctuations in terms of ground cover and species
   richness of shrubs and graminoids. In contrast, both lichens and
   bryophytes substantially decreased in cover and diversity, leading to
   alterations in community composition that were unrelated to vascular
   plant cover. Thermophilization of the vascular plant community was found
   only on the two intermediate summits. Our findings are only partially
   consistent with (long-term) climate-change impacts, and we argue that
   local non-climatic drivers such as herbivory might offset vegetation
   responses to warming. Hence, we underline the importance of considering
   local non-climatic drivers when evaluating temporal vegetation change in
   biologically complex systems.},

Title = {Colour moult phenology and camouflage mismatch in polymorphic
   populations of Arctic foxes},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Species that seasonally moult from brown to white to match snowy
   backgrounds become conspicuous and experience increased predation risk
   as snow cover duration declines. Long-term adaptation to camouflage
   mismatch in a changing climate might occur through phenotypic plasticity
   in colour moult phenology and or evolutionary shifts in moult rate or
   timing. Also, adaptation may include evolutionary shifts towards winter
   brown phenotypes that forgo the winter white moult. Most studies of
   these processes have occurred in winter white populations, with little
   attention to polymorphic populations with sympatric winter brown and
   winter white morphs. Here, we used remote camera traps to record moult
   phenology and mismatch in two polymorphic populations of Arctic foxes in
   Sweden over 2 years. We found that the colder, more northern population
   moulted earlier in the autumn and later in the spring. Next, foxes
   moulted earlier in the autumn and later in the spring during colder and
   snowier years. Finally, white foxes experienced relatively low
   camouflage mismatch while blue foxes were mismatched against snowy
   backgrounds most of the autumn through the spring. Because the
   brown-on-white mismatch imposes no evident costs, we predict that as
   snow duration decreases, increasing blue morph frequencies might help
   facilitate species persistence.},

Title = {Temperature causes species-specific responses to UV-induced DNA damage
   in amphibian larvae},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic ozone depletion has led to a 2-5\% increase in ultraviolet
   B radiation (UVBR) levels reaching the earth's surface. Exposure to UVBR
   causes harmful DNA damage in amphibians, but this is minimized by DNA
   repair enzymes such as thermally sensitive cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer
   (CPD)-photolyase, with cool temperatures slowing repair rates. It is
   unknown whether amphibian species differ in the repair response to a
   given dose of UVBR across temperatures. We reared larvae of three
   species (Limnodynastes peronii, Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and
   Platyplectrum ornatum) at 25 degrees C and acutely exposed them to 80 mu
   W cm(-2) UVBR for 2 h at either 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C.
   UVBR-mediated DNA damage was measured as larvae repaired damage in
   photoreactive light at their exposure temperatures. Cool temperatures
   increased DNA damage in two species and slowed DNA repair rate in P.
   ornatum. The magnitude of DNA damage incurred from UVBR was
   species-specific. Platyplectrum ornatum had the lowest CPDs and DNA
   repair rates, and the depressive effects of low temperature on
   photorepair were greater in L. tasmaniensis. Considering the
   susceptibility of most aquatic organisms to UVBR, this research
   highlighted a need to consider the complexity of species-specific
   physiology when forecasting the influence of changing UVBR and
   temperature in aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The environment plays an important role in an individual's development
   during early life, however, parents may also influence offspring
   development through so called ``parental effects.{''} We examined the
   effects of environmental enrichment in zebrafish (Danio rerio) across
   two generations through the paternal lineage. Fathers and grandfathers
   were exposed to either standard or high levels of housing enrichment for
   4-weeks during adulthood. First-generation (F1) and second-generation
   (F2) offspring were obtained from controlled breeding and tested as
   larvae for changes in morphology at hatching stage (72hpf), and in
   locomotor activity at larval stage (120hpf) in both generations. We
   found paternal experience of enrichment resulted in changes in trunk
   length of F1 offspring and changes in spine curvature and dorsal length
   of F2 offspring, while changes in snout morphology of F2 offspring
   seemed to be driven by whether grandpaternal and paternal experience of
   the environment was matched or not. We found that while paternal
   enrichment increased the frequency of spontaneous movement in F1 and F2
   offspring, interacting effects of paternal and grandpaternal enrichment
   on movement distance were seen in F2 offspring, and that spontaneous
   movement and the distance that larvae swam are thus distinct phenotypes
   that were differentially affected by the experiences of previous
   paternal generations. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
   parental and grandparental environment influence zebrafish behavior and
   morphology. The nature of these effects and the design of this study
   mean that these phenotypes were likely the result of nongenetic
   transmission through the paternal germline.},

Abstract = {The chondrocranium is a key structure of the skull, but our knowledge of
   its embryonic development is based mostly on investigations of few
   stages across taxa. Variation of chondrocranial features is known across
   species, but little is known about intraspecific variation, or its
   evolution in the context of domestication. Here, we investigated two
   specific structures of the chondrocranium in three windows of embryonic
   development. The anatomy of one of these structures was also compared
   among adult skulls of chickens and their wild ancestor (red junglefowl
   {[}RJF]). The proccesus tectalis and the prenasal process, along with
   the surrounding area of the orbitonasal foramina, presented variation
   throughout the ontogeny and in the adults. The processus tectalis showed
   distinct variation from the earliest stage studied to the adult. The
   numbers of orbitonasal foramina were also found to be variable in the
   ancestor and breeds studied. Furthermore, during early embryonic
   development, the prenasal process is similar across breeds and RJF, but
   later in embryonic development this structure presents variable states.
   The embryonic and adult variation found herein could be an example of
   intraspecific variation under domestication, resulting from different
   types of tissue interrelationship during development.},

Title = {Optimising camera trap surveys for the Carpentarian Pseudantechinus
   (Pseudantechinus mimulus) in northwest Queensland},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {The Carpentarian Pseudantechinus (Pseudantechinus mimulus) is a poorly
   studied dasyurid marsupial that inhabits rocky outcrops in the Mount Isa
   Inlier bioregion in Queensland and the Gulf Coastal and Gulf Fall and
   Uplands bioregions in the Northern Territory. It is readily detected by
   passive infrared triggered camera traps ('camera traps'). Camera trap
   data can be used to develop detection probability estimates from which
   activity patterns can be inferred, but no effort has previously been
   made to determine changes in the detectability of P. mimulus throughout
   the year. We undertook a 13-month baited camera trap survey across nine
   sampling periods at 60 locations of known historic presence or nearby
   suitable habitat to assess the change in detection rates and detection
   probabilities of P. mimulus across a year. Detection probabilities were
   calculated from camera trap data within a single-species, multi-season
   occupancy framework to determine optimal survey timing. Detection
   probability data were used to calculate the likelihood of false absences
   to determine optimal survey duration. We recorded 2493 detections of P.
   mimulus over 10 966 camera days. Detection probability ranged from 0.009
   to 0.179 and was significantly higher from April to October than from
   November to March. The likelihood of false absences varied by sampling
   period and desired level of confidence. We find that camera trap surveys
   for P. mimulus are best conducted from April to October, but optimal
   survey duration is dependent upon the time of year and desired level of
   confidence that an observed absence from a given site reflects a true
   absence at that site. Attaining a minimum of 80\% confidence of absence
   requires as few as 9 days of survey effort in May to 16 days of survey
   effort in October.},

Abstract = {In phytophagous insects, oviposition behaviour is an important component
   of habitat selection and, given the multiplicity of genetic and
   environmental factors affecting its expression, is defined as a complex
   character resulting from the sum of interdependent traits. Here, we
   study two components of egg-laying behaviour: oviposition acceptance
   (OA) and oviposition preference (OP) in Drosophila melanogaster using
   three natural fruits as resources (grape, tomato and orange) by means of
   no-choice and two-choice experiments, respectively. This experimental
   design allowed us to show that the results obtained in two-choice assays
   (OP) cannot be accounted for by those resulting from no-choice assays
   (OA). Since the genomes of all lines used are completely sequenced, we
   perform a genome-wide association study to identify and characterize the
   genetic underpinnings of these oviposition behaviour traits. The
   analyses revealed different candidate genes affecting natural genetic
   variation of both OA and OP traits. Moreover, our results suggest
   behavioural and genetic decoupling between OA and OP and that egg-laying
   behaviour is plastic and context-dependent. Such independence in the
   genetic architectures of OA and OP variation may influence different
   aspects of oviposition behaviour, including plasticity, canalization,
   host shift and maintenance of genetic variability, which contributes to
   the adoption of adaptive strategies during habitat selection.},

Title = {Direct and indirect phenotypic effects on sociability indicate potential
   to evolve},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {209-220},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The decision to leave or join a group is important as group size
   influences many aspects of organisms' lives and their fitness. This
   tendency to socialise with others, sociability, should be influenced by
   genes carried by focal individuals (direct genetic effects) and by genes
   in partner individuals (indirect genetic effects), indicating the
   trait's evolution could be slower or faster than expected. However,
   estimating these genetic parameters is difficult. Here, in a laboratory
   population of the cockroach Blaptica dubia, I estimate phenotypic
   parameters for sociability: repeatability (R) and repeatable influence
   (RI), that indicate whether direct and indirect genetic effects
   respectively are likely. I also estimate the interaction coefficient
   (psi), which quantifies how strongly a partner's trait influences the
   phenotype of the focal individual and is key in models for the evolution
   of interacting phenotypes. Focal individuals were somewhat repeatable
   for sociability across a 3-week period (R = 0.080), and partners also
   had marginally consistent effects on focal sociability (RI = 0.053). The
   interaction coefficient was non-zero, although in opposite sign for the
   sexes; males preferred to associate with larger individuals (psi(male) =
   -0.129), while females preferred to associate with smaller individuals
   (psi(female) = 0.071). Individual sociability was consistent between
   dyadic trials and in social networks of groups. These results provide
   phenotypic evidence that direct and indirect genetic effects have
   limited influence on sociability, with perhaps most evolutionary
   potential stemming from heritable effects of the body mass of partners.
   Sex-specific interaction coefficients may produce sexual conflict and
   the evolution of sexual dimorphism in social behaviour.},

Title = {A novel neo-sex chromosome in Sylvietta brachyura (Macrosphenidae) adds
   to the extraordinary avian sex chromosome diversity among Sylvioidea
   songbirds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 26},
Abstract = {We report the discovery of a novel neo-sex chromosome in an African
   warbler, Sylvietta brachyura (northern crombec; Macrosphenidae). This
   species is part of the Sylvioidea superfamily, where four separate
   autosome-sex chromosome translocation events have previously been
   discovered via comparative genomics of 11 of the 22 families in this
   clade. Our discovery here resulted from analyses of genomic data of
   single species-representatives from three additional Sylvioidea families
   (Macrosphenidae, Pycnonotidae and Leiothrichidae). In all three species,
   we confirmed the translocation of a part of chromosome 4A to the sex
   chromosomes, which originated basally in Sylvioidea. In S. brachyura, we
   found that a part of chromosome 8 has been translocated to the sex
   chromosomes, forming a unique neo-sex chromosome in this lineage.
   Furthermore, the non-recombining part of 4A in S. brachyura is smaller
   than in other Sylvioidea species, which suggests that recombination
   continued along this region after the fusion event in the Sylvioidea
   ancestor. These findings reveal additional sex chromosome diversity
   among the Sylvioidea, where five separate translocation events are now
   confirmed.},

Abstract = {Whether sexual selection increases or decreases fitness is under ongoing
   debate. Sexual selection operates before and after mating. Yet, the
   effects of each episode of selection on individual reproductive success
   remain largely unexplored. We ask how disentangled pre- and
   post-copulatory sexual selection contribute to fitness of field crickets
   Gryllus bimaculatus. Treatments allowed exclusively for (i)
   pre-copulatory selection, with males fighting and courting one female,
   and the resulting pair breeding monogamously, (ii) post-copulatory
   selection, with females mating consecutively to multiple males and (iii)
   relaxed selection, with enforced pair monogamy. While standardizing the
   number of matings, we estimated a number of fitness traits across
   treatments and show that females experiencing sexual selection were more
   likely to reproduce, their offspring hatched sooner, developed faster
   and had higher body mass at adulthood, but females suffered survival
   costs. Interestingly, we found no differences in fitness of females or
   their offspring from pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection
   treatments. Our findings highlight the potential for sexual selection in
   enhancing indirect female fitness while concurrently imposing direct
   survival costs. By potentially outweighing these costs, increased
   offspring quality could lead to beneficial population-level consequences
   of sexual selection.},

Title = {100 years of Haldane's rule},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Haldane's rule is one of the `two rules of speciation'. It states that
   if one sex is `absent, rare or sterile' in a hybrid population, then
   that sex will be heterogametic. Since Haldane first made this
   observation, 100 years have passed and still questions arise over how
   many independent examples exist and what the underlying causes of
   Haldane's rule are. This review aims to examine research that has
   occurred over the last century. It seeks to do so by discussing possible
   causes of Haldane's rule, as well as gaps in the research of these
   causes that could be readily addressed today. After 100 years of
   research, it can be concluded that Haldane's rule is a complicated one,
   and much current knowledge has been accrued by studying the model
   organisms of speciation. This has led to the primacy of dominance theory
   and faster-male theory as explanations for Haldane's rule. However, some
   of the most interesting findings of the 21st century with regard to
   Haldane's rule have involved investigating a wider range of taxa
   emphasizing the need to continue using comparative methods, including
   ever more taxa as new cases are discovered.},

Title = {To self or not to self? Absence of mate choice despite costly
   outcrossing in the fungus Podospora anserina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Fungi have a large potential for flexibility in their mode of sexual
   reproduction, resulting in mating systems ranging from haploid selfing
   to outcrossing. However, we know little about which mating strategies
   are used in nature, and why, even in well-studied model organisms. Here,
   we explored the fitness consequences of alternative mating strategies in
   the ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina. We measured and compared
   fitness proxies of nine genotypes in either diploid selfing or
   outcrossing events, over two generations, and with or without
   environmental stress. We showed that fitness was consistently lower in
   outcrossing events, irrespective of the environment. The cost of
   outcrossing was partly attributed to non-self recognition genes with
   pleiotropic effects on fertility. We then predicted that when presented
   with options to either self or outcross, individuals would perform mate
   choice in favour of the reproductive strategy that yields higher
   fitness. Contrary to our prediction, individuals did not seem to avoid
   outcrossing when a choice was offered, in spite of the fitness cost
   incurred. Our results suggest that, although functionally diploid, P.
   anserina does not benefit from outcrossing in most cases. We outline
   different explanations for the apparent lack of mate choice in face of
   high fitness costs associated with outcrossing, including a new
   perspective on the pleiotropic effect of non-self recognition genes.},

Abstract = {Latently infected CD4+ T cells represent one of the major obstacles to
   HIV eradication even after receiving prolonged highly active
   anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term use of HAART causes the
   emergence of drug-resistant virus which is then involved in HIV
   transmission. In this paper, we develop mathematical HIV models with
   staged disease progression by incorporating entry inhibitor and latently
   infected cells. We find that entry inhibitor has the same effect as
   protease inhibitor on the model dynamics and therefore would benefit HIV
   patients who developed resistance to many of current anti-HIV
   medications. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results
   and show that the virus and latently infected cells reach an infected
   steady state in the absence of treatment and are eliminated under
   treatment whereas the model including homeostatic proliferation of
   latently infected cells maintains the virus at low level during
   suppressive treatment. Therefore, complete cure of HIV needs complete
   eradication of latent reservoirs.},

Abstract = {Large-scale changes in the ranges and abundance of a large number of
   species of both southern and northern origin have occurred in the Baltic
   region under the development of the warm phase of the climate in recent
   decades. Moreover, changes are far from being synchronous in different
   species of these groups. An increase in the population of the Caspian
   Tern Hydroprogne caspia and its active settlement in the northeast
   direction were observed in the first half of the 20th century. In recent
   decades, there has been, on the contrary, a general downward trend in
   the number. The article discusses in detail the history of the invasion
   of the species in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, the spatial
   distribution, and features of the habitat confinement of nesting birds.
   It is shown that, unlike other southern invaders of the region, the
   Caspian Tern has remained a rare species over the past 30-40 years with
   a tendency to strong population fluctuations. This is probably caused by
   the lack of a reserve of birds in the nearest breeding areas. It is
   shown that the Caspian Tern, which is a stenobiont species, usually
   nests on open sandy biotopes. Inhabiting the Gulf of Finland, it has
   mastered reproduction in a fundamentally different landscape, on selga
   massive-crystalline rocks.},

Title = {Intra-crown variation of leaf mass per area of Fagus crenata is driven
   by light acclimation of leaf thickness and hydraulic acclimation of leaf
   density},

Abstract = {In trees, leaf anatomy acclimates to the vertical light and hydraulic
   gradients within the crown. Intra-crown trait variation reflects
   phenotypic plasticity, which is considered a measure of individual-level
   acclimation to environmental variation. Here, we compared plasticity of
   leaf anatomical traits among trees from five regional populations of
   Fagus crenata and assessed the contribution of these traits to leaf mass
   per area (LMA). Intra-crown variation of LMA was larger than variation
   among trees from different sites, suggesting phenotypic plasticity is
   greater than genetic variation. After intra-crown light effects were
   removed, LMA increased with increasing height, suggesting, in addition
   to light acclimation, hydraulic limitation drives intra-crown variation.
   LMA was positively correlated with leaf thickness and negatively
   correlated with mesophyll porosity. Leaf thickness accounted for 39\% of
   the variation in LMA, while palisade thickness accounted for 62\% of the
   variation in leaf thickness, suggesting light was the main driver of
   leaf thickness. Thicker leaves also had denser mesophyll and thicker
   epidermal layers, both acclimations to low water availability (i.e.,
   hydraulic limitation). Among the traits, intra-crown plasticity was
   highest for mesophyll porosity, while there was no difference among
   trees from different sites in overall trait plasticity. Our results
   indicate phenotypic plasticity of leaf traits in F. crenata is mainly
   driven by light availability, while some traits, such as leaf density,
   may be driven by hydraulic limitation. In regional populations with high
   phenotypic plasticity, individual-level acclimation may buffer negative
   effects of future climate change on growth and productivity of F.

Title = {Are brood sex ratios adaptive?-The effect of experimentally altered
   brood sex ratio on nestling growth, mortality and recruitment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Brood sex ratios (BSRs) have often been found to be nonrandom in respect
   of parental and environmental quality, and many hypotheses suggest that
   nonrandom sex ratios can be adaptive. To specifically test the adaptive
   value of biased BSRs, it is crucial to disentangle the consequences of
   BSR and maternal effects. In multiparous species, this requires
   cross-fostering experiments where foster parents rear offspring
   originating from multiple broods, and where the interactive effect of
   original and manipulated BSR on fitness components is tested. To our
   knowledge, our study on collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) is
   the first that meets these requirements. In this species, where BSRs had
   previously been shown to be related to parental characteristics, we
   altered the original BSR of the parents shortly after hatching by
   cross-fostering nestlings among trios of broods and examined the effects
   on growth, mortality and recruitment of the nestlings. We found that
   original and experimental BSR, as well as the interaction of the two,
   were unrelated to the fitness components considered. Nestling growth was
   related only to background variables, namely brood size and hatching
   rank. Nestling mortality was related only to hatching asynchrony. Our
   results therefore do not support that the observed BSRs are adaptive in
   our study population. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of
   direct effects of experimentally altered BSRs on parental fitness, which
   should be evaluated in the future. In addition, studies similar to ours
   are required on various species to get a clearer picture of the adaptive
   value of nonrandom BSRs.},

Title = {Within-population variation in body size plasticity in response to
   combined nutritional and thermal stress is partially independent from
   variation in development time},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},

Volume = {36},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ongoing climate change has forced animals to face changing thermal and
   nutritional environments. Animals can adjust to such combinations of
   stressors via plasticity. Body size is a key trait influencing
   organismal fitness, and plasticity in this trait in response to
   nutritional and thermal conditions varies among genetically diverse,
   locally adapted populations. The standing genetic variation within a
   population can also influence the extent of body size plasticity. We
   generated near-isogenic lines from a newly collected population of
   Drosophila melanogaster at the mid-point of east coast Australia and
   assayed body size for all lines in combinations of thermal and
   nutritional stress. We found that isogenic lines showed distinct
   underlying patterns of body size plasticity in response to temperature
   and nutrition that were often different from the overall population
   response. We then tested whether plasticity in development time could
   explain, and therefore regulate, variation in body size to these
   combinations of environmental conditions. We selected five genotypes
   that showed the greatest variation in response to combined thermal and
   nutritional stress and assessed the correlation between response of
   developmental time and body size. While we found significant genetic
   variation in development time plasticity, it was a poor predictor of
   body size among genotypes. Our results therefore suggest that multiple
   developmental pathways could generate genetic variation in body size
   plasticity. Our study emphasizes the need to better understand genetic
   variation in plasticity within a population, which will help determine
   the potential for populations to adapt to ongoing environmental change.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {To achieve a sustainable society and solve the problems caused by
   climate change and socioeconomic activities, it is necessary to monitor
   the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem functions, services,
   and biodiversity at both regional and global scales. During the last
   decade, we have seen rapid and significant improvement in satellite and
   near-surface remote-sensing technologies. In this review, we describe
   how remote-sensing observations are being used to effectively evaluate
   the spatial and temporal variability of land use and cover types and of
   plant phenology in East Asia. We discuss the current status,
   uncertainties, problems, and future perspectives for terrestrial
   ecosystem and biodiversity monitoring, and we address the
   multidisciplinary research by incorporating in situ and satellite
   observations for East Asia. Recent satellites with advanced optical
   sensors, such as MultiSpectral Instrument/Sentinel-2A/2B, Advanced
   Himawari Imager/Himawari-8, and PlanetScope, and satellites with
   synthetic aperture radar, such as Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2,
   allow detailed monitoring of land use and cover type changes and plant
   phenology. These satellite sensors can provide images with high spatial
   (3-10 m) and high temporal (10 min to 5 days) resolution, at both large
   (>= 1 km(2)) and small (<1 km(2)) scales. In particular, researchers are
   expected to develop discrimination techniques that will enable these
   advanced satellite technologies to detect evergreen broadleaf trees and
   ways to estimate the geographic distribution of leaf traits. We
   encourage more collaborations among ecologists, engineers, and
   remote-sensing scientists to share their abundant knowledge and
   experience and thereby improve the monitoring capabilities.},

Abstract = {The firefly Photinus pyralis inhabits a wide range of latitudinal and
   ecological niches, with populations living from temperate to tropical
   habitats. Despite its broad distribution, its demographic history is
   unknown. In this study, we modelled and inferred different demographic
   scenarios for North American populations of P. pyralis, which were
   collected from Texas to New Jersey. We used a combination of ABC
   techniques (for multi-population/colonization analyses) and likelihood
   inference (dadi, StairwayPlot2, PoMo) for single-population demographic
   inference, which proved useful with our RAD data. We uncovered that the
   most ancestral North American population lays in Texas, which further
   colonized the Central region of the US and more recently the North
   Eastern coast. Our study confidently rejects a demographic scenario
   where the North Eastern populations colonized more southern populations
   until reaching Texas. To estimate the age of divergence between of P.
   pyralis, which provides deeper insights into the history of the entire
   species, we assembled a multi-locus phylogenetic data covering the genus
   Photinus. We uncovered that the phylogenetic node leading to P. pyralis
   lies at the end of the Miocene. Importantly, modelling the demographic
   history of North American P. pyralis serves as a null model of
   nucleotide diversity patterns in a widespread native insect species,
   which will serve in future studies for the detection of adaptation
   events in this firefly species, as well as a comparison for future
   studies of other North American insect taxa.},

Abstract = {Latitudinal gradients in the variability of plant trait expression are
   insufficiently studied. Here, we infer the expression and variability of
   major reproductive traits in Japanese angiosperm woody plants using
   geographical distributions of 773 woody plant species and 4682 grid
   cells at the 10 x 10 km(2) spatial resolution. We focus on flower color,
   flower size, fruit size, fruit type, seed mass, and dispersal type and
   relate trait mean values and within cell variability to latitude, forest
   area and fragmentation, phylogenetic relatedness, and socioeconomic
   factors. To account for the correlation between variability and mean
   trait values, we use a recently developed model based on Taylor's power
   law (TPL). All studied reproductive traits exhibited strong although
   contrasting latitudinal gradients. Contrary to Gloger's rule, flowers
   tended to be darker at higher latitudes. Flower sizes increased and
   fruit and seed sizes decreased at higher latitudes. Color variability
   increased while variability in fruit size decreased toward higher
   latitudes. Higher human impact influenced fruit size positively and seed
   size negatively. We confirmed the usefulness of the TPL in the study of
   trait variability. We interpret the darker flower colors at higher
   latitudes as an adaptation to predominant bee pollination and thus as an
   effect of ecological filtering. Our study does not unequivocally
   corroborate the hypothesis that color variability within woody plant
   communities is governed by the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. We
   interpret the observed latitudinal trends toward higher variation in
   flower color and size in terms of increased numbers of generalist
   pollinators at higher latitudes.},

Title = {Landscape effects on pollinator abundance differ among taxonomic groups},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {434-445},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding how landscape composition affects pollinator abundance is
   crucial for conserving the sustainability of the symbiotic relationship
   between plants and pollinators. However, field evidence on the effect of
   landscape composition and spatial scales on the abundance of each
   pollinator group is biased toward bee pollinators, and non-bee
   pollinators tend to be excluded. This study aims to evaluate the effect
   of landscape composition at various spatial scales on diverse taxonomic
   groups of pollinators, including non-bee pollinators. We selected 22
   grasslands with varying landscape compositions in Shiroi City, Chiba
   Prefecture, Japan. We recorded the abundance of pollinators and floral
   resource availability at these sites. The effects of landscape
   composition within a 100-1000 m radius and the floral resource
   availability were analyzed using Bayesian generalized linear mixed
   models to determine whether these factors affected the abundance of each
   pollinator group. As a result, the difference in important factors among
   the pollinator groups was detected; Scoliidae, Lycaenidae, Stomorhina
   obsoleta, and Sphaerophoria were influenced by the landscape
   composition, whereas Bombus diversus and Hesperiidae were not. Scoliidae
   was affected by the proportion of agri-field and forest areas within a
   500-1000 m radius. St. obsoleta and Sphaerophoria showed different
   response patterns to the proportion of urban land within a 100 m radius.
   B. diversus and Hesperiidae were influenced by floral resource
   availability. Our study suggests that considering the spatial scales of
   landscape composition on the target species is essential to plan
   effective conservation measures.},

Title = {Seasonal patterns of sugar components and their functions in branches of
   Fagus crenata in association with three reproduction events},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 29},
Abstract = {Soluble sugars have multiple functions in plants and both their absolute
   and relative abundances may vary in association with diverse
   physiological processes and life-history events. Some also have specific
   functions in different organs that vary seasonally. Therefore, studying
   the dynamics of sugar compositions in woody species would further our
   understanding of their functions, which has been mainly analyzed en
   bloc. In order to elucidate the functions of specific soluble sugars and
   the effects of reproduction on their profile, we monitored the soluble
   sugar composition in ``new `` (current-year) and ``old `` (1-3 years
   old) branches of Fagus crenata for 7 years, which included three
   reproduction ( ``masting ``) events. As well as the generally
   predominant sugar species (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), substantial
   amounts of raffinose (accounting for up to 42\% of the total sugars)
   were found in both new and old branches during winter hardening. In
   addition, myo-inositol (which plays important roles in cell growth and
   development) was detected mainly during the early growing season and
   fluctuated interannually in both new and old branches. Furthermore, the
   only clear change in soluble sugar contents associated with reproduction
   events was in myo-inositol concentrations in the new branches, which
   were lower in fruiting trees than in non-fruiting trees, possibly due to
   the growth reduction in fruiting tree branches identified in previous
   studies. The results show the importance of considering the dynamics of
   each sugar component, rather than en bloc, in attempts to elucidate
   their roles in physiological processes and responses to environmental
   changes.},

Abstract = {Meleagris gallopavo L. (Wild Turkey) is a valued game species that is
   sensitive to the timing of hunting seasons, which generally overlap with
   breeding, but can vary spatially or temporally. Here, we analyze the
   timing of turkey reproduction across North Carolina by examining
   camera-trap images collected from 527 sites over 3 years. We found a
   peak of male strutting behavior at Julian week 13 and, based on the age
   of poults photographed later in the summer, estimated the peak of egg
   hatching at week 22. The timing of strutting significantly varied across
   years but not across the 3 ecoregions of the state. Understanding turkey
   breeding and reproductive chronology can be useful when agencies set
   hunting seasons to balance the interest of hunters while minimizing
   potential impacts to reproduction.},

Abstract = {Adaptive approaches are needed to effectively manage dynamic marine

   where conservation issues are likely to arise in the future. The recent
   development of subseasonal global environmental forecasts provides an
   opportunity to inform management by forecasting species distributions in
   advance over operational timeframes. We demonstrate the utility of
   environmental forecasts for managing marine mammals by integrating
   species distribution models with subseasonal forecasts to predict the
   arrival of migratory humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at
   foraging grounds in the Northeast US. Environmental forecasts showed
   high model skill at lead times of up to 2 weeks and resulting humpback
   whale models performed well in predicting humpback arrival. Forecasts of
   whale distribution can shape management efforts to minimize both impacts
   on whales and economic costs. Applying subseasonal forecasts to
   anticipate future risk presents a powerful tool for the dynamic
   management of marine mammals. Front Ecol Environ 2022;},

Title = {Static allometries do not reflect evolutionary allometry in exaggerated

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1524-1536},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Across the animal kingdom, exaggerated weaponry is frequently used by
   one sex to contest access for potential mates. Within species, if
   disproportionate investment in weaponry confers an advantage to larger
   individuals, this may result in positive static allometry. It is
   predicted that the same selective pressures may also lead to positive
   evolutionary allometry, where larger species bear disproportionately
   large weapons on average, compared with smaller species. Furthermore, in
   species with stronger sexual selection, the static allometries of those
   weapons are expected to steepen. All adult males across the New Zealand
   sheetweb spider genus Cambridgea bear exaggerated chelicerae, which are
   used to compete for control of females' webs. Here, we characterize the
   distribution of chelicera lengths within each sex of 12 Cambridgea
   species to show that chelicerae almost always exhibit positive static
   allometry in males while female chelicera lengths are consistently
   isometric. We use comparative phylogenetic methods to demonstrate that
   the slopes of static allometries steepen in males of larger species but
   that the ratio of average chelicera length to cephalothorax width is
   tightly conserved across taxa, leading to an isometric evolutionary
   allometry. While static allometries indeed steepen in larger species,
   possibly due to stronger sexual selection, this conservation of relative
   trait size suggests that chelicera length is subject to other
   stabilizing selective pressures. Changes to species body plans might be
   constrained, while still allowing for disproportionate investment in
   weapon traits in the upper range of intraspecific body sizes.},

Volume = {35},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ecological conditions limiting the time to find a compatible mate or
   increasing the difficulty in doing so likely promote the evolution of
   traits used for species and mate recognition. In addition to
   interspecific character displacement signalling species identity,
   intraspecific traits that signal an individual's sex and breeding status
   reduce the challenge of identifying a compatible conspecific mate and
   should be more common in migratory rather than sedentary species,
   species with shorter breeding seasons and species breeding under high
   sympatry with many closely related heterospecifics. Here, we tested this
   recognition hypothesis for promoting plumage sexual dichromatism in the
   true thrushes (Turdus spp.), a large and diverse genus of passerine
   birds. We used receptor-noise limited models of avian vision to quantify
   avian-perceived chromatic and achromatic visual contrasts between male
   and female plumage patches and tested the influence of breeding season
   length, spatial distribution and sympatry with other Turdus species on
   plumage dichromatism. As predicted, we found that (1) true thrush
   species with migratory behaviour have greater plumage sexual
   dichromatism than non-migratory species, (2) species with longer
   breeding seasons have less plumage sexual dichromatism, and (3) greater
   numbers of Turdus thrush species breeding in sympatry is associated with
   more plumage sexual dichromatism. These results suggest that social
   recognition systems, including species and mate recognition, play a
   prominent role in the evolution of plumage sexual dichromatism in true
   thrushes.},

Abstract = {Migration, a critical evolutionary force, can have contrasting effects
   on adaptation. It can aid as well as impede adaptation. The effects of
   migration on microbial adaptation have been studied primarily in simple
   constant environments. Very little is known about the effects of
   migration on adaptation to complex, fluctuating environments. In our
   study, we subjected replicate populations of Escherichia coli, adapting
   to complex and unpredictably fluctuating environments to different
   proportions of clonal ancestral immigrants. Contrary to the results from
   simple/constant environments, the presence of clonal immigrants reduced
   all measured proxies of fitness. However, migration from a source
   population with a greater variance in fitness resulted in no change in
   fitness with respect to the no-migration control, except at the highest
   level of migration. Thus, the presence of variation in the immigrants
   could counter the adverse effects of migration in complex and
   unpredictably fluctuating environments. Our study demonstrates that the
   effects of migration are strongly dependent on the nature of the
   destination environment and the genetic makeup of immigrants. These
   results enhance our understanding of the influences of migrating
   populations, which could help better predict the consequences of
   migration.},

Title = {Transcriptomic responses of females to consumption of nuptial food gifts
   as a potential mediator of sexual conflict in decorated crickets},

Abstract = {Nuptial food gift provisioning by males to females at mating is a
   strategy in many insects that is thought to be shaped by sexual conflict
   or sexual selection, as it affords males access to a female's
   physiology. While males often attempt to use these gifts to influence
   female behaviour to their own advantage, females can evolve counter
   mechanisms. In decorated crickets, the male's nuptial gift comprises
   part of the spermatophore, the spermatophylax, the feeding on which
   deters the female from prematurely terminating sperm transfer. However,
   ingested compounds in the spermatophylax and attachment of the
   sperm-containing ampulla could further influence female physiology and
   behaviour. We investigated how mating per se and these two distinct
   routes of potential male-mediated manipulation influence the female
   transcriptomic response. We conducted an RNA sequencing experiment on
   gut and head tissues from females for whom nuptial food gift consumption
   and receipt of an ejaculation were independently manipulated. In the gut
   tissue, we found that females not permitted to feed during mating
   exhibited decreased overall gene expression, possibly caused by a
   reduced gut function, but this was countered by feeding on the
   spermatophylax or a sham gift. In the head tissue, we found only low
   numbers of differentially expressed genes, but a gene co-expression
   network analysis revealed that ampulla attachment and spermatophylax
   consumption independently induce distinct gene expression patterns. This
   study provides evidence that spermatophylax feeding alters the female
   post-mating transcriptomic response in decorated crickets, highlighting
   its potential to mediate sexual conflict in this system.},

Title = {Alien and Native Dominants Exercise Similar Effects on the Species

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {It remains unclear whether the effect exercised by alien dominants on
   the species richness in plant communities is on average stronger than
   the effect exercised by native dominants. To clear up this point, 20
   synanthropic plant communities dominated by species of different
   biogeographical origins were surveyed in the Belaya River valley,
   Western Caucasus (190-680 m above sea level). For each of the studied
   communities, aboveground biomass samples were collected on 25-30 plots
   0.25 m(2) in size with different shares of dominants; the collected
   samples were subsequently sorted by species and weighed. Analysis of the
   field data made it possible to draw the following conclusions: (1)
   samples with high shares of alien and native dominants differ
   statistically insignificantly in the average number of species; (2) on
   average, the relationship between the degree of dominance of alien
   species and the species richness is as strong as the relationship
   between the degree of dominance of native species and the species
   richness; (3) in most cases, the relationship between these parameters
   can be satisfactorily explained by the ``energy-diversity{''}
   hypothesis; and (4) the proportion of synanthropic plant species in
   communities with high shares of alien and native dominants is not higher
   than that in communities with low shares of these dominants. Overall,
   the results indicate that alien and native dominants exercise similar
   and mostly nonselective effects on accompanying species in plant
   communities.},

Abstract = {The data on parasitizing of two species of myxosporeans of the genus
   Kudoa in the muscles of two species of alien gobies in the Black Sea off
   the coast of Sevastopol are presented. One isolate was found in the
   chameleon goby Tridentiger trigonocephalus, and the other one was found
   in the red-mouthed goby Gobius cruentatus. It is supposed that the
   source of infection for the alien fish were native gobies, in which the
   above species of parasites were previously known. A decrease in the size
   of spores and polar capsules as well as a slight deformation of the
   spore shape of K. niluferi were observed, which may be associated with
   parasitizing in an unusual host and in another part of the range.
   Molecular genetic identification of myxosporeans from two species of
   gobies confirms that the studied isolates belong to the genus Kudoa. Two
   18S rDNA sequences of these isolates turned out to be very similar, but
   not identical to each other (differences of 4.87\%), and also similar to
   two known species of goby myxosporeans from the Black Sea, K. nova and
   K. niluferi. The results obtained are the first evidence of parasitizing
   of both species of gobies by Myxosporea representatives in the area of
   invasion and also compensate for the absence of information on genomic
   variability of parasites of chameleon and red-mouthed gobies in the
   native range.},

   reached 50 specimens/dm(2) of cableway structures. There are no food
   plants of this invader on the plateau. It is most likely that adults of
   C. arcuata are brought to the plateau by vertical air currents from the
   areas located below, where the pest successfully reproduces and
   develops. The Ai-Petri Plateau is a reserve of the adult pest, which
   provides its expansion to other territories of southern Crimea by air
   currents. Chemical control of the C. arcuata population at the apex of

Title = {Future climate conditions accelerate wheat straw decomposition alongside

Abstract = {Although microbial decomposition of plant litter plays a crucial role in
   nutrient cycling and soil fertility, we know less about likely links of
   specific microbial traits and decomposition, especially in relation to
   climate change. We study here wheat straw decomposition under ambient
   and manipulated conditions simulating a future climate scenario (next 80
   years) in agroecosystems, including decay rates, macronutrient dynamics,
   enzyme activity, and microbial communities. We show that future climate
   will accelerate straw decay rates only during the early phase of the
   decomposition process. Additionally, the projected climate change will
   increase the relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi in decomposing
   wheat straw. Moreover, the impact of future climate on microbial
   community assembly and molecular ecological networks of both bacteria
   and fungi will strongly depend on the decomposition phase. During the
   early phase of straw decomposition, stochastic processes dominated
   microbial assembly under ambient climate conditions, whereas
   deterministic processes highly dominated bacterial and fungal
   communities under simulated future climate conditions. In the later
   decomposition phase, similar assembly processes shaped the microbial
   communities under both climate scenarios. Furthermore, over the early
   phases of decomposition, simulated future climate enhanced the
   complexity of microbial interaction networks. We concluded that the
   impact of future climate on straw decay rate and associated microbial
   traits like assembly processes and inter-community interactions is
   restricted to the early phase of decomposition.},

Title = {Light-independent anaerobic microbial oxidation of manganese driven by
   an electrosyntrophic coculture},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {163-171},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Anaerobic microbial manganese oxidation (AMMO) has been considered an
   ancient biological metabolism for Mn element cycling on Archaean Earth
   before the presence of oxygen. A light-dependent AMMO was recently
   observed under strictly anoxic conditions, providing a new proxy for the
   interpretation of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, the
   feasibility of biotic Mn(II) oxidation in dark geological habitats that
   must have been abundant remains unknown. Therefore, we discovered that
   it would be possible to achieve AMMO in a light-independent
   electrosyntrophic coculture between Rhodopseudomonas palustris and
   Geobacter metallireducens. Transmission electron microscopy analysis
   revealed insoluble particle formation in the coculture with Mn(II)
   addition. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analysis verified that these particles were a mixture of MnO2 and Mn3O4.
   The absence of Mn oxides in either of the monocultures indicated that
   the Mn(II)-oxidizing activity was induced via electrosyntrophic
   interactions. Radical quenching and isotopic experiments demonstrated
   that hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) produced from H2O dissociation by
   R. palustris in the coculture contributed to Mn(II) oxidation. All these
   findings suggest a new, symbiosis-dependent and light-independent AMMO
   route, with potential importance to the evolution of oxygenic
   photosynthesis and the biogeochemical cycling of manganese on Archaean
   and modern Earth.},

Abstract = {Diel and seasonal changes in the gut contents of omnivorous-carnivorous
   macroinvertebrates were examined in a Japanese mountain stream based on
   direct observation of gut contents. Carnivorous-omnivorous (predator)
   macroinvertebrates were sampled at four time periods (02:00-03:00,
   08:00-09:00, 14:00-15:00, and 20:00-21:00) on 3 days in each of March,
   June, September, and December. A total of 1391 individual
   macroinvertebrates belonging to 71 taxa were dissected: identifiable gut
   contents were observed in 928 individuals and prey identified to the
   family level were observed from the guts of 564 individuals. Using
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling, interspecific variation in foraging
   patterns was summarized into two axes that approximately correspond to
   body size and habitat preferences of prey taxa. Although seasonal
   patterns in the number of prey individuals in a gut varied among taxa,
   in March and December, several predators notably foraged on taxa such as
   Simuliidae, which inhabits stone surfaces in river sections with a rapid
   current. This pattern may be explained by season-specific prey
   availability and predation risks from vertebrates. Diel changing
   patterns in the number of prey individuals per gut varied among predator
   taxa, and most predators did not show obvious proportional changes in
   gut contents. These results indicate that subcompartments of interaction
   networks and numerous indirect effects via intraguild predation
   potentially exist within the ``guild `` of macroinvertebrates, which are

Title = {Testing the Enemy Release Hypothesis in the Invasive Fish Amatitlania

Abstract = {The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) posits that invasive species are
   released from their natural enemies in their invasive range, which
   promotes their successful invasion. In this study, we tested the ERH in
   a population of the convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata, an
   invasive species in Mexico. The ERH predicts that the convict cichlid:
   (a) is not infected by specialist helminth parasites in the invasive
   range; (b) has lower infection parameter values, as measured through
   richness, prevalence, abundance and diversity of helminths, than a
   native species-the redside cichlid Cichlasoma istlanum; and (c) is not
   affected in its condition factor by the abundance of helminths it
   carries. The convict cichlid was infected by two (33\%) specialist
   helminths relative to the six specialist helminths that infect the
   cichlid in its native range. The convict cichlid had lower helminth
   richness and diversity than the redside cichlid. However, the prevalence
   and abundance of the parasite species varied between the host fish.
   While the prevalence and abundance of the nematode Rhabdochona kidderi
   was higher in the redside cichlid, the prevalence and abundance of the
   trematode Uvulifer sp. was higher in the convict cichlid. The condition
   factor in both host fish was not correlated with helminth abundance. Our
   results do not agree with the prediction that the convict cichlid is
   completely released from specialist parasites, nor with the prediction
   that this invasive species has lower infection parameter values than the
   native redside cichlid. However, our results agree with the prediction
   that the abundance of parasite helminths do not affect the cichlid's
   condition factor. More studies are necessary to determine the advantages
   that the convict cichlid could have in the invasive range when it is
   infected with a low richness and diversity of helminths.},

Abstract = {Dispersal is an important factor in shaping ecosystems and patterns of
   biodiversity. However, animals use several different modes of dispersal,
   each of which can have varying impacts on the ecology and evolutionary
   history of a group. One of these modes is phoresy, when an animal (the
   phorant) will temporarily attach itself to another animal (the host) as
   a means of dispersal. This behavior has been described in many groups of
   animals, but very infrequently in the thrips (Insecta: Thysanoptera).
   Here, we report the collection of 2 species of live thrips, Hoplothrips
   sp. and Neohydatothrips variabilis, from 2 species of live birds,
   Cardinalis cardinalis (Northern Cardinal) and Zenaida macroura (Mourning
   Dove), respectively, in northeast Arkansas. Most previous records of
   thrips associated with birds were from nesting material or found on
   deceased birds. The presence of thrips on live birds suggests some
   thrips are phoretic on birds, or at the very least that interactions
   between thrips and birds are more frequent than previously assumed.},

Abstract = {Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic
   continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be
   associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of
   some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed)
   footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most
   paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some
   workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph
   ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is
   usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead
   attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a
   pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of
   the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal
   dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously
   available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those
   of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges
   from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of
   both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of
   prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal
   sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these
   features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit
   I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some
   pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all)
   morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been
   made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to
   determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.},

Abstract = {Understanding habitat use and nursery areas of larval fish is a key
   component to managing and conserving riverine fishes. Yet, freshwater
   researchers often focus only on adult fishes, resulting in a limited
   understanding of the habitat requirements for the early life stages of
   freshwater fishes. The goal of this study was to quantify the larval
   fish microhabitat use of three fish families in Twelvemile Creek, a
   fifth-order tributary of Lake Hartwell (Savannah River basin) in the
   Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. We used handheld dipnets to
   sample larval fishes along 20 equidistant transects spaced 10 m apart
   weekly from May to July 2021 along a 200 m stream reach. We also
   collected microhabitat data at each larval fish capture location. Most
   captured individuals were in the metalarval stage and were identified to
   the family level. A partial distance-based redundancy analysis indicated
   that water velocity contributed to changes in larval fish assemblage
   structure. Larval fishes occupied a subset of the available habitat that
   was characterized by low water velocity, non-Podostemum substrate, and
   shallow habitats close to the shore or bed rock structure. We also
   detected temporal patterns in larval fish counts, with peak Percidae and
   Leuciscidae counts in late July and the highest Catostomidae counts in
   late May-early June. Our results suggest that larval fishes select
   habitats with low water velocity and shallow habitats close to shore
   microhabitat characteristics, and that riffle-pool sequences may serve
   as a nursery habitat for Percidae, Catostomidae and Leuciscidae
   metalarvae.},

Abstract = {Although the outcome of parasitic infections can be explained by a
   combination of environmental and host/parasite genetic factors, these
   factors are often confounded by geography. Thus, linking temperature, a
   locally variable environmental factor, with host and parasite genetics
   can reveal complex spatial host-parasite interactions. We used Daphnia
   magna genotypes from Central Europe, where the Hamiltosporidium
   tvaerminnensis parasite has not yet been reported, and from two regions
   where it is frequently found, Northern Europe and Mediterranean basin.
   In Central Europe habitats are usually permanent and hosts are typically
   in their planktonic phase during summer - the hottest time of the year.
   In Northern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, on the other hand, hosts
   inhabit ponds that frequently dry-up in summer. We predicted that high
   temperatures during host and parasite active phases would prevent
   long-term parasite persistence. By exposing all hosts to two parasite
   isolates at ambient and stressfully high temperatures we tested this
   prediction. At ambient temperatures, we confirmed that long-term
   parasite persistence is only possible in Northern and Mediterranean host
   genotypes, while we observed reduced persistence at high temperature,
   but only for the Mediterranean hosts. Virulence was higher in Northern
   host genotypes only at ambient temperature. These results were
   consistent among the two parasites isolates. Our findings, thus, do not
   corroborate our hypotheses and suggest that predictions about responses
   to future climate change are highly complex in this host-parasite
   system.},

Title = {Systematic bias and the phylogeny of Coleoptera-A response to Cai et al.

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY},

Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Systematic bias is one of the major phylogenetic issues arising over the
   last two decades. Using methods designed to reduce compositional and
   rate heterogeneity, hence systematic bias, Cai and co-workers (2022) (=
   CEA22) reanalyzed the DNA sequence dataset for Coleoptera of Zhang et
   al. (2018) (= ZEA). CEA22 suggest that their phylogenetic results and
   major evolutionary hypotheses about the Coleoptera should be favoured
   over other recently published studies. Here, we discuss the methodology
   of CEA22 with particular attention to how their perfunctory reanalysis
   of ZEA obfuscates rather than illuminates beetle phylogeny. Similar to
   published rebuttals of an earlier study of theirs, we specifically find
   that many of their claims are misleading, unsupported, or false.
   Critically, CEA22 fail to establish the stated premise for their
   reanalysis. They fail to demonstrate how composition or rate
   heterogeneity supposedly impacted the phylogeny estimate of ZEA, let
   alone the results of other recent studies. Moreover, despite their claim
   of comprehensive sampling of Coleoptera, their dataset is neither the
   most diverse with respect to species and higher taxa included, nor
   anywhere near the largest in terms of sequence data and sampled loci.
   Although CEA22 does contribute additional fossils for calibration, those
   seeking the best available estimate for Coleoptera phylogeny and
   evolution based on molecular data are advised to look elsewhere.},

Title = {Propagation of viral genomes by replicating ammonia-oxidising archaea
   during soil nitrification},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {309-314},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) are a ubiquitous component of microbial
   communities and dominate the first stage of nitrification in some soils.
   While we are beginning to understand soil virus dynamics, we have no
   knowledge of the composition or activity of those infecting nitrifiers
   or their potential to influence processes. This study aimed to
   characterise viruses having infected autotrophic AOA in two nitrifying
   soils of contrasting pH by following transfer of assimilated CO2-derived
   C-13 from host to virus via DNA stable-isotope probing and metagenomic
   analysis. Incorporation of C-13 into low GC mol\% AOA and virus genomes
   increased DNA buoyant density in CsCl gradients but resulted in
   co-migration with dominant non-enriched high GC mol\% genomes, reducing
   sequencing depth and contig assembly. We therefore developed a hybrid
   approach where AOA and virus genomes were assembled from low buoyant
   density DNA with subsequent mapping of C-13 isotopically enriched high
   buoyant density DNA reads to identify activity of AOA.
   Metagenome-assembled genomes were different between the two soils and
   represented a broad diversity of active populations. Sixty-four
   AOA-infecting viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified
   with no clear relatedness to previously characterised prokaryote
   viruses. These vOTUs were also distinct between soils, with 42\%
   enriched in C-13 derived from hosts. The majority were predicted as
   capable of lysogeny and auxiliary metabolic genes included an
   AOA-specific multicopper oxidase suggesting infection may augment copper
   uptake essential for central metabolic functioning. These findings
   indicate virus infection of AOA may be a frequent process during
   nitrification with potential to influence host physiology and activity.},

   heterogeneity},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-69},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Microbial activity in the deep sea is cumulatively important for global
   elemental cycling yet is difficult to quantify and characterize due to
   low cell density and slow growth. Here, we investigated microbial
   activity off the California coast, 50-4000 m water depth, using
   sensitive single-cell measurements of stable-isotope uptake and nucleic
   acid sequencing. We observed the highest yet reported proportion of
   active cells in the bathypelagic (up to 78\%) and calculated that
   deep-sea cells (200-4000 m) are responsible for up to 34\% of total
   microbial biomass synthesis in the water column. More cells assimilated
   nitrogen derived from amino acids than ammonium, and at higher rates.
   Nitrogen was assimilated preferentially to carbon from amino acids in
   surface waters, while the reverse was true at depth. We introduce and
   apply the Gini coefficient, an established equality metric in economics,
   to quantify intracommunity heterogeneity in microbial anabolic activity.
   We found that heterogeneity increased with water depth, suggesting a
   minority of cells contribute disproportionately to total activity in the
   deep sea. This observation was supported by higher RNA/DNA ratios for
   low abundance taxa at depth. Intracommunity activity heterogeneity is a
   fundamental and rarely measured ecosystem parameter and may have
   implications for community function and resilience.},

Title = {A comparison of fish communities between coves of varying connection to
   Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {543-554},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Sediment berms of various heights have developed in the mouths of
   several coves within Harlan County Reservoir due to a combination of
   sediment deposition and lateral drift of eroded sediments. These berms
   can isolate coves from the main reservoir if the berm height is greater
   than the water elevation of the reservoir. Previous research in other
   reservoirs has shown that fish communities may differ in coves based on
   their connection histories. This study examines similarities and
   differences in fish assemblages between several disconnected coves and
   connected coves in Harlan County Reservoir. Connected coves had greater
   species richness and diversity compared to disconnected coves. Fish
   communities between cove types were relatively similar based on
   presence-absence data but notably different based on species abundance.
   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed that fish
   communities were distinct between cove types. Eleven fish species were
   indicators of connected coves, and two species were indicators of
   disconnected coves. Disconnected coves had higher abundances of
   understudied native species rarely found in the main reservoir, such as
   Orangespotted Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Black Bullhead. Further
   research evaluating the influence of water quality, food availability,
   and duration of isolation is needed to understand the effect of cove
   disconnection on fish communities. Managers can use this information
   when planning cove renovations by weighing the costs and benefits of
   either maintaining ecologically distinct coves versus connecting coves
   and improving habitat accessibility for reservoir fishes.},

Abstract = {The state of the population of the invader Mnemiopsis leidyi (A.

   and the trophic relationships and predatory impact of M. leidyi on the
   prey populations in the western and eastern sectors of the open Black
   Sea were studied in July-August 2017. The average biomass of M. leidyi
   at the peak of its seasonal development in these areas was 92-258 g
   m(-2). The food spectrum of M. leidyi was dominated by copepods Acartia
   spp. and Calanus euxinus (Hulsemann, 1984). Spatial differences in the
   quantitative development of M. leidyi and zooplankton, the intensity of
   food consumption, and prey grazing were found. A high rate of food
   consumption (specific daily ration of 45.50 +/- 8.31\% C of body) and
   intensive grazing of M. leidyi (up to similar to 50\% of the biomass of
   Acartia spp. per day) in the western offshore part of the sea should be
   accompanied by a decrease in mesoplankton biomass. On the contrary,
   predation by M. leidyi did not significantly affect the plankton
   community in the east, where M. leidyi consumed about 6\% of the biomass
   of Acartia spp.},

Abstract = {The article summarizes information on the penetration and spread of 14
   most dangerous or potentially dangerous invasive species across the
   territory of Armenia, threatening natural biodiversity, natural
   ecosystems, and, to some extent, public health. It is shown that 8 out
   of 14 species were deliberately introduced into Armenia as ornamental
   plants or plants for landscaping of settlements and forest protection
   zones along roads and railways. At the same time, five of these species
   are arborous plants. Four species ended up on the territory of the
   republic as a result of their self-dispersal, and two species appeared
   as a result of unintentional introduction. The degree of threat to
   biodiversity and natural ecosystems is characterized as ``high{''} for
   seven species and ``very high{''} for four species, and three species
   are listed as ``potentially invasive.{''} At the same time, one species
   (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) represents a ``very high{''} threat to public
   health. The article proves the absolute necessity of conducting an
   examination on the threat of invasion when planning the introduction of
   plants in order to grow them in open ground, first of all, when creating
   plantations and using them in landscaping settlements and when creating
   or restoring damaged forest ecosystems and protective forest belts.},

Abstract = {Genetic resistance to anticoagulants caused by mutations in the Vkorc1
   gene of the most invasive rodent species-Norway rats and house mice, has
   not been studied in Russia. We analyzed the variability of the Vkorc1
   gene in house mice and Norway rats in various settlements of Russia, and
   identified mutations responsible for resistance to rodenticides. Two
   exons of the Vkorc1 gene were analyzed in 71 Norway rats from four
   cities (Moscow, Tyumen, Chita, Rostov-on-Don) and 108 house mice from
   cities and small settlements (Moscow region, Tormosin, Nizhny
   Tsasuchei). Three Norway rats (15.8\% of the studied individuals) in
   Moscow have a heterozygous state the Tyr139Ser mutation, which is
   responsible for resistance. House mice were not found to have mutations
   in the Vkorc1 gene responsible for resistance to anticoagulants of the
   first and second generation in the Leu128Ser and Tyr139Cys positions
   located in the third exon. However, in cities in the first exon, we
   identified two heterozygous mutations have not be described previously
   in the scientific literature: Lys58Arg and Ser31Trp. In Russia, the
   genetic resistance to rodenticides in settlements in the populations of
   house mice and Norway rats is significantly lower than in Western
   Europe.},

Title = {Identification of sex-specific compounds in the invasive four-eyed fir
   bark beetle Polygraphus proximus},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Polygraphus proximus, a four-eyed fir bark beetle, is an invasive bark
   beetle species which has caused extensive damage to forests of Abies
   sibirica in southern and western Siberia and to Abies species in the
   European part of Russia. There is a high risk that the pest insect will
   spread to areas where it is currently not considered present, such as
   the European Union. In these areas, it threatens to attack conifer
   forests of various species which may result in major environmental and
   economic impact. The aim of this study was to identify pheromone
   components of P. proximus that can be used as pheromone baits. Males and
   females of P. proximus were allowed to bore into the bark of stem
   sections of Abies sibirica at the laboratory, and volatiles were
   collected with solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Analyses of these
   extracts with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed
   several sex-specific compounds. In total, twelve male-specific compounds
   and one female-specific compound were identified. The major
   male-specific compound determined by GC peak area was
   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol {[}(Z)-DMCHE] and the minor
   male-specific compounds were 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol,
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-2-butenal, benzyl alcohol, fragranol,
   7-methyl-3-methylene-6-octen-1-ol, (Z)- and
   (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde, geraniol, geranial and
   papayanol. The only female-specific compound was identified as
   1-hexanol. Two of the male-specific compounds, (Z)-DMCHE and
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol were shown to attract males and females of P.
   proximus in field studies. Thus, we now for the first time can present
   the structures of two male-specific components that are biologically
   active parts of P. proximus aggregation pheromone. However, some
   chemical communication overlap between P. proximus and P. subopacus
   needs to be further investigated as (Z)-DMCHE also attracted males and
   females of P. subopacus.},

Abstract = {This paper presents models describing ecological niches of the stellate
   sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus Pallas, 1771) in the northern part of the

   data. Long-time spatial distribution dynamics of two alien species
   (polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and mollusk Abra ovata) and
   crustaceans is analyzed. The effects of abiotic and biotic factors on
   the formation of stellate sturgeon ecological niches in the eastern and
   western regions of the northern part of the Caspian Sea are estimated.
   Ordination diagrams reflecting the spatial distribution of stellate
   sturgeon in different years in the plane of two principal components
   (PCA) are constructed. It is shown that the leading factors for the
   construction of ecological niche models are water salinity and density
   of crustacean aggregations.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the physicochemical characteristics regulating
   the distribution and abundance of M. marcella larvae in six wetlands in
   the northern Colombia. Standardized techniques for collecting
   invertebrate and physicochemical data were used in 29 sampling points in
   an intraannual period. Mean pH and temperature oscillated in narrow
   ranges within wetlands (7.7 +/- 0.09-8.6 +/- 0.07; 28.1 +/- 0.29-32.8
   +/- 0.17 degrees C, respectively), whereas ammonium concentrations and
   conductivity exhibited a wide variation (0.2 +/- 0.03-2.8 +/- 0.54 mg
   NH4 L-1; 861 +/- 30.7-19254 +/- 1706 mu S cm(-1), respectively). A total
   of 2586 individual M. marcella larvae were collected. Abundance was
   greater in wetlands influenced by the Magdalena River, with 19.4 +/- 1.7
   and 9.3 +/- 1.4 individuals; followed by wetlands hydrologically
   influenced by seasonal runoff, with 8.1 +/- 0.4 and 6.4 +/- 0.4
   individuals; and lowest in wetlands with influence of the Caribbean Sea,
   with 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 individuals. Abundances of M. marcella
   larvae exhibited similar variations at different months during the
   sampling period. Abundance and distribution of M. marcella larvae in
   wetlands of northern Colombia is strongly dependent on water
   conductivity, transparency and alkalinity. This study evidence that
   Odonata larvae are a valuable tool as bioindicators for wetland
   assessment and monitoring.},

Abstract = {Ondatra zibethicus (Common Muskrat) are often considered herbivores;
   however, they also eat animal matter, especially mussels, which comprise
   a considerable part of their diet in some populations. Common Muskrats
   also feed on crayfish (Astacoidea), although such behavior is poorly
   documented. On 21 April 2022, we observed a Common Muskrat repeatedly
   catching crayfish (Cambaridae) and carrying them to its den. The site in
   the Coldwater River National Wildlife Refuge, Quitman County, MS,
   consisted of a ditch with a water-control structure on the edge of a
   waterfowl impoundment being dewatered. The consumption of crayfish by a
   Common Muskrat during a time when vegetation was presumably less
   available has important ramifications for the management of both

Abstract = {Rhinella marina (Cane Toad) is a generalist predator that has been found
   to consume both invertebrate and vertebrate prey. Herein, we detail the
   first confirmed consumption of hatchling Zenaida macroura (Mourning
   Dove) and Sialia sialis (Eastern Bluebird) by the non-native invasive
   Cane Toad in Florida. Although birds are not known to be a large part of
   the Cane Toad diet, opportunistic consumption of hatchlings that likely
   fell from nests suggests that ground-nesting birds could also be at risk
   of predation by Cane Toads.},

Title = {Dominance of phage particles carrying antibiotic resistance genes in the

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The growth of antibiotic resistance has stimulated interest in
   understanding the mechanisms by which antibiotic resistance genes (ARG)
   are mobilized. Among them, studies analyzing the presence of ARGs in the
   viral fraction of environmental, food and human samples, and reporting
   bacteriophages as vehicles of ARG transmission, have been the focus of
   increasing research. However, it has been argued that in these studies
   the abundance of phages carrying ARGs has been overestimated due to
   experimental contamination with non-packaged bacterial DNA or other
   elements such as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). This study aims to shed
   light on the extent to which phages, OMVs or contaminating non-packaged
   DNA contribute as carriers of ARGs in the viromes. The viral fractions
   of three types of food (chicken, fish, and mussels) were selected as
   sources of ARG-carrying phage particles, whose ability to infect and
   propagate in an Escherichia coli host was confirmed after isolation. The
   ARG-containing fraction was further purified by CsCl density gradient
   centrifugation and, after removal of DNA outside the capsids, ARGs
   inside the particles were confirmed. The purified fraction was stained
   with SYBR Gold, which allowed the visualization of phage capsids
   attached to and infecting E. coli cells. Phages with Myoviridae and
   Siphoviridae morphology were observed by electron microscopy. The
   proteins in the purified fraction belonged predominantly to phages
   (71.8\% in fish, 52.9\% in mussels, 78.7\% in chicken sample 1, and
   64.1\% in chicken sample 2), mainly corresponding to tail, capsid, and
   other structural proteins, whereas membrane proteins, expected to be
   abundant if OMVs were present, accounted for only 3.8-21.4\% of the
   protein content. The predominance of phage particles in the viromes
   supports the reliability of the protocols used in this study and in
   recent findings on the abundance of ARG-carrying phage particles.},

Abstract = {The endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is an
   endangered species among the conserved Chinese amphibians.
   Tourism-related pressures have increased for this species recently. The
   effect of tourism on the hatching rate of the target species was
   determined by experimentally observing the influences of different
   intensities of tourism disturbance on salamander in the Zhangjiajie
   Chinese Giant Salamander National Nature Reserve. Water quality factors
   (e.g. total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and Escherichia
   coli abundance) were analysed, and hatching rate was estimated. Results
   showed that high levels of tourism disturbance (500,000-1,200,000
   visitors per year) had active effects on the hatching time and negative
   effects on the hatching rate. The prediction performance of artificial
   neural network models was validated by the low root mean square error
   values of 2.2539 and 3.2612 for the training and testing data and high
   determination coefficient values of 0.9732 and 0.9508 for the training
   and testing data, respectively. The potential for positive or negative
   feedback mechanisms in such relationships between tourists and wildlife
   highlights the importance of considering both sides of the complex
   interaction to find a balance between the development of tourism and
   wild animal protection.},

Abstract = {Eastern Africa has experienced strong climatic changes since the last
   deglaciation (15 000 years ago). The driving mechanisms and
   teleconnections of these spatially complex climate variations are yet
   not fully understood. Although previous studies on lake systems have
   enhanced our knowledge of Holocene precipitation variation in eastern
   Africa, relatively few studies have reconstructed the terrestrial
   temperature history of eastern Africa from lake archives. Here, we
   present (i) a new branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT)
   temperature calibration that includes Bale Mountains surface sediments
   and (ii) a quantitative record of mean annual air temperature (MAT) over
   the past 12 ka cal BP using brGDGTs in a sediment core collected from
   Garba Guracha (3950 m a.s.l.) in the Bale Mountains. After adding Bale
   Mountains surface sediment (n = 11) data (Baxter et al., 2019) to the
   existing East African lake dataset, additional variation in 6-methyl
   brGDGTs was observed, which necessitated modifying the MBT5mE'
   calibration (MBT denotes methylation of branched tetraethers) by adding
   6-methyl brGDGT IIIa' (resulting in the MBT Bale Mountains index, r(2) =
   0.93, p < 0.05). Comparing the MBT5mE' and the new MBT Bale Mountains
   index, our high-altitude Garba Guracha temperature record shows that
   warming occurred shortly after the Holocene onset when the temperature
   increased by more than 3.0 degrees C in less than 600 years. The highest
   temperatures prevailed between 9 and 6 ka cal BP, followed by a
   temperature decrease until 1.4 ka cal BP. The reconstructed temperature
   history is linked to supraregional climatic changes associated with
   insolation forcing and the African Humid Period (AHP), as well as with
   local anomalies associated with catchment deglaciation and hydrology.},

Abstract = {Bacterial transformation, a common mechanism of horizontal gene
   transfer, can speed up adaptive evolution. How its costs and benefits
   depend on the growth environment is poorly understood. Here, we
   characterize the distributions of fitness effects (DFE) of
   transformation in different conditions and test whether they predict in
   which condition transformation is beneficial. To determine the DFEs, we
   generate hybrid libraries between the recipient Bacillus subtilis and
   different donor species and measure the selection coefficient of each
   hybrid strain. In complex medium, the donor Bacillus vallismortis
   confers larger fitness effects than the more closely related donor
   Bacillus spizizenii. For both donors, the DFEs show strong effect
   beneficial transfers, indicating potential for fast adaptive evolution.
   While some transfers of B. vallismortis DNA show pleiotropic effects,
   various transfers are beneficial only under a single growth condition,
   indicating that the recipient can benefit from a variety of donor genes
   to adapt to varying growth conditions. We scrutinize the predictive
   value of the DFEs by laboratory evolution under different growth
   conditions and show that the DFEs correctly predict the condition at
   which transformation confers a benefit. We conclude that transformation
   has a strong potential for speeding up adaptation to varying
   environments by profiting from a gene pool shared between closely
   related species.},

   contribution of C. peruvianus and P. seriata to the total raw biomass of
   the community reached 49-50\%. The highest abundance of alien species
   was registered for the shelf areas of the Middle Caspian at its eastern
   (C. peruvianus, 2.3 x 10(5) cells/L), western (P. seriata, 1.4 x 10(5)
   cells/L), and northern (C. pelagica, 1.3 x 10(5) cells/L) parts. During
   the period of studies, the northern expansion of the alien species in
   the Caspian Sea was limited by the isohaline 5.0, which coincided with
   the highly productive frontal zone (4.0-6.0) of the marginal filter of
   the Volga River. During the period preceding the autumn bloom
   (September-October), C. peruvianus was shown to be a part of the
   phytoplankton from the upper (25- to 30-m) productive water layer in
   both the Middle and Southern Caspian. During this period, the maximum
   abundance of this species (1.6 x 10(4) cells/L) was observed in the
   shallow areas of the Apsheron Sill and the eastern part of the Middle
   Caspian in the coastal wind upwelling zone.},

Title = {Influence of GEOTRACES data distribution and misfit function choice on
   objective parameter retrieval in a marine zinc cycle model},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {21},

Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Biogeochemical model behaviour for micronutrients is typically hard to
   constrain because of the sparsity of observational data, the difficulty
   of determining parameters in situ, and uncertainties in observations and
   models. Here, we assess the influence of data distribution, model
   uncertainty, and the misfit function on objective parameter optimisation
   in a model of the oceanic cycle of zinc (Zn), an essential micronutrient
   for marine phytoplankton with a long whole-ocean residence time. We aim
   to investigate whether observational constraints are sufficient for
   reconstruction of biogeochemical model behaviour, given that the Zn data
   coverage provided by the GEOTRACES Intermediate Data Product 2017 is
   sparse. Furthermore, we aim to assess how optimisation results are
   affected by the choice of the misfit function and by confounding factors
   such as analytical uncertainty in the data or biases in the model
   related to either seasonal variability or the larger-scale circulation.
   The model framework applied herein combines a marine Zn cycling model
   with a state-of-the-art estimation of distribution algorithm (Covariance
   Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy, CMA-ES) to optimise the model
   towards synthetic data in an ensemble of 26 optimisations. Provided with
   a target field that can be perfectly reproduced by the model,
   optimisation retrieves parameter values perfectly regardless of data
   coverage. As differences between the model and the system underlying the
   target field increase, the choice of the misfit function can greatly
   impact optimisation results, while limitation of data coverage is in
   most cases of subordinate significance. In cases where optimisation to
   full or limited data coverage produces relatively distinct model
   behaviours, we find that applying a misfit metric that compensates for
   differences in data coverage between ocean basins considerably improves
   agreement between optimisation results obtained with the two data
   situations.},

Title = {Genome-centric investigation of bile acid metabolizing microbiota of
   dairy cows and associated diet-induced functional implications},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {172-184},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although the importance of bile acid (BA)-related microbial strains and
   enzymes is increasingly recognized for monogastric animals, a lack of
   knowledge about BA metabolism in dairy cows limits functional
   applications aimed at the targeted modulation of microbe-host
   interactions for animal production and health. In the present study, 108
   content samples from six intestinal regions of dairy cows were used for
   shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Overall, 372 high-quality
   metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were involved in BA deconjugation,
   oxidation, and dehydroxylation pathways. Furthermore, the
   BA-metabolizing microbiome predominately occurred in the large
   intestine, resulting in the accumulation of secondary unconjugated BAs.
   Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the bile salt hydrolase
   (BSH)-carrying microbial populations managed with the selective
   environment of the dairy cow intestine by adopting numerous host mucin
   glycan-degrading abilities. A sequence similarity network analysis
   classified 439 BSH homologs into 12 clusters and identified different
   clusters with diverse evolution, taxonomy, signal peptides, and
   ecological niches. Our omics data further revealed that the strains of
   Firmicutes bacterium CAG-110 processed the increased abundance of BSHs
   from Cluster 1, coinciding with the changes in the colon cholic acid
   concentration after grain introduction, and were intricately related to
   intestinal inflammation. This study is the first to use a genome-centric
   approach and whole intestine-targeted metabolomics to reveal microbial
   BA metabolism and its diet-induced functional implications in dairy
   cows. These findings provide insight into the manipulation of intestinal
   microorganisms for improving host health.},

Title = {The ColR/S two-component system is a conserved determinant of host
   association across Pseudomonas species},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {286-296},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Members of the bacterial genus Pseudomonas form mutualistic, commensal,
   and pathogenic associations with diverse hosts. The prevalence of host
   association across the genus suggests that symbiosis may be a conserved
   ancestral trait and that distinct symbiotic lifestyles may be more
   recently evolved. Here we show that the ColR/S two-component system,
   part of the Pseudomonas core genome, is functionally conserved between
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Using plant
   rhizosphere colonization and virulence in a murine abscess model, we
   show that colR is required for commensalism with plants and virulence in
   animals. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that the ColR regulon has
   diverged between P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens and deleting
   components of the ColR regulon revealed strain-specific, but not
   host-specific, requirements for ColR-dependent genes. Collectively, our
   results suggest that ColR/S allows Pseudomonas to sense and respond to a
   host, but that the ColR-regulon has diverged between Pseudomonas strains
   with distinct lifestyles. This suggests that conservation of
   two-component systems, coupled with life-style dependent diversification
   of the regulon, may play a role in host association and lifestyle
   transitions.},

Abstract = {We surveyed the Naval Air Station in Key West, FL, to document
   state-listed herpetofauna in 2 different vegetation types using 3
   motion-detecting infrared cameras centered within radiating drift
   fences. Cameras were activated on 21 June 2021 and retrieved on 30
   November 2021. Of 225,153 photos taken, 1210 were of vertebrates (603 of
   herpetofauna, 512 of mammals, and 95 of birds). July produced the most
   photographs of vertebrates per camera day (6.84/camera day), whereas
   August had the fewest (1.17/camera day), likely due to low
   precipitation. The mean time of day when vertebrate photos were taken
   was midday at 1247 hours. We found no Florida-listed birds or
   herpetofauna present on Navy lands during our camera-trap research;
   however, we did have 259 photos of the federally endangered Sylvilagus
   palustris hefneri (Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit). Additionally, 4 species of

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Restoration ecologists devote considerable time and resources to
   understanding the role of functional traits in community assembly and
   ecosystem functioning. However, while functional traits show promise in
   supporting restoration practice in some circumstances, traits are not
   often explicitly considered by practitioners. Here we highlight four
   reasons that are preventing the use of traits in restoration, ranging
   from different restoration targets and frameworks to practical
   considerations around species selection, databases, plant stock
   availability, and measurement approaches. We provide actions that can be
   taken by researchers, practitioners, plant stock producers, and policy
   makers to better incorporate functional traits in restoration practice
   and show how traits can complement existing practices to achieve both
   traditional/taxonomic and functional restoration targets. We hope to
   guide critical partnerships, missing research, and immediate actions to
   leverage the value of traits at all stages in the restoration process.},

Abstract = {With the aim of exploring the features of the phytoplankton community
   and eutrophication status in the lower reaches of the Haihe River Basin
   near Tianjin, sampling surveys were carried out in May, July and
   September of 2021. The results showed 53 dominant phytoplankton species
   in the survey area, of which 36 species were found in May, while 28 were
   found both in July and September. Ten dominant species were highlighted
   in the surveys, mainly belonging to Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta,
   Bacillariophyta, and Cryptophyta. The regions with relatively higher
   levels of phytoplankton biomass and abundance were Duliujian River,
   Qilihai Wetland and New Chaobai River, while the highest species
   richness and biodiversity occurred in Yuqiao Reservoir, Duliujian River,
   New Chaobai River and Ji Canal. The highest TN content was observed in
   Duliujian River, and the highest TP, chl-a, CODMn and EI were recorded
   in New Chaobai River. In contrast, the region with the lowest level of
   eutrophication was Yuqiao Reservoir. Correlation analysis and RDA
   analysis showed that the eutrophication assessment indices affecting the
   phytoplankton community and distribution of dominant species were mainly
   TN, chl-a and CODMn in May and July, while TN, TP, chl-a, CODMn and EI
   were the most influential in September.},

Abstract = {Journals dedicated to the polar sciences have been outliers. Within both
   the history of science and the history of media, they stand out in
   several ways, including their comparatively late establishment of

   polar sciences journals began to carry predominantly peer-reviewed
   original research rather than synopses of research published elsewhere.

Abstract = {The availability of iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) has been shown to be a
   key factor regulating rates of nitrogen fixation in the western
   subtropical Pacific. However, the relative importance of Fe and P at
   finer spatial scales between the northern South China Sea (NSCS) and the
   western boundary of the North Pacific is poorly constrained.
   Furthermore, nutrient limitation of specific diazotroph types has not
   yet been assessed. Here we investigated these unknowns by (i) carrying
   out measurements of finer-scale spatial variabilities in N-2 fixation
   rates and diazotroph nifH gene abundances throughout these regions and
   (ii) conducting eight additional Fe and phosphate addition bioassay
   experiments where both changes in N-2 fixation rates and the nifH gene
   abundances of specific diazotrophs were measured. Overall, nitrogen
   fixation rates and nifH gene abundances were lower in the NSCS than
   around the Luzon Strait and the western North Pacific. The nutrient
   addition bioassay experiments demonstrated that N2 fixation rates in the
   central NSCS were co-limited by Fe and P, whereas at the western
   boundary of the North Pacific they were P-limited. Changes in the
   abundances of nifH in response to nutrient addition varied in how well
   they correlated with changes in N-2 fixation rates, and in six out of
   eight experiments the largest responses in nifH gene abundances were
   dominated by either Trichodesmium or UCYN-B (unicellular diazotrophic
   cyanobacteria group B). In general, nutrient addition had a relatively
   restricted impact on the composition of the six phylotypes that we
   surveyed apart from on UCYN-B. This unicellular cyanobacterium group
   showed increased contribution to the total nifH gene abundance following
   P addition at sites where N2 fixation rates were P-limited. Our study
   provides comprehensive evidence of nutrient controls on N-2 fixation
   biogeography in the margin of the western North Pacific. Future research
   that more accurately constrains nutrient supply rates to this region
   would be beneficial for resolving what controls diazotroph community
   structure.},

Title = {Winter season Southern Ocean distributions of climate-relevant trace

Abstract = {Climate-relevant trace gas air-sea exchange exerts an important control
   on air quality and climate, especially in remote regions of the planet
   such as the Southern Ocean. It is clear that polar regions exhibit
   seasonal trends in productivity and biogeochemical cycling, but almost
   all of the measurements there are skewed to summer months. If we want to
   understand how the Southern Ocean affects the balance of climate through
   trace gas air-sea exchange, it is essential to expand our measurement
   database over greater temporal and spatial scales, including all
   seasons. Therefore, in this study, we report measured concentrations of
   dimethylsulfide (DMS, as well as related sulfur compounds) and isoprene
   in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the winter to
   understand the spatial and temporal distribution in comparison to
   current knowledge and climatological calculations for the Southern
   Ocean. The observations of isoprene are the first in the winter season
   in the Southern Ocean. We found that the concentrations of DMS from the
   surface seawater and air in the investigated area were 1.03 +/- 0.98
   nmol(-1) and 28.80 +/- 12.49 pptv, respectively. The concentrations of
   isoprene in surface seawater were 14.46 +/- 12.23 pmol(-1). DMS and
   isoprene fluxes were 4.04 +/- 4.12 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and 80.55 +/-
   78.57 nmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. These results are generally lower
   than the values presented or calculated in currently used climatologies
   and models. More data are urgently needed to better interpolate
   climatological values and validate process-oriented models, as well as
   to explore how finer measurement resolution, both spatially and
   temporally, can influence air-sea flux calculations.},

Abstract = {The endostoma of eurypterids is a small ventral structure previously
   known from only 11 specimens and in detail from only a single species,
   Eurypterus tetraganophthalmus. Four previously undescribed eurypterid
   specimens from the Samuel J. Ciurca Jr. Collection, Yale Peabody Museum
   of Natural History, likely belonging to Eurypterus, and a previously
   documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New
   York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and
   homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a
   bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly
   facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are
   noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates
   with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous
   interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh
   body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria.
   This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the
   metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.},

Abstract = {Myotis austroriparius (Southeastern Myotis) traditionally inhabit
   bottomland hardwood forests along the Atlantic coastal plain and lower
   Mississippi River Valley. This insectivorous bat is a species of
   conservation concern in Alabama and Georgia and was thought to be
   restricted to the Southern Coastal Plain and Southeastern Plains
   ecoregions. Based primarily on cave, transportation-structure, and
   mist-netting surveys, we documented occurrences of Southeastern Myotis
   in 14 Alabama and 20 Georgia counties outside and along the border of
   the accepted range, including in the Piedmont, Ridge and Valley,
   Interior Plateau, and Southwestern Appalachians ecoregions. We reviewed
   observations of bats year-round in both states, including pregnant and
   lactating females and winter hibernacula. Roosting sites included caves,
   culverts, bridges, and tree cavities. Combined, these observations
   provide strong evidence that the range of Southeastern Myotis should
   consist of all Alabama and Georgia except for the Blue Ridge ecoregion.
   This increase in distribution may result from increased surveying
   efforts and/or range expansion due to climate change, as observed in
   other southeastern bat species.},

Abstract = {Geodiversity is recognized as one of the most important drivers of
   ecosystem characteristics and biodiversity globally. However, in the
   northern Neotropics, the contribution of highly diverse landscapes,
   environmental conditions, and geological history in structuring
   large-scale patterns of aquatic environments and aquatic species
   associations remains poorly understood. We evaluated the relationships
   among geodiversity, limnological conditions, and freshwater ostracodes
   from southern Mexico to Nicaragua. A cluster analysis (CA), based on
   geological, geochemical, mineralogical, and water-column physical and
   chemical characteristics of 76 aquatic ecosystems (karst, volcanic,
   tectonic) revealed two main limnological regions: (1) karst plateaus of
   the Yucatan Peninsula and northern Guatemala, and (2) volcanic terrains
   of the Guatemalan highlands, mid-elevation sites in El Salvador and
   Honduras, and the Nicaraguan lowlands. In addition, seven subregions
   were recognized, demonstrating a high heterogeneity of aquatic
   environments. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified water
   chemistry (ionic composition) and mineralogy as most influential for
   aquatic ecosystem classification. Multi-parametric analyses, based on
   biological data, revealed that ostracode species associations represent
   disjunct faunas. Five species associations, distributed according to
   limnological regions, were recognized. Structural equation modeling
   (SEM) revealed that geodiversity explains limnological patterns of the
   study area. Limnology further explained species composition, but not
   species richness. The influence of conductivity and elevation were
   individually evaluated in SEM and were statistically significant for
   ostracode species composition, though not for species richness. We
   conclude that geodiversity has a central influence on the limnological
   conditions of aquatic systems, which in turn influence ostracode species
   composition in lakes of the northern Neotropical region.},

Abstract = {Large amounts of methane (CH4) could be released as a result of the
   gradual or abrupt thawing of Arctic permafrost due to global warming.
   Once available, this potent greenhouse gas is emitted into the
   atmosphere or transported laterally into aquatic ecosystems via
   hydrologic connectivity at the surface or via groundwaters. While high
   northern latitudes contribute up to 5 \% of total global CH4 emissions,
   the specific contribution of Arctic rivers and streams is largely
   unknown. We analyzed high-resolution continuous CH4 concentrations
   measured between 15 and 17 June 2019 (late freshet) in a similar to 120
   km transect of the Kolyma River in northeast Siberia. The average
   partial pressure of CH4 (pCH(4)) in tributaries (66.8-206.8 mu atm) was
   27 times higher than in the main river channel (28.3 mu atm). In the
   main channel, CH4 was up to 1600 \% supersaturated with respect to
   atmospheric equilibrium. Key sites along the riverbank and at tributary
   confluences accounted for 10 \% of the navigated transect and had the
   highest pCH(4) (41 +/- 7 mu atm) and CH4 emissions (0.03 +/- 0.004 mmol
   m(-2) (1-1 ) compared to other sites in the main channel, contributing
   between 14 \% to 17 \% of the total CH4 flux in the transect. These key
   sites were characterized by warm waters (T > 14.5 degrees C) and low
   specific conductivities (kappa < 88 mu S cm(-1)). The distribution of
   CH4 in the river could be linked statistically to T and kappa of the
   water and to their proximity to the shore z, and these parameters served
   as predictors of CH4 concentrations in unsampled river areas. The
   abundance of CH4-consuming bacteria and CH4-producing archaea in the
   river was similar to those previously detected in nearby soils and was
   also strongly correlated to T and kappa. These findings imply that the
   source of riverine CH4 is closely related with sites near land. The
   average total CH4 flux density in the river section was 0.02 +/- 0.006
   mmol m(-2) d(-1), equivalent to an annual CH4 flux of 1.24 x 10(7) g CH4
   yr(-1) emitted during a 146 d open water season. Our study highlights
   the importance of high-resolution continuous CH4 measurements in Arctic
   rivers for identifying spatial and temporal variations, as well as
   providing a glimpse of the magnitude of riverine CH4 emissions in the
   Arctic and their potential relevance to regional CH4 budgets.},

Title = {Physiological flexibility of phytoplankton impacts modelled chlorophyll

Abstract = {Phytoplankton growth, and hence biomass, responds to variations in light
   and nutrient availability in the near-surface ocean. A wide variety of
   models have been developed to capture variable chlorophyll : carbon
   ratios due to photoacclimation, i.e. the dynamic physiological response
   of phytoplankton to varying light and nutrient availability. Although
   photoacclimation models have been developed and tested mostly against
   laboratory results, their application and testing against the observed
   flexible response of phytoplankton communities remains limited. Hence,
   the biogeochemical implications of photoacclimation in combination with
   ocean circulation have yet to be fully explored. We compare modelled
   chlorophyll and primary production from an inflexible phytoplankton
   functional type model (InFlexPFT), which assumes fixed carbon (C) :
   nitrogen (N) : chlorophyll (Chl) ratios, to that from a recently
   developed flexible phytoplankton functional type model (FlexPFT), which
   incorporates photoacclimation and variable C : N : Chl ratios. We couple
   each plankton model with a 3-D eddy-resolving ocean circulation model of
   the North Pacific and evaluate their respective performance versus
   observations (e.g. satellite imagery and vertical profiles of in situ
   observations) of Chl and primary production. These two models yield
   different horizontal and vertical distributions of Chl and primary
   production. The FlexPFT reproduces observed subsurface Chl maxima in the
   subtropical gyre, although it overestimates Chl concentrations. In the
   subtropical gyre (where light is sufficient), even at low nutrient
   concentrations, the FlexPFT yields higher chlorophyll concentrations and
   faster growth rates, which result in higher primary production in the
   subsurface, compared to the InFlexPFT. Compared to the FlexPFT, the
   InFlexPFT yields slower growth rates and lower Chl and primary
   production. In the subpolar gyre, the FlexPFT also predicts faster
   growth rates near the surface, where light and nutrient conditions are
   most favourable. Compared to the InFlexPFT, the key differences that
   allow the FlexPFT to better reproduce the observed patterns are its
   assumption of variable, rather than fixed, C : N : Chl ratios and
   interdependent, rather than strictly multiplicative, effects of light
   limitation (photoacclimation) and nutrient limitation (uptake). Our
   results suggest that incorporating these processes has the potential to
   improve chlorophyll and primary production patterns in the near-surface
   ocean in future biogeochemical models.},

Title = {Fish use of restored mangroves matches that in natural mangroves
   regardless of forest age},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The loss and degradation of mangrove forests have triggered global
   restoration efforts to support biodiversity and ecosystem services,
   including fish stock enhancement. As mangrove restoration accelerates,
   it is important to evaluate outcomes for species that play functional
   roles in ecosystems and support services, yet this remains a clear
   knowledge gap. There is remarkably little information, for example,
   about how fish use of mangroves varies as restored vegetation matures,
   hampering efforts to include fisheries benefits in natural capital
   assessments of restoration. We used unbaited underwater cameras within
   two distinct zones of mangrove forests-fringe and interior-at five pairs
   of restored-natural mangrove sites of increasing age from restoration in
   southeast Queensland, Australia. We used deep learning to automatically
   extract data for the four most common species: yellowfin bream
   (Acanthopagrus australis), sea mullet (Mugil cephalus), common toadfish
   (Tetractenos hamiltoni), and common silverbiddy (Gerres subfasciatus).
   The abundance of these species varied among sites and zones, but was
   equal or greater in restored sites compared to paired natural sites.
   Despite younger restored sites having dramatically lower structural
   vegetation complexity, abundances did not increase with restoration site
   maturity. Furthermore, while yellowfin bream and sea mullet were more
   abundant in the fringe zone, we observed similarities in how fish used
   fringe and interior zones across all sites. Our paired, space-for-time
   design provides a powerful test of restoration outcomes for fish,
   highlighting that even newly restored sites with immature vegetation are
   readily utilized by key fish species.},

Title = {Rehabilitation and mine closure policies creating a pathway to
   relinquishment: an Australian perspective},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mine closure practices have continued to improve over the last few
   decades; however, across the industry rehabilitation outcomes continue
   to fall short of community expectations. While examples of successful
   rehabilitation exist, there are still limited examples of mines closing,
   relinquishing, and transitioning to another land use. Barriers to
   relinquishment such as residual risk, land transfer liability, and
   limited next land use options are compounded by the lack of legislated
   mine relinquishment policy. Broader mine closure policy has evolved
   significantly over the last few decades in Australia, with recent
   changes in some states enhancing mandates requiring progressive
   rehabilitation and financial assurance mechanisms in an effort to
   continue to improve mine closure outcomes. Government authorities with
   legislative powers to report and influence rehabilitation activities in
   Queensland and Victoria are also considered a positive mine closure
   policy direction. Despite these recent legislative developments there is
   still no multi-agency regulatory policy framework integrating mine
   closure and relinquishment in any Australian jurisdiction. This article
   explores how recent mine closure policy changes in Australia could be
   used by policy makers to enable relinquishment in the future and
   provides recommendations for an integrated multi-agency relinquishment
   policy framework.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to negatively affect many
   ecologically important organisms. Here we report the response of
   Caribbean benthic foraminiferal assemblages to naturally discharging
   low-pH waters with a composition similar to that expected for the end of
   the 21st century. At low pH \& SIM; 7.8 and low saturation state with
   respect to calcite (omega calcite < 4), the relative abundance of
   hyaline, agglutinated, and symbiont-bearing species increased,
   indicating higher resistance to potential carbonate chemistry changes.
   Diversity and other taxonomical metrics (i.e., richness, abundance, and
   evenness) declined steeply with decreasing pH despite exposure of this
   ecosystem to low-pH conditions for millennia, suggesting that tropical
   foraminiferal communities will be negatively impacted under
   acidification scenarios SSP3-7.0 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) and
   SSP5-8.5. The species Archaias angulatus, a major contributor to
   sediment production in the Caribbean, was able to calcify at more
   extreme conditions (7.1 pH) than those projected for the late 21st
   century, but the calcified tests had a lower average density than those
   exposed to higher-pH conditions (7.96), indicating that reef
   foraminiferal carbonate production might decrease this century. Smaller
   foraminifera were particularly sensitive to low pH, and our results
   demonstrate their potential use to monitor OA conditions.},

Title = {Variation in calcification of Reticulofenestra coccoliths over the
   Oligocene-Early Miocene},

Pages = {5007-5019},

Abstract = {Coccolithophores are calcifying marine phytoplankton whose
   intracellularly produced calcite plates, coccoliths, have been the
   dominant source of calcium carbonate in open-ocean settings since the
   Cretaceous. An open question is whether their calcification has been
   affected by changing environmental conditions over geological timescales
   such as variations in the ocean carbon system. Previous methods using
   circular polarized light microscopy allowed for only the thickness of
   small coccoliths thinner than 1.5 mu m to be quantified, but prior to
   the Pliocene, a significant fraction of the coccoliths exceeded this
   thickness and have not been quantifiable. Here, we implement a new
   approach for calibration of circular polarized light microscopy enabling
   us to quantify coccoliths which feature calcite up to 3 mu m thick. We
   apply this technique to evaluate the evolution of calcification in the
   Reticulofenestra from the early Oligocene to Early Miocene in
   exceptionally well-preserved sediments from the Newfoundland margin.
   Through this time interval, coccolith thickness and the scale-invariant
   shape factor k(se) vary by about 20\% around the mean thickness of 0.37
   mu m and mean kse of 0.16. Lower shape factors characterize samples with
   a higher relative abundance of dissolution-resistant nan-noliths,
   suggesting that dissolution may contribute to thinning of placoliths. We
   therefore define temporal trends in calcification only in samples in
   which the assemblage suggests minimal dissolution. The lowest kse
   characterizes the middle Oligocene, and the highest kse around 18Ma is
   in the Early Miocene. High ocean dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   concentrations have been proposed for this period of the Miocene and may
   be one factor contributing to high coccolith k(se).},

Title = {Trace gas fluxes from tidal salt marsh soils: implications for

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {19},
Pages = {4655-4670},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Tidal salt marsh soils can be a dynamic source of greenhouse gases such
   as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well
   as sulfur-based trace gases such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and
   dimethylsulfide (DMS) which play roles in global climate and
   carbon-sulfur biogeochemistry. Due to the difficulty in measuring trace
   gases in coastal ecosystems (e.g., flooding, salinity), our current
   understanding is based on snapshot instantaneous measurements (e.g.,
   performed during daytime low tide) which complicates our ability to
   assess the role of these ecosystems for natural climate solutions. We
   performed continuous, automated measurements of soil trace gas fluxes
   throughout the growing season to obtain high-temporal frequency data and
   to provide insights into magnitudes and temporal variability across
   rapidly changing conditions such as tidal cycles. We found that soil CO2
   fluxes did not show a consistent diel pattern, CH4, N2O, and CS2 fluxes
   were highly variable with frequent pulse emissions ( > 2500 \%, > 10 000
   \%, and > 4500\% change, respectively), and DMS fluxes only occurred
   midday with changes > 185 000 \%. When we compared continuous
   measurements with discrete temporal measurements (during daytime, at low
   tide), discrete measurements of soil CO2 fluxes were comparable with
   those from continuous measurements but misrepresent the temporal
   variability and magnitudes of CH4, N2O, DMS, and CS2. Discrepancies
   between the continuous and discrete measurement data result in
   differences for calculating the sustained global warming potential
   (SGWP), mainly by an overestimation of CH4 fluxes when using discrete
   measurements. The high temporal variability of trace gas fluxes
   complicates the accurate calculation of budgets for use in blue carbon
   accounting and earth system models.},

Abstract = {As the boundary interface between the atmosphere and ocean, the
   sea-surface microlayer (SML) plays a significant role in the
   biogeochemical cycles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and
   macronutrients in marine environments. In our study, the optical
   properties of DOM were compared between the sub-surface water (SSW) and
   the SML during spring, summer and winter in the East China Sea (ECS) and
   the Yellow Sea (YS). In addition, photoexposure experiments were
   designed to compare photochemical degradation processes of DOM between
   the SML and the SSW. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM, dissolved
   organic carbon, chlorophyll a (Chl a), picoplankton, nutrients and
   bacteria were frequently enriched in the SML. The enrichment factors
   (EFs) of tryptophan-like component 4 were significantly higher than
   other fluorescence components; the longer wavelength absorption values
   of CDOM showed higher EFs in the SML, and a more significant
   relationship between CDOM and Chl a in the SML, indicating that
   autochthonous DOM was more strongly enriched in the SML than the
   terrestrial DOM. Higher EFs were generally observed in the SML in the
   off-shore regions than in the coastal regions, and CDOM in the SML was
   photobleached more after relatively strong irradiation, as also
   indicated by the lower percentages of humic-like DOM and lower specific
   UV absorbance values (SUVA254) in the SML than the SSW. Compared to the
   SSW, the elevated nutrients may stimulate phytoplankton growth,
   biological activity and then production of abundant fresh autochthonous
   DOM in the SML. Our results revealed a new enrichment model for
   exploring the air-sea interface environment, which can explain the more
   autochthonous properties of DOM in the SML than the SSW.},

Abstract = {Plant litter decomposition is a biogeochemical process underlying the
   carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and between the biosphere and the
   atmosphere. For the latter, it serves as one of the most important
   sources of not only carbon dioxide but also volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs), which have not yet been taken into account in atmospheric models
   for various purposes and scales, from local to regional and global. This
   review owes its appearance to the growing interest in decaying leaf
   litter and living forest floor cover as a hitherto unaccounted for
   source of photochemically active components of the Earth's atmosphere.
   This interest is understandable if we take into account the size of this
   source: for terrestrial ecosystems, the global production of litter is
   10 x 10(16) g dry matter. The living vegetation cover of the soil on the
   forest floor, mainly comprising mosses and small shrubs, should also be
   regarded as a potentially significant source of atmospheric VOCs, as its
   total biomass may be comparable to or even exceed that of canopy
   foliage, which is considered the main source of these compounds. This
   implies a need to integrate these sources into biogenic VOC emission
   models, which in turn requires extensive research on these sources to
   understand the conditions and factors that influence VOC emissions. The
   decomposition of leaf litter, accompanied by the release of VOCs, is a
   very complex process that depends on a number of biological, chemical
   and physical environmental factors, but little information is currently
   available on the role each plays. Equally limited is information on the
   chemical composition and emission rates of VOCs from these sources.
   The review focuses on the main gaps in our knowledge of the sources of
   biogenic VOCs under the forest canopy, and we are confident that filling
   them will make a significant contribution to solving such an important
   task as closing the global organic carbon budget.},

Abstract = {The subsurface oxygen maximum (SOM) is observed in oligotrophic oceans
   and is associated with different physical and biological processes. This
   study characterizes the SOM in the Mediterranean Sea at the basin scale
   and investigates its driving mechanisms by analysing the output of the
   1/24 \& LCIRC; resolution biogeochemical reanalysis provided by the
   Copernicus Marine Service for the 1999-2019 time period. We validated
   the model-derived oxygen concentration in the epipelagic layer at
   different spatial and temporal scales, including novel process
   comparisons with estimates from in situ observations. Moreover, using
   Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) float observations, we estimated the
   model uncertainty in reproducing the SOM concentration and depth in
   summer (13 mmol O2 m(-3) and 13 m, respectively). The western and
   eastern Mediterranean Sea depicts different SOM signatures in summer,
   with higher oxygen values and shallower depths in the western
   Mediterranean. The concentrations and depths (in the ranges of 230-250
   mmol O-2 m(-3) and 30-100 m, respectively) are in agreement with the
   estimations from the literature and show mesoscale variability patterns.
   The western Mediterranean also shows a stronger biological activity,
   specifically oxygen production and consumption, along the whole
   epipelagic layer and higher oxygen concentrations at the surface
   throughout the year, but heavy undersaturated waters are associated with
   winter deep convection in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. A 1-year
   analysis conducted on selected areas that are representative of the
   heterogeneity of summer SOM highlighted that the SOM can actually be
   sustained by biological production (as in northwestern Mediterranean
   areas), or it can be a residual of the confinement of spring production
   (as in the central Ionian area) and vertical motions influence its depth
   (as in the Levantine subduction area).},

Abstract = {To monitor the effect of current nitrogen emissions and mitigation
   strategies, total (wet + dry) atmospheric nitrogen deposition to forests
   is commonly estimated using chemical transport models or canopy budget
   models in combination with throughfall measurements. Since flux
   measurements of reactive nitrogen (Nr) compounds are scarce, dry
   deposition process descriptions as well as the calculated flux estimates
   and annual budgets are subject to considerable uncertainties. In this
   study, we compared four different approaches to quantify annual dry
   deposition budgets of total reactive nitrogen (sigma Nr) at a mixed
   forest site situated in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Dry
   deposition budgets were quantified based on (I) 2.5 years of eddy
   covariance flux measurements with the Total Reactive Atmospheric
   Nitrogen Converter (TRANC); (II) an in situ application of the
   bidirectional inferential flux model DEPAC (Deposition of Acidifying
   Compounds), here called DEPAC-1D; (III) a simulation with the chemical
   transport model LOTOS-EUROS (Long-Term Ozone Simulation - European
   Operational Smog) v2.0, using DEPAC as dry deposition module; and (IV) a
   canopy budget technique (CBT).Averaged annual sigma N-r dry deposition
   estimates determined from TRANC measurements were 4.7 +/- 0.2 and 4.3
   +/- 0.4 kg N ha(-1) a(-1), depending on the gap-filling approach.
   DEPAC-1D-modeled dry deposition, using concentrations and meteorological
   drivers measured at the site, was 5.8 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) a(-1). In
   comparison to TRANC fluxes, DEPAC-1D estimates were systematically
   higher during summer and in close agreement in winter. Modeled sigma Nr
   deposition velocities (vd) of DEPAC-1D were found to increase with lower
   temperatures and higher relative humidity and in the presence of wet
   leaf surfaces, particularly from May to September. This observation was
   contrary to TRANC-observed fluxes. LOTOS-EUROS-modeled annual dry
   deposition was 6.5 +/- 0.3 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) for the site-specific
   weighting of land-use classes within the site's grid cell. LOTOS-EUROS
   showed substantial discrepancies to measured sigma N-r deposition during
   spring and autumn, which was related to an overestimation of ammonia
   (NH3) concentrations by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to measured values
   as a consequence of a mismatch between gridded input NH3 emissions and
   the site's actual (rather low) pollution climate. According to
   LOTOS-EUROS predictions, ammonia contributed most to modeled input sigma
   Nr concentrations, whereas measurements showed NOx as the prevailing
   compound in sigma N-r concentrations. Annual deposition estimates from
   measurements and modeling were in the range of minimum and maximum
   estimates determined from CBT being at 3.8 +/- 0.5 and 6.7 +/- 0.3 kg N
   ha(-1) a(-1), respectively. By adding locally measured wet-only
   deposition, we estimated an annual total nitrogen deposition input
   between 11.5 and 14.8 kg N ha(-1) a(-1), which is within the critical
   load ranges proposed for deciduous and coniferous forests.},

Abstract = {Cyanopodoviruses affect the mortality and population dynamics of the
   unicellular picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the
   dominant primary producers in the oceans. Known cyanopodoviruses all
   contain the DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol) that is important for phage
   DNA replication and widely used in field quantification and diversity
   studies. However, we isolated 18 cyanopodoviruses without identifiable
   DNA pol. They form a new MPP-C clade that was separated from the
   existing MPP-A, MPP-B, and P-RSP2 clades. The MPP-C phages have the
   smallest genomes (37.3-37.9 kb) among sequenced cyanophages, and show
   longer latent periods than the MPP-B phages. Metagenomic reads of both
   clades are highly abundant in surface waters, but the MPP-C phages show
   higher relative abundance in surface waters than in deeper waters, while
   MPP-B phages have higher relative abundance in deeper waters. Our study
   reveals that cyanophages with distinct genomic contents and infection
   kinetics can exhibit different depth profiles in the oceans.},

Abstract = {Wildlife harbour pathogens that can harm human or livestock health and
   are the source of most emerging infectious diseases. It is rarely
   considered how changes in wildlife population age-structures or how
   age-stratified behaviours might alter the level of pathogen detection
   within a species, or risk of spillover to other species. Micro-organisms
   that occur in healthy animals can be an important model for
   understanding and predicting the dynamics of pathogens of greater health
   concern, which are hard to study in wild populations due to their
   relative rarity. We therefore used a metagenomic approach to jointly
   characterise viral and prokaryotic carriage in faeces collected from a
   healthy wild bird population (Cygnus olor; mute swan) that has been
   subject to long-term study. Using 223 samples from known individuals
   allowed us to compare differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral
   carriage between adults and juveniles at an unprecedented level of
   detail. We discovered and characterised 77 novel virus species, of which
   21\% belong putatively to bird-infecting families, and described the
   core prokaryotic microbiome of C. olor. Whilst no difference in
   microbiota diversity was observed between juveniles and adult
   individuals, 50\% (4/8) of bird-infecting virus families
   (picornaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses and bornaviruses) and 3.4\%
   (9/267) of prokaryotic families (including Helicobacteraceae,
   Spirochaetaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families) were differentially
   abundant and/or prevalent between juveniles and adults. This indicates
   that perturbations that affect population age-structures of wildlife
   could alter circulation dynamics and spillover risk of microbes,
   potentially including pathogens.},

Abstract = {The frequency and asymmetry of mixed-species mating set the initial
   stage for the ecological and evolutionary implications of hybridization.
   How such patterns of mixed-species mating, in turn, are influenced by
   the combination of mate choice errors and relative species abundance
   remains largely unknown. We develop a mathematical model that generates
   predictions for how relative species abundances and mate choice errors
   affect hybridization patterns. When mate choice errors are small (<5\%),
   the highest frequency of hybridization occurs when one of the
   hybridizing species is at low abundance, but when mate choice errors are
   high (>5\%), the highest hybridization frequency occurs when species
   occur in equal proportions. Furthermore, females of the less abundant
   species are overrepresented in mixed-species matings. We compare our
   theoretical predictions with empirical data on naturally hybridizing
   Ficedula flycatchers and find that hybridization is highest when the two
   species occur in equal abundance, implying rather high mate choice
   errors. We discuss ecological and evolutionary implications of our
   findings and encourage future work on hybrid zone dynamics that take
   demographic aspects, such as relative species abundance, into account.},

Title = {Kangaroo Fathers Modulate Maternal Control of Offspring Sex but Not

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {6},
Pages = {790-801},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {When sons and daughters have different fitness costs and benefits,
   selection may favor deviations from an even offspring sex ratio. Most
   theories on sex ratio manipulation focus on maternal strategies and
   sex-biased maternal expenditure. Recent studies report paternal
   influences on both offspring sex ratio and postpartum sex-biased
   maternal expenditure. We used long-term data on marked kangaroos to
   investigate whether and how paternal mass and skeletal size, both
   determinants of male reproductive success, influenced (a) offspring sex
   in interaction with maternal mass and (b) postpartum sex-biased maternal
   expenditure. When mothers were light, the probability of having a son
   increased with paternal mass. Heavy mothers showed the opposite trend. A
   similar result emerged when considering paternal size instead of mass.
   Postpartum maternal sex-specific expenditure was independent of paternal
   mass or size. Studies of offspring sex manipulation or maternal
   expenditure would benefit from an explicit consideration of paternal
   traits, as paternal and maternal effects can modulate each other.},

Title = {Diverse stakeholders navigate divergent perspectives on stream
   restoration success in Western rangelands},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 27},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration is a value-driven process; yet social
   understanding of restoration lags ecological understanding. Restoration
   goals are driven by which stakeholders have a voice in the restoration
   process and their individual goals. While conflict among stakeholder
   visions has been observed, we lack a multidimensional understanding of
   these visions, where they overlap, and how they diverge. Focusing on
   stream restoration on private lands, we asked: (1) How do perspectives
   on measures of restoration success vary among stakeholders, including
   contractors and designers, scientists, organizations, and landowners?
   and (2) How do these groups discuss and navigate these differences? We
   used a mixed-method interview and Q-methodology approach to understand
   the range of stakeholders' approaches for assessing a successful stream
   restoration. We asked stakeholders to rank their level of agreement with
   33 statements about restoration goals, using these to evaluate
   perspectives about restoration success. We identified four perspectives
   on successful stream restoration that varied in: the use of
   science-driven criteria, risk tolerance, private property protection,
   and commitment to restoring streams to a previous state. Notably,
   contractors used deficit model approaches to communicate with
   landowners, even for private restoration. Institutional and cultural
   changes to how we approach restoration, suggested by some of the
   interviews, may provide paths forward. These include a recognition that
   all restoration objectives are socially defined, even within and among
   professionals, and that landowners have important local-system
   knowledge. Earlier engagement between all stakeholders involved in
   restoration may help create mutual understanding across parties and
   stave off disputes about project objectives or implementation.},

Title = {Giant panda habitat restoration requires more than just planting bamboo
   and trees},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 9},
Abstract = {Planting bamboo and trees is of great importance in giant panda
   (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat restoration. In practice, however,
   simply planting bamboo and trees cannot effectively and rapidly restore
   lost, degraded, and fragmented habitats. Based on present restoration
   work in the Qinling Mountains, China, we argue that: (1) Planting should
   be done on open and suitable forest lands, but the area that could be
   afforested is relatively small. (2) Forests that have regrown naturally
   on cut-over lands are mostly middle-aged and early secondary stands,
   which need to be managed, not replanted. (3) Plantations of nonnative
   larch (Larix spp.) urgently need to be replaced and replanted with
   native trees and bamboos, but new policies are needed that allow these
   plantations to be thinned or cut. (4) Bamboo forests in the mid-high
   mountain zones need to be assessed to determine if they are disclimaxes
   of degraded forests. Pilot studies are needed to determine the best need
   and practices to rehabilitate and restore them. We conclude that the
   restoration of panda habitat cannot be accomplished simply through tree
   and bamboo plantings.},

Title = {Overcoming legal barriers to coastal wetland restoration: lessons from
   Australia's Blue Carbon methodology},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Month = {2022 SEP 25},
Abstract = {Globally, there is a recognized need for widespread restoration of
   coastal wetlands. Despite this recognition, progress in many places has
   been slow, for reasons including legal and policy barriers. In Australia
   many of these legal barriers have been overcome in the development of
   the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative - Tidal Restoration of
   Blue Carbon Ecosystems) Methodology Determination 2022, which allows for
   certain coastal restoration projects to be accredited and ultimately
   receive Australian Carbon Credit Units. This paper describes the new
   methodology, outlines the key legal barriers which had to be addressed
   in its development, and analyzes the legal solutions utilized. It
   concludes with some general observations for fucoastal wetland
   restoration projects. Despite the jurisdictional focus on Australia, it
   is anticipated that these lessons will be of broader relevance to other
   countries grappling with restoration projects in the intertidal zone.},

Abstract = {The abandonment of agricultural lands triggers a secondary succession of
   plant species which implies important changes in soil quality. Annual
   Mediterranean grasslands are known to be persistent on abandoned
   agriculture lands in the western Mediterranean. We used plant taxonomic
   and functional approaches to determine the role of Mediterranean
   grasslands as an indicator of changes in ecosystem biodiversity and
   functionality. We tested the hypothesis that Mediterranean grasslands
   are a suitable model for monitoring biodiversity and soil fertility in a
   secondary succession. Soil and vegetation features on 21 permanent plots
   were monitored in 2016 and 2020. Numerical classifications based on
   floristic composition showed two different plant communities
   independently of the sampling year: early-stage grasslands in the first
   post-abandonment decade and late-stage grasslands after the first
   post-abandonment decade. Generalized linear model and redundancy
   analysis also revealed differences in growth forms, functional traits
   and soil functionality between communities. Late-stage grasslands was
   characterized by enriched bryophyte coverage and an impoverishment in
   hemicryptophytes and plant latex segregators growing on soils with a
   higher hydrolase enzyme activity and TOC content compared to early-stage
   grassland. Our results suggest that annual Mediterranean grasslands
   growing on siliceous soils denoting a mature-stage succession, and
   floristically characterized by the symbiont plant with Ascomycota,
   Tuberaria guttata, and a high bryophyte cover, are worthy of recognition
   for conservation.},

Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-237},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Due to their potential impact on ecosystems and biogeochemistry,
   microbial interactions, such as those between phytoplankton and
   bacteria, have been studied intensively using specific model organisms.
   Yet, to what extent interactions differ between closely related
   organisms, or how these interactions change over time, or culture
   conditions, remains unclear. Here, we characterize the interactions
   between five strains each of two globally abundant marine
   microorganisms, Prochlorococcus (phototroph) and Alteromonas
   (heterotroph), from the first encounter between individual strains and
   over more than a year of repeated cycles of exponential growth and
   long-term nitrogen starvation. Prochlorococcus-Alteromonas interactions
   had little effect on traditional growth parameters such as
   Prochlorococcus growth rate, maximal fluorescence, or lag phase,
   affecting primarily the dynamics of culture decline, which we interpret
   as representing cell mortality and lysis. The shape of the
   Prochlorococcus decline curve and the carrying capacity of the
   co-cultures were determined by the phototroph and not the heterotroph
   strains involved. Comparing various mathematical models of culture
   mortality suggests that Prochlorococcus death rate increases over time
   in mono-cultures but decreases in co-cultures, with cells potentially
   becoming more resistant to stress. Our results demonstrate intra-species
   differences in ecologically relevant co-culture outcomes. These include
   the recycling efficiency of N and whether the interactions are mutually
   synergistic or competitive. They also highlight the information-rich
   growth and death curves as a useful readout of the interaction
   phenotype.},

Abstract = {The reproductive output of Malaclemys terrapin (Diamond-backed Terrapin)
   is highly variable across its geographic range. While much of the
   literature is based on populations from the Atlantic coast of the United
   States, little reproductive-output data exists for the Gulf of Mexico
   populations. We captured female Diamond-backed Terrapins in southwestern
   Louisiana and assessed their reproductive output using radiographic-and
   ultrasound-imaging techniques. X-rays identified that average clutch
   size was 7.2 and average egg width was 21.9 mm. We revealed a positive
   relationship between female size (plastron length) and both clutch size
   and egg width, but no relationship between egg size and clutch size.
   Ultrasound imaging in a subset of individuals revealed large
   pre-ovulatory follicles and fully shelled eggs concurrently in females,
   indicating the potential for at least 2 clutches annually in this
   region. Our results suggest Diamond-backed Terrapins in southwestern
   Louisiana show variation in reproductive output compared to other
   populations at similar latitudes, indicating the need for additional
   study within and between populations in the region.},

Abstract = {Studying the minor part of the uncultivated microbial majority ({''}rare
   biosphere{''}) is difficult even with modern culture-independent
   techniques. The enormity of microbial diversity creates particular
   challenges for investigating low-abundance microbial populations in
   soils. Strategies for selective sample enrichment to reduce community
   complexity can aid in studying the rare biosphere. Magnetotactic
   bacteria, apart from being a minor part of the microbial community, are
   also found in poorly studied bacterial phyla and certainly belong to a
   rare biosphere. The presence of intracellular magnetic crystals within
   magnetotactic bacteria allows for their significant enrichment using
   magnetic separation techniques for studies using a metagenomic approach.
   This work investigated the microbial diversity of a black bog soil and
   its magnetically enriched fraction. The poorly studied phylum
   representatives in the magnetic fraction were enriched compared to the
   original soil community. Two new magnetotactic species, Candidatus
   Liberimonas magnetica DUR002 and Candidatus Obscuribacterium magneticum
   DUR003, belonging to different classes of the relatively little-studied
   phylum Elusimicrobiota, were proposed. Their genomes contain clusters of
   magnetosome genes that differ from the previously described ones by the

Title = {Cryptic and ubiquitous aplastidic cryptophytes are key freshwater
   flagellated bacterivores},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Morphology-based microscopic approaches are insufficient for a taxonomic
   classification of bacterivorous heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) in
   aquatic environments since their cells do not display reliably
   distinguishable morphological features. This leads to a considerable
   lack of ecological insights into this large and taxonomically diverse
   functional guild. Here, we present a combination of fluorescence in situ
   hybridization followed by catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD-FISH) and
   environmental sequence analyses which revealed that morphologically
   indistinguishable, so far largely cryptic and uncultured aplastidic
   cryptophytes are ubiquitous and prominent protistan bacterivores in
   diverse freshwater ecosystems. Using a general probe for Cryptophyceae
   and its heterotrophic CRY1 lineage, we analyzed different water layers
   in 24 freshwater lakes spanning a broad range of trophic states, sizes
   and geographical locations. We show that bacterivorous aplastidic
   cryptophytes and the CRY1 lineage accounted for ca. 2/3 and 1/4 of total
   HNF, respectively, in both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic samples. These
   heterotrophic cryptophytes were generally smaller and more abundant than
   their chloroplast-bearing counterparts. They had high uptake rates of
   bacteria, hinting at their important roles in channeling carbon flow
   from prokaryotes to higher trophic levels. The worldwide ubiquity of
   Cryptophyceae and its CRY1 lineage was supported by 18S rRNA gene
   sequence analyses across a diverse set of 297 freshwater metagenomes.
   While cryptophytes have been considered to be mainly plastidic
   ``algae{''}, we show that it is the aplastidic counterparts that
   contribute considerably to bacterial mortality rates. Additionally, our
   results suggest an undiscovered diversity hidden amongst these abundant
   and morphologically diverse aplastidic cryptophytes.},

Title = {Chlorine redox chemistry is widespread in microbiology},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Chlorine is abundant in cells and biomolecules, yet the biology of
   chlorine oxidation and reduction is poorly understood. Some bacteria
   encode the enzyme chlorite dismutase (Cld), which detoxifies chlorite
   (ClO2-) by converting it to chloride (Cl-) and molecular oxygen (O-2).
   Cld is highly specific for chlorite and aside from low hydrogen peroxide
   activity has no known alternative substrate. Here, we reasoned that
   because chlorite is an intermediate oxidation state of chlorine, Cld can
   be used as a biomarker for oxidized chlorine species. Cld was abundant
   in metagenomes from various terrestrial habitats. About 5\% of bacterial
   and archaeal genera contain a microorganism encoding Cld in its genome,
   and within some genera Cld is highly conserved. Cld has been subjected
   to extensive horizontal gene transfer. Genes found to have a genetic
   association with Cld include known genes for responding to reactive
   chlorine species and uncharacterized genes for transporters, regulatory
   elements, and putative oxidoreductases that present targets for future
   research. Cld was repeatedly co-located in genomes with genes for
   enzymes that can inadvertently reduce perchlorate (ClO4-) or chlorate
   (ClO3-), indicating that in situ (per)chlorate reduction does not only
   occur through specialized anaerobic respiratory metabolisms. The
   presence of Cld in genomes of obligate aerobes without such enzymes
   suggested that chlorite, like hypochlorous acid (HOCl), might be formed
   by oxidative processes within natural habitats. In summary, the
   comparative genomics of Cld has provided an atlas for a deeper
   understanding of chlorine oxidation and reduction reactions that are an
   underrecognized feature of biology.},

Abstract = {A debate is currently ongoing as to whether intensive livestock farms
   may constitute reservoirs of clinically relevant antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR), thus posing a threat to surrounding communities. Here,
   combining shotgun metagenome sequencing, machine learning (ML), and
   culture-based methods, we focused on a poultry farm and connected
   slaughterhouse in China, investigating the gut microbiome of livestock,
   workers and their households, and microbial communities in carcasses and
   soil. For both the microbiome and resistomes in this study, differences
   are observed across environments and hosts. However, at a finer scale,
   several similar clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes
   (ARGs) and similar associated mobile genetic elements were found in both
   human and broiler chicken samples. Next, we focused on Escherichia coli,
   an important indicator for the surveillance of AMR on the farm. Strains
   of E. coli were found intermixed between humans and chickens. We
   observed that several ARGs present in the chicken faecal resistome
   showed correlation to resistance/susceptibility profiles of E. coli
   isolates cultured from the same samples. Finally, by using environmental
   sensing these ARGs were found to be correlated to variations in
   environmental temperature and humidity. Our results show the importance
   of adopting a multi-domain and multi-scale approach when studying
   microbial communities and AMR in complex, interconnected environments.},

Abstract = {In the European Union, natural habitat 62CO{*} Ponto-Sarmatian steppes
   is limited in its range and occurs only in two member states-Bulgaria
   and Romania. This grassland habitat was a subject to various impacts
   over the years and suffers on a decrease in its area, changes in species
   composition and occurance of invasive and ruderal species. The most
   significant threats to the habitat are related to intensive or excessive
   grazing of livestock, abandonment of grassland management (e.g.,
   cessation of grazing or mowing), afforestation, plowing, conversion into
   agricultural land, conversion to other land uses (tourism, recreation,
   urbanization, construction of infrastructure), construction of energy
   plants and natural succession. In the present study we provide a
   comparative analysis of the actions aiming to protect the priority
   natural habitat 62CO{*} Ponto-Sarmatian steppes on the territory of EU.
   In addition, we investigated and compared the species composition of
   defined sites from 62CO{*} in Romania and Bulgaria to obtain up to date
   information and to confirm the current presence of the habitat. We
   discuss on the necessary measures for effective management of this
   protected habitat, as well as on the needed efforts to achieve
   favourable conservation status.},

Title = {A question of scale: modeling biomass, gain and mortality distributions
   of a tropical forest},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4929-4944},

Abstract = {Describing the heterogeneous structure of forests is often challenging.
   One possibility is to analyze forest biomass in different plots and to
   derive plot-based frequency distributions. However, these frequency
   distributions depend on the plot size and thus are scale dependent. This
   study provides insights about transferring them between scales.
   Understanding the effects of scale on distributions of biomass is
   particularly important for comparing information from different sources
   such as inventories, remote sensing and modeling, all of which can
   operate at different spatial resolutions. Reliable methods to compare
   results of vegetation models at a grid scale with field data collected
   at smaller scales are still missing.
   The scaling of biomass and variables, which determine the forest
   biomass, was investigated for a tropical forest in Panama. Based on
   field inventory data from Barro Colorado Island, spanning 50 ha over 30
   years, the distributions of aboveground biomass, biomass gain and
   mortality were derived at different spatial resolutions, ranging from 10
   to 100 m. Methods for fitting parametric distribution functions were
   compared. Further, it was tested under which assumptions about the
   distributions a simple stochastic simulation forest model could best
   reproduce observed biomass distributions at all scales. Also, an
   analytical forest model for calculating biomass distributions at
   equilibrium and assuming mortality as a white shot noise process was
   tested.
   Scaling exponents of about 0.47 were found for the standard deviations
   of the biomass and gain distributions, while mortality showed a
   different scaling relationship with an exponent of 0.3. Lognormal and
   gamma distribution functions fitted with the moment matching estimation
   method allowed for consistent parameter transfers between scales. Both
   forest models (stochastic simulation and analytical solution) were able
   to reproduce observed biomass distributions across scales, when combined
   with the derived scaling relationships.
   The study demonstrates a way of how to approach the scaling problem in
   model-data comparisons by providing a transfer relationship. Further
   research is needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms that
   shape the frequency distributions at the different scales.},

Abstract = {Varanus salvator (Asian Water Monitor) is the second largest species of
   lizard in the world and is a member of the Varanidae Family. This highly
   aquatic species can also be found in arboreal environments and is an
   active predator and scavenger. Originating from southeastern Asia,
   including parts of India, this species is common in the international
   pet trade. Its popularity in the pet trade has led to multiple
   introductions outside of their native range, making this a species of
   concern as potentially invasive to the southeastern US with ready access
   to the Caribbean and Latin America. As a generalist species that has
   already been identified in Florida, there is a high likelihood for
   establishment as an invasive species. In cases such as these,
   implementing early detection and rapid response for successful
   management of invasive species is critical. Here, we provide a
   comprehensive summary of natural history findings on the Asian Water
   Monitor, including management methods and potential ecological impacts
   as an invasive species.},

Title = {How biogenic polymers control surfactant dynamics in the surface
   microlayer: insights from a coastal Baltic Sea study},

Abstract = {Surfactants can hamper gas exchange by up to 50\% in coastal seas;
   however, their small-scale temporal and spatial dynamics are poorly
   constrained. This study investigated possible biogenic sources of
   surfactants in the sea surface microlayer (SML) and the underlying water
   at a coastal Baltic Sea site. To relate surfactant dynamics to biogenic
   production, we conducted two field studies (June and September 2018) and
   focused on amino acids and carbohydrates as the main components of
   organic matter derived from phytoplankton. Furthermore the composition
   of the biochemicals provided insights into microbial degradation
   dynamics and was complemented by flow-cytometry-based community
   analysis. In total, 76 samples were collected within an area of
   approximately 50 km(2), allowing for high spatial resolution. Moreover,
   morning and afternoon sampling enabled us to investigate diel cycles.
   Our results reveal that surfactant concentrations were tightly coupled
   to the abundance of nano-phytoplankton and generally higher in September
   than in June, with cell abundance 3 times higher. Surfactant
   concentration in June was best explained by the combined effect of the
   particulate fraction of the non-essential amino acid serine, the
   concentration of particulate combined carbohydrates (PCHO), and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Surfactant and PCHO concentrations were
   significantly enriched in the SML and followed a pronounced diel cycle,
   possibly linked to microbial processing and/or photo-processing. In
   contrast to June, the surfactant pool in September correlated to a
   diverse mixture of semi-labile organic matter components, represented
   best by dissolved glucose and the essential amino acid isoleucine. We
   conclude that the surfactant pool in surface seawater is mainly composed
   of organic matter components that resist rapid microbial degradation.
   Elevated surfactant concentrations are triggered by the release of fresh
   organic matter. While the effect of the resistant but less
   surface-active stock is potentially longer-lasting, the additive effect
   of labile, highly surface-active agents on gas exchange may diminish on
   short timescales.},

Abstract = {The ability of coral populations to recover from disturbance depends on
   larval dispersion and recruitment. While ocean warming and acidification
   effects on adult corals are well documented, information on early life
   stages is comparatively scarce. Here, we investigate whether ocean
   warming and acidification can affect the larval and recruit development
   of the Mediterranean azooxanthellate coral Astroides calycularis. Larvae
   and recruits were raised for 9 months at ambient (23 degrees C) and warm
   (26 degrees C) temperatures and ambient (8.0) and low pH (7.7, on the
   total scale). The timing of the larval metamorphosis, growth of the
   recruit polyp by linear extension and budding, and skeletal
   characteristics of the 9-month-old polyps were monitored. Settlement and
   metamorphosis were more successful and hastened under a warm
   temperature. In contrast, low pH delayed the metamorphosis and affected
   the growth of the recruits by reducing the calcified area of attachment
   to the substrate as well as by diminishing the skeleton volume and the
   number of septa. However, skeleton density was higher under low pH and
   ambient temperature. The warm temperature and low-pH treatment had a
   negative impact on the survival, settlement, and growth of recruits.
   This study provides evidence of the threat represented by ocean warming
   and acidification for the larval recruitment and the growth of recruits
   of A. calycularis.},

Abstract = {Mesoscale eddies modulate the ocean's physical, chemical, and biological
   properties. In cyclonic eddies (CEs), nutrient upwelling can stimulate
   primary production by phytoplankton. Yet, how this locally enhanced
   autotrophic production affects heterotrophy and consequently the
   metabolic balance between the synthesis and the consumption of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we
   investigated the horizontal and vertical variability in auto- and
   heterotrophic microbial activity (biomass production and respiration)
   within a CE that formed off Mauritania and along the \& SIM; 900 km
   zonal corridor between Mauritania and the Cape Verde islands in the
   Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA). Our results show how the
   physical disturbances caused by the CE affected the biomass distribution
   of phyto- and bacterioplankton and their metabolic activities. The
   injection of nutrients into the sunlit surface resulted in enhanced
   autotrophic pico- and nanoplankton abundance and generally increased
   autotrophic activity as indicated by chlorophyll a (Chl a)
   concentration, primary production (PP), and extracellular release rates.
   However, the detailed eddy survey also revealed an uneven distribution
   of these variables with, for example, the highest Chl a concentrations
   and PP rates occurring near and just beyond the CE's periphery. The
   heterotrophic bacterial activity was similarly variable. Optode-based
   community respiration (CR), bacterial respiration (BR) estimates, and
   bacterial biomass production (BP) largely followed the trends of PP and
   Chl a. Thus, a submesoscale spatial mosaic of heterotrophic bacterial
   abundance and activities occurred within the CE that was closely related
   to variability in autotrophic production. Consistent with this, we found
   a significant positive correlation between concentrations of semi-labile
   dissolved organic carbon (SL-DOC; here the sum of dissolved hydrolysable
   amino acids and dissolved combined carbohydrates) and BR estimates.
   Extracellular release of carbon as indicated by primary production of
   dissolved organic carbon (PPDOC) was variable with depth and laterally
   and not always sufficient to compensate the bacterial carbon demand
   (BCD: BR + BP), with PPDOC accounting for between 28 \% and 110 \% of
   the BCD. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE: BP / BCD) ranged between 1.7
   \% and 18.2 \%. We estimated the metabolic state to establish whether
   the CE was a source or a sink of organic carbon. We showed that the CE
   carried a strong autotrophic signal in the core (PP / CR > 1). Our
   results suggest that submesoscale (0-10 km) processes lead to highly
   variable metabolic activities in both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic
   microorganisms. Overall, we revealed that the CEs not only trap and
   transport coastal nutrients and organic carbon to the open ocean but
   also stimulate phytoplankton growth, generating freshly produced organic
   matter during westward propagation. This drives heterotrophic processes
   and may contribute to the previously observed net heterotrophy in open
   Atlantic surface waters.},

Abstract = {With ongoing warming and sea ice loss, the Arctic Ocean and its marginal
   seas as a habitat for pelagic calcifiers are changing, possibly
   resulting in modifications of the regional carbonate cycle and the
   composition of the seafloor sediment. A substantial part of the pelagic
   carbonate production in the Arctic is due to the calcification of the
   dominant planktonic foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma. To
   quantify carbonate production and loss in the upper water layer by this
   important Arctic calcifier, we compile and analyse data from vertical
   profiles in the upper water column of shell number concentration, sizes
   and weights of this species across the Arctic region during summer. Our
   data are inconclusive on whether the species performs ontogenetic
   vertical migration throughout its life cycle or whether individual
   specimens calcify at a fixed depth within the vertical habitat. The base
   of the productive zone of the species is on average located below 100 m
   and at maximum at 300 m and is regionally highly variable. The calcite
   flux immediately below the productive zone (export flux) is on average 8
   mg CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1), and we observe that this flux is attenuated until
   at least 300 m below the base of the productive zone by a mean rate of
   6.6 \% per 100 m. Regionally, the summer export flux of N. pachyderma
   calcite varies by more than 2 orders of magnitude, and the estimated
   mean export flux below the twilight zone is sufficient to account for
   about a quarter of the total pelagic carbonate flux in the region. These
   results indicate that estimates of the Arctic pelagic carbonate budget
   will have to account for large regional differences in the export flux
   of the major pelagic calcifiers and confirm that substantial attenuation
   of the export flux occurs in the twilight zone.},

Abstract = {The distribution and abundance of transposable elements across the tree
   of life have significantly shaped the evolution of cellular organisms,
   but the underlying mechanisms shaping these ecological patterns remain
   elusive. Here we establish a ``common garden{''} approach to study
   causal ecological interactions between a xenogeneic conditional lethal
   sacB gene and the community of transposable insertion sequences (ISs) in
   a multipartite prokaryote genome. Xenogeneic sacB of low, medium, or
   high GC content was individually inserted into three replicons of a
   model bacterium Sinorhizobium fredii, and exhibited replicon- and
   GC-dependent variation in genetic stability. This variation was largely
   attributable to multidimensional niche differentiation for IS community
   members. The transposition efficiency of major active ISs depended on
   the nucleoid-associated xenogeneic silencer MucR. Experimentally
   eliminating insertion activity of specific ISs by deleting MucR strongly
   demonstrated a dominant role of niche differentiation among ISs. This
   intracellular common garden approach in the experimental evolution
   context allows not only for evaluating genetic stability of natural and
   synthetic xenogeneic genes of different sequence signatures in host
   cells but also for tracking and testing causal relationships in unifying
   ecological principles in genome ecology.},

Abstract = {The Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the coastal mangrove
   ecosystems in China. Here, we attempt to evaluate the invasion effect of
   S. alterniflora and the restoration effect of mangrove wetlands from the
   perspective of the nitrogen cycle characteristics. The inorganic
   nitrogen content, soil nitrogen mineralization, ammonification, and
   nitrification rate of uninvaded mudflats with those of invaded S.
   alterniflora site and native Kandelia obovata site at different
   restoration stages were compared. The results showed that the NH4+-N was
   the dominant form of soil inorganic nitrogen at all sites. Owing to its
   higher ammonification rates, the nitrogen mineralization rates at S.
   alterniflora site were highest in spring and summer among all sites
   except for mudflat. The young mangrove (1 year and 8 years) had
   significantly higher soil inorganic nitrogen content but lower nitrogen
   mineralization than the mature mangrove, indicated the short-term
   response to restoration. The S. alterniflora invasion did not enhance
   soil nitrogen mineralization comparing with preinvaded mudflat, but it
   used more NH4+-N relative to K. obovata due to its higher soil nitrogen
   mineralization than mangrove communities in germination and growing
   seasons.},

Title = {Belowground bud bank of invasive plants contributes to their successful
   invasion in coastal wetlands},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 15},
Abstract = {The capacity of vegetative regeneration can contribute to the invasion
   success of alien plant species in introduced ranges. Belowground bud
   bank is a trait closely related to vegetative regeneration, but it is
   still unknown whether belowground bud bank can help invasive alien
   plants to successfully invade into native plant communities. We measured
   bud bank density and aboveground biomass of invasive alien and native
   plants, and species diversity in four wetlands along a soil moisture
   gradient in Zhejiang Province in East China. Overall, bud bank density,
   aboveground biomass, and plant diversity differed significantly among
   the four wetlands along the soil moisture gradient. Bud bank density,
   aboveground biomass, and the relative dominance of invasive plants
   increased with increasing soil moisture, whereas bud bank density and
   the relative dominance of the native plants showed the opposite trend.
   For invasive plants, both the proportion of aboveground biomass and the
   relative dominance were significantly positively related to their bud
   proportion. These results suggest that belowground bud bank of invasive
   alien plant species can contribute to their successful invasion in
   native plant communities. Therefore, measures such as plowing and raking
   could be taken to destroy or restrict belowground bud bank of invasive
   alien plants to prevent their invasion and to restore native vegetation.},

Title = {Assisted dispersal and retention of lichen-dominated biocrust material
   for arctic restoration},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 17},
Abstract = {Arctic biocrust loss due to industrial activity can have long-lasting
   ecological impacts, highlighting the importance of restoring disturbed
   tundra environments. This research focused on biocrust establishment on
   substrates of by-product materials from diamond mining (crushed rock,
   lake sediment, processed kimberlite), inoculant dispersal (dry
   placement, slurry), habitat amelioration (erosion control blanket,
   tundra soil, woody debris), and containment (jute mat), over three field
   seasons at Diavik Diamond Mine, Inc., Northwest Territories. Three years
   after inoculation, lichens were detected on 100\% of inoculated plots
   and 70\% of uninoculated plots (likely blown in from inoculated plots).
   Uninoculated plots had significantly lower species richness and
   vegetation cover than inoculated plots. Biocrust retention was highest
   on plots with erosion control blanket, containment, woody debris, and
   crushed rock; larger scale application of these treatments should be
   assessed in future. Plots with processed kimberlite, no habitat
   amelioration or tundra soil, and no containment had the lowest cover,
   species richness, and individual species abundance in year 3. This
   research suggests that active restoration techniques using lichen
   biocrust inoculation and habitat amelioration is required for successful
   biocrust revegetation outcomes on substrates of mining by-products in
   the arctic.},

Title = {Sun-induced fluorescence as a proxy for primary productivity across
   vegetation types and climates},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {20},
Pages = {4833-4864},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellites
   has shown potential as a remote sensing proxy for gross primary
   productivity (GPP). However, to fully exploit the potential of this
   signal, the robustness and stability of the SIF-GPP relationship across
   vegetation types and climates must be assessed. For this purpose,
   current studies have been limited by the availability of SIF datasets
   with sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the signal between
   different vegetation cover types. To overcome this limitation, this
   analysis uses GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) SIF
   retrievals, downscaled to a resolution of 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km)
   to explore the relationship between SIF and FLUXCOM GPP (GPPFX), a
   data-driven dataset of primary productivity obtained by upscaling
   flux-tower measurements. The high resolution of the downscaled SIF
   (SIFDS) dataset allows the relationships to be broken down by vegetation
   cover for separate climate zones, thus enabling a confrontation between
   GPP and SIF at fine granularity. This analysis first investigates the
   spatial and temporal relationships between FLUXCOM GPP and downscaled
   SIF at a global scale. A reasonably strong linear relationship is
   generally observed between SIFDS and GPP(FX) in all vegetation
   categories, and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) shows that the
   spatial response is similar between certain plant traits, with some
   distinction between herbaceous and woody vegetation and notable
   exceptions, such as equatorial broadleaf forests. Geographical regions
   of non-linearity suggest where SIFDS could potentially provide
   information about ecosystem dynamics that are not represented in the
   FLUXCOM GPP dataset. With the demonstration of down-scaled SIF as a
   proxy for GPP, the response of SIFDS to short-term fluctuations in
   several meteorological variables is analysed and the most significant
   short-term environmental driving and limiting meteorological variables
   determined. Vegetation groupings of similar SIF-meteorological response
   reinforce the vegetation categorisations suggested by the ANCOVA. This
   comparative exploration of two of the most recent products in carbon
   productivity estimation shows the value in downscaling SIF data,
   provides an independent probe of the FLUXCOM GPP model, enhances our
   understanding of the global SIF-GPP spatio-temporal relationship with a
   particular focus on the role of vegetation cover, and explores the
   similarity of the SIF and GPP responses to meteorological fluctuations.
   Additional analyses with alternative SIF and GPP datasets support these
   conclusions.},

Title = {Exploring How a Generalist Pathogen and Within-Host Priority Effects

Abstract = {In multihost-multipathogen communities, a focal host's risk of being
   infected by a particular pathogen can be influenced by the presence of
   other host and pathogen species. We explore how indirect interactions
   between pathogens at the within-host level (through coinfecting the same
   individual) and the between-host level (through altered susceptible host
   densities) affect the focal host's risk of infection. We use an SI-type
   epidemiological model of two host species and two environmentally
   transmitted pathogens where one pathogen is a specialist on the focal
   host and the other pathogen is a generalist. We show that monotonic,
   unimodal, and U-shaped relationships between the specialist and
   generalist infectious propagule densities (proxies of the focal host's
   risk of infection) are driven by the way within-host priority effects
   alter the production of specialist infectious propagules by infected
   focal host individuals. Interestingly, within-host priority effects can
   also lead to overcompensation in density wherein increased infected host
   mortality results in greater specialist infectious propagule density. We
   interpret these results in terms of how the focal host's risk of being
   infected by a specialist pathogen is affected by the presence of a
   generalist pathogen, its alternative host, and within-host priority
   effects.},

Title = {The Adaptive Potential of Nonheritable Somatic Mutations},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {6},
Pages = {755-772},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The adaptive potential of nonheritable somatic mutations has received
   limited attention in traditional evolutionary theory because
   heritability is a fundamental pillar of Darwinian evolution. We
   hypothesized that the ability of a germline genotype to express a novel
   phenotype via nonheritable somatic mutations can be selectively
   advantageous and that this advantage will channel evolving populations
   toward germline genotypes that constitutively express the phenotype. We
   tested this hypothesis by simulating evolving populations of developing
   organisms with an impermeable germline-soma separation navigating a
   minimal fitness landscape. The simulations revealed the conditions under
   which nonheritable somatic mutations promote adaptation. Specifically,
   this can occur when the somatic mutation supply is high, when few cells
   with the advantageous somatic mutation are required to increase
   organismal fitness, and when the somatic mutation also confers a
   selective advantage at the cellular level. We therefore provide proof of
   principle that nonheritable somatic mutations can promote adaptive
   evolution via a process we call ``somatic genotypic exploration.{''} We
   discuss the biological plausibility of this phenomenon as well as its
   evolutionary implications.},

Title = {Abiotic Niche Divergence of Hybrid Species from Their Progenitors},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Although more frequently discussed recently than previously, the role of
   ecology in homoploid hybrid and allopolyploid speciation has not been
   subjected to comparative analysis. We examined abiotic niche divergence
   of 22 assumed homoploid hybrid species and 60 allopolyploid species from
   that of their progenitors. Ecological niche modeling was employed in an
   analysis of each species' fundamental niche, and ordination methods were
   used in an analysis of realized niches. Both analyses utilized 100,000
   georeferenced records. From estimates of niche overlap and niche
   breadth, we identified for both types of hybrid species four niche
   divergence patterns: niche novelty, niche contraction, niche
   intermediacy, and niche expansion. Niche shifts involving niche novelty
   were common and considered likely to play an important role in the
   establishment of both types of hybrid species, although more so for
   homoploid hybrid species than for allopolyploid species. Approximately
   70\% of homoploid hybrid species versus 37\% of allopolyploid species
   showed shifts in the fundamental niche from their parents, and similar
   to 86\% versus similar to 52\%, respectively, exhibited shifts in the
   realized niche. Climate was shown to contribute more than soil and
   landform to niche shifts in both types of hybrid species. Overall, our
   results highlight the significance of abiotic niche divergence for
   hybrid speciation, especially without genome duplication.},

Title = {Soil environmental DNA metabarcoding can quantify local plant diversity
   for biomonitoring across varied environments},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 7},
Abstract = {Biomonitoring of plant communities is essential when evaluating outcomes
   of ecological restoration, but morphology-based inventories can impede
   consistency across spatial and temporal scales. The Eden Project botanic
   garden (Cornwall, UK) offers an opportunity to test whether soil
   environmental DNA (eDNA) reflects plant species richness, community
   composition, and diversity. Furthermore, it enables the exploration of
   whether community complexity, environmental conditions, or sampling
   scale influence the similarity of soil eDNA-derived results compared
   with those derived from classic botanical inventories. Survey plots were
   established encompassing a mixture of high- and low-complexity plant
   assemblages, under either hot and humid or cool and dry conditions.
   Botanical inventories were conducted in quadrats up to 7 m around a soil
   eDNA sample plot. Soil samples were processed by metabarcoding of trnL
   p6 loop to determine plant eDNA identity and relative abundance.
   Differences in diversity and community composition were calculated
   before determining whether (1) inventory scale; (2) plant assembly
   complexity; (3) ambient conditions; (4) soil chemistry; (5) bulk root
   biomass and (6) soil respiration influenced the similarity of soil eDNA
   and botanical inventory methods. Inventory scale significantly
   determined the dissimilarity in both diversity and composition, with
   soil respiration, phosphorus, and C:N ratio also accounting for
   variation across sites. Our results demonstrate that soil eDNA
   metabarcoding is an effective approach for quantifying relative
   diversity in plant communities across broad habitat types and could be
   integrated into restoration monitoring strategies, but that its
   application requires an appropriate a priori knowledge of survey sites
   to best tailor soil eDNA survey implementation.},

   interface in the USA},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 22},
Abstract = {As we advance into the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,
   understanding the relationship between science, management, and policy
   is increasingly important given the paucity of research evaluating the
   ability of existing policy to address contemporary environmental
   challenges. Despite their inherent interdependence, restoration ecology
   as a scientific discipline, ecological restoration as a practice, and
   the policies driving restoration efforts do not always represent a
   unified force. Accenting the policies and practices within the United
   States, we present our perspective on challenges associated with this
   disunion, including those linked to social dimensions of restoration and
   limitations associated with existing policy. We provide a review of
   existing federal policy in the United States and synthesize suggestions
   that have emerged in the literature to fortify connections between
   restoration science and policy. We also describe social challenges to
   meeting restoration goals, including barriers surrounding power
   dynamics, trust, and communication, as well as divergent incentives,
   perspectives, and values. We propose potential solutions that exist in
   transdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing, and
   evidence-based, balanced decision-making that equally considers varying
   perspectives. With the understanding that current conservation practices
   are not enough to mitigate environmental degradation, we focus on
   streamlining problem-solving strategies to support restoration and face
   the widespread ecological issues of today.},

Title = {Introduced Spartina anglica modifies fish habitat in southern temperate
   succulent saltmarshes},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Month = {2022 NOV 2},
Abstract = {Vegetation changes in saltmarsh habitat can influence fish assemblages
   and abundance. In Tasmania, Australia, mid-latitude succulent saltmarsh
   communities have been invaded by the introduced tall grass, Spartina
   anglica. Eradication efforts have been ongoing since the 1990s with
   purported benefits for fish access to intertidal foraging grounds, but a
   lack of knowledge of the impact of S. anglica on fish limits
   understanding of the benefits and effectiveness of native habitat
   restoration. Here, we investigate whether fish assemblages in native
   saltmarshes and non-native S. anglica grassland differ in species
   diversity, fish abundance, and size class distribution. We used buoyant
   pop nets to sample fishes in Sarcocornia quinqueflora herbland and S.
   anglica grassland swards at three sampling stations in northwest
   Tasmania. Very few individuals and low species diversity were recorded
   in both vegetation types at the sampling station with the most
   well-established S. anglica infestation. Elsewhere, richness and
   diversity were higher in S. quinqueflora herbland. Overall fish
   abundance was higher in S. quinqueflora than in S. anglica, with a very
   strong effect at one sampling station. Fewer small individuals of the
   numerically dominant Atherinosoma microstoma were recorded in S.
   anglica, potentially indicating impaired nursery function. Our results
   provide important insights for S. anglica control, as we are the first
   to demonstrate a relationship between S. anglica presence and fish
   characteristics in southern Australian saltmarsh. These results indicate
   that S. anglica control is valuable for fish conservation. An extension
   of our research to document the effects of S. anglica removal on fishes
   is desirable.},

Title = {Regenerative capacity of old-fields on semi-arid floodplains in the
   northern Murray-Darling basin},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 25},
Abstract = {Revegetating abandoned agricultural lands is vital to restoring critical
   ecological functions and services. Natural regeneration, whereby
   vegetation regrows via the seeds already present within the landscape,
   has shown to be an effective approach to restoring large agricultural
   areas, although more research is required to understand the regenerative
   capacity of the various seed sources. Here, we investigate the
   regenerative capacity of old-fields of semi-arid floodplains of eastern
   Australia in a year-long seedling emergence experiment. We examined the
   germinable seed banks from three potential propagule sources (soil, leaf
   litter, and animal scats) collected across 24 field sites, comprising 12
   old-fields and 12 adjacent remnant vegetation patches, distributed
   across four regions. Soil seed banks stored the most germinable species
   of the three seed bank types, although these were dominated largely by
   annual herbaceous species. High abundances of seedlings emerged from
   scat samples, indicating that native animals, such as kangaroos and
   emus, play a role in transporting seeds in these landscapes. Finally,
   leaf litter stored the most germinable propagules of woody species,
   therefore, representing a vital mechanism for woody vegetation
   regeneration. There were few differences in emerging seedling
   assemblages in terms of species richness, abundance or composition
   between seed banks of old-fields and adjacent remnant vegetation,
   suggesting that old-field seed banks have a high level of resilience.
   Our findings suggest that these seed banks can make an important
   contribution to natural regeneration of these old-fields, but mainly
   with respect to understory and midstory species, with overstory tree
   species mostly absent from these seed sources.},

Title = {Fish diversity decline in the lower Gangetic plains: a victim of

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {341-362},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Analysis of long-term data provides a valuable approach to determining
   the extent of biodiversity decline and likely causes, but such
   approaches are rare in large tropical rivers. We investigated the
   response of the fish fauna to hydrological, climate and anthropogenic
   factors over the period 1982-2017 in the lower Ganges (Padma) River,
   Bangladesh. Systematic effort-based sampling of fish between 2007 and
   2017 from a 70-km reach showed a decreasing trend in abundance and
   diversity. Compared to 1982 data for the same sites and fishing methods,
   28 fish species, including 16 nationally threatened ones, were absent in
   recent catches, suggesting local extinction of these. Fish community
   diversity was negatively affected by fishing pressure (71 fishermen in
   1980, 2616 in 2019, 37.8-fold increase) and non-native species abundance
   (6.8-fold increase in abundance between 2007 and 2017). Permanent water
   area has reduced by similar to 50\% since 1984. Annual mean rainfall,
   Ganges water depth and river discharge at the study location decreased
   significantly since 1980 (by 19.2\%, 17.8\% and 27.6\% respectively,
   while annual air temperature increased (25.1 degrees C in 1981 to 26.2
   degrees C in 2019). Water diversion at the Farakka Barrage, similar to
   70 km upstream, is partially responsible for reductions in permanent
   water area in the study reach. Potential sources of biological invasion
   and water pollution have been identified. Widespread ecological
   consequences on fish diversity and productivity, resulting from multiple
   factors, are occurring in the lower Ganges. Reduction of fisheries
   impacts and improved prevention of accidental aquaculture releases of
   non-native fishes are identified as conservation priorities for
   arresting the decline of native fishes in the lower Ganges.},

Abstract = {The emblematic conifer flora of Chile has experienced wide-scale habitat
   loss and fragmentation. Coupled with the complex topography of the
   region, this leads to a prediction of high levels of genetic drift and
   isolation resulting in strong population differentiation, and the
   potential for negative genetic consequences. To address the degree to
   which these predictions are realised, we conducted a comparative
   population genetic survey in four endemic conifers from South America,
   each of conservation concern and with a restricted distribution area.
   Between seven and ten populations per species were sampled, covering
   their entire natural distribution in Chile. We used restriction
   site-associated DNA markers (RAD-seq), with de novo assembly and
   optimisation, to accommodate the large and complex genome of conifers.
   The main finding was low levels of genetic structure in all four conifer
   species (F-ST = 0.017-0.062). This pattern was strikingly consistent
   across all four species. These results are likely due to the extreme
   longevity of individuals restricting divergence due to genetic drift.
   Thus, despite the currently highly fragmented ranges of these conifer
   species, we did not detect evidence for high levels of population
   differentiation and genetic isolation. This suggests some resilience to
   negative genetic impacts of habitat fragmentation, and the longevity of
   the individual trees may provide considerable buffering capacity. We
   recommend follow-up studies focusing on genotyping the seedling
   generation, to assess whether there is any evidence for the early
   warning of genetic isolation and/or elevated inbreeding in the currently
   established cohorts.},

Abstract = {Serpentinization of ultramafic rocks provides molecular hydrogen (H-2)
   that can support lithotrophic metabolism of microorganisms, but also
   poses extremely challenging conditions, including hyperalkalinity and
   limited electron acceptor availability. Investigation of two
   serpentinization-active systems reveals that conventional
   H-2-/CO2-dependent homoacetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable in
   situ due to picomolar CO2 levels. Through metagenomics and
   thermodynamics, we discover unique taxa capable of metabolism adapted to
   the habitat. This included a novel deep-branching phylum, ``Ca.
   Lithacetigenota{''}, that exclusively inhabits serpentinite-hosted
   systems and harbors genes encoding alternative modes of H-2-utilizing
   lithotrophy. Rather than CO2, these putative metabolisms utilize reduced
   carbon compounds detected in situ presumably serpentinization-derived:
   formate and glycine. The former employs a partial homoacetogenesis
   pathway and the latter a distinct pathway mediated by a rare
   selenoprotein-the glycine reductase. A survey of microbiomes shows that
   glycine reductases are diverse and nearly ubiquitous in
   serpentinite-hosted environments. ``Ca. Lithacetigenota{''} glycine
   reductases represent a basal lineage, suggesting that catabolic glycine
   reduction is an ancient bacterial innovation by Terrabacteria for
   gaining energy from geogenic H-2 even under hyperalkaline, CO2-poor
   conditions. Unique non-CO2-reducing metabolisms presented here shed
   light on potential strategies that extremophiles may employ for
   overcoming a crucial obstacle in serpentinization-associated
   environments, features potentially relevant to primordial lithotrophy in
   early Earth.},

Title = {Mini Safe Havens for population recovery and reintroductions

Abstract = {In response to the ongoing decline of fauna worldwide, there has been
   growing interest in the rewilding of whole ecosystems outside of fenced
   sanctuaries or offshore islands. This interest will inevitably result in
   attempts to restore species where eliminating threats from predators and
   competitors is extremely challenging or impossible, or reintroductions
   of predators that will increase predation risk for extant prey (i.e.,
   coexistence conservation). We propose `Mini Safe Havens' (MSHs) as a
   potential tool for managing these threats. Mini Safe Havens are refuges
   that are permanently permeable to the focal species; allowing the
   emigration of individuals while maintaining gene flow through the
   boundary. Crucial to the effectiveness of the approach is the ongoing
   maintenance and monitoring required to preserve a low-to-zero risk of
   key threats within the MSH; facilitating in-situ learning and adaptation
   by focal species to these threats, at a rate and intensity of exposure
   determined by the animals themselves. We trialled the MSH approach for a
   pilot reintroduction of the Australian native New Holland mouse
   (Pseudomys novaehollandiae), in the context of a trophic rewilding
   project to address potential naivete to a reintroduced native mammalian
   predator. We found that mice released into a MSH maintained their weight
   and continued to use the release site beyond 17 months (525 days)
   post-release. In contrast, individuals in temporary soft-release
   enclosures tended to lose weight and became undetectable approximately
   1-month post-release. We discuss the broad applicability of MSHs for
   population recovery and reintroductions `beyond-the-fence' and recommend
   avenues for further refinement of the approach.},

Title = {Diazotrophs are overlooked contributors to carbon and nitrogen export to
   the deep ocean},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},

Pages = {47-58},

Abstract = {Diazotrophs are widespread microorganisms that alleviate nitrogen
   limitation in 60\% of our oceans, thereby regulating marine
   productivity. Yet, the group-specific contribution of diazotrophs to
   organic matter export has not been quantified, which so far has impeded
   an accurate assessment of their impact on the biological carbon pump.
   Here, we examine the fate of five groups of globally-distributed
   diazotrophs by using an original combination of mesopelagic particle
   sampling devices across the subtropical South Pacific Ocean. We
   demonstrate that cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are
   exported down to 1000 m depth. Surprisingly, group-specific export
   turnover rates point to a more efficient export of small unicellular
   cyanobacterial diazotrophs (UCYN) relative to the larger and filamentous
   Trichodesmium. Phycoerythrin-containing UCYN-B and UCYN-C-like cells
   were recurrently found embedded in large (>50 mu m) organic aggregates
   or organized into clusters of tens to hundreds of cells linked by an
   extracellular matrix, presumably facilitating their export. Beyond the
   South Pacific, our data are supported by analysis of the Tara Oceans
   metagenomes collected in other ocean basins, extending the scope of our
   results globally. We show that, when diazotrophs are found in the
   euphotic zone, they are also systematically present in mesopelagic
   waters, suggesting their transport to the deep ocean. We thus conclude
   that diazotrophs are a significant part of the carbon sequestered in the
   deep ocean and, therefore, they need to be accounted in regional and
   global estimates of export.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Many areas in the Arctic are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change. We observe large-scale effects on physical, biological, economic
   and social parameters, including ice cover, species distributions,
   economic activity and regional gover-nance frameworks. Arctic living
   marine resources are affected in various ways. A holistic understanding
   of these effects requires a multidisciplinary enterprise. We synthesize
   relevant research, from oceanography and ecology, via economics, to
   political science and international law. We find that multidisciplinary
   research can enhance our understanding and promote new questions and
   issues relating to impacts and outcomes of climate change in the Arctic.
   Such issues include recent insights on changing spawning migrations of
   the North-east Arctic cod stock that necessitates revisions of
   socioeconomic estimates of ecosystem wealth in the Barents Sea, better
   integrated prediction systems that require increased coopera-tion
   between experts on climate prediction and ecosystem modelling, and
   institu-tional complexities of Arctic governance that require enhanced

Title = {High nutrient loads hinder successful restoration of natural habitats in
   freshwater wetlands},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {SI},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Restoration of natural processes in ecosystems is key to mitigate the
   biodiversity crisis. Here, we evaluate 20 Danish stream-valley
   restoration projects-mainly by rewetting-in terms of successful
   restoration of natural wetland habitats. We used quadratic discriminant
   analysis and generalized linear models to compare 80 vegetation plots
   from the restoration projects with >60,000 natural or semi-natural
   wetland reference plots. We modeled the influence of time since
   restoration, grazing, rewetting, and nutrient availability on (1) the
   probability that study plots belong to natural habitats and (2) their
   richness of high-quality-habitat indicator species. The probability of a
   restored wetland having developed into a natural wetland habitat-such as
   an alkaline fen-was generally below 10\%. Also, we found only half as
   many indicator species in restored wetlands than in reference wetlands
   and we demonstrated that the number of characteristic alkaline fen
   species did not deviate from what could be expected under the prevailing
   nutrient conditions. We found a negative effect of soil nutrient
   availability on the number of high-quality-habitat indicator species and
   the lowest probability of plots being natural wetlands in the most
   nutrient rich plots. The effect of grazing was only positive in the
   first years after restoration and only in the most nutrient rich plots,
   while the effect of rewetting sites to historical hydrological
   conditions was generally negative. Our findings suggest that unnaturally
   high nutrient availability is probably the core limiting factor for
   successful restoration of natural wetlands and their associated plant
   diversity.},

Title = {Monitoring vegetation condition using microwave remote sensing: the
   standardized vegetation optical depth index (SVODI)},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {21},
Pages = {5107-5123},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Vegetation conditions can be monitored on a global scale using remote
   sensing observations in various wavelength domains. In the microwave
   domain, data from various spaceborne microwave missions are available
   from the late 1970s onwards. From these observations, vegetation optical
   depth (VOD) can be estimated, which is an indicator of the total canopy
   water content and hence of above-ground biomass and its moisture state.
   Observations of VOD anomalies would thus complement indicators based on
   visible and near-infrared observations, which are primarily an indicator
   of an ecosystem's photosynthetic activity.
   Reliable long-term vegetation state monitoring needs to account for the
   varying number of available observations over time caused by changes in
   the satellite constellation. To overcome this, we introduce the
   standardized vegetation optical depth index (SVODI), which is created by
   combining VOD estimates from multiple passive microwave sensors and
   frequencies. Different frequencies are sensitive to different parts of
   the vegetation canopy. Thus, combining them into a single index makes
   this index sensitive to deviations in any of the vegetation parts
   represented. SSM/I-, TMI-, AMSR-E, WindSat- and AMSR2-derived C-, X- and
   Ku-band VODs are merged in a probabilistic manner resulting in a
   vegetation condition index spanning from 1987 to the present.
   SVODI shows similar temporal patterns to the well-established optical
   vegetation health index (VHI) derived from optical and thermal data. In
   regions where water availability is the main control on vegetation
   growth, SVODI also shows similar temporal patterns to the meteorological
   drought index scPDSI (self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index)
   and soil moisture anomalies from ERA5-Land. Temporal SVODI patterns
   relate to the climate oscillation indices SOI (Southern Oscillation
   index) and DMI (dipole mode index) in the relevant regions. It is
   further shown that anomalies occur in VHI and soil moisture anomalies
   before they occur in SVODI.
   The results demonstrate the potential of VOD to monitor the vegetation
   condition, supplementing existing optical indices. It comes with the
   advantages and disadvantages inherent to passive microwave remote
   sensing, such as being less susceptible to cloud coverage and solar
   illumination but at the cost of a lower spatial resolution.
   The index generation is not specific to VOD and could therefore find
   applications in other fields.},

Title = {Modeling nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soil incubation
   experiments using CoupModel},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {19},
Pages = {4811-4832},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Efforts to develop effective climate mitigation strategies for
   agriculture require methods to estimate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
   from soil. Process-based biogeochemical models have been often used for
   field- and large-scale estimates, while the sensitivity and uncertainty
   of model applications to incubation experiments are less investigated.
   In this study, a process-oriented model (CoupModel) was used to simulate
   N2O and CO2 fluxes and soil mineral nitrogen (N) contents in a
   short-term (43 d) factorial incubation experiment (16 treatments). A
   global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach, ``Morris screening{''}, was
   applied to quantify parameter sensitivity. The GSA suggested that a
   higher number of sensitive parameters was associated with N2O flux
   estimates and that inter-treatment variations in parameter sensitivities
   were distinguished by soil moisture levels or NO3- content and residue
   types. Important parameters regarding N2O flux estimates were linked to
   the decomposability of soil organic matter (e.g., organic C pool sizes)
   and the denitrification process (e.g., Michaelis constant and
   denitrifier respiratory rates). After calibration, the model better
   captured temporal variations and magnitude of gas fluxes and mineral N
   in unamended soils than in residue-amended soils. Low-magnitude daily
   and cumulative N2O fluxes were well simulated with mean errors (MEs)
   close to zero, but the model tended to underestimate N2O fluxes, as
   observed daily values increased by over 0.1 gNm 2 d 1, in which the
   major mismatch was due to limited success of the model to describe the
   high emissions during the first few days after crop residue addition. A
   larger uncertainty was also seen in the magnitude of pulse emissions by
   the posterior simulations. We also evaluated ancillary variables
   regarding N cycling, which indicated that more frequent measurements and
   additional types of observed data such as soil oxygen content and the
   microbial sources of emitted N2O are required to further evaluate model
   performance and biases. The major challenges for calibration were
   associated with high sensitivities of denitrification parameters to
   initial soil abiotic conditions and the instantaneous residue amendment.
   Model structure uncertainties and improved modeling practices in the
   context of incubation experiments were discussed.},

Abstract = {Nutrient cycles in the Arctic Ocean are being altered by changing
   hydrography, increasing riverine inputs, glacial melt and sea-ice loss
   due to climate change. In this study, combined isotopic measurements of
   dissolved nitrate (delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3) and silicic acid
   (delta Si-30(OH)(4)) are used to understand the pathways that major
   nutrients follow through the Arctic Ocean. Atlantic waters were found to
   be isotopically lighter (delta Si-30(OH)(4)=+ 1.74 parts per thousand)
   than their polar counterpart (delta Si-30(OH)(4)=+ 1.85 parts per
   thousand) owing to partial biological utilisation of dissolved Si (DSi)
   within the Arctic Ocean. Coupled partial benthic denitrification and
   nitrification on Eurasian Arctic shelves lead to the enrichment of delta
   15N-NO3 and lighter delta 18O-NO3 in the polar surface waters (delta
   N-15-NO3= 5.44 parts per thousand, delta O-18-NO3= 1.22 parts per
   thousand) relative to Atlantic waters (delta N-15-NO3= 5.18 parts per
   thousand, delta O-18-NO3= 2.33 parts per thousand). Using a pan-Arctic
   DSi isotope dataset, we find that the input of isotopically light delta
   Si-30(OH)(4) by Arctic rivers and the subsequent partial biological
   uptake and biogenic Si burial on Eurasian shelves are the key processes
   that generate the enriched isotopic signatures of DSi exported through
   Fram Strait. A similar analysis of delta N-15-NO3 highlights the role of
   N-limitation due to denitrification losses on Arctic shelves in
   generating the excess dissolved silicon exported through Fram Strait. We
   estimate that around 40 \% of DSi exported in polar surface waters
   through Fram Strait is of riverine origin. As the Arctic Ocean is
   broadly N-limited and riverine sources of DSi are increasing faster than
   nitrogen inputs, a larger silicic acid export through the Fram Strait is
   expected in the future. Arctic riverine inputs therefore have the
   potential to modify the North Atlantic DSi budget and are expected to
   become more important than variable Pacific and glacial DSi sources over
   the coming decades.},

Abstract = {Systematic long-term studies on ecosystem dynamics are largelylacking
   from the East Antarctic Southern Ocean, although it is wellrecognized
   that they are indispensable to identify the ecological impactsand risks
   of environmental change. Here, we present a framework forestablishing a
   long-term cross-disciplinary study on decadal timescales. Weargue that
   the eastern Weddell Sea and the adjacent sea to the east, offDronning
   Maud Land, is a particularly well suited area for such a study,since it
   is based on findings from previous expeditions to this region.Moreover,
   since climate and environmental change have so far beencomparatively
   muted in this area, as in the eastern Antarctic in general, asystematic
   long-term study of its environmental and ecological state canprovide a
   baseline of the current situation, which will be important for
   anassessment of future changes from their very onset, with consistent
   andcomparable time series data underpinning and testing models and
   theirprojections. By establishing an Integrated East Antarctic
   MarineResearch (IEAMaR) observatory, long-term changes in ocean
   dynamics,geochemistry, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions and
   services will besystematically explored and mapped through regular
   autonomous and ship-basedsynoptic surveys. An associated long-term
   ecological research (LTER)programme, including experimental and
   modelling work, will allow forstudying climate-driven ecosystem changes
   and interactions with impactsarising from other anthropogenic
   activities. This integrative approach willprovide a level of long-term
   data availability and ecosystem understandingthat are imperative to
   determine, understand, and project the consequencesof climate change and
   support a sound science-informed management of futureconservation
   efforts in the Southern Ocean.},

   monoterpene emissions from holm oak in opposite ways},

Abstract = {Climate change can profoundly alter volatile organic compound (VOC)
   emissions from vegetation and thus influence climate evolution. Yet, the
   short- and long-term effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on emissions
   in interaction with temperature are not well enough understood,
   especially for VOCs other than isoprene. To gain additional insight, we
   conducted a study on holm oak, which is known for its strong foliar
   monoterpene emissions that are directly linked to their synthesis. We
   measured CO2-response curves of emissions, CO2-H2O gas exchanges and
   chlorophyll fluorescence at two assay temperatures (30 and 35 degrees C)
   on saplings of four populations grown under normal and double CO2
   concentrations combined with two temperature growth regimes differing by
   5 degrees C (day/night: 25/15 and 30/20 degrees C). A stepwise reduction
   in CO2 resulted in a decrease in emissions, occasionally preceded by an
   increase, with the overall decrease in emissions being greater at 35
   degrees C than at 30 degrees C assay temperature. During ramping to high
   CO2, emissions remained mostly unchanged at 35 degrees C, whereas at 30
   degrees C they often dropped, especially at the highest CO2 levels (>=
   1200 ppm). In addition to the actual leaf temperature, the high CO2
   responsiveness of emissions was modulated by the plant's growth
   temperature with warm-grown plants being more sensitive than cool-grown
   plants. In contrast, growth CO2 had no significant effect on the CO2
   sensitivity of emissions, although it promoted plant growth and the leaf
   emission factor. Correlation analyses suggest that the emission response
   to CO2 depended primarily on the availability of energetic cofactors
   produced by photosynthetic electron transport. This availability was
   likely limited by different processes that occurred during CO2 ramping
   including photooxidative stress and induction of protective and repair
   mechanisms as well as competition with CO2 fixation and
   photorespiration. In addition, feedback inhibition of photosynthesis may
   have played a role, especially in leaves whose emissions were inhibited
   only at very high CO2 levels. Overall, our results confirm an
   isoprene-analogous behavior of monoterpene emissions from holm oak.
   Emissions exhibit a nonlinear response curve to CO2 similar to that
   currently used for isoprene emission in the MEGAN model, with no
   difference between major individual monoterpene species and plant
   chemotype. Simulations estimating the annual VOC releases from holm oak
   leaves at double atmospheric CO2 indicate that the observed high-CO2
   inhibition is unlikely to offset the increase in emissions due to the
   predicted warming.},

Abstract = {Coconut crabs Birgus latro have recently been reclassified from Data
   Deficient to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. This is a somewhat unusual
   case of temporal and spatial information being used to change the IUCN
   status of an arthropod and it draws attention to the paucity of
   biological data on most invertebrate species. To be listed, two or more
   scientific criteria need to be documented but such data are unavailable
   for many invertebrates. This raises the question as to whether certain
   invertebrates receive more scientific attention and are hence more
   likely to be listed if, like the coconut crab, they are large,
   slow-reproducing or a dual-biome species (characteristics which make
   them inherently vulnerable) and whether being an indicator or a flagship
   species is important.},

Abstract = {Large-scale biodiversity monitoring remains a challenge in science and
   policy. `Biodiversity Observation Networks' provide an integrated
   infrastructure for monitoring biodiversity through timely discovery,
   access, and re-use of data, but their establishment relies on an
   in-depth understanding of existing monitoring effort. We performed a
   scoping review and network analysis to assess the scope of available
   data on amphibians and reptiles in the UK and catalogue the mobilisation
   of information across the data landscape, thereby highlighting existing
   gaps. The monitoring portfolio has grown rapidly in recent decades, with
   over three times as many data sources than there are amphibian and
   reptile species in the UK now available. We identified 45 active sources
   of `FAIR' ('Findable', `Accessible', `Interoperable' and `Reusable')
   data. The taxonomic, geographic and temporal coverage of datasets
   appears largely uneven and no single source is currently suitable for
   producing robust multispecies assessments on large scales. A dynamic and
   patchy exchange of data occurs between different recording projects,
   recording communities and digital data platforms. The National
   Biodiversity Network Atlas is a highly connected source but the scope of
   its data (re-)use is potentially limited by insufficient accompanying
   metadata. The emerging complexity and fragmented nature of this dynamic
   data landscape is likely to grow without a concerted effort to integrate
   existing activities. The factors driving this complexity extend beyond
   the UK and to other facets of biodiversity. We recommend integration and
   greater stakeholder collaboration behind a coordinated infrastructure
   for data collection, storage and analysis, capable of delivering
   comprehensive assessments for large-scale biodiversity monitoring.},

   an overview},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 16},
Abstract = {The United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration was announced in 2021
   to highlight the need for collective efforts to revive degraded
   ecosystems. Plant above- and belowground microbiomes are fundamental to
   plant health and ecosystem functioning. Plant aboveground microbiomes
   have received considerably more attention than the belowground
   microbiome, especially in the context of coastal plant restoration.
   Thus, there is fundamental gap in our understanding of the role
   belowground microbiomes play in restoration success in saltmarsh and
   mangrove ecosystems. Here, we outline potential pathways and challenges
   associated with including the belowground microbiome in mangrove and
   saltmarsh restoration via a conceptual framework and an overview of
   current literature. We highlight the large gap of knowledge that exists
   in plant-microbe literature as it pertains to coastal restoration
   warranting future research. More research is needed to significantly
   advance both fundamental and applied knowledge through better
   understanding of the importance of coastal microbiomes to restoration
   success by stakeholders and funding bodies.},

Abstract = {One of the major undetermined problems in evaporation (ET) retrieval
   using thermal infrared remote sensing is the lack of a physically based
   ground heat flux (G) model and its integration within the surface energy
   balance (SEB) equation. Here, we present a novel approach based on
   coupling a thermal inertia (TI)-based mechanistic G model with an
   analytical surface energy balance model, Surface Temperature Initiated
   Closure (STIC, version STIC1.2). The coupled model is named STIC-TI. The
   model is driven by noon-night (13:30 and 01:30 local time) land surface
   temperature, surface albedo, and a vegetation index from MODIS Aqua in
   conjunction with a clear-sky net radiation sub-model and ancillary
   meteorological information. SEB flux estimates from STIC-TI were
   evaluated with respect to the in situ fluxes from eddy covariance
   measurements in diverse ecosystems of contrasting aridity in both the
   Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Sensitivity analysis
   revealed substantial sensitivity of STIC-TI-derived fluxes due to the
   land surface temperature uncertainty. An evaluation of noontime G (Gi)
   estimates showed 12 \%-21 \% error across six flux tower sites, and a
   comparison between STIC-TI versus empirical G models also revealed the
   substantially better performance of the former. While the instantaneous
   noontime net radiation (RNi) and latent heat flux (LEi) were
   overestimated (15 \% and 25 \%), sensible heat flux (Hi) was
   underestimated (22 \%). Overestimation (underestimation) of LEi (Hi) was
   associated with the overestimation of net available energy (RNi-Gi) and
   use of unclosed surface energy balance flux measurements in LEi (Hi)
   validation. The mean percent deviations in Gi and Hi estimates were
   found to be strongly correlated with satellite day-night view angle
   difference in parabolic and linear pattern, and a relatively weak
   correlation was found between day-night view angle difference versus LEi
   deviation. Findings from this parameter-sparse coupled G-ET model can
   make a valuable contribution to mapping and monitoring the
   spatiotemporal variability of ecosystem water stress and evaporation
   using noon-night thermal infrared observations from future Earth
   observation satellite missions such as TRISHNA, LSTM, and SBG.},

Title = {Marine Vegetation Management Strategies: a framework for estuary wide
   prioritization of protection and rehabilitation},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 NOV 16},
Abstract = {Intertidal systems are constrained by landscape morphology. Where these
   systems do occur, they often experience a wide range of anthropogenic
   impacts, further exacerbated by sea-level rise (SLR). By mapping natural
   morphological constraints, anthropogenic impacts and modeled SLR, at an
   estuary-wide scale the Marine Vegetation Management Strategies (MVMS)
   identify and prioritize sites and interventions that could address key
   threats and risks to the system enabling rehabilitation. Development of
   MVMS is part of an initiative within the broader New South Wales (NSW)
   state government's Marine Estate Management Strategy to deliver healthy
   coastal habitats. The MVMS are being developed to take a policy of ``no
   net loss of key fish habitats{''} toward more active management of
   intertidal systems that maximize and sustain the ecosystem values and
   services. Spatial indicators were developed for a pilot estuary (Tweed
   River) to map and quantify ``macrophyte potential{''} which is defined
   as the capacity for macrophytes (mangrove and saltmarsh) to deliver
   ecosystem services now and into the future (under scenarios of SLR). The
   approach incorporates datasets which indicate the geophysical nature of
   the landscape, anthropogenic exposure, and vulnerability to SLR. This
   strategic science-based approach is being rolled out across coastal NSW,
   with the mapping products and associated resources identified as key
   tools to assist in the adopting of a more integrated approach to
   managing coastal wetlands.},

Abstract = {Metabolic activities in estuaries, especially these of large rivers,
   profoundly affect the downstream coastal biogeochemistry. Here, we
   unravel the impacts of large industrial port facilities, showing that
   elevated metabolic activity in the Hamburg port (Germany) increases
   total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) runoff to the
   North Sea. The imports of particulate inorganic carbon, particulate
   organic carbon, and particulate organic nitrogen (PIC, POC, and PON)
   from the upstream Elbe River can fuel up to 90 \% of the TA generated in
   the entire estuary via calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution. The
   remaining at least 10 \% of TA generation can be attributed to anaerobic
   metabolic processes such as denitrification of remineralized PON or
   other pathways. The Elbe Estuary as a whole adds approximately 15 \% to
   the overall DIC and TA runoff. Both the magnitude and partitioning among
   these processes appear to be sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic
   changes. Thus, with increased TA loads, the coastal ocean (in
   particular) would act as a stronger CO2 sink, resulting in changes to
   the overall coastal system's capacity to store CO2.},

Title = {Pore network modeling as a new tool for determining gas diffusivity in

Abstract = {Peatlands are globally significant carbon stocks and may become major
   sources of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide and methane in a
   changing climate and under anthropogenic management pressure. Diffusion
   is the dominant gas transport mechanism in peat; therefore, a proper
   knowledge of the soil gas diffusion coefficient is important for the
   estimation of GHG emissions from peatlands. Pore network modeling (PNM)
   is a potential tool for the determination of gas diffusivity in peat, as
   it explicitly connects the peat microstructure and the characteristics
   of the peat pore network to macroscopic gas transport properties. In the
   present work, we extracted macropore networks from three-dimensional
   X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat samples and
   simulated gas diffusion in these networks using PNM. These results were
   compared to the soil gas diffusion coefficients determined from the same
   samples in the laboratory using the diffusion chamber method. The
   measurements and simulations were conducted for peat samples from three
   depths. The soil gas diffusion coefficients were determined under
   varying water contents adjusted in a pressure plate apparatus. We also
   assessed the applicability of commonly used gas diffusivity models to
   peat. The laboratory measurements showed a decrease in gas diffusivity
   with depth due to a decrease in air-filled porosity and pore space
   connectivity. However, gas diffusivity was not extremely low close to
   saturation, which may indicate that the structure of the macropore
   network is such that it enables the presence of connected diffusion
   pathways through the peat matrix, even in wet conditions. The
   traditional gas diffusivity models were not very successful in
   predicting the soil gas diffusion coefficient. This may indicate that
   the microstructure of peat differs considerably from the structure of
   mineral soils and other kinds of porous materials for which these models
   have been constructed and calibrated. By contrast, the pore network
   simulations reproduced the laboratory-determined soil gas diffusion
   coefficients rather well. Thus, the combination of the mu CT and PNM
   methods may offer a promising alternative to the traditional estimation
   of soil gas diffusivity through laboratory measurements.},

Abstract = {Assessing landscape connectivity allows defining the degree to which the
   landscape facilitates or impedes the movement of a species between
   resource patches. In this phase of climate change and biodiversity
   crisis, maintaining landscape connectivity by restoring and protecting
   connecting areas and corridors is a key strategy to ensure the survival
   of many species. The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a freshwater top
   predator that is slowly recovering after a dramatic decline occurred in
   central and southern Europe in the last century. To assess the chances
   of otter recolonization of the western Alps, we analyzed environmental
   connectivity by applying electrical circuit theory to an expert-based
   resistance surface using the Circuitscape software. The study area
   included southeastern France, northwestern Italy, and Switzerland. We
   produced a cumulative current flow map and a gap analysis was also
   conducted to highlight the ``conservation gaps{''} for optimal
   corridors. The results revealed that the orography of the landscape was
   the main factor influencing the quantity and quality of the pathways in
   the western Alpine landscapes. As main corridors were concentrated on
   valley bottoms, human pressure could severely diminish animal movement.
   Despite this, some heavily populated areas showed high connectivity
   values. Some important pathways did not fall within protected areas,
   potentially hindering otter dispersal and highlighting the need to
   expand the system of protected areas in the Alpine arc. Recolonization
   of Alpine territories by otters can therefore only occur if connectivity
   and environmental suitability combine to ensure the animals' survival
   over time.},

Title = {An evaluation of freshwater monitoring programs in ILTER nodes and

Abstract = {Identifying and quantifying global change impacts on biotic and abiotic
   components of ecosystems is critical to promote an effective adaptation
   that increases the success of conservation strategies. To achieve this
   goal, global and regional assessment efforts require certain degree of
   harmonization on local monitoring programs to establish relevant
   comparisons at different spatio-temporal scales. Otherwise, the lack of
   harmonization might hinder the detection and assessment on the effects
   of human impacts. In this work we have compiled information on
   freshwater monitoring programs located in areas of intensive research
   and conservation interest: International Long Term Ecological Research
   (ILTER) nodes and mountain National Parks. We aimed at evaluating the
   quality and robustness of these programs to assess the impact of global
   change, addressing from the worldwide to the European and Spanish
   national scale. Results highlighted that freshwater monitoring programs
   lack a common strategy to monitor these ecosystems. Even at the
   continental and national scales, contrasting strategies and level of
   detail have been historically applied. Water quality, habitat and
   biodiversity are more commonly monitored than community structure and
   ecosystem functioning. Monitoring efforts on the Spanish Mountain
   National parks indicated differences on the targeted aquatic ecosystems.
   Rivers and lakes received a higher attention, while mires were rarely
   considered. Our results provide evidence that greater efforts should be
   directed towards constructing a coordinated strategy to monitor
   freshwater ecosystems at national, continental, and global scales. This
   strategy should involve a shared backbone of biophysical and
   biogeochemical variables for each habitat type on agreed protocols that
   are implemented across regions and administrative borders. Achieving
   this will support a substantial advance on the ecological research to
   further delineate proper conservation strategies to face the challenges
   imposed by global change.},

Abstract = {Electroautotrophic microorganisms have attracted great attention since
   they exhibit a new type of primary production. Here, in situ
   electrochemical cultivation was conducted using the naturally occurring
   electromotive forces at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The voltage and
   current generation originating from the resulting microbial activity was
   observed for 12 days of deployment, with fluctuation in response to
   tidal cycles. A novel bacterium belonging to the genus Thiomicrorhabdus
   dominated the microbial community specifically enriched on the cathode.
   Metagenomic analysis provided the draft genome of the bacterium and the
   gene repertoire indicated that the bacterium has the potential for
   thio-autotrophic growth, which is a typical physiological feature of the
   members of the genus, while the bacterium had a unique gene cluster
   encoding multi-heme cytochrome c proteins responsible for extracellular
   electron transfer. Herein, we propose this bacterium as a new species,
   specifically enriched during electricity generation, as `Candidatus
   Thiomicrorhabdus electrophagus'. This finding suggests the natural
   occurrence of electrosynthetic microbial populations using the
   geoelectricity in deep-sea hydrothermal environments.},

Abstract = {In ``The Effects of Plant Compensatory Regrowth and Induced Resistance
   on Herbivore Population Dynamics,{''} which appeared in The American
   Naturalist in 2016, Stieha et al. argued that overcompensatory regrowth
   of plant tissues lost to herbivory ({''}overcompensation{''}) promotes
   cyclic herbivore outbreaks. In contrast, they concluded that partial
   regrowth ({''}tolerance{''}) stabilizes herbivore dynamics, preventing
   outbreaks. These conclusions were based on a comparison between two
   plant-herbivore models that differed in two properties: (1) whether
   biomass could ever be higher after herbivory and regrowth than before
   herbivory (i.e., is overcompensatory regrowth possible?) and (2) how
   much herbivory the plants could withstand before only being able to
   partially compensate for losses (for overcompensating plants, there was
   a threshold herbivory level above which this occurred, whereas tolerant
   plants always showed partial compensation). While Stieha et al. supposed
   that difference 1 was responsible for the increased propensity for
   outbreaks in their overcompensation model, we show here that, in fact,
   difference 2 is responsible. Thus, we conclude that Stieha et al.'s
   results about ``overcompensating{''} plants apply more broadly: the risk
   of herbivore outbreaks is elevated whenever plants with low-enough
   herbivore loads can perfectly compensate or overcompensate for losses to
   herbivory.},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Determining how and how often asexual lineages emerge within sexual
   species is central to our understanding of sex-asex transitions and the
   long-term maintenance of sex. Asexuality can arise ``by transmission{''}
   from an existing asexual lineage to a new one through different types of
   crosses. The occurrence of these crosses, cryptic sex, variations in
   ploidy, and recombination within asexuals greatly complicates the study
   of sex-asex transitions, as they preclude the use of standard
   phylogenetic methods and genetic distance metrics. In this study we show
   how to overcome these challenges by developing new approaches to
   investigate the origin of the various asexual lineages of the brine
   shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica. We use a large sample of asexuals,
   including all known polyploids, and their sexual relatives. We combine
   flow cytometry with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. We develop new
   genetic distance measures and methods to compare various scenarios
   describing the origin of the different lineages. We find that all
   diploid and polyploid A. parthenogenetica likely arose within the past
   80,000 years through successive and nested hybridization events that
   involved backcrosses with different sexual species. All A.
   parthenogenetica have the same common ancestor and therefore likely
   carry the same asexuality gene(s) and reproduce by automixis. These
   findings radically change our view of sex-asex transitions in this group
   and show the importance of considering scenarios of asexuality by
   transmission. The methods developed are applicable to many other asexual
   taxa.},

Title = {Planting time, first-year mowing, and seed mix design influence
   ecological outcomes in agroecosystem revegetation projects},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The conversion of tallgrass prairie to agriculture has negatively
   affected provisioning of ecosystem services. Successful restoration of
   ecosystem services could depend on management decisions applied during
   revegetation projects. We examined the effects of three management
   decisions (seed mix design, planting time, and first-year mowing) on
   targeted ecosystem services (erosion control, weed resistance, and
   pollinator resources). We tested three seed mixes of varying diversity
   and grass-to-forb seeding ratios: Economy mix (21 species, 3:1
   grass:forb), Pollinator mix (38 species, 1:3), and Diversity mix (71
   species, 1:1). We established plots at two planting times
   (dormant-season and spring) with or without first-year mowing. To assess
   ecosystem services, we measured stem density, canopy cover, and floral
   density and richness of sown species in the second year after planting.
   The Economy mix had the highest stem density and cover but lowest floral
   density and richness. The Pollinator mix had the lowest stem density and
   cover but highest floral density. The Diversity mix had comparable stem
   density and cover to the Economy mix and comparable floral density and
   richness to the Pollinator mix. Mowing accelerated native plant
   establishment in all seed mixes. Dormant-season planting improved
   establishment of spring and fall forbs and favored cool-season
   graminoids over warm-season grasses. All three management decisions
   influenced ecosystem outcomes, and comparison to a previous study
   revealed these effects to be robust to variation in site and climatic
   conditions. We recommend a diverse, balanced seed mix design, first-year
   mowing, and dormant-season planting to improve multifunctionality of
   conservation projects.},

Title = {The past, present, and potential future of phosphorus management in the
   Florida Everglades},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Florida Everglades, the largest subtropical wetland in North
   America, is in the midst of one of the most comprehensive and expensive
   environmental restoration efforts in history. Over the past 150 years,
   the Everglades has suffered substantial degradation due to massive
   drainage projects, polluting agricultural practices, and urban
   population growth. Decades of scientific investigation have shown that
   phosphorus (P) pollution is a primary driver of this environmental
   decline. This paper reviews how and why specific P-management goals and
   strategies have been adopted in support of Everglades restoration,
   focusing on the often-contentious process for converting science into
   restoration policies and standards. We synthesize current P-management
   successes, failures, and tradeoffs, including the challenge of balancing
   multiple hydrologic and water quality restoration goals with the
   priorities and values of a diverse group of stakeholders. We then
   highlight promising future directions for Everglades P policy and
   propose questions to help guide the discussion of future restoration
   priorities and research needs in this and other complex
   social-ecological systems. The overall goals of this review are thus
   twofold: (1) to support an in-depth understanding of the past, present,
   and potential future of P management approaches in this globally unique
   social-ecological system; and (2) to provide a broader framework for
   understanding how the coevolution of science and policy can support or
   undermine large-scale ecosystem restoration.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This special issue is a compilation of studies arising from the
   activities of the 5-year Australian Research Council Industrial
   Transformation Training Centre for Mine Site Restoration. Research
   conducted by the Centre involved disciplines often overlooked or
   under-resourced in the mining industry including restoration genetics,
   seed technology and enablement, rare species management, and restoration
   ecophysiology. These studies then formed the context for development of
   an additional focus on mining closure policy development. The programs
   highlight the critical importance of ensuring that the seed supply
   chain, plant growth media, and restoration technologies are
   fit-for-purpose, that native fauna are considered in the life-of-mine
   and, how collectively, investment in these types of programs can inform
   effective mine closure planning. Though Australian-based, the principles
   and outcomes of the research are applicable to international mining
   activities operating in natural or seminatural ecosystems or regions of
   high biodiversity.},

Abstract = {With a changing climate, it is becoming increasingly critical
   tounderstand vegetation responses to limiting environmental factors.
   Here, weinvestigate the spatial and temporal patterns of light and water
   limitationon photosynthesis using an observational framework. Our study
   is unique incharacterizing the nonlinear relationships between
   photosynthesis and waterand light, acknowledging approximately two
   regime behaviours (no limitationand varying degrees of limitation). It
   is also unique in using anobservational framework instead of using
   model-derived photosynthesisproperties. We combine data from three
   different satellite sensors, i.e.,sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
   (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), surface
   soilmoisture from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) microwave
   radiometer, and vegetation greenness from the ModerateResolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We find bothsingle-regime and two-regime
   models describe SIF sensitivity to soilmoisture and photosynthetically
   active radiation (PAR) across the globe. Thedistribution and strength of
   soil moisture limitation on SIF are mapped inthe water-limited
   environments, while the distribution and strength of PARlimitations are
   mapped in the energy-limited environments. A two-regimebehaviour is
   detected in 73 \% of the cases for water limitation onphotosynthesis,
   while two-regime detection is much lower at 41 \% for light limitation
   on photosynthesis. SIF sensitivity to PAR strongly increasesalong
   moisture gradients, reflecting mesic vegetation's adaptation to
   makingrapid usage of incoming light availability on the weekly
   timescales. Thetransition point detected between the two regimes is
   connected to soil typeand mean annual precipitation for the SIF-soil
   moisture relationship and forthe SIF-PAR relationship. These thresholds
   therefore have an explicitrelation to properties of the landscape,
   although they may also be relatedto finer details of the vegetation and
   soil interactions not resolved by thespatial scales here. The simple
   functions and thresholds are emergentbehaviours capturing the
   interaction of many processes. The observationalthresholds and strength
   of coupling can be used as benchmark information forEarth system models,
   especially those that characterize gross primaryproduction mechanisms
   and vegetation dynamics.},

Abstract = {Soil fertility and plant productivity are globallyconstrained by N
   availability. Proteins are the largest N reservoir in soils,and the
   cleavage of proteins into small peptides and amino acids has beenshown
   to be the rate-limiting step in the terrestrial N cycle. However, weare
   still lacking a profound understanding of the environmental controls
   ofthis process. Here we show that integrated effects of climate and
   soilgeochemistry drive protein cleavage across large scales. We measured
   grossprotein depolymerization rates in mineral and organic soils sampled
   across a4000 km long European transect covering a wide range of
   climates, geologiesand land uses. Based on structural equation models we
   identified that soilorganic N cycling was strongly controlled by
   substrate availability, e.g., bysoil protein content. Soil geochemistry
   was a secondary predictor, bycontrolling protein stabilization
   mechanisms and protein availability.Precipitation was identified as the
   main climatic control on proteindepolymerization, by affecting soil
   weathering and soil organic matteraccumulation. In contrast, land use
   was a poor predictor of proteindepolymerization. Our results highlight
   the need to consider geology andprecipitation effects on soil
   geochemistry when estimating and predictingsoil N cycling at large
   scales.},

Abstract = {The Kilianstollen Marsberg (Rhenish Massif, Germany) has been
   extensively mined for copper ores, dating from early medieval period
   until 1945. The exposed organic-rich alum shale rocks influenced by the
   diverse mine drainages at an ambient temperature of 10 degrees C could
   naturally enrich biogeochemically distinct heavy metal resistant
   microbiota. This amplicon-sequence-based study evaluates the microbially
   colonized subterranean rocks of the abandoned copper mine Kilianstollen
   to characterize the colonization patterns and biogeochemical pathways of
   individual microbial groups. Under the selective pressure of the heavy
   metal contaminated environment at illuminated sites, Chloroflexi
   (Ktedonobacteria) and Cyanobacteria (Oxyphotobacteria) build up
   whitish-greenish biofilms In contrast, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and
   Actinobacteria dominate rocks around the uncontaminated spring water
   streams. The additional metagenomic analysis revealed that the heavy
   metal resistant microbiome was evidently involved in redox cycling of
   transition metals (Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, Cd, Hg). No deposition of
   metals or minerals, though, was observed by transmission electron
   microscopy in Ktedonobacteria biofilms which may be indicative for the
   presence of different detoxification pathways. The underlying heavy
   metal resistance mechanisms, as revealed by analysis of
   metagenome-assembled genomes, were mainly attributed to transition metal
   efflux pumps, redox enzymes, volatilization of Hg, methylated
   intermediates of As3+, and reactive oxygen species detoxification
   pathways.},

Abstract = {Vegetation phenology, which refers to the seasonal changes in plant
   physiology, biomass and plant cover, is affected by many abiotic
   factors, such as precipitation, temperature and water availability.
   Phenology is also associated with the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange
   between ecosystems and the atmosphere. We employed digital cameras to
   monitor the vegetation phenology of three northern boreal peatlands
   during five growing seasons. We derived a greenness index (green
   chromatic coordinate, GCC) from the images and combined the results with
   measurements of CO2 flux, air temperature and high-resolution satellite
   data (Sentinel-2). From the digital camera images it was possible to
   extract greenness dynamics on the vegetation community and even species
   level. The highest GCC and daily maximum gross photosynthetic production
   (GPP(max)) were observed at the site with the highest nutrient
   availability and richest vegetation. The short-term temperature response
   of GCC depended on temperature and varied among the sites and months.
   Although the seasonal development and year-to-year variation in GCC and
   GPP(max) showed consistent patterns, the shortterm variation in GPP(max)
   was explained by GCC only during limited periods. GCC clearly indicated
   the main phases of the growing season, and peatland vegetation showed
   capability to fully compensate for the impaired growth resulting from a
   late growing season start. The GCC data derived from Sentinel-2 and
   digital cameras showed similar seasonal courses, but a reliable timing
   of different phenological phases depended upon the temporal coverage of
   satellite data.},

Abstract = {Alpine peatlands are recognized as a major natural contributor to the
   budgets of atmospheric methane (CH4) but as a weak nitrous oxide (N2O)
   source. Anthropogenic activities and climate change have put these
   fragile nitrogen (N)-limited peatlands under pressure by altering water
   table (WT) levels and enhancing N deposition. The response of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions from these peatlands to these changes is uncertain.
   To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in
   2018 and 2019 investigating individual and interactive effects of three
   WT levels (WT-30, 30 cm below soil surface; WT0, 0 cm at the soil
   surface; WT10, 10 cm above soil surface) and multiple levels of N
   deposition (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 kgNha(-1)yr(-1)) on growing season CH4
   and N2O emissions in the Zoige alpine peatland, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   We found that the elevated WT levels increased CH4 emissions, while N
   deposition had nonlinear effects (with stimulation at moderate levels
   but inhibition at higher levels). In contrast no clear pattern of the
   effect of WT levels on the cumulative N2O emissions was evident, while N
   deposition led to a consistent and linear increase (emission factor: 2.3
   \%-2.8 \%), and this was dependent on the WT levels. Given the current N
   deposition in the Zoige alpine peatland (1.08-17.81 kgNha(-1)), our
   results suggested that the CH4 and N2O emissions from the alpine
   peatlands could greatly increase in response to the possible doubling N
   deposition in the future. We believe that our results provide insights
   into how interactions between climate change and human disturbance will
   alter CH4 and N2O emissions from this globally important habitat.},

Title = {Direct seeding versus seedling planting: survival, biomass, growth, and

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Seedling planting (SP) and direct seeding (DS) are the most used methods
   of tropical tree propagation. We compared the performance of SP and DS
   plants of four seasonal tropical species over 6 years, considering
   survival, growth, above and belowground biomass, and the costs of
   planting and maintenance. We planted 48 pairs of SP and DS plants of
   Amburana cearensis, Astronium fraxinifolium, Copaifera langsdorffii, and
   Tabebuia aurea spaced 2 x 1 m. To evaluate biomass allocation, we dug up
   5 individuals of each species after 12 and 30 months. We measured
   survival and height at the time of planting, and at 12, 30, and 68
   months. We modeled differences in survival, biomass allocation, and
   height over time. We calculated costs per surviving tree and the
   cost-effectiveness (survival x height increment/cost). Survival was high
   (average 85\%) and it did not differ between planting method for three
   species; while Astronium showed higher survival via DS (94 vs. 73\% SP).
   Only Amburana presented a higher total biomass in SP than in DS (1.066
   vs. 310 g). SP plants of Copaifera and Tabebuia grew taller (1.72 vs.
   1.16 m, 1.80 vs. 0.85 m, respectively) than the DS plants. Total cost
   per surviving tree for DS trees was two times lower than for SP (US\$
   1.33 vs. 2.57). Three species were more cost-effective via DS. The
   higher effectiveness of DS can be explained by the high survival and
   establishment rate of DS plants, dismissing the need for the several
   steps related to planting seedlings.},

Abstract = {River sediments falling dry at low water levels are sources of CO2  to
   the atmosphere. While the general relevance of CO2  emissions from dry
   sediments has been acknowledged and some regulatory mechanisms have been
   identified, knowledge on mechanisms and temporal dynamics is still
   sparse. Using a combination of high-frequency measurements and two field
   campaigns we thus aimed to identify processes responsible for CO2 
   emissions and to assess temporal dynamics of CO2  emissions from dry
   sediments at a large German river. CO2  emissions were largely driven by
   microbial respiration in the sediment. Observed CO2 fluxes could be
   explained by patterns and responses of sediment respiration rates
   measured in laboratory incubations. We exclude groundwater as a
   significant source of CO2  because the CO2  concentration in the
   groundwater was too low to explain CO2  fluxes. Furthermore, CO2  fluxes
   were not related to radon fluxes, which we used to trace
   groundwater-derived degassing of CO2 . CO2  emissions were strongly
   regulated by temperature resulting in large diurnal fluctuations of CO2
   emissions with emissions peaking during the day. The diurnal
   temperature-CO2 flux relation exhibited a hysteresis which highlights
   the effect of transport processes in the sediment and makes it difficult
   to identify temperature dependence from simple linear regressions. The
   temperature response of CO2 flux and sediment respiration rates in
   laboratory incubations was identical. Also deeper sediment layers
   apparently contributed to CO2 emissions because the CO2 flux was
   correlated with the thickness of the unsaturated zone, resulting in CO2
   fluxes increasing with distance to the local groundwater level and with
   distance to the river. Rain events lowered CO2 emissions from dry river
   sediments probably by blocking CO2 transport from deeper sediment layers
   to the atmosphere. Terrestrial vegetation growing on exposed sediments
   greatly increased respiratory sediment CO2 emissions. We conclude that
   the regulation of CO2 emissions from dry river sediments is complex.
   Diurnal measurements are mandatory and even CO2 uptake in the dark by
   phototrophic micro-organisms has to be considered when assessing the
   impact of dry sediments on CO2 emissions from rivers.},

Abstract = {The response of soil carbon represents one of the key uncertainties in
   future climate change. The ability of Earth system models (ESMs) to
   simulate present-day soil carbon is therefore vital for reliably
   estimating global carbon budgets required for Paris Agreement targets.
   In this study CMIP6 ESMs are evaluated against empirical datasets to
   assess the ability of each model to simulate soil carbon and related
   controls: net primary productivity (NPP) and soil carbon turnover time
   (tau(s)). Comparing CMIP6 with the previous generation of models
   (CMIP5), a lack of consistency in modelled soil carbon remains,
   particularly the underestimation of northern high-latitude soil carbon
   stocks. There is a robust improvement in the simulation of NPP in CMIP6
   compared with CMIP5; however, an unrealistically high correlation with
   soil carbon stocks remains, suggesting the potential for an
   overestimation of the long-term terrestrial carbon sink. Additionally,
   the same improvements are not seen in the simulation of tau(s). These
   results suggest that much of the uncertainty associated with modelled
   soil carbon stocks can be attributed to the simulation of below-ground
   processes, and greater emphasis is required on improving the
   representation of below-ground soil processes in future developments of
   models. These improvements would help to reduce the uncertainty in
   projected carbon release from global soils under climate change and to
   increase confidence in the carbon budgets associated with different
   levels of global warming.},

Abstract = {Coupled physical-biogeochemical models can fill the spatial and temporal
   gap in ocean carbon observations. Challenges of applying a coupled
   physical-biogeochemical model in the regional ocean include the
   reasonable prescription of carbon model boundary conditions, lack of in
   situ observations, and the oversimplification of certain biogeochemical
   processes. In this study, we applied a coupled physical-biogeochemical
   model (Regional Ocean Modelling System, ROMS) to the Gulf of Mexico
   (GoM) and achieved an unprecedented 20-year high-resolution (5 km, 1/22
   degrees) hindcast covering the period of 2000 to 2019. The
   biogeochemical model incorporated the dynamics of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) pools and the formation and dissolution of carbonate
   minerals. The biogeochemical boundaries were interpolated from NCAR's
   CESM2-WACCM-FV2 solution after evaluating the performance of 17 GCMs in
   the GoM waters. Model outputs included carbon system variables of wide
   interest, such as pCO(2), pH, aragonite saturation state (Omega(Arag)),
   calcite saturation state (Omega(Calc)), CO2 air-sea flux, and carbon
   burial rate. The model's robustness is evaluated via extensive
   model-data comparison against buoys, remote-sensingbased machine
   learning (ML) products, and ship-based measurements. A reassessment of
   air-sea CO2 flux with previous modeling and observational studies gives
   us confidence that our model provides a robust and updated CO2 flux
   estimation, and NGoM is a stronger carbon sink than previously reported.
   Model results reveal that the GoM water has been experiencing a similar
   to 0.0016 yr(-1) decrease in surface pH over the past 2 decades,
   accompanied by a similar to 1.66 mu atm yr(-1) increase in sea surface
   pCO(2). The air-sea CO2 exchange estimation confirms in accordance with
   several previous models and ocean surface pCO(2) observations that the
   river-dominated northern GoM (NGoM) is a substantial carbon sink, and
   the open GoM is a carbon source during summer and a carbon sink for the
   rest of the year. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to evaluate the
   impacts of river inputs and the global ocean via model boundaries. The
   NGoM carbon system is directly modified by the enormous carbon inputs
   (similar to 15.5 Tg C yr(-1) DIC and similar to 2.3 Tg C yr(-1) DOC)
   from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System (MARS). Additionally,
   nutrient-stimulated biological activities create a similar to 105 times
   higher particulate organic matter burial rate in NGoM sediment than in
   the case without river-delivered nutrients. The carbon system condition
   of the open ocean is driven by inputs from the Caribbean Sea via the
   Yucatan Channel and is affected more by thermal effects than biological
   factors.},

Abstract = {Global initiatives to reforest degraded areas have intensified in recent
   years, arising from advances in agricultural frontiers that mainly alter
   natural landscapes and suppress vegetation. However, little is known
   about the influence of agricultural landscapes on the re-establishment
   of groups that perform key ecosystem services in restoration areas, such
   as pollination and pest control. Using trap nest methodology, we aimed
   to evaluate how aspects of the landscape influence the abundance,
   richness, diversity, and composition of trap-nesting bees and wasps as
   well as their natural enemies in restored areas located within highly
   managed landscapes. Samplings were conducted monthly from August 2018 to
   August 2019 in nine reforested areas of Seasonal Semideciduous forest
   older than 15 years. We found evidence of a negative influence of
   monoculture area (i.e., surrounding soybean/corn agriculture) on the
   abundance of wasps and their natural enemies, indicating a preference
   for more heterogeneous landscapes, possibly related to the greater
   availability of prey and lesser edge effect in this type of landscape.
   Bee diversity indicates a negative relationship with increasing distance
   from the edge of reforestation to the edges of the nearest forest
   fragment. Our results also suggest that some bee and wasp species are
   more affected by habitat loss than other species in general, which was
   indicated by a change in community composition. We conclude that the
   nesting of solitary bees and wasps in reforested areas was influenced by
   characteristics of the surrounding landscape, which should be considered
   in restoration projects to maximize the effectiveness of ecological
   services such as pollination and predation.},

Abstract = {The severe biodiversity decline in European agricultural landscapes
   demands a specific evaluation of the various land-use practices. Many
   butterflies in Europe, as an important ecological indicator and
   pollinator taxon, require human interventions to sustain their
   populations in cultivated landscapes. However, land-use changes and
   management intensification are currently responsible for their decline.
   In this study, we compare butterfly communities occurring on 93 sites in
   seven widely distributed land-use types, viz. extensive meadows and
   pastures, semi-intensive meadows, vineyards, arable land, settlements
   and apple orchards. We recorded a high butterfly diversity in supposedly
   high nature-conservation value (HNV) grasslands (extensive meadows and
   pastures). All other land-use types showed significantly lower
   diversity, with decreasing diversity from semi-intensive meadows to
   apple orchards. Moreover, functional traits uncovered a general trend:
   extensive grasslands supported communities of more specialized and
   sedentary species whilst all other non-HNV land-use types showed
   communities characterized by mobile generalists. Community composition
   was driven by the land-use type and explained by plant-based indicator
   values for nutrients and light and temperature variables. Important
   life-history traits further correlated with site variables confirming
   the shift from specialists to generalists along increasing land-use
   intensity gradients and the effect of the thermal environment on
   phenological traits. We found supporting evidence for the effectiveness
   of regional Agri-Environmental Measures for butterfly conservation in
   European cultural landscapes and for the European conservation schemes
   to focus at least partly on the preservation of HNV grasslands with
   extensive management. Furthermore, we clearly show the poor ecological
   state of butterfly communities in more disturbed land-use types
   (including urban areas) and propose adopting measures to improve
   butterflies' conservation in these environments.},

Abstract = {Protected areas (PA) in biodiversity hotspots face the challenge of
   monitoring large numbers of locally rare and threatened plant species at
   times with limited budgets. Prioritising species according to their
   local extinction risk could help PA managers to decide which species to
   monitor. However, there is often very little information available on
   the species occurrence and extinction risk in the PA. Because of this,
   PA managers often rely on the national or global Red List for
   prioritising species at the PA level. Here, we evaluate the
   effectiveness of using the Red List for species prioritisation and
   examine the robustness of extinction probability equations for 74 fynbos
   species in Table Mountain National Park (TMNP). We conducted in-field
   surveys to verify the persistence of subpopulations previously recorded,
   following a detection protocol adapted for rare and cryptic plant
   species. We found that most targeted species were extant within TMNP but
   with a substantially reduced number of subpopulations. Twenty-six
   species only had one or two subpopulations remaining. Critically
   Endangered (CR) species lost on average 4 subpopulations more than Least
   Concern (LC) species. However, species persistence in TMNP was largely
   independent of their Red List status. Half of the species represented by
   just one or two subpopulations were listed as LC. This work shows that
   prioritising monitoring according to the Red List status is not
   appropriate at the scale of the individual PA. We suggest that more
   in-field data and monitoring is required to prevent extinctions
   occurring in PAs.},

Abstract = {The ecological theory of adaptive radiation has profoundly shaped our
   conceptualization of the rules that govern diversification. However,
   while many radiations follow classic early-burst patterns of
   diversification as they fill ecological space, the longer-term fates of
   these radiations depend on many factors, such as climatic stability. In
   systems with periodic disturbances, species-rich clades can contain
   nested adaptive radiations of subclades with their own distinct
   diversification histories, and how adaptive radiation theory applies in
   these cases is less clear. Here, we investigated patterns of ecological
   and phenotypic diversification within two iterative adaptive radiations
   of cryonotothenioid fishes in Antarctica's Southern Ocean: crocodile
   icefishes and notoperches. For both clades, we observe evidence of
   repeated diversification into disparate regions of trait space between
   closely related taxa and into overlapping regions of trait space between
   distantly related taxa. We additionally find little evidence that
   patterns of ecological divergence are correlated with evolution of
   morphological disparity, suggesting that these axes of divergence may
   not be tightly linked. Finally, we reveal evidence of repeated
   convergence in sympatry that suggests niche complementarity. These
   findings reflect the dynamic history of Antarctic marine habitats and
   may guide hypotheses of diversification dynamics in environments
   characterized by periodic disturbance.},

Title = {Spatial Synchrony of Diving Waterbirds Populations in Continental
   Wetlands of the Iberian Region},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Spatial population synchrony is a key aspect in ecology. Normally, three
   mechanisms have been identified to explain similar temporal variations
   in abundance between spatially separated populations: Moran effect,
   trophic interactions and dispersal. We analysed the spatial synchrony of
   the abundance of five diving waterfowl species (White-Headed Duck,
   Black-Necked Grebe, Red-Crested Pochard, Common Pochard and Common Coot)
   by conducting a monthly census from October 2013 to September 2019 in 34
   lakes located in Central Spain. Twenty-eight independent variables
   related to the hydroperiod, anthropogenic impacts, landscape and
   structural variables were tested in relation to temporal patterns.
   Synchronised lakes groups were identified for all species, with
   differential associations with variables. The variables associated with
   spatial synchrony were: Distance between lakes (White-Headed Duck and
   Common Pochard); Natural vegetation area in lakes (Red-Crested Pochard)
   and Accumulated precipitation until the breeding season (Common Pochard
   and Common Coot). For Black-Necked Grebe, no variable was associated
   with the observed temporal patterns. These results provide the first
   evidence for the mechanisms behind the spatio-temporal synchronisation
   of diving waterbirds populations in the central Iberian region.},

Title = {Marine bacteroidetes use a conserved enzymatic cascade to digest diatom

Abstract = {The polysaccharide beta-mannan, which is common in terrestrial plants
   but unknown in microalgae, was recently detected during diatom blooms.
   We identified a beta-mannan polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) in
   the genome of the marine flavobacterium Muricauda sp. MAR\_2010\_75.
   Proteomics showed beta-mannan induced translation of 22 proteins encoded
   within the PUL. Biochemical and structural analyses deduced the
   enzymatic cascade for beta-mannan utilization. A conserved GH26
   beta-mannanase with endo-activity depolymerized the beta-mannan.
   Consistent with the biochemistry, X-ray crystallography showed the
   typical TIM-barrel fold of related enzymes found in terrestrial
   beta-mannan degraders. Structural and biochemical analyses of a second
   GH26 allowed the prediction of an exo-activity on shorter manno-gluco
   oligosaccharides. Further analysis demonstrated
   exo-alpha-1,6-galactosidase- and endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity of the
   PUL-encoded GH27 and GH5\_26, respectively, indicating the target
   substrate is a galactoglucomannan. Epitope deletion assays with
   mannanases as analytic tools indicate the presence of beta-mannan in the
   diatoms Coscinodiscus wailesii and Chaetoceros affinis. Mannanases from
   the PUL were active on diatom beta-mannan and polysaccharide extracts
   sampled during a microalgal bloom at the North Sea. Together these
   results demonstrate that marine microorganisms use a conserved enzymatic
   cascade to degrade beta-mannans of marine and terrestrial origin and
   that this metabolic pathway plays a role in marine carbon cycling.},

Title = {Basin-scale biogeography of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 ecotype
   replication},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Establishing links between microbial diversity and environmental
   processes requires resolving the high degree of functional variation
   among closely related lineages or ecotypes. Here, we implement and
   validate an improved metagenomic approach that estimates the spatial
   biogeography and environmental regulation of ecotype-specific
   replication patterns (R-Obs) across ocean regions. A total of 719
   metagenomes were analyzed from meridional Bio-GO-SHIP sections in the
   Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Accounting for sequencing bias and anchoring
   replication estimates in genome structure were critical for identifying
   physiologically relevant biological signals. For example, ecotypes
   within the dominant marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus exhibited
   distinct diel cycles in R-Obs that peaked between 19:00-22:00.
   Additionally, both Prochlorococcus ecotypes and ecotypes within the
   highly abundant heterotroph Pelagibacter (SAR11) demonstrated systematic
   biogeographies in R-Obs that differed from spatial patterns in relative
   abundance. Finally, R-Obs was significantly regulated by nutrient stress
   and temperature, and explained by differences in the genomic potential
   for nutrient transport, energy production, cell wall structure, and
   replication. Our results suggest that our new approach to estimating
   replication is reflective of gross population growth. Moreover, this
   work reveals that the interaction between adaptation and environmental
   change drives systematic variability in replication patterns across
   ocean basins that is ecotype-specific, adding an activity-based
   dimension to our understanding of microbial niche space.},

Title = {Metabolic genes on conjugative plasmids are highly prevalent in
   Escherichia coli and can protect against antibiotic treatment},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Conjugative plasmids often encode antibiotic resistance genes that
   provide selective advantages to their bacterial hosts during antibiotic
   treatment. Previous studies have predominantly considered these
   established genes as the primary benefit of antibiotic-mediated plasmid
   dissemination. However, many genes involved in cellular metabolic
   processes may also protect against antibiotic treatment and provide
   selective advantages. Despite the diversity of such metabolic genes and
   their potential ecological impact, their plasmid-borne prevalence,
   co-occurrence with canonical antibiotic resistance genes, and phenotypic
   effects remain widely understudied. To address this gap, we focused on
   Escherichia coli, which can often act as a pathogen, and is known to
   spread antibiotic resistance genes via conjugation. We characterized the
   presence of metabolic genes on 1,775 transferrable plasmids and compared
   their distribution to that of known antibiotic resistance genes. We
   found high abundance of genes involved in cellular metabolism and stress
   response. Several of these genes demonstrated statistically significant
   associations or disassociations with known antibiotic resistance genes
   at the strain level, indicating that each gene type may impact the
   spread of the other across hosts. Indeed, in vitro characterization of
   13 statistically relevant metabolic genes confirmed that their
   phenotypic impact on antibiotic susceptibility was largely consistent
   with in situ relationships. These results emphasize the ecological
   importance of metabolic genes on conjugal plasmids, and that selection
   dynamics of E. coli pathogens arises as a complex consequence of both
   canonical mechanisms and their interactions with metabolic pathways.},

Title = {Mortality by ribosomal sequencing (MoRS) provides a window into
   taxon-specific cell lysis},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Microbes are by far the dominant biomass in the world's oceans and drive
   biogeochemical cycles that are critical to life on Earth. The
   composition of marine microbial communities is highly dynamic, spatially
   and temporally, with consequent effects on their functional roles. In
   part, these changes in composition result from viral lysis, which is
   taxon-specific and estimated to account for about half of marine
   microbial mortality. Here, we show that extracellular ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA(ext)) is produced by viral lysis, and that specific lysed
   populations can be identified by sequencing rRNA(ext) recovered from
   seawater samples. In ten seawater samples collected at five depths
   between the surface and 265 m during and following a phytoplankton
   bloom, lysis was detected in about 15\% of 16,946 prokaryotic taxa,
   identified from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with lysis occurring
   in up to 34\% of taxa within a water sample. The ratio of rRNA(ext) to
   cellular rRNA (rRNA(cell)) was used as an index of taxon-specific lysis,
   and revealed that higher relative lysis was most commonly associated
   with copiotrophic bacteria that were in relatively low abundance, such
   as those in the genera Escherichia and Shigella spp., as well as members
   of the Bacteriodetes; whereas, relatively low lysis was more common in
   taxa that are often relatively abundant, such as members of the
   Pelagibacterales (i.e., SAR11 clade), cyanobacteria in the genus
   Synechococcus, and members of the phylum Thaumarchaeota (synonym,
   Nitrososphaerota) that comprised about 13-15\% of the 16 S rRNA gene
   sequences below 30 m. These results provide an explanation for the
   long-standing conundrum of why highly productive bacteria that are
   readily isolated from seawater are often in very low abundance. The
   ability to estimate taxon-specific cell lysis will help explore the
   distribution and abundance of microbial populations in nature.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Mammals have been widely recognized as mobile link species that can
   vectorize resources across the landscape. In this study, we analyze the
   biodeposition of waste products egested by native herbivorous mammals of
   the Monte Desert to document for the first time the implications of the
   restoration of a native forest on this process. We compared a restored
   native woodland an adjacent grazing field in terms of the spatial
   distribution of waste products, the biodiversity of trophic items stored
   in fecal pellets, and the C:N ratio as a predictor of nutrients supplied
   to the soil. We found that fecal pellets of mammal species were
   intermingled and spatially distributed throughout the entire landscape,
   but they were more abundant in the restoration area, indicating the
   influence of land management types on the distribution process. The two
   mammal species presented different feeding strategies; however, the
   plant species consumed in the grazing field indicate decreased food
   options for native mammals, meaning a smaller amplitude of their trophic
   niches under this land management. The low C:N ratio and the high
   nitrogen pool provided by the pellets in the restoration area suggest a
   potential benefit to plant communities. However, the higher organic C
   jointly with the lower C:N ratio observed in fecal pellets of grazing
   field indicate a low decomposability which could promote the
   conservation of C in the soil.},

Abstract = {Land managers rely heavily on herbicides to mitigate exotic plant
   invasions but the nontarget effects of herbicides on treated plant,
   animal, and soil communities are often overlooked. Biological soil
   crusts (biocrusts) are important components of ecosystems yet the
   effects of different herbicides on biocrusts are rarely considered. We
   tested the impact of three widely used herbicides, indaziflam, imazapic,
   aminocyclopyrachlor, and chlorsulfuron, two of which were applied with
   or without a surfactant, on biocrusts dominated by mosses or lichens in
   intermountain grasslands. We found that neither the herbicides nor
   surfactant impacted biocrust moss or lichen cover within 2 years of
   their application.},

Title = {Seed- versus transplant-based eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) restoration
   success in a temperate marine lake},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Despite active seagrass restoration gaining traction as a tool to halt
   and reverse worldwide seagrass losses, overall success remains limited.
   Restoration strategies, through seeding or transplantation, face
   different environmental bottlenecks that limit success. Choosing the
   most appropriate strategy of the two for a specific location, however,
   is hampered by lack of direct practical comparisons between strategies
   within a single system. To investigate potential life stage dependent
   bottlenecks, we compared seed-based and transplant-based restoration of
   Zostera marina in the subtidal saltwater Lake Grevelingen. Our results
   demonstrate that seedling recruitment was negatively impacted by
   bioturbation from the lugworm Arenicola marina and sediment movement due
   to hydrodynamic exposure. Transplant-based restoration was clearly more
   successful but surprisingly best predicted by leaf gluing by the ragworm
   Platynereis dumerilii. This previously undescribed interaction caused
   seagrass leaves to clump and reduce effective photosynthetic surface and
   leaf movement. We suggest that the observed behavior of these worms may
   result from a lack of foodweb interactions, illustrating the importance
   of trophic control for seagrass restoration. Thus, in addition to
   recognizing life stage dependent environmental bottlenecks for
   restoration strategy selection, seagrass restoration may also require
   the active recovery of their associated food webs.},

Title = {Mines to forests? Analyzing long-term recovery trends for surface coal
   mines in Central Appalachia},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mountaintop removal mining, and other surface mining operations have
   severe, large-scale impacts on the communities and ecosystems of
   Appalachia. The impact of this disturbance surpasses that of other land
   clearing events, such as fire or timber harvesting; mines remove both
   established vegetation and soil, but also alter landscape topography.
   The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act legally mandates
   restoration of former mines after the end of mining activity, yet the
   long-term outcomes of restoration efforts across Central Appalachia are
   unknown. We conducted the first regionwide analysis of the lands mined
   between 1985 and 2015 in Central Appalachia, and explore post-mining
   ecological trajectories. Pairing mine-footprint and remote sensing data,
   we characterize the vegetation trends and site health at 71,140 mine
   sites across Central Appalachia. We use first order autoregressive
   models to describe the rates of recovery, expected long-term ecological
   state, and probability of recovery to reference state for former mines.
   We found that only 7.9\% of sites recover to 95\% of the forest
   reference condition in all remote sensing indices. Overall only 0.10\%
   of sites have a 95\% probability of reaching or exceeding reference
   forests in all remote sensing indices. While much of these mined lands
   are intentionally not being reforested, 19\% of mines in Kentucky, 81\%
   of mines in Virginia, and 46.5\% of mines in West Virginia have declared
   forestry as the primary land use for post-mining operations. Our results
   indicate that post-mining forests are not recovering to a level that is
   consistent with average forest conditions in similar unmined sites.},

Abstract = {Sustainable land restoration has made remarkable progress over the past
   decade in terms of inclusivity, integration, and sustainability. Big
   data analytics has gained momentum in the Global North with large
   repositories being developed to analyze, monitor, and track the health
   and status of ecosystems after active restoration. However, restoration
   initiatives in Global South still face issues of fragmented

   being built upon in the future. Copious data going unregistered causes
   discrepancies in reporting the failure or progress made toward global
   commitments. Active involvement of indigenous and local communities,
   followed by citizen scientists' cooperation can help mainstream big data
   analytics to revolutionize sustainable land restoration. Financial
   support from private sector toward advanced technologies for processing
   and providing access to ecological big data of restoration, carrying out
   capacity building initiatives under long-term restoration research can
   be a game changer.},

Title = {Seasonal study of the small-scale variability in dissolved methane in

Abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a climate-relevant atmospheric trace gas which is
   emitted to the atmosphere from coastal areas such as the Baltic Sea. The
   oceanic CH4 emission estimates are still associated with a high degree
   of uncertainty partly because the temporal and spatial variability in
   the CH4 distribution in the ocean surface layer is usually not known. In
   order to determine the small-scale variability in dissolved CH4 we set
   up a purge and trap system with a significantly improved precision for
   the CH4 concentration measurements compared to static headspace
   equilibration measurements. We measured the distribution of dissolved
   CH4 in the water column of the western Kiel Bight and Eckernforde Bay in
   June and September 2018. The top 1m was sampled in high resolution to
   determine potential small-scale CH4 concentration gradients within the
   mixed layer. CH4 concentrations throughout the water column of the
   western Kiel Bight and Eckernforde Bay were generally higher in
   September than in June. The increase in the CH4 concentrations in the
   bottom water was accompanied by a strong decrease in O2 concentrations
   which led to anoxic conditions favourable for microbial CH4 production
   in September. In summer 2018, northwestern Europe experienced a
   pronounced heatwave. However, we found no relationship between the
   anomalies of water temperature and excess CH4 in both the surface and
   the bottom layer at the site of the Boknis Eck Time Series Station
   (Eckernforde Bay). Therefore, the 2018 European heatwave most likely did
   not affect the observed increase in the CH4 concentrations in the
   western Kiel Bight from June to September 2018. The high-resolution
   measurements of the CH4 concentrations in the upper 1m of the water
   column were highly variable and showed no uniform decreasing or
   increasing gradients with water depth. Overall, our results show that
   the CH4 distribution in the water column of the western Kiel Bight and
   Eckernforde Bay is strongly affected by both large-scale temporal (i.e.
   seasonal) and small-scale spatial variabilities which need to be
   considered when quantifying the exchange of CH4 across the
   ocean-atmosphere interface.},

Abstract = {Sexual ornamentation is often assumed to be costly, allowing honest
   signaling of individual quality, and carotenoid-based colors have been
   proposed to bear significant costs. If carotenoid-based colors are
   costly to produce, sexually selected signals should use more
   concentrated carotenoid pigments and have more saturated color than
   nonsexual signals, where honesty-guaranteeing costs are not required. We
   tested this prediction comparing carotenoid-based colors across
   canaries, goldfinches, and allies because many of these species use
   yellow plumage as sexual ornamentation but also have yellow rumps that
   appear to be nonsexual flash marks. Only in the breast, but not the
   rump, was there an asymmetric codistribution of male and female color
   saturation, with males similarly or more saturated than females,
   indicating evolution of breast color by sexual selection. Yellow was not
   consistently more saturated in the breast than in the rump, and the
   codistribution of rump and breast color saturation indicated that
   saturated rumps can persist irrespective of breast color. This
   challenges the assumption that carotenoid-based colors bear significant
   costs. The use of carotenoid coloration as sexual signals in this clade
   may instead be due to social costs, cost-free index mechanisms for
   signaling quality, and/or socially monogamous species evolving low-cost
   signals to mostly discriminate against the lowest-quality mates.},

Title = {Multi-year observations reveal a larger than expected autumn respiration

Abstract = {Site-level observations have shown pervasive cold season CO2 release
   across Arctic and boreal ecosystems, impacting annual carbon budgets.
   Still, the seasonality of CO2 emissions are poorly quantified across
   much of the high latitudes due to the sparse coverage of site-level
   observations. Space-based observations provide the opportunity to fill
   some observational gaps for studying these high-latitude ecosystems,
   particularly across poorly sampled regions of Eurasia. Here, we show
   that data-driven net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from atmospheric CO2
   observations implies strong summer uptake followed by strong autumn
   release of CO2 over the entire cold northeastern region of Eurasia
   during the 2015-2019 study period. Combining data-driven NEE with
   satellite-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP), we show
   that this seasonality implies less summer heterotrophic respiration (Rh)
   and greater autumn Rh than would be expected given an exponential
   relationship between respiration and surface temperature. Furthermore,
   we show that this seasonality of NEE and Rh over northeastern Eurasia is
   not captured by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of dynamic global vegetation
   models (DGVMs), which estimate that 47 \%-57 \% (interquartile range) of
   annual Rh occurs during August-April, while the data-driven estimates
   suggest 59 \%-76 \% of annual Rh occurs over this period. We explain
   this seasonal shift in Rh by respiration from soils at depth during the
   zero-curtain period, when sub-surface soils remain unfrozen up to
   several months after the surface has frozen. Additional impacts of
   physical processes related to freeze-thaw dynamics may contribute to the
   seasonality of Rh. This study confirms a significant and spatially
   extensive early cold season CO2 efflux in the permafrost-rich region of
   northeast Eurasia and suggests that autumn Rh from subsurface soils in
   the northern high latitudes is not well captured by current DGVMs.},

Title = {Beyond the passive-active dichotomy: aligning research with the

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {Experts recommend moving beyond the passive-versus-active dichotomy
   toward an intervention continuum framework of ecological restoration.
   Restoration science should guide this transition by elucidating the
   performance of restoration strategies and underlying mechanisms along
   gradients of intervention intensity, but is constrained by a paucity of
   relevant comparisons, conflation of restoration goals, and incomplete
   documentation of interventions in the present literature. Moving beyond
   the passive-active dichotomy in restoration science requires emphasis on
   (1) designing studies that compare multiple restoration treatments to
   identify whether and how benefits accrue with increasing intervention
   intensity; (2) distinguishing ecological from other ecosystem
   restoration goals, as goals could modify outcomes at any given
   intervention intensity level; and (3) documenting restoration goals,
   methods, and costs consistently and in sufficient detail in
   publications, for reproducibility in science and practice, and relevance
   to comparative and synthetic research, in restoration frameworks based
   on the intervention continuum.},

Abstract = {Turnover of organic matter (OM) is an essential ecological function in
   inland water bodies and relevant for water quality especially for the
   potential of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal as well as due to
   emissions of CO2. We investigated various sources of OM including DOC,
   autochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-POC), allochthonous
   particulate organic carbon (allo-POC), and sedimentary matter (SED) in a
   temperate drinking water reservoir (Rappbode Reservoir, Germany) with
   respect to carbon isotope ratios and concentration dynamics. For this
   purpose, we focused on the metalimnion and the hypolimnion, where
   respiratory turnover is expected to be dominant and hardly disturbed by
   atmospheric exchange. The observation period of nine months covered a
   complete stratification period of the water body. Dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) concentrations and its isotopes (delta C-13(DIC)) were
   considered together with isotope data of DOC and POC (delta C-13(DOC)
   and delta C-13(POC)) as input parameters for mass balances. DIC
   concentrations ranged between 0.30 and 0.53 mmol L-1 , while delta
   C-13(DIC) values were between -15.1 and -7.2 parts per thousand versus
   the VPDB (Vienna PeeDee Belemnite) standard. Values of delta(13)C(DOC
   )and delta C-13(auto-POC) ranged between -28.8 and -27.6 parts per
   thousand and between -35.2 and -26.8 parts per thousand, respectively.
   Isotope compositions of sedimentary material and allochthonous POC were
   inferred from the literature with average values of delta C-13(SED) =
   -30.7 parts per thousand, and delta C-13(allo-POC) = -31.8 parts per
   thousand. Comparison of DIC concentration gains and stable isotope mass
   balances showed that autochthonous POC from primary producers was the
   main contributor to DIC increases, while contributions from DOC, ExtPOC
   and SED played a minor role. OM turnover rates, i.e. the conversion of
   organic carbon towards DIC, calculated with our isotope approach were
   within the range for oligotrophic water bodies (0.01 to 1.3 mu mol L(-1
   )d(-1)). Some higher values in the metalimnion are likely due the
   availability of settling POC from the photic zone. Samples from a
   Metalimnetic Oxygen Minimum (MOM) showed a clear dominance of
   respiration over photosynthesis through bacterial degradation of
   autochthonous POC. These high turnover rates further highlight a close
   link with planktonic biological assemblages. Our work shows that
   respiration in temperate lentic water bodies largely depends on
   autochthonous POC production as a major carbon source},

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that shape the geographic distribution of
   plant species is a central theme of biogeography. Although seed mass,
   seed dispersal mode and phylogeny have long been suspected to affect
   species distribution, the link between the sources of variation in these
   attributes and their effects on the distribution of seed plants are
   poorly documented. This study aims to quantify the joint effects of key
   seed traits and phylogeny on species distribution. We collected the seed
   mass and seed dispersal mode from 1426 species of seed plants
   representing 501 genera of 122 families and used 4 138 851 specimens to
   model species distributional range size. Phylogenetic generalized
   least-squares regression and variation partitioning were performed to
   estimate the effects of seed mass, seed dispersal mode and phylogeny on
   species distribution. We found that species distributional range size
   was significantly constrained by phylogeny. Seed mass and its
   intraspecific variation were also important in limiting species
   distribution, but their effects were different among species with
   different dispersal modes. Variation partitioning revealed that seed
   mass, seed mass variability, seed dispersal mode and phylogeny together
   explained 46.82 \% of the variance in species range size. Although seed
   traits are not typically used to model the geographic distributions of
   seed plants, our study provides direct evidence showing seed mass, seed
   dispersal mode and phylogeny are important in explaining species
   geographic distribution. This finding underscores the necessity to
   include seed traits and the phylogenetic history of species in
   climate-based niche models for predicting the response of plant
   geographic distribution to climate change.},

Title = {Environmentally Associated Variation in Dispersal Distance Affects
   Inbreeding Risk in a Stream Salamander},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {6},
Pages = {802-814},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Avoiding inbreeding is considered a key driver of dispersal evolution,
   and dispersal distances should be especially important in mediating
   inbreeding risk because the likelihood of mating with relatives
   decreases with dispersal distance. However, a lack of direct data on
   dispersal distances has limited empirical tests of this prediction,
   particularly in the context of the multiple selective forces that can
   influence dispersal. Using the headwater stream salamander Gyrinophilus
   porphyriticus, we tested whether spatial variation in environmental
   conditions leads to differences in dispersal distances, resulting in
   spatial variation in the effect of dispersal on inbreeding risk. Using
   capture-recapture and population genomic data from five streams, we
   found that dispersal distances were greater in downstream reaches than
   upstream reaches. Inbreeding risk trended lower for dispersers than
   nondispersers in downstream reaches but not in upstream reaches.
   Furthermore, stream reaches did not differ in spatial patterns of
   individual relatedness, indicating that variation in inbreeding risk was
   in fact due to differences in dispersal distances. These results
   demonstrate that environmentally associated variation in dispersal
   distances can cause the inbreeding consequences of dispersal to vary at
   fine spatial scales. They also show that selective pressures other than
   inbreeding avoidance maintain phenotypic variation in dispersal,
   underscoring the importance of addressing alternative hypotheses in
   dispersal research.},

Title = {Individual Dietary Specialization in a Generalist Bee Varies across
   Populations but Has No Effect on the Richness of Associated Microbial
   Communities},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Despite the increasingly documented occurrence of individual
   specialization, the relationship between individual consumer
   interactions and diet-related microbial communities in wild populations
   is still unclear. Using data from nests of Ceratina australensis from
   three different wild bee populations, we combine metabarcoding and
   network approaches to explore the existence of individual variation in
   resource use within and across populations and whether dietary
   specialization affects the richness of pollen-associated microbes. We
   reveal the existence of marked dietary specialization. In the most
   specialized population, we also show that individuals' diet breadth was
   positively related to the richness of fungi but not bacteria. Overall,
   individual specialization appeared to have a weak or negligible effect
   on the microbial richness of nests, suggesting that different mechanisms
   beyond environmental transmission may be at play regarding microbial
   acquisition in wild bees.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13-14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The payload size and commercial availability of thermal infrared cameras
   mounted on drones has initiated a new wave in the potential for
   conservationists and researchers to survey, count and detect wildlife,
   even the most complex of habitats such as forest canopies. However,
   several fundamental design and methodological questions remain to be
   tested before standardized monitoring approaches can be broadly adopted.
   We test the impact of both the speed of drone flights and diel flight
   period on tropical rainforest canopy wildlife detections. Detection and
   identification rates differ between both flight speeds and diel time.
   Overall similar to 36\% more detections were made during slower flight
   speeds, along with a greater ability to categorize taxonomic groups.
   Flights conducted at 3am resulted in similar to 67\% more detections
   compared to flights conducted at 7am (the diel period with the lowest
   detection rate). However, 112\% more detections could be identified to
   taxonomic group in 7am flights compared with 3am flights - due to the
   types of wildlife being identified and the assistance of the RGB camera.
   Although, this technology holds great promise for carrying out surveys
   in structurally complex and poorly known ecosystems like forest
   canopies, there is more to do in further methodological testing, and
   building automated post-processing systems. Our results suggest that
   drone studies in the same habitat types, with the same animal densities,
   could be off by multiples if flown during different times and/or at
   different speeds. The difference could be an alarming 5-6x variation in
   animal detections or identification depending on changes in these two
   factors alone.},

Abstract = {Maternal effects can give newborns a head start in life by adjusting
   natal phenotypes to natal environments, yet their strength and
   adaptiveness are often difficult to investigate in natural populations.
   Here, we studied anticipatory maternal effects and their adaptiveness in
   common lizards in a seminatural experimental system. Specifically, we
   investigated how maternal environments (i.e., vegetation cover) and
   maternal phenotype (i.e., activity levels and body length) can shape
   offspring phenotype. We further studied whether such maternal effects
   influenced offspring survival in natal environments varying with respect
   to vegetation cover, conspecific density, and, consequently, maternal
   fitness. More active females from dense vegetation habitats produced
   bigger offspring than their less active counterparts, the contrary being
   true for sparse vegetation habitats. Moreover, females from dense
   vegetation habitats produced more active offspring and more active
   offspring survived better in dense vegetation habitats, resulting in
   greater maternal fitness through maternal effects. These results suggest
   adaptive anticipatory maternal effects, induced by vegetation structure
   and mediated by activity levels that may shape early-life prospects in
   natal environments.},

Title = {Evidence of Biological Self-Organization in Spatial Patterns of a Common
   Tropical Alga},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Tropical reef communities contain spatial patterns at multiple scales,
   observable from microscope and satellite alike. Many of the
   smaller-scale patterns are generated physiologically (e.g., skeletal
   structures of corals at <1-m scale), while some of the larger patterns
   have been attributed to scale-dependent feedbacks (e.g., spur and groove
   reefs at 10-100-m scales). In describing the spatial patterning of reef
   benthic communities at landscape levels, we uncovered unique spatial
   patterning among living marine algae. Populations of the calcifying
   green alga Halimeda were observed to form a consistent polygonal pattern
   at a characteristic scale of 3-4 m. The pattern showed no clear evidence
   of having been formed through biologically created shifts in
   hydrodynamical conditions or related mechanisms. In considering the
   specifics of Halimeda growth patterns, a model of self-organization
   involving separation and patterned extension is proposed, a mechanism
   revealed in some geological pattern formation. This observation
   reinforces the diversity of pathways by which striking spatial patterns
   can occur in ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC), one of the largest terrestrial carbon (C)
   stocks on Earth, has been depleted by anthropogenic land cover change
   and agricultural management. However, the latter has so far not been
   well represented in global C stock assessments. While SOC models often
   simulate detailed biochemical processes that lead to the accumulation
   and decay of SOC, the management decisions driving these biophysical
   processes are still little investigated at the global scale. Here we
   develop a spatially explicit data set for agricultural management on
   cropland, considering crop production levels, residue returning rates,
   manure application, and the adoption of irrigation and tillage
   practices. We combine it with a reduced-complexity model based on the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 2 method to create
   a half-degree resolution data set of SOC stocks and SOC stock changes
   for the first 30 cm of mineral soils. We estimate that, due to arable
   farming, soils have lost around 34.6 GtC relative to a counterfactual
   hypothetical natural state in 1975. Within the period 1975-2010, this
   SOC debt continued to expand by 5 GtC (0.14 GtC yr(-1)) to around 39.6
   GtC. However, accounting for historical management led to 2.1 GtC fewer
   (0.06 GtC yr(-1)) emissions than under the assumption of constant
   management. We also find that management decisions have influenced the
   historical SOC trajectory most strongly by residue returning, indicating
   that SOC enhancement by biomass retention may be a promising negative
   emissions technique. The reduced-complexity SOC model may allow us to
   simulate management-induced SOC enhancement - also within
   computationally demanding integrated (land use) assessment modeling.},

Abstract = {The increasing rates of CO2 due to anthropogenic activities are causing
   important potential climate threats for the Mediterranean Sea: ocean
   acidification and warming. In this region, two seagrass species,
   Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, can play a crucial role in
   climate change mitigation. Seagrasses can act as carbon sinks, buffer
   lowering pH values during the day and storing carbon in the sediment
   underneath their meadows. However, available data documenting these
   processes are scattered and collected using different methodologies,
   which makes its interpretation and generalization very challenging. In
   this study, we analyzed published and unpublished data (collected for
   this study) on seagrass community metabolism to compare two
   methodologies, benthic chambers and multiparametric sensors, and
   evaluate trends through time for these two species. Furthermore, we
   analyzed seasonal trends of both seagrass species' metabolic rates and
   their variation between the eastern and western Mediterranean basins.
   Most evaluated meadows, 80.9 \%, were autotrophic. Calculated metabolic
   rates differ between methodologies, with multiparametric sensors
   estimating rates almost an order of magnitude higher, 143.22 +/- 28.21
   (SE) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for net community production (NCP) compared to
   an average of 18.75 +/- 3.80 (SE) mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for measurements
   with benthic chambers. However, sensors are not able to differentiate
   between habitats and only useful to assess seagrass metabolism at a
   broader community level, whereas benthic chambers are capable of
   evaluating rates at the species level and confirm that P. oceanica is
   more productive compared to C. nodosa. We found similar metabolic rates
   in the eastern and western Mediterranean regions for P. oceanica with
   the benthic-chamber technique and higher NCP in the west based on sensor
   measurements.},

Abstract = {The G matrix, which quantifies the genetic architecture of traits, is
   often viewed as an evolutionary constraint. However, G can evolve in
   response to selection and may also be viewed as a product of adaptive
   evolution. Convergent evolution of G in similar environments would
   suggest that G evolves adaptively, but it is difficult to disentangle
   such effects from phylogeny. Here, we use the adaptive radiation of
   Anolis lizards to ask whether convergence of G accompanies the repeated
   evolution of habitat specialists, or ecomorphs, across the Greater
   Antilles. We measured G in seven species representing three ecomorphs
   (trunk-crown, trunk-ground, and grass-bush). We found that the overall
   structure of G does not converge. Instead, the structure of G is well
   conserved and displays a phylogenetic signal consistent with Brownian
   motion. However, several elements of G showed signatures of convergence,
   indicating that some aspects of genetic architecture have been shaped by
   selection. Most notably, genetic correlations between limb traits and
   body traits were weaker in long-legged trunk-ground species, suggesting
   effects of recurrent selection on limb length. Our results demonstrate
   that common selection pressures may have subtle but consistent effects
   on the evolution of G, even as its overall structure remains conserved.},

Title = {The Effects of Foraging Ecology and Allometry on Avian Skull Shape Vary

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {4},
Pages = {E174-E188},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Avian skull shape diversity is classically thought to result from
   selection for structures that are well adapted for distinct ecological
   functions, but recent work has suggested that allometry is the dominant
   contributor to avian morphological diversity. If true, this hypothesis
   would overturn much conventional wisdom regarding the importance of
   form-function relationships in adaptive radiations, but it is possible
   that these results are biased by the low taxonomic levels of the clades
   that have been studied. Using 3D morphometric data from the skulls of a
   relatively old and ecologically diverse order of birds, the
   Charadriiformes (shorebirds and relatives), we found that foraging
   ecology explains more than two-thirds of the variation in skull shape
   across the clade. However, we also found support for the hypothesis that
   skull allometry evolves, contributing more to shape variation at the
   level of the family than the order. Allometry may provide an important
   source of shape variation on which selection can act over short
   timescales, but its potential to evolve complicates generalizations
   between clades. Foraging ecology remains a better predictor of avian
   skull shape over macroevolutionary timescales.},

Title = {Efficacy of strip seeding to restore grassland plant communities},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 23},
Abstract = {Strip seeding is a novel restoration practice of strategically planting
   in strips, resulting in alternating seeded and unseeded areas to target
   efforts and reduce costs while achieving ecological outcomes similar to
   conventional methods of seeding entire sites. However, there has been
   limited work testing the efficacy of this method, including how strip
   width and percent seeded area affect restoration outcomes. We evaluated
   four native grass strip seed treatments (33\%, 50\% narrow, 50\% wide,
   and 66\% of area seeded), an unseeded control, and a conventional 100\%
   seeded control to investigate: (1) how plant communities in seeded and
   unseeded strips change over time; (2) how initial strip width affect
   native species biomass, invasive species biomass, and plant species
   diversity; and (3) cost-effectiveness of strip seeding in terms of
   management costs and benefits accrued. Four years post-seeding, seeded
   and unseeded strips exhibited unique plant communities; seeded strips
   were characterized by native perennial grasses while unseeded strips had
   a higher abundance of annual forbs (majority non-native) and non-native
   annual grasses. Plant communities were similar within strips across
   strip seeding treatments. Invasion resistance and productivity scaled
   with percent area initially seeded, but by year four all strip seed
   treatments (33-66\%) provided similar benefits to conventional seeding
   (100\%). Overall, this suggests strip seeding is a promising,
   cost-effective method to restore targeted species and maintain native
   grassland communities. Further research is needed on long-term effects,
   ecological and economic barriers and opportunities, and provisioning of
   a broad suite of ecosystem services across different environmental
   contexts and management practices.},

Title = {Drivers of success in collaborative monitoring in forest landscape
   restoration: an indicative assessment from Latin America},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 23},
Abstract = {Despite growing global attention on forest landscape restoration (FLR)
   as an integrated approach to enhancing environmental and human
   well-being, the potential for leveraging monitoring to catalyze learning
   and improve management outcomes is not being fully realized. We assessed
   the extent to which collaborative monitoring, a process that embraces
   cross-scale multilevel actors and interactions in the collection and use
   of information, is considered across FLR projects in Latin America by
   applying a diagnostic of 54 ``success factors{''} scored from 1 (factor
   not in place) to 5 (factor fully in place). Responses were collected
   from 36 projects across 12 countries. Although respondents generally
   understood monitoring as crucial to FLR success, local participation
   scored as insufficient. Several of the lowest-ranked success factors
   related to training for local people in the use of tools, forms, and
   technology for data collection, and to interpreting data to promote
   understanding of management outcomes. The most notable finding related
   to the paucity of networks or entities to leverage information into
   knowledge-sharing and learning opportunities from the top-down and the
   bottom-up. Our results provide a preliminary indication of how to
   promote collaborative monitoring approaches in the context of FLR
   projects in Latin America. First, it requires enhanced integration among
   academics, local communities and governmental and nongovernmental
   organizations. Second, it requires a minimum level of harmonization with

Title = {Spatially Explicit Habitat Selection: Testing Contagion and the Ideal
   Free Distribution with Culex Mosquitoes},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Since its inception, attempts have been made to improve ideal free
   distribution (IFD) theory to make it better fit real-world data. Spatial
   contagion is a newer ecological concept that suggests that the perceived
   quality of a patch can be affected by the quality of its neighbor
   patches. Here, we present a series of experiments testing for potential
   contagion effects, examining how contagion can interact with the IFD and
   determining whether spatial context affects assessment of habitat
   quality. First, we tested whether the presence of conspecific
   competitors negatively impacts oviposition habitat selection by female
   mosquitoes (Culex restuans). We then used a more complex spatial
   landscape to determine whether competition can create a spatial
   contagion effect. Finally, we examined whether the density of
   conspecifics can adjust the contagion effect of nutrient availability.
   While females avoided patches containing conspecifics, there was no
   effect of competition/density on neighboring patches. Additionally, we
   found that resource availability was a significant predictor of where
   egg rafts were laid, but resource availability did not have a contagion
   effect. These results provide further support for the utility of the
   IFD, as individuals were able to accurately assess patch-level habitat
   quality.},

Title = {Simulated genetic efficacy of metapopulation management and conservation
   value of captive reintroductions in a rapidly declining felid},

Abstract = {In South Africa, cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) occur as a relictual,
   unmanaged population of `free-roamers', a managed metapopulation across
   fenced reserves, and in various captive facilities. To ensure that the
   Cheetah Metapopulation Project (CMP) is not at risk of losing overall
   genetic variation to drift or inbreeding, we propose various
   interventions, including exchanges between free-roamers and the
   metapopulation or supplementation with unrelated individuals from
   captivity. Simulated trajectories of genetic diversity under such
   intervention strategies over time could directly inform conservation
   action and policy towards securing the long-term genetic integrity of
   the CMP. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for 172
   adult cheetahs across the free-roamer population, the metapopulation,
   and three major captive facilities. Management intervention trajectory
   models were tested including, (1) no intervention, (2) genetic exchange
   between free-roamers and the metapopulation, (3) translocation from a
   single captive facility and (4) translocation from several captive
   facilities into the metapopulation. Discriminant Analysis of Principal
   Components (DAPC) showed that two captive populations are highly
   differentiated from the metapopulation and each other, whilst the third
   captive and free-roamer populations are genetically more similar to the
   metapopulation. Simulated genetic variation over 25 generations
   indicated that models 1 and 2 show significant losses of heterozygosity
   due to genetic drift and present a proportional increase in the
   frequencies of 1st- and 2nd-degree relatives, whilst this variation and
   pairwise relatedness remain relatively constant under models 3 and 4. We
   emphasise the potential importance of captive facilities as reservoirs
   of genetic diversity in metapopulation management and threatened species
   recovery.},

Abstract = {The American Horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, a species considered a
   phylogenetic relict, has been widely studied in its distribution in the
   United States due to its relevance in the fishing and biomedical
   industry. However, there is little information on the genetic status of
   the Mexican population which is relevant for the conservation of this
   endangered species. Here, using nuclear microsatellites markers, we
   evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of L. polyphemus in
   different localities of its Mexican distribution in the Yucatan
   Peninsula. A total of 103 individuals from four Mexican localities from
   the Gulf of Mexico (Champoton and Ria Celestun), northern coast of
   Yucatan (Yum Balam), to Caribbean coast (Sian Ka'an), were analyzed. Our
   results show low to moderately low values of different genetic diversity
   parameters and possible inbreeding processes for the two localities
   situated at the disttibution extremities (Champoton and Sian Ka'an).
   Also, we detected a strong genetic structure with two clusters, one
   pooling the Ria Celestun, Yum Balam and Sian Ka'an samples, and the
   other corresponding to Champoton, the most isolated population in the
   southern Gulf of Mexico. These patterns of genetic diversity could be
   related to anthropogenic activities (contamination, illegal fishing)
   that have impacted these populations for decades, resulting in a
   decrease in their populations.The observed genetic structure seems to be
   related to the dispersal behavior of the species and the circulation
   pattern on the Yucatan Shelf and the Campeche Bank. Our results
   highlighted the existence of two management units that should be
   considered in proposing management and conservation strategies for this
   species, especially focused on localities at critical risk.},

Abstract = {Palms are integral structural and functional components of tropical
   forest ecosystems, and are one of the most economically important plant
   families. This monocotyledon lineage exhibits a pantropical distribution
   with approx. 2600 species. Palm genetic diversity is severely threatened
   by habitat degradation, fragmentation, extensive resource extraction,
   and the loss of mutualistic species. This genetic erosion could
   considerably reduce the adaptation potential and persistence of taxa
   under climate change, which could pervasively impact the functioning of
   tropical forest ecosystems. In this review, with the insight of the
   post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which emphasizes conservation
   and monitoring of genetic diversity, we summarize the impacts of
   anthropogenic interventions on palm populations, past decades of
   research on conservation genetics, and propose a future course of action
   using genomic and epigenomic approaches to conserve palm genetic
   resources in the context of climate change. Anthropogenic interventions
   in natural habitats have considerably reduced viable populations and
   altered the genetic characteristics of palm populations. Populations of
   many species are fragmented with disturbed mating patterns owing to the
   loss of reproductively active individuals and dispersal agents.
   Furthermore, climate change is predicted to have an adverse impact on
   current palm distribution, and assisted migration to suitable climatic
   niches is recommended. In this context, the integration of phenotypic,
   genetic, epigenetic, and genomic approaches in congruence with
   bioclimatic variables can enhance the adaptive potential and climatic
   resilience to implement effective conservation strategies in palms.},

   from an Agricultural Landscape},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ability to predict the impact of abiotic stressors on plant
   assemblage characteristics during habitat restoration is critical in the
   success of targeted restoration efforts. In an effort to determine
   wetland plant responses to common agricultural stressors, we seeded 75
   mesocosms with soil collected from three restored wetlands in the
   Mississippi River Alluvial Valley. These mesocosms were subjected to
   four different combinations of nitrogen and sediment addition and
   monitored for two growing seasons. Resulting assemblages showed strong
   effects from site of origin with weaker effects of imposed treatments on
   assemblage composition. In contrast to species composition, summary
   metrics of assemblage quality (e.g., richness and diversity) were
   negatively affected by increased nitrogen and sediment levels, vs.
   controls. Over time, assemblage phylogenetic relatedness became more
   clustered, indicating the importance of abiotic filtering on wetland
   plant assemblages in agricultural landscapes. Our results indicate that
   agriculturally derived stressors can exert a filtering effect on plant
   assemblages, impact their perceived quality, and lessen the importance
   of soil site of origin in restored wetlands in agricultural landscapes.},

Abstract = {Community structure depends jointly on species' responses to, and
   effects on, environmental factors. Many such factors, including
   detritus, are studied in ecosystem ecology. Detritus in terrestrial
   ecosystems is dominated by plant litter (nonliving organic material),
   which, in addition to its role in material cycling, can act as a niche
   factor modulating interactions among plants. Litter thus links
   traditional community and ecosystem processes, which are often studied
   separately. We explore this connection using population dynamics models
   of two plant species and a litter pool. We first find conditions
   determining the outcome of interactions between these species,
   highlighting the role that litter plays and the role of broader
   ecosystem parameters, such as decomposition rate. Species trade-offs in
   tolerance to direct competition and litter-based interference
   competition allow for coexistence, provided the litter-tolerant species
   produces more litter at the population level; otherwise, priority
   effects may result. When species coexist, litter-mediated interactions
   between plants disrupt the traditional relationship between biomass
   accumulation and decomposition. Increasing decomposition rate may have
   no effect on standing litter density and, in some cases, may even
   increase litter load. These results illustrate how ecosystem variables
   can influence community outcomes that then feed back to influence the
   ecosystem.},

Title = {Increased Floral Rewards due to Local Adaptation Drives Plant Ecological
   Speciation via Learned Preferences of Pollinators},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Volume = {200},
Number = {6},
Pages = {834-845},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In animal-pollinated plants, the growth environment and pollination
   environment are two important agents of natural selection. However,
   their simultaneous effects on plant speciation remain underexplored.
   Here, we report a theoretical finding that if plants' local adaptation
   to the growth environment increases their floral rewards for
   pollinators, it can strongly facilitate ecological speciation in plants.
   We consider two evolving plant traits, vegetative and floral signal
   traits, in a population genetic model for two plant populations under
   divergent selection from different growth environments. The vegetative
   trait determines plants' local adaptation. Locally adapted plants reward
   pollinators better than maladapted plants. By associative learning,
   pollinators acquire learned preferences for floral signal traits
   expressed by better-rewarding plants. If pollinators' learned
   preferences become divergent between populations, floral signal
   divergence occurs and plants develop genetic associations between
   vegetative and floral signal traits, leading to ecological speciation
   via a two-allele mechanism. Interestingly, speciation is contingent on
   whether novel floral signal variants arise before or after plant
   populations become locally adapted to the growth environment. Our
   results suggest that simultaneous selection from growth and pollination
   environments might be important for the ecological speciation of
   animal-pollinated plants.},

Title = {Novel Genomic Insights into Body Size Evolution in Cetaceans and a
   Resolution of Peto's Paradox},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},
Number = {2},
Pages = {E28-E42},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) have undergone a radical
   transformation from the typical terrestrial mammalian body plan to a
   streamlined body, while exhibiting dramatic interspecific size
   differences. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   diversification of cetacean body size are largely unknown. Here, by
   using genomic and phenotypic data for 22 cetaceans, we performed
   phylogenetic genome-body size analysis and explored the genetic basis of
   the high diversity of body size in cetaceans. A functional enrichment
   analysis showed that body size-related genes in cetaceans are enriched
   in pathways associated with immunity, cell growth, and metabolism,
   suggesting that they contributed to body size diversification. Genes
   showing correlated evolution with body size were mainly involved in
   immune surveillance, tumor suppression function, and development of
   hypertumors. The role of these genes in tumor control resolves Peto's
   paradox (i.e., the lack of a correspondence between an expansion in body
   size and, thereby, cell number and an increased cancer incidence). Our
   results provide novel insights into the evolution of substantial body
   size variation in cetaceans.},

   Communities of Steppe Streams},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The factors influencing molluscs distribution in a small steppe stream
   were investigated to assess the impact of beavers on their diversity and
   abundance. Twenty stations-in unaffected streams, beaver ponds at
   different stages of development, and anthropogenic ponds-were sampled in
   May 2019 and June 2021. In each pond, a nearshore area of 1 m(2) was
   completely surveyed using a dip net. Twenty-one mollusc species were
   found. Old and drained beaver ponds were characterized by significantly
   higher species richness. The damming of the river, by both humans and
   beavers, initially resulted in decreased species diversity, then
   followed by increased species richness due to increased habitat
   heterogeneity across the valley. Maximum gamma biodiversity was observed
   when the river habitats included all types of beaver ponds. When ponds
   were abandoned, a short-term increase in mollusc biodiversity and
   abundance was observed. Afterward, channel processes returned the
   habitats to a lotic state, habitat heterogeneity began to decrease, and
   mollusc community evenness dropped dramatically. To conserve the mollusc
   biodiversity of the stream valley, it is necessary for beavers to
   permanently renew some ponds.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions cause species extinction but can also provide
   benefits. Wetlands, such as salt marshes, include little-known but
   important ecosystems that are sometimes severely invaded by exotic
   plants. Salt marshes in eastern South America are increasingly impacted
   by invasions of the African grass Urochloa arrecta. This study
   investigated the appearance of a population of the mangrove rail Rallus
   longirostris in areas dominated by U. arrecta and its disappearance with
   the eradication of this plant. We monitored four areas (54.47 ha) in the
   Guaratuba Bay estuary in southern Brazil, from 2006 to 2022, two of
   which contained four patches of U. arrecta as the dominant species. In
   2012, we started to eradicate U. arrecta with mechanical management, and
   in 2020, it was eradicated locally. We recorded R. longirostris for the
   first time within a patch of U. arrecta in 2007. In subsequent years we
   saw the species in two other patches of the exotic plant. Rallus
   longirostris was no longer observed once U. arrecta was eradicated.
   Differences in patch occupancy between invaded and uninvaded habitats
   observed for R. longirostris and Pardirallus nigricans, and the
   disappearance of R. longirostris following the exotic plant management
   suggest competitive advantage and/or differential habitat preference and
   population density as hypotheses to explain observed patterns. The
   invasion of U. arrecta can increase the local populations of R.
   longirostris. Since this bird is not endangered, we encourage the
   management of U. arrecta because of its impact on salt marshes,
   including an endemic endangered bird.},

Abstract = {Wetland diversity metrics are critical indicators of habitat carrying
   capacity and anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem health. This study
   aimed at comparing the composition and ecological features of bird
   communities across gradients of habitat effects within wetland areas of
   freshwater tropical lakes. For this study, the total number, diversity,
   and dominance of bird communities (n = 519; 29 species) within a 1 km
   radius riparian area of four tropical lakes were measured and compared
   alongside habitat effect variables. Three categories of habitat effect
   variables i.e., lake morphology (surface area of lake, lake perimeter,
   shape index i.e., form factor); landscape structure (vegetation density
   within 1 km radius measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   {[}NDVI]), and human disturbance/urbanization features (distance to
   major road, distance to residential area) were assessed across the four
   lake wetlands. The multivariate relationship of variables was described
   using non-metric multidimentional scaling (NMDS) of six habitat effect
   variables alongside Hill numbers diversity as dependent variables showed
   that variation in bird species composition was strongly negatively
   correlated with lake shape index, and positively correlated with
   vegetation density (NDVI) and distance to the road (indicating
   complementary effects). This implies that wetlands with heterogeneously
   shaped lakes alongside greater vegetation density (NDVI), and increased
   furtherance from major highways (urbanization features) were more likely
   to attract and accommodate more diverse bird communities. Furthermore,
   the habitat-specific avian guild structure highlighted the carrying
   capacity of the different lake wetlands. The study findings imply that
   the conservation of wetland avifauna will require emphasis on
   habitat-specific variables.},

Title = {Current Status of Ponds in India: A Framework for Restoration, Policies
   and Circular Economy},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Healthy pond ecosystems are critical for achieving several sustainable
   development goals (SDG) through numerous ecosystem services (e.g., flood
   control, nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration). However, the
   socio-economic and ecological value of ponds is often underestimated
   compared to the larger water bodies. Ponds are highly vulnerable to
   mounting land-use pressures (e.g., urban expansion, and agriculture
   intensification) and environmental changes, leading to degradation and
   loss of the pond ecosystem. The narrow utilitarian use-based
   conservation fails to recognize the multiple anthropogenic pressures and
   provides narrow solutions which are inefficient to regenerate the
   degraded pond ecosystem. In this paper, we holistically examined the
   legal challenges (policies) and key anthropogenic and environmental
   pressures responsible for pond degradation in India. The country is
   strongly dedicated to attaining SDG and circular economy (CE) through
   aquatic ecosystem conservation and restoration. Considerable efforts are
   required at the administration level to recognize the contribution of
   pond ecosystem services in attaining global environmental goals and
   targets. Worldwide restoration strategies were reviewed, and a framework
   for pond restoration and conservation was proposed, which includes
   policies and incentives, technologies such as environmental-DNA (e-DNA),
   life cycle assessment (LCA), and other ecohydrological measures.
   Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer a sustainable and cost-effective
   approach to restoring the pond's natural processes. Furthermore, linkage
   between the pond ecosystem and the CE was assessed to encourage a
   regenerative system for biodiversity conservation. This study informs
   the need for extensive actions and legislative reforms to restore and
   conserve the pond ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Halos around coral reefs are landscape-scale patterns arising from
   multispecies interactions that collectively structure reefscapes over
   many thousands of square kilometers. First described in the 1960s, halos
   are known from a handful of locations and continue to captivate
   scientists. What remains unknown is how globally widespread, persistent,
   and dynamic halos are. We examined satellite imagery of reefs globally,
   coupled with in situ field observations, to show that halos are a
   globally ubiquitous, persistent, yet dynamic ecological phenomenon
   spanning vastly different systems. We further document the previously
   undescribed presence of halos outside the tropics surrounding seagrass
   ``reefs{''} and highlight the temporal scales over which coral reef
   halos change, merge, and persist. Specifically, we show that halos can
   change in size over relatively short temporal scales of months, despite
   persisting over decades. In doing so, we document patterns suggesting
   that additional biophysical mechanisms than previously assumed may shape
   halos. Understanding the full suite of mechanisms governing halo
   formation and maintenance may enable us to use them as proxies for
   species interactions. Given the global extent of halos, their role in
   affecting sedimentary carbon storage, and their relationship with marine
   reserve existence and maturity, they may ultimately serve as globally
   relevant indicators of coral reef ecosystem functioning and health.},

Title = {Drones and Bathymetry Show the Importance of Optimal Water Depth for
   Nest Placement Within Breeding Colonies of Western and Clark's Grebes},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Habitat selection involves a series of decisions that are arguably the
   most important decisions that animals make and these decisions occur at
   multiple hierarchical spatial scales. Colonial-nesting birds face a
   unique challenge when selecting a nest site because each bird's choices
   are severely constrained by other birds within their breeding colony.
   Individuals must seek out optimum nesting locations within the
   constraint of the colony's geographic location. We investigated how
   water depth and proximity to open water affected 4th-order nest-site
   selection of Western and Clark's Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis,
   Aechmophorus clarkii), colonial nesting waterbirds that have declined in
   abundance across their range. We used an orthomosiac that we created
   from similar to 500 aerial drone images of a large breeding colony to
   construct a Resource Selection Function to describe microhabitat
   features that influence nest-site placement within the colony footprint.
   Grebes preferred to nest in portions of the colony with intermediate
   water depths (40-80 cm during nest construction) and they preferred to
   nest in portions of the colony furthest from open water. Understanding
   how individual birds make use of available microhabitat features within
   the footprint of their breeding colony can help inform conservation
   efforts of colonial-nesting birds, particularly for species that nest in
   wetland habitats whose water levels are managed for human use.},

Title = {Wetland Conservation and Its Effects on Mosquito Populations},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To stop the worldwide decline of wetlands, conservation measures like
   restoration, protection and construction of these ecosystems are
   indispensable. However, wetland conservation could influence mosquito
   populations. We analysed how conservation measures affect the species
   composition and abundance of mosquitoes by conducting a systematic
   literature review and generated results from 113 selected articles.
   Thereby, we separately assessed conservation measures in constructed,
   for example polders, and natural, non-constructed, wetlands. An increase
   in overall mosquito abundance was more prevalent in constructed
   wetlands, but not in studies conducted in non-constructed wetlands.
   Besides assessing overall mosquito abundance, we developed a scheme to
   rank mosquito species-specific nuisance after conservation measures.
   Mosquito species can differ in their nuisance potential according to
   their biting and host-seeking behaviors. We further assessed the effects
   of mosquito management practices on specific mosquito species and
   discussed different practices between constructed and non-constructed
   wetlands. Whereas in constructed wetlands more management practices
   could be applied, practices in non-constructed wetlands were limited. In
   conclusion, we were not able to reject entirely the hypothesis that
   mosquito populations change after conservation measures in wetlands.},

Title = {Application of Palaeoecological and Geochemical Proxies in the Context

   Asia},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia (SEA) have undergone large-scale
   degradation in recent times due to extensive land use changes and
   drainage associated with their conversion for economic gains, and
   resulting fires during dry periods. This has had detrimental impacts on
   key peatland ecosystem processes and services such as hydrology, peat
   formation, carbon storage, fire prevention and biodiversity.
   Palaeoecological and geochemical proxies have been increasingly used in
   tropical peatland studies to extend contemporary instrumental records of
   peat conditions. Despite not yet being used to actively inform tropical
   peatland degradation and restoration interventions, these proxies are
   able to provide long-term trends in responses, resilience (threshold)
   and feedback processes of vegetation dynamics, groundwater level, peat
   pH, peat decomposition and accumulation rates, and degradation history.
   In this review, through the assessment of relevant tropical peatland
   studies in SEA, the palaeoecological and geochemical proxies were
   evaluated for their potential to reconstruct long-term peatland
   responses to climatically and anthropogenically-driven degradation. This
   information can potentially be utilised to provide better understanding
   of the extent of degradation and assist with the development of
   restoration management plans in SEA through its application in
   peat-hydrology restoration models.},

Abstract = {Bacillus velezensis is considered as model species for plant-associated
   bacilli providing benefits to its host such as protection against
   phytopathogens. This is mainly due to the potential to secrete a wide
   range of secondary metabolites with specific and complementary
   bioactivities. This metabolite arsenal has been quite well defined
   genetically and chemically but much remains to be explored regarding how
   it is expressed under natural conditions and notably how it can be
   modulated upon interspecies interactions in the competitive rhizosphere
   niche. Here, we show that B. velezensis can mobilize a substantial part
   of its metabolome upon the perception of Pseudomonas, as a soil-dwelling
   competitor. This metabolite response reflects a multimodal defensive
   strategy as it includes polyketides and the bacteriocin amylocyclicin,
   with broad antibiotic activity, as well as surfactin lipopeptides,
   contributing to biofilm formation and enhanced motility. Furthermore, we
   identified the secondary Pseudomonas siderophore pyochelin as an
   info-chemical, which triggers this response via a mechanism independent
   of iron stress. We hypothesize that B. velezensis relies on such
   chelator sensing to accurately identify competitors, illustrating a new
   facet of siderophore-mediated interactions beyond the concept of
   competition for iron and siderophore piracy. This phenomenon may thus
   represent a new component of the microbial conversations driving the
   behavior of members of the rhizosphere community.},

Abstract = {Subducting oceanic crusts release fluids rich in biologically relevant
   compounds into the overriding plate, fueling subsurface
   chemolithoautotrophic ecosystems. To understand the impact of subsurface
   geochemistry on microbial communities, we collected fluid and sediments
   from 14 natural springs across a similar to 200 km transect across the
   Costa Rican convergent margin and performed shotgun metagenomics. The
   resulting 404 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) duster into
   geologically distinct regions based on MAG abundance patterns: outer
   forearc-only (25\% of total relative abundance), forearc/arc-only (38\%
   of total relative abundance), and delocalized (37\% of total relative
   abundance) clusters. In the outer forearc, The rmodesulfovibrionia,
   Candidatus Bipolaricaulia, and Firmicutes have hydrogenotrophic sulfate
   reduction and Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) carbon fixation pathways. In the
   forearc/arc, Anaerolineae, Ca. Bipolaricaulia, and
   Thermodesulfovibrionia have sulfur oxidation, nitrogen cycling,
   microaerophilic respiration, and WL, while Aquificae have aerobic sulfur
   oxidation and reverse tricarboxylic acid carbon fixation pathway.
   Transformation-based canonical correspondence analysis shows that MAG
   distribution corresponds to concentrations of aluminum, iron, nickel,
   dissolved inorganic carbon, and phosphate. While delocalized MAGs appear
   surface-derived, the subsurface chemolithoautotrophic, metabolic, and
   taxonomic landscape varies by the availability of minerals/metals and
   volcanically derived inorganic carbon. However, the WL pathway persists
   across all samples, suggesting that this versatile, energy-efficient
   carbon fixation pathway helps shape convergent margin subsurface
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) environment plays a critical role in shaping
   enteric infections. Host environmental factors create bottlenecks,
   restrictive events that reduce the genetic diversity of invading
   bacterial populations. However, the identity and impact of bottleneck
   events on bacterial infection are largely unknown. We used Citrobacter
   rodentium infection of mice, a model of human pathogenic Escherichia
   coli infections, to examine bacterial population dynamics and quantify
   bottlenecks to host colonization. Using Sequence Tag-based Analysis of
   Microbial Populations (STAMP) we characterized the founding population
   size (Nb') and relatedness of C. rodentium populations at relevant
   tissue sites during early- and peak-infection. We demonstrate that the
   GI environment severely restricts the colonizing population, with an
   average Nb' of only 12-43 lineages (of 2,000+ inoculated) identified
   regardless of time or biogeographic location. Passage through gastric
   acid and escape to the systemic circulation were identified as major
   bottlenecks during C. rodentium colonization. Manipulating such events
   by increasing gastric pH dramatically increased intestinal Nb'.
   Importantly, removal of the stomach acid barrier had downstream
   consequences on host systemic colonization, morbidity, and mortality.
   These findings highlight the capability of the host GI environment to
   limit early pathogen colonization, controlling the population of initial
   founders with consequences for downstream infection outcomes.},

Title = {Host Developmental Stage Effects on Parasite Resistance and Tolerance},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Hosts can defend themselves against parasites either by preventing or
   limiting infections (resistance) or by limiting parasite-induced damage
   (tolerance). However, it remains underexplored how these defense types
   vary over host development with shifting patterns of resource allocation
   priorities. Here, we studied the role played by developmental stage in
   resistance and tolerance in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). This
   anadromous fish has distinct life stages related to living in freshwater
   and seawater. We experimentally exposed 1-year-old salmon, either at the
   freshwater stage or at the stage transitioning to the marine phase, to
   the trematode Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. Using 56 pedigreed families
   and multivariate animal models, we show that developmental transition is
   associated with reduced resistance but does not affect tolerance.
   Furthermore, by comparing tolerance slopes (host fitness against
   parasite load) based on additive genetic effects among infected and
   unexposed control relatives, we observed that the slopes can be largely
   independent of the infection, that is, they may not reflect tolerance.
   Together, our results suggest that the relative importance of different
   defense types may vary with host development and emphasize the
   importance of including control treatments for more confident
   interpretations of tolerance estimates.},

Abstract = {The diversity, co-occurrence patterns, and assembly processes of
   microbial eukaryotes (0.2-20 mu m) in Antarctic freshwater lakes are not
   well understood, despite their wide distribution and ecological
   importance. This study used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to
   investigate the microbial eukaryotic communities of five freshwater
   lakes on the Fildes Peninsula over three summer seasons. A total of 28
   phyla were detected, with phytoplankton occupying the highest percentage
   of sequences (accounting for up to 98 \%). The dominant taxa consisted
   of Chrysophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cryptophyta. The species richness
   (113-268) and Shannon index (1.70-3.50) varied among the lakes, with
   higher values recorded in Lake Chang Hu and Lake Kitec and the lowest
   value obtained for Lake Yue Ya. There were significant differences
   between the microbial eukaryotic communities of the lakes, with spatial
   and temporal heterogeneity in the relative abundance of the dominant
   taxa (P < 0.05). Environmental variables explained about 39 \% of the
   variation in community structures, with water temperature and phosphate
   identified as the driving factors (P < 0.05). Network analysis revealed
   comprehensive co-occurrence relationships (positive correlation 82 \%
   vs. negative correlation 18 \%). The neutral community model revealed
   that neutral processes explained more than 55 \% of the community
   variation. Stochastic processes (e.g. homogenizing dispersal and
   undominated processes) predominated in community assembly over the
   deterministic processes. These findings demonstrate the diversity of the
   microbial eukaryotic communities in the freshwater lakes of the Fildes
   Peninsula and have important implications for understanding the
   community assembly in these ecosystems.},

   succession), and the Caragana korshinskii (late succession) were
   selected to investigate the effect of AMF on the growth of psammophytes
   in different successional stages. We found that the mycorrhizal
   colonization of late-successional psammophytes with the AMF was greater
   than that of the early and mid-successional psammophytes. The effect of
   AMF on drought resistance was stronger in late-successional psammophytes
   and the promotion effect increased with the intensity of drought. The
   AMF reduced the difference between aboveground and belowground plant
   growth and promoted more belowground growth of psammophytes in the
   late-successional stage. We concluded that AMF can enhance the drought
   resistance of psammophytes and has a more significant effect on the
   growth of plants from the late-successional stage. This study
   highlighted the importance of AMF for psammophytes, providing a new
   approach to improving the growth of psammophytes under drought
   circumstances.},

Title = {Setting the stage for the restoration of an Annona glabra swamp after
   exotic grass invasion},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 NOV 2},
Abstract = {The expansion of cattle ranching in the coastal plain of the Gulf of
   Mexico is transforming freshwater swamps resulting in the reduction of
   swamps area and the introduction of invasive exotic grasses. This study
   seeks to determine the structure of the remaining population of Annona
   glabra in a grassland, evaluate vegetation and environmental conditions
   of the grassland, and determine the germination capability of A. glabra
   under different cover conditions of grass growth and two flood levels.
   The study area is a flooded grassland invaded by Echinochloa pyramidalis
   in central Veracruz, Gulf of Mexico. In the grassland, we censused and
   mapped the remaining individuals of A. glabra. We sampled the vegetation
   and measured the physicochemical characteristics of the soil and water.
   To evaluate the effect of the invasive grass on the germination of A.
   glabra seeds, we designed two greenhouse experiments: one (E1) under
   soil moisture at field capacity and another (E2) under flooded
   conditions. We found 312 remnant individuals. We recorded 31 plant
   species, most (72.7\%) classified as aquatic/semiaquatic. The relative
   importance value was highest for E. pyramidalis, Mimosa pigra, and
   Eleocharis mutata. BEST analysis did not detect significant correlations
   between vegetation and physicochemical variables, indicating homogeneous
   environmental conditions. Seed germination was above 80\% in E1 and
   below 20\% in E2 in all grass cover levels. Although flooding decreases
   germination rates, substantial proportion of seeds can germinate,
   suggesting that natural succession is viable. Based on our results, the
   flooded grassland has conditions to restore swamp.},

Title = {The COVID-19 pandemic changes citizens' visual aesthetic perceptions and
   attitudes toward restored landscape in the karst area in China},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Landscape change caused by ecological restoration projects in the karst
   rocky desertification area of southwestern China has presented
   ecological benefits, yet the visual aesthetic perception of the restored
   landscape has received less attention. Meanwhile, given the
   unpredictable worldwide health emergency caused by the COVID-19
   pandemic, it inspired us to be concerned about will citizens' aesthetic
   perceptions and attitudes to the change of restored landscape from
   pre-COVID-19 to during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizing
   an online survey, we explored citizens' visual aesthetic perceptions and
   attitudes to natural restored landscape (NRL) and managed restored
   landscape (MRL) on 757 citizens in Shilin Geopark (in Kunming, China),
   as well as how citizens' sociocultural backgrounds influence visual
   aesthetic preference. The results indicated that before the COVID-19
   pandemic, the professionals preferred NRL, while the nonprofessionals
   presented a higher preference for MRL. However, during the COVID-19
   pandemic, both two groups showed a higher preference for NRL, which
   implied that the experience of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic
   might awaken most citizens' preference for the NRL. Among different
   kinds of restored plant communities, the landscape dominated by shrubs
   was the most popular. Furthermore, gender, age, career type, education,
   region, and citizens' visit frequency were significantly correlated with
   visual aesthetic perceptions before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the
   COVID-19 pandemic, professional background, gender, and age did not show
   significant impacts on visual aesthetic perceptions anymore. These
   results highlight the necessity of understanding visual aesthetic
   perceptions in different sociodemographic groups to encourage natural
   succession and create a nature-based restored landscape in the karst
   area.},

Title = {The Evolution of Blue Carbon Science},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {`Blue carbon' was coined over a decade ago to describe the contribution
   of mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes to carbon drawdown in coasts
   and oceans, concomitantly attracting attention of policy-makers and
   resource managers to their potential as a natural climate solution.
   Here, we explore the emergence and evolution of this relatively new
   research field through bibliometrics approaches to investigate patterns
   and trends in scientific publications through time. Our aim was to
   understand the evolution of blue carbon science, from where we came from
   and where we are now. We analysed 1,729 papers from 5,763 authors.
   Overall, the carbon-sink capacity of these ecosystems has been
   recognised long before the term `blue carbon' was coined; with an annual
   percentage growth rate of 20\% y(-1). Research attention was highest for
   mangroves (similar to 38\% of publications), followed by saltmarshes
   (similar to 22\%), and seagrasses (similar to 18\%); while similar to
   16\% of the studies included two or more blue carbon ecosystems and 5\%
   of the studies focused on other ecosystems. The citation burst analysis
   showed that, in the 1990s, the hot topic (i.e., fast-growing topic) was
   related to the overall flux and dynamics of carbon, with a recent
   transition to the role of coastal vegetation to climate change
   mitigation from 2009. The term `blue carbon' became a hot topic in 2017,
   with the strongest citation burst between 2017 and 2020. This
   bibliometric study draws the patterns and trends of blue carbon science
   and indicate that this field is evolving through time to focus more on
   the blue carbon role as nature climate solutions.},

Title = {Effects of Landscape Heterogeneity at Multiple Spatial Scales on Paddy
   field-breeding Frogs in a Large Alluvial Plain in Japan},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Enhancing the environmental heterogeneity of habitats is essential to
   decelerate the degradation of biodiversity in rice paddy ecosystems
   caused by the recent rapid changes in agricultural landscapes. However,
   paddy field environments hierarchically belong to agricultural
   landscapes and river basins. Therefore, the spatial scale of
   environmental heterogeneity affecting the distribution patterns and
   abundance of the organisms inhabiting paddy fields, such as frog
   species, varies. Thus, in the Kanto Plain, the largest alluvial plain in
   Japan, we conducted an extensive frog survey to ascertain multiple
   spatial scale heterogeneities of frog abundance in relation to
   topography, climate, land use pattern, and features of paddy fields.
   Across 200 field sites, five frog species were detected during calling
   surveys. The statistical, niche and abundance models revealed
   differences in distribution patterns, spatial heterogeneity of
   abundance, and environmental preference of these frogs at the spatial
   levels of river basins, landscapes, and paddy fields. While the
   distribution pattern and abundance of Zhangixalus schlegelii were
   affected by the percentage of forest area, those of Pelophylax porosus
   porosus were sensitive to features relating to water availability of the
   paddy fields. Despite the small diversity of species detected, the
   presence of two species with unique habitat preferences revealed
   significant benefits of habitat heterogeneity in the agricultural
   landscape, allowing us to suggest management strategies for improving
   frog diversity in agricultural landscapes dominated by paddy fields.},

Title = {Identifying spatio-temporal trends in seagrass meadows to inform future

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Seagrass restoration requires information on a range of factors
   including site environmental conditions, appropriate planting
   techniques, and the identification of sites most likely to support
   seagrass. To address the question of where to focus restoration efforts,
   a key first step is to identify trends in the spatio-temporal
   distribution of seagrasses to identify areas of persistence, loss, and
   recent gains. Areas of recent recovery (and adjacent areas), can then be
   targeted by practitioners for assisted recovery and restoration, whilst
   areas of persistent loss can be avoided. Here we identified the
   contemporary distribution, density, and species composition of seagrass
   ecosystems (using Sentinel 2 imagery and supervised object-based imagery
   analysis) and integrated these data with historic extents to identify
   spatio-temporal trends in seagrass distribution in Western Port,
   Victoria, Australia. Contemporary classifications demonstrated
   acceptable accuracies (Overall Accuracy 0.77-0.85, User Accuracy
   0.76-0.97) and predicted a contemporary seagrass extent of 222 km(2);
   with 48 km(2) of low-density recovery predicted to have occurred since
   1999. Comparisons with historical seagrass extents indicated some
   seagrass recovery since large-scale losses in 1983, although some areas
   of loss were also present. Recovery included a net gain of approximately
   95 km(2) in the past 20 years and an eastward range expansion;
   suggesting environmental conditions have improved and are now conducive
   for restoration efforts in some areas. Results demonstrate that
   accurate, low-cost, remote sensing of seagrass ecosystems is possible
   and show how understanding spatio-temporal trends can guide the spatial
   allocation of resources by prioritizing areas for restoration where
   recovery is beginning to occur.},

Abstract = {Ansupa, the largest freshwater lake in Odisha state, a Ramsar Site has
   immense significance for biodiversity and provisioning services. In
   light of its wide range of social and economic benefits and many effects
   on human well-being, the present study attempts to determine local
   stakeholders' dependency, resource use, knowledge, and perception of
   wetland conservation. We conducted 120 household surveys in villages
   adjacent to Ansupa Lake. We used a questionnaire with both open-ended
   and closed-ended questions to obtain information on the socioeconomic
   profile of the villagers, their dependencies, and their perceptions of
   lake conservation. We used a Likert scale to measure respondents'
   perceptions and ordinal regression to analyse the datasets. The survey
   found that people living on the lake's fringes depend directly or
   indirectly on it, regardless of their economic status. Nearly 40\% of
   the respondents relied entirely on the lake for their livelihood.
   Irrigation, pisciculture, non-timber forest products, and fodder are
   economic benefits derived from the lake. In this context, the findings
   of the study highlight a substantial link between dependency, benefits,
   and education, influencing residents' perceptions of the lake. Further,
   our study could be helpful to society in terms of Ansupa lake
   conservation and management planning, as well as the government in
   involving locals in lake conservation initiatives and decision-making
   processes.},

Title = {Small Contribution of Schoenoplectus acutus (Emergent Macrophyte) to
   Nitrogen Removal from Wastewater Effluent Input to a Restored Prairie
   Wetland Complex},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Natural and constructed wetlands have been successful in remediating
   municipal and industrial wastewater effluent before it is discharged to
   downstream watersheds. There are several wetland ecosystem processes
   that can contribute to retention or removal of elements input in
   wastewater, although their relative importance is uncertain and variable
   among different wetlands. In this study we combined measurements of
   plant biomass production, nutrient content and stable nitrogen isotope
   compositions (delta N-15) in Schoenoplectus acutus to determine the role
   of these dominant emergent aquatic plants in uptake and removal of
   wastewater nitrogen input to the Frank Lake (Alberta, Canada) wetland
   complex. Municipal and industrial wastewater effluent enters Frank Lake
   in Basin 1 and water flow is directed through Basin 2 and Basin 3 before
   input to the Little Bow River. Plant and sediment delta N-15 values (>
   15 parts per thousand) showed extreme enrichment of N-15 illustrating
   incorporation of effluent-derived nitrogen in the wetland complex.
   Nitrogen uptake by emergent plant biomass contributed approximately
   8.7\% of the total removal of that nutrient from Basin 1, while
   sequestration of nitrogen in lake sediments (25-50\%) was a more
   important mechanism of nitrogen retention/removal. The relatively high
   plant delta N-15 values in Basins 1 and 2 were consistent with
   significant rates of denitrification occurring in those areas of the
   wetland.},

Title = {Tree logs for grassland restoration? Lessons from an unintentional
   experiment},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {For subtropical Brazilian grasslands, few restoration techniques are
   established, and seeds of native grassland species are not available on
   the market. Here, we evaluated the effect of physical barriers (PB) on
   vegetation recovery in a degraded grassland. We considered species that
   exhibit attributes in their diaspores that facilitate dispersal as
   well-dispersed species (WDS) and compared the proportion of WDS at our
   site to their proportion in the regional species pool. To analyze plots
   near and distant from the PB, we calculated the extrapolated metrics by
   an asymptotic estimator (double sample size of each distance). We found
   74 species in the degraded area, with higher richness and Shannon
   diversity values closer to logs, but higher Simpson values with larger
   distance from logs. Almost half of the species in the degraded area are
   WDS, more than in the regional species pool. While effects of logs on
   microsite conditions may also play a role (e.g. logs accumulating
   organic material or increasing soil moisture, providing shade), our data
   indicates that the PB works as a seed trap favoring the occurrence of
   WDS. It seems promising to develop applications in restoration,
   especially when associating PB with other restoration techniques to
   increase availability of adequate germination and establishment
   conditions.},

Title = {The acceptable range of variation within the desirable stable state as a
   measure of restoration success},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is standard practice to compare the status of performance indicators
   between restoration and reference sites to monitor restoration progress
   and demonstrate restoration success. However, standard methods for
   defining the reference ecosystem, selecting reference sites, and
   measuring success are surprisingly lacking. Our study develops these
   methods based on the acceptable range of variation (ARV) within the
   desirable stable (reference) state as a measure of restoration success.
   The method (1) constrains application to the contemporary landscape to
   avoid the problematic historical range of variation concept and
   idealized restoration targets; (2) acknowledges the theory of
   alternative stable states and ecosystem dynamics and posits that the
   reference ecosystem should be clearly defined as a desirable stable
   (reference) state; and (3) shows that identifying an acceptable thematic
   (classification) scale and an acceptable management timeframe is
   essential to defining the desirable stable (reference) state. We present
   two approaches to calculating an ARV and a simulation method to explore
   reference site replication sufficiency. We apply the methods to two
   contrasting Australian restoration case studies and recommend that
   routine adoption of these methods would make a significant contribution
   to the science and practice of restoration ecology and to the assessment
   of restoration success.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The strategy of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
   identifies three pathways for action for overcoming six global barriers
   thought to hamper upscaling. We evaluated 6,023 peer-reviewed and gray
   literature papers published over the last two decades to map the
   information landscape underlying the barriers and associated pathways
   for action across world regions, terrestrial ecosystem types,
   restorative interventions and their outcomes. Overall, the literature
   addressed more the financial and legislative barriers than the technical
   and research-related ones, supporting the view that social, economic and
   political factors hamper scaling up ecosystem restoration. Latin
   America, Africa, and North America were the most prominent regions in
   the literature, yet differed in the number of publications addressing
   each barrier. An overwhelming number of publications focused on forests
   (78\%), while grasslands (6\%), drylands (3\%), and mangroves (2\%)
   received less attention. Across the three pathways for action, the
   action lines on (1) promoting long-term ecosystem restoration actions
   and monitoring and (2) education on restoration were the most
   underrepresented in the literature. In general, restorative
   interventions assessed rendered positive outcomes except those of a
   political, legislative or financial nature which reported negative or
   inconclusive outcomes. Our indicative assessment reveals critical
   information gaps on barriers, pathways, and types of restorative
   interventions across world regions, particularly related to specific
   social issues such as education for ecosystem restoration. Finally, we
   call for refining ``strength of evidence{''} assessment frameworks that
   can systematically appraise, synthesize and integrate information on
   traditional and practitioner knowledge as two essential components for
   improving decision-making in ecosystem restoration.},

Title = {Responses of biological soil crusts to different types of vegetation
   restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau: a case study},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 20},
Abstract = {Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are important components of dryland
   ecosystems. Vegetation strongly affects the distribution of biocrusts by
   influencing the soil stability, moisture and light availability. The
   Loess Plateau has been subjected to large-scale restoration efforts;
   however, the type, coverage, and biomass of biocrusts responses to
   different types of vegetation restoration remain uncertain. Here, we
   investigated the biocrust characteristics (type, coverage, thickness,
   biomass, dominant cryptogam species, and relative abundance of major
   cyanobacteria and algae) in areas restored with different types of
   vegetation (Caragana korshinskii, Platycladus orientalis, Armeniaca
   sibirica, Populus hopeiensis, Pinus tabuliformis, Tamarix chinensis) and
   in a natural grassland on the Loess Plateau. Our results showed that the
   coverage, thickness, and biomass of the biocrusts were higher in the
   natural grassland than in the afforested areas, which suggests that the
   natural grassland is more suitable than the afforested areas for
   biocrust distribution. The biocrusts were composed mainly of mosses in
   the Pi. tabuliformis area and of cyanobacteria and algae in most of the
   other vegetation restoration areas. However, no biocrusts were observed
   in the T. chinensis area, probably because the dense canopy prevented
   light from reaching the soil. In addition, soil properties influenced by
   vegetation restoration may also affect the characteristics of biocrusts.
   Overall, our study suggests that natural grassland recovery, rather than
   afforestation, is likely the most suitable method for the development of
   biocrusts and provides suggestions for restoration and reconstruction on
   the Loess Plateau.},

Abstract = {Edges between adjacent biotopes may hinder or promote spillover of
   arthropods, influencing their distribution across landscapes. An
   understanding of spillover between natural and production areas enables
   management of edge effects for optimal biodiversity conservation. We
   assessed arthropod assemblages across vineyard-fynbos edges in the Cape
   Floristic Region of South Africa, where biodiversity-rich fynbos often
   borders vineyards. Species richness, assemblage composition, and
   compartmentalised beta-diversity (species turnover and nestedness) were
   assessed for three vegetation layers (ground level, lower vegetation,
   and upper vegetation) to determine bidirectional spillover. Species were
   also categorised according to biotope affiliation (crop-associated,
   fynbos-associated, or ubiquitous), based on habitat fidelity. We
   assessed how species richness of each biotope affiliation was influenced
   by environmental and management variables. Our main interest was
   biotope-specific variables which may enhance or impede spillover by
   influencing arthropods affiliated with the opposite biotope. Arthropod
   species richness did not differ along vineyard-fynbos transects for
   ground and lower vegetation layers but was lower in the upper vineyard
   vegetation compared to fynbos. Arthropod assemblages were distinct
   between biotopes for upper and lower vegetation but were similar on the
   soil surface and showed lower nestedness differences, indicating greater
   spillover by ground-level arthropods. In vineyards, no variables
   influenced fynbos-associated species, although herbaceous vegetation
   cover promoted ubiquitous arthropod species richness. Spillover between
   the biotopes was limited, and no drivers could be identified that
   promote spillover into vineyards, yet both biotopes supported diverse
   and distinct arthropod assemblages. Therefore, conservation of natural
   fynbos patches alongside sensitively managed vineyards is feasible for
   harmonising biodiversity conservation and viticulture.},

Title = {Evolutionary Determinants of Nonseasonal Breeding in Wild Chacma Baboons},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},

Abstract = {Animal reproductive phenology varies from strongly seasonal to
   nonseasonal, sometimes among closely related or sympatric species. While
   the extent of reproductive seasonality is often attributed to
   environmental seasonality, this fails to explain many cases of
   nonseasonal breeding in seasonal environments. We investigated the
   evolutionary determinants of nonseasonal breeding in a wild primate, the
   chacma baboon (Papio ursinus), living in a seasonal environment with
   high climatic unpredictability. We tested three hypotheses proposing
   that nonseasonal breeding has evolved in response to (1) climatic
   unpredictability, (2) reproductive competition between females favoring
   birth asynchrony, and (3) individual, rank-dependent variations in
   optimal reproductive timing. We found strong support for an effect of
   reproductive asynchrony modulated by rank: (i) birth synchrony is costly
   to subordinate females, lengthening their interbirth intervals; (ii)
   females alter their reproductive timings (fertility periods and
   conceptions) in relation to previous conceptions in the group; and (iii)
   the reported effect of birth synchrony on interbirth intervals weakens
   the intensity of reproductive seasonality at the population level. This
   study emphasizes the importance of sociality in mediating the evolution
   of reproductive phenology in group-living organisms, a result of broad
   significance for understanding key demographic parameters driving
   population responses to increasing climatic fluctuations.},

Title = {Exploring Conditions That Strengthen or Weaken the Ecological and
   Evolutionary Consequences of Phenological Synchrony},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Climate change-driven phenological shifts alter the temporal
   distributions of natural populations and communities, but we have little
   understanding of how these shifts affect natural populations. Using
   agent-based models, we show that the interaction of within-population
   synchrony (individual variation in timing) and timing of interspecific
   interactions shapes ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations
   within a seasonal cycle. Low-synchrony populations had lower survival
   and biomass but relatively stronger individuals. These effects were
   surprisingly robust and did not require size-based competitive
   asymmetries. However, reducing population synchrony could either
   negatively or positively affect population demography depending on
   whether the phenology of the focal species was advanced or delayed
   relative to its competitor. Furthermore, selection for earlier hatching
   increased when the interspecific competitor arrived earlier and when
   population synchrony was high. These results emphasize the importance of
   variation in the phenology of individuals within populations to better
   understand species interactions and predict ecological and evolutionary
   outcomes of phenological shifts.},

Title = {Group composition impacts reproductive output and population viability
   in captive white rhinoceros},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {290-302},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Captive breeding programmes can play an important role in the
   conservation of species threatened with extinction in the wild. White
   rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, have suffered drastic declines due to
   illegal poaching across their range, and captive populations have the
   potential to safeguard this species from extinction. However, white
   rhinoceros birth rates in captivity have been extremely low, and there
   is substantial variation in breeding success between different
   institutions. A better understanding of the factors limiting their
   reproduction in captivity could improve their breeding management and
   conservation potential. This study used studbook data (n = 467) and
   comparisons with wild populations in Kenya (n = 236) to assess the
   breeding performance and viability of the European captive southern
   white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum simum, population. Our results
   show that the European population is declining 2\% annually under
   current demographic parameters. On average, just 10\% of females calved
   annually, in comparison to almost 40\% across wild populations. To
   become self-sustaining, this must increase to a minimum of 17\%, though
   reaching this target may lead to additional management challenges.
   Further analyses using studbook (n = 134 individuals) and
   multi-institutional questionnaire data (n = 20 institutions) suggest
   that modifying the social structure of captive groups could improve
   female breeding success. Institutions housing larger groups had
   proportionally greater breeding success, and females were more likely to
   copulate if housed with another breeding female, and more receptive to
   bulls if housed in a group with a lower mean age. These findings
   highlight the importance of considering social conditions in captive
   breeding programmes, particularly for species with complex social
   systems and low reproductive rates.},

Abstract = {The archaeal Asgard superphylum currently stands as the most promising
   prokaryotic candidate, from which eukaryotic cells emerged. This unique
   superphylum encodes for eukaryotic signature proteins (ESP) that could
   shed light on the origin of eukaryotes, but the properties and function
   of these proteins is largely unresolved. Here, we set to understand the
   function of an Asgard archaeal protein family, namely the ESCRT
   machinery, that is conserved across all domains of life and executes
   basic cellular eukaryotic functions, including membrane constriction
   during cell division. We find that ESCRT proteins encoded in Loki
   archaea, express in mammalian and yeast cells, and that the Loki
   ESCRT-III protein, CHMP4-7, resides in the eukaryotic nucleus in both
   organisms. Moreover, Loki ESCRT-III proteins associated with chromatin,
   recruited their AAA-ATPase VPS4 counterpart to organize in discrete foci
   in the mammalian nucleus, and directly bind DNA. The human ESCRT-III
   protein, CHMP1B, exhibited similar nuclear properties and recruited both
   human and Asgard VPS4s to nuclear foci, indicating interspecies
   interactions. Mutation analysis revealed a role for the N terminal
   region of ESCRT-III in mediating these phenotypes in both human and
   Asgard ESCRTs. These findings suggest that ESCRT proteins hold chromatin
   binding properties that were highly preserved through the billion years
   of evolution separating Asgard archaea and humans. The conserved
   chromatin binding properties of the ESCRT membrane remodeling machinery,
   reported here, may have important implications for the origin of
   eukaryogenesis.},

Title = {Can the extinction risk of Irish vascular plants be predicted using leaf
   traits?},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13-14},
Pages = {3113-3135},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Globally, 39\% of vascular plant species are estimated to be threatened
   with extinction. Many factors are responsible for this figure; however,
   in numerous regions the primary drivers of plant extinction remain
   unknown. In this study, leaf traits were examined to determine whether
   there is an association between any specific leaf trait and extinction
   risk for the Irish flora. Ireland has a relatively small flora that is
   influenced by a temperate, oceanic climate. Fourteen leaf traits were
   measured for 1,029 angiosperm taxa, primarily from online herbarium
   images. Extinction risk was based on national Red List assessments for
   the Irish flora. Multivariate analysis of the data showed no correlation
   between leaf traits and extinction risk for the Irish flora. One-way
   ANOVA and Pearson's Chi-squared tests largely supported this result,
   with some indication that leaf teeth may be associated with extinction
   risk. The correlation of extinction risk and leaf traits with
   phylogenetic relatedness was also considered, with the presence of a
   phylogenetic signal detected for the distribution of extinction risk
   across the Irish flora and significant phylogenetic signal observed for
   individual leaf traits. It was concluded that the leaf traits analysed
   do not significantly correlate with the extinction risk of the Irish
   flora and that leaf traits are not a good predictor of extinction risk
   for this flora.},

Title = {Effects of historical management on the vegetation and habitat
   properties of wet meadows in Germany},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wet meadows in Germany are of high conservational value with a strong
   decline over the last centuries. Occasionally, new meadows developed,
   providing us with the opportunity to compare vegetation and habitat
   properties of wet meadows with currently similar, but different
   historical management. We categorized the areas as ancient, old or
   young, according to the point of establishment and grassland continuity
   in the last two centuries. Several trends derived from other grassland
   types proved also to be true for wet meadows like a high diversity of
   vascular plants and Red List species in long-term managed grasslands.
   Old grasslands, established one to two centuries ago, exhibited the
   highest diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes, indicating
   additional plants arrived by seeding. We investigated species
   composition using ordination and indicator species. Ancient grasslands
   were characterized by plants adapted to wet meadows (Molinietalia) such
   as Rhinanthus serotinus. Young meadows were marked by plants revealing
   succession like Carex brizoides or a high productivity. A trend,
   contrary to other grassland types, was that most habitat properties
   exhibited no temporal pattern except habitat area and few soil
   attributes. Altogether, a stepwise intensification from ancient to young
   meadows was detected that reflects the fast development from traditional
   to modern agriculture. Including the grassland's history in conservation
   approaches and adapting the management accordingly will improve
   restoration attempts. Ancient and old grasslands provided more
   appropriate species for future wet meadows, whereas young grasslands
   often need a more intensive land use and would benefit from seeding to
   develop to species-rich meadows.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation in native grass seedling plastic trait response
   to water stress depends on the context of annual grass invasion},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Seed selection is critical for successful restoration in semiarid
   systems. In the Great Basin, drought and annual grass invasion are
   primary barriers to native perennial seedling establishment. Local seed
   sourcing is encouraged to overcome drought, as drier populations exhibit
   drought-adapted traits. Whether drought-adapted traits are also
   beneficial for resisting invasive annual grasses, however, is an
   outstanding question. Here, we evaluate seedling performance and trait
   expression of Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), a native perennial grass
   commonly used in restoration, in a factorial experiment that crossed
   seed source (five populations collected along an aridity gradient),
   water treatment (wet and dry), and competition (with and without
   cheatgrass). Seeds from the wettest site had the highest mean seedling
   establishment rate and biomass compared to seeds from drier sites.
   Establishment rate was sensitive to drought but not to cheatgrass
   competition, whereas biomass was sensitive to both stressors. Watering
   and competition treatments had a significant interaction effect on
   seedling trait expression. Specifically, without cheatgrass competition
   P. secunda exhibited more resource-conservative traits under drought,
   such as lower specific leaf area and higher proportion of fine roots,
   whereas the relationship shifted such that with cheatgrass competition
   P. secunda exhibited more resource-acquisitive traits under drought.
   Plasticity of seedling emergence and root length were negatively
   correlated with drought tolerance, which suggests no evidence for
   adaptive plasticity. As trait-based approaches are increasingly used for
   seed selection in the Great Basin, our results highlight that the
   predictive power of traits for drought depends on the context of annual
   grass invasion.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {3},
Pages = {316-329},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Elevational ranges within many taxa are greater in the north temperate
   region than the tropics. Two hypotheses to explain the pattern are,
   first, that large elevational ranges in the temperate region arise
   because species have evolved broad tolerance curves in response to
   seasonality and, second, that a low diversification rate in the
   temperate region (speciation minus extinction) has led to relatively few
   species, each of which occupies a large elevational range in the absence
   of competitors (character release). We build a quantitative genetic
   model of selection on a phenotypic trait, whereby increased tolerance is
   modeled as arising from plasticity in the trait. We show that broad
   tolerances result in evolution of large elevational ranges because they
   induce shallower genotypic clines and hence reduced maladaptive gene
   flow. The evolution of large elevational ranges results in relatively
   few competing species arranged along the elevational gradient at a
   species carrying capacity. In such saturated communities, species have
   much elevational overlap. In contrast, in similar-sized communities that
   could accommodate many more species, the resulting character release is
   associated with smaller elevational overlaps. Empirical assessment of
   these predictions should contribute to assessing any role for ecological
   limits in driving the latitudinal diversity gradient in species
   richness.},

Title = {Plant-Pollinator Specialization: Origin and Measurement of Curvature},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},
Number = {2},
Pages = {206-222},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {A feature of biodiversity is the abundance of curves displayed by organs
   and organisms. Curvature is a widespread, convergent trait that has
   important ecological and evolutionary implications. In pollination
   ecology, the curvature of flowers and pollinator mouthparts (e.g.,
   hummingbird bills) along the dorsiventral plane has been associated with
   specialization, competition, and species coexistence. Six differing
   methods have historically been used to measure curvature in pollination
   systems; we provide a solution to this inconsistency by defining
   curvature using well-established concepts from differential geometry.
   Intuitively, curvature is the degree to which a line is not straight,
   but more formally it is the rate at which the tangent of a curve changes
   direction with respect to arc length. Here, we establish a protocol
   wherein a line is fitted against landmarks placed on an image of a
   curved organ or organism, then curvature is computed at many points
   along the fitted line and the sum taken. The protocol is demonstrated by
   studying the development of nectar spur curvature in the flowering plant
   genus Epimedium (Berberidaceae). By clarifying the definition of
   curvature, our aim is to make the language of comparative morphology
   more precise and broadly applicable to capture other curved structures
   in nature.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest of South America supports a rich terrestrial
   biodiversity but has been reduced to only a small extent of its original
   forest cover. It hosts a large number of endemic mammalian species but
   our knowledge of arboreal mammal ecology and conservation has been
   limited because of the challenges of observing arboreal species from
   ground level. Camera trapping has proven to be an effective tool in
   terrestrial mammal monitoring but the technique has rarely been used for
   arboreal species. For the first time in the Atlantic Forest, we obtained
   data on the arboreal mammal community using arboreal camera trapping,
   focusing on Caparao National Park, Brazil. We placed 24 infrared camera
   traps in the forest canopy in seven areas within the Park, operating
   them continuously during January 2017-June 2019. During this period the
   camera traps accumulated 4,736 camera-days of footage and generated a
   total of 2,256 photographs and 30-s videos of vertebrates. The arboreal
   camera traps were able to detect arboreal mammals of a range of body
   sizes. The mammal assemblage comprised 15 identifiable species,
   including the Critically Endangered northern muriqui Brachyteles
   hypoxanthus and buffy-headed marmoset Callithrix flaviceps as well as
   other rare, nocturnal and inconspicuous species. We confirmed for the
   first time the occurrence of the thin-spined porcupine Chaetomys
   subspinosus in the Park. Species richness varied across survey areas and
   forest types. Our findings demonstrate the potential of arboreal camera
   trapping to inform conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {Upland peatlands are nationally and internationally important habitats
   that can provide a range of ecosystem services, but many are considered
   degraded by human activities. On Exmoor, (South West England, UK)
   restoration activities are often aimed at reversing the effects of
   nineteenth century agricultural `improvement' schemes, the effects of
   which are not yet fully understood. To develop this understanding,
   long-term ecological context is essential. We used sub-fossil pollen,
   plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, insects, coprophilous fungal spores
   and charcoal to study ecological conditions and disturbance regimes over
   the last similar to 7700 years at a site in Exmoor National Park
   ('Ricksy Ball'). Multivariate analyses were used to explore changes in
   ecological communities over time and a range of techniques were used to
   establish the chronology. During the last similar to 7700 years,
   anthropogenic disturbance regimes (burning, grazing, drainage) have
   varied through time, reflecting changing land use and management, the
   effects of which are evident in vegetation (pollen, plant macrofossils)
   and microbial (testate amoebae) communities. In particular, a
   combination of drainage and high-intensity grazing appears to have
   substantially altered local ecology during the nineteenth century,
   indicated by increases in coprophilous fungal spores and the loss of
   Sphagnum and associated biota. This occurred in the context of more
   gradual, centennial-scale declines in Sphagnum and microbial biovolumes.
   We provide a range of reference conditions and show that the moorland
   has been influenced by land management changes for millennia, and this
   may have been most pronounced during the nineteenth century. There is no
   single, readily identifiable, `stable' pre-drainage baseline.

Title = {Co-occurring bunchgrasses are associated with different plant species in
   dry pine savannas},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Grass species are often included during restoration to reinstate
   feedbacks with fire. In biodiverse pine savannas of the southeastern
   United States, wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) is the preferred
   candidate for restoring low-intensity fires through the understory. Less
   common but locally co-dominant in dry pine savannas, pineywoods dropseed
   (Sporobolus junceus) is another bunchgrass candidate for restoration. If
   two bunchgrass species associate with different suites of plants in the
   understory, restoring both could support a twofold goal of restoring
   fire regimes and plant biodiversity. To guide restoration goals, we
   tested the hypothesis that in natural (i.e. not recently restored) dry
   pine savannas in North Florida where wiregrass and dropseed are
   co-dominant, they are associated with different understory plant species
   richness, occurrence, and abundance under or adjacent to their canopies.
   Species richness of associated plants did not differ between bunchgrass
   species or with distance from bunchgrass (i.e. under vs. adjacent). Some
   associated plant species, however, were more likely to occur and had
   greater abundance with one or the other bunchgrass species irrespective
   of distance. Our results suggest that including more than one bunchgrass
   species in restoration plantings could increase dry pine savanna
   biodiversity while also reinstating plant-fire feedbacks.},

Title = {Post-fire restoration of Sphagnum bogs in the Tasmanian Wilderness World
   Heritage Area, Australia},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sphagnum bogs in Australia are small, with a limited distribution, but
   of high conservation value. They are restricted to cool, wet
   environments that are typically fire free and are poorly adapted to
   recover from fire disturbance, unlike most Australian flora. Increased
   fire activity due to anthropogenic climate change is threatening
   Sphagnum bogs. This increased threat has stimulated interest in their
   restoration. Compared with the northern hemisphere, there have been few
   studies of the ecology of Sphagnum restoration in the southern
   hemisphere. Here, we report on a field experiment in Tasmania, in an
   area burned by an extensive fire in 2016. We investigated the role of
   shade, fertilizer and transplants, factors demonstrated to be important
   in the restoration of burnt bogs on the Australian mainland. Treatments
   commenced three to 4 years after the fire. Overall, we found that
   fire-damaged Sphagnum recovers very slowly, and that there was no
   recovery in severely burned areas. The addition of shade increased
   recovery of damaged Sphagnum, but fertilizer was harmful, even to
   healthy Sphagnum. Transplants in fire-killed Sphagnum grew poorly in
   both moderately and severely burnt Sphagnum areas. Our findings support
   the use of shading in post-fire Sphagnum recovery projects, although
   further work is required to determine the optimal approach and duration
   of providing shade.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Sustainable ecotourism development and conservation depend on
   understanding factors that affect flagship species. This study analysed
   environmental factors and their effects on flagship species: African
   buffalo (Syncerus caffer), red-river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), olive
   baboon (Papio anubis), duiker (Cephalophus spp.), and crocodile
   (Crocodylus niloticus) distribution in Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary
   (BWS). Secondary data (camp reports 2017-2019) showed flagship species
   distribution across four vegetation types in 14 sites. Field
   observations were used to reconstruct camp report information using GPS
   coordinates to show animal distribution. Environmental factors were
   assessed based on the scope and severity of their threats to the
   species. PAST ver.3.06 was used to analyse animal and vegetation data. A
   total of 995 individual animals were recorded. Riverine forest (n = 325)
   had the highest, followed by semi-deciduous (n = 316), and woodland
   Savanna (n = 192). Bushfire was the major predictive factor on animal
   distribution, followed by grazing pressure, farming activities,
   elevation, and erosion. These findings imply that an increased scale of
   disturbances reduces the chance of sighting flagship animals. A higher
   concentration of these species in riverine and semi-deciduous forests
   calls for increased patrols as a conservation measure. Constructing
   viewing platforms and hiking trails in areas of higher animal activity
   would improve ecotourism development.},

Title = {Do Interactions among Microbial Symbionts Cause Selection for Greater
   Pathogen Virulence?},

Abstract = {The ecological and evolutionary consequences of microbiome treatments
   aimed at protecting plants and animals against infectious disease are
   not well understood, even as such biological control measures become
   more common in agriculture and medicine. Notably, we lack information on
   the impacts of symbionts on pathogen fitness with which to project the
   consequences of competition for the evolution of virulence. To address
   this gap, we estimated fitness consequences for a common plant pathogen,
   Ustilago maydis, over differing virulence levels and when the host plant
   (Zea mays) is coinfected with a defensive symbiont (Fusarium
   verticillioides) and compared these fitness estimates to those obtained
   when the symbiont is absent. Here, virulence is measured as the
   reduction in the growth of the host caused by pathogen infection.
   Results of aster statistical models demonstrate that the defensive
   symbiont most negatively affects pathogen infection and that these
   effects propagate through subsequent stages of disease development to
   cause lower pathogen fitness across all virulence levels. Moreover, the
   virulence level at which pathogen fitness is maximal is higher in the
   presence of the defensive symbiont than in its absence. Thus, as
   expected from theory for multiple parasites, competition from the
   defensive symbiont may cause selection for increased pathogen virulence.
   More broadly, we consider that the evolutionary impacts of interactions
   between pathogens and microbial symbionts will depend critically on
   biological context and environment and that interactions among diverse
   microbial symbionts in spatially heterogeneous communities contribute to
   the maintenance of the highly diverse symbiotic functions observed in
   these communities.},

Title = {Effects of Community Richness and Competitive Asymmetry on Protozoa
   Evolution in Sarracenia purpurea Leaves},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Predicting evolution in natural systems will require understanding how
   selection operates in multispecies communities. We predicted that the
   amount that traits evolve in multispecies mixtures would be less than
   the amount that would be predicted from the additive contributions of
   the pairwise interactions and that subordinate species will be more
   likely to evolve in competitive systems than dominant species. We
   conducted an experimental test of these predictions using a guild of
   protozoans found in the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant
   Sarracenia purpurea. The response to selection did not significantly
   change as we increased richness from monocultures to two- and
   four-species mixtures. In accordance with our second prediction,
   subordinate species demonstrated greater growth in competition after
   selection than before, while dominant species generally showed no
   response to selection. Monod-type experiments to determine minimum
   resource levels found that the dominant species had much higher resource
   requirements than the subordinate species and that the minimum resource
   requirements evolved to be higher in the subordinate species.
   Importantly, these results suggest that subordinate species evolve to
   become more similar to dominant species, which may involve resource use
   convergence. Our findings and other recent works suggest that community
   diversity can affect evolution in surprising ways that warrant further
   investigation.},

   Are Scale Dependent},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-64},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Pollen dispersal is a key evolutionary and ecological process, but the
   degree to which variation in the density of concurrently flowering
   conspecific plants (i.e., coflowering density) shapes pollination
   patterns remains understudied. We monitored coflowering density and
   corresponding pollination patterns of the insect-pollinated palm
   Oenocarpus bataua in northwestern Ecuador and found that the influence
   of coflowering density on these patterns was scale dependent: high
   neighborhood densities were associated with reductions in pollen
   dispersal distance and gametic diversity of progeny arrays, whereas we
   observed the opposite pattern at the landscape scale. In addition,
   neighborhood coflowering density also impacted forward pollen dispersal
   kernel parameters, suggesting that low neighborhood densities encourage
   pollen movement and may promote gene flow and genetic diversity. Our
   work reveals how coflowering density at different spatial scales
   influences pollen movement, which in turn informs our broader
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying patterns of genetic diversity
   and gene flow within populations of plants.},

Title = {Predicting and Measuring Decision Rules for Social Recognition in a

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Many animals use signals to recognize familiar individuals but risk
   making mistakes because the signal properties of different individuals
   often overlap. Furthermore, outcomes of correct and incorrect decisions
   yield different fitness payoffs, and animals incur these payoffs at
   different frequencies depending on interaction rates. To understand how
   signal variation, payoffs, and interaction rates shape recognition
   decision rules, we studied male golden rocket frogs, which recognize the
   calls of territory neighbors and are less aggressive to neighbors than
   to strangers. We first quantified patterns of individual variation in
   call properties and predicted optimal discrimination thresholds using
   signal variation. We then measured thresholds for discriminating between
   neighbors and strangers using a habituation-discrimination field
   playback experiment. Territorial males discriminated between calls
   differing by 9\%-12\% in temporal properties, slightly higher than the
   predicted thresholds (5\%-10\%). Finally, we used a signal detection
   theory model to explore payoff and interaction rate parameters and found
   that the empirical threshold matched those predicted under ecologically
   realistic assumptions of infrequent encounters with strangers and
   relatively costly missed detections of strangers. We demonstrate that
   receivers group continuous variation in vocalizations into discrete
   social categories and that signal detection theory can be applied to
   understand evolved decision rules.},

Title = {Plant-soil research empowers students to dig deeper into restoration
   ecology},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Training the next generation of applied ecologists is critical for
   combatting ongoing ecosystem degradation and meeting the rising demand
   for professionals in the ecological restoration economy. Despite growing
   interest, relatively few undergraduate programs are explicitly focused
   on restoration ecology. To adequately prepare students for future
   careers in restoration, educators should incorporate lessons on the
   science and practice of restoration into curricula of broader ecology
   courses. Given the interdisciplinary nature of restoration ecology,
   projects grounded in restoration science can be used by instructors to
   explore a broad range of topics. Course-based research aimed at solving
   local restoration problems is one powerful way to enhance students'
   ecological literacy and professional development as well as promote
   diversity in the field. In this paper, I describe an initiative in which
   undergraduates in my ecology course conducted their own experiments
   evaluating the effects of soil amendments on the performance of native
   plant species that are targets for restoration on our campus nature
   preserve. Students worked in groups to independently design and execute
   experiments, analyze data, and communicate their results in formal
   reports and presentations. Student projects represent useful case
   studies that highlight the influence of soil conditions on restoration
   outcomes. Results of assessment surveys also illustrate the tremendous
   benefits of student-led research on participants' scientific skills,
   learning experiences, and appreciation for applied science. A greater
   emphasis on restoration and inquiry-based learning in undergraduate
   ecology courses will ensure students pursuing careers in ecological
   restoration have the training necessary to meet the complex challenges
   of such endeavors.},

Title = {Early responses of regeneration to weeding and herbicide application to
   control Guinea-grass in a 20-year-old Atlantic Forest undergoing
   restoration},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 4},
Abstract = {Among the invasive grasses harming natural ecosystems in Brazil,
   Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus) has received significant attention
   due to its high invasive potential and damage it causes to restoration
   sites. Here, we show the response of seedlings (10 cm to 1 m) and
   saplings (>1 m) one year after Guinea-grass removal in a 20-year-old
   restoration site in the Atlantic Forest. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were
   installed and assigned into three treatments: control, mechanical
   removal using gas-trimmers, and mechanical removal followed by the
   application of Roundup Transorb R (glyphosate). Forest canopy and grass
   cover were also assessed. Guinea-grass was negatively correlated with
   woody species richness and abundance. Forest canopy cover was positively
   related to species richness and abundance, and negatively related to
   Guinea-grass. Treatments applied were successful in controlling the
   plant invader and did not cause any significant reduction in the total
   abundance or richness of saplings after one year. For seedlings,
   however, the abundance and richness of pioneer woody species increased
   over time with mechanical removal, while the abundance and richness of
   non-pioneer woody species decreased in plots treated with herbicide. We
   expect regeneration responses to continue to improve with time. Our
   results support the use of both herbicide and mechanical removal to
   reduce Guinea-grass in Atlantic Forest sites undergoing restoration,
   although the use of herbicide lowers native seedling richness in the
   short-term, while mechanical removal may be better for small sites,
   where it is more feasible and less demanding.},

   and functioning},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aging dams and the rising efforts to restore stream ecosystems are
   increasing the number of dam decommissioning programs. Although dam
   decommissioning aims at improving in-stream habitat, biodiversity, and
   ecosystem functioning in the long term, it might also cause ecological
   impacts in the short term due to the mobilization of the sediment
   accumulated in the reservoir. Benthic biofilm in particular can be
   impaired by episodes of high turbidity and scouring. We conducted a
   multiple before-after/control-impact experiment to assess the effects of
   the drawdown of a large dam (42 m tall), a first step to its
   decommissioning, on biofilm structure (biomass and chlorophyll-a) and
   functioning (metabolism, nutrient uptake, and organic matter breakdown).
   Our results show that the reservoir drawdown reduced the autotrophic
   biofilm biomass (chlorophyll-a) downstream from the dam, which in turn
   lowered metabolism. However, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by the
   biofilm was not affected. Organic matter breakdown was slower below the
   dam than in nearby undammed reaches before and during drawdown. All
   drawdown effects quickly disappeared and reaches downstream from the dam
   approached values found in nearby undammed reaches. Thus, our results
   indicate that the effects of reservoir drawdown on stream biofilms exist
   but may be small and disappear rapidly.},

Title = {Automatic recorders monitor wolves at rendezvous sites: do wolves adjust

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {We used automatic sound recorders to study spontaneous vocalizations of
   wild wolves during the pup-rearing season around rendezvous sites from
   24 wolf packs in six study areas across North America, Asia, and Europe.
   Between 2018 and 2021, for a total of 1225 pack-days, we recorded 605
   spontaneous wolf chorus howls and 224 solo-howl series. Howling
   occurrence varied across areas, from 12.50 to 94.12\% days with howling.
   Daily howling ranged from 0.00 to 3.47 solo howls/day and 0.13 to 5.29
   chorus howls/day. Generally, spontaneous chorus howls peaked between
   sunset and sunrise. Howling rate depended on area, pack size, and
   density of people living nearby, being greater where fewer people lived.
   High rates in Yellowstone National Park, (800,000+ visitors during the
   study) could reflect accommodation to human activities such as wolf
   watching. One to six automatic recorders per site within 1000 m of
   rendezvous sites needed 4-15 days to detect the pack (average 9.5) and
   5-21 days (average 11.3) to detect pups, both with a probability of
   95\%. Our results may guide wolf-monitoring programs using automatic
   sound recorders, a promising method offering advantages over howling
   surveys, especially in human-dominated landscapes.},

Abstract = {The central aim of this study is to estimate the current potential
   distribution of Turkey's forests and their composition in absence of
   anthropogenic landcover change, and in this manner to contribute to past
   studies on the distribution of European forest taxa by filling an
   important spatial gap. For our simulations, we used high resolution
   climate data from ERA5-Land and a process based dynamic regional to
   global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS), for which we modified the original
   European tree species list to match the climatic sensitivities that the
   species in turn exhibit throughout their natural ranges in Turkey,
   alternating between subspecies where necessary. This is the first
   application of LPJ-GUESS for the entire country using high resolution
   climate data. We defined the climatic tolerances for the model of three
   conifer species with wide distribution in Turkey: Pinus nigra, Pinus
   brutia, and Cedrus libani. We first identified relative bioclimatic
   tolerances of species for Turkey by way of comparing their current
   recorded distributions to ERA5-Land reanalysis data using observation
   data from the General Directorate of Forestry of Turkey, and later
   through ensemble runs with LPJ-GUESS we finetuned their parameters.
   Finally, we compared simulated net primary production to MODIS remote
   sensing observation estimates. In general, LPJ-GUESS captured the
   natural distribution ranges of different forest taxa, especially after
   the introduction of three additional species native to Turkey,
   highlighting competition for resources. Due to probable regional
   acclimatization of species, our final set of parameters for the
   different plant functional types offers a suitable alternative for
   future studies.},

Title = {Three birds with one stone? Sex ratios of seized critically endangered
   helmeted hornbill casques reveal illegal hunting of males, females and
   juveniles},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hunted wildlife can often be used to answer questions about wild
   individuals. Sex ratios of hunted individuals can be important for
   understanding changes in population demographics and viability. Here we
   determined the sex ratio of the illegally hunted helmeted hornbill
   Rhinoplax vigil, a critically endangered species from Southeast Asia, to
   examine their vulnerability to hunters. Using casques seized in Hong
   Kong SAR between 2012 and 2016, we identified the sex of seized
   individuals using morphological and molecular methods as well as
   discriminant analysis. As R. vigil females can spend up to 6 months of
   the year sealed into tree cavity nests, they are reliant on males for
   food. The unique breeding ecology of this elusive species means that
   males are more likely to be observed than females throughout the year.
   These behavioural differences mean that there are several potential
   outcomes which may be observed in the sex ratio of the seized casques,
   depending on hunting strategies. Our results suggest that sex
   identification is possible via visual inspection of the gular skin
   colour and beak-tip markings, but when these are not available, genetic
   methods or morphological measurements can be used. Our findings also
   indicated a primarily male-biased sex ratio across the seizures;
   however, females, as well as juveniles, were also present in seizures.
   Although removing one sex from the wild can cause shifts in demographic
   dynamics over time, illegal and unsustainable hunting of any measure of
   a critically endangered species will ultimately heighten its risk of
   extinction. These methods and results are useful to conservationists and
   researchers interested in further study of hornbill populations and
   their viability and are ultimately important for the conservation and
   management of this critically endangered species.},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Climate change is altering species' habitats, phenology, and behavior.
   Although sexual behaviors impact population persistence and fitness,
   climate change's effects on sexual signals are understudied. Climate
   change can directly alter temperature-dependent sexual signals, cause
   changes in body size or condition that affect signal production, or
   alter the selective landscape of sexual signals. We tested whether
   temperature-dependent mating calls of Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea
   multiplicata) had changed in concert with climate in the southwestern
   United States across 22 years. We document increasing air temperatures,
   decreasing rainfall, and changing seasonal patterns of temperature and
   rainfall in the spadefoots' habitat. Despite increasing air
   temperatures, spadefoots' ephemeral breeding ponds have been getting
   colder at most elevations, and male calls have been slowing as a result.
   However, temperature-standardized call characters have become faster,
   and male condition has increased, possibly due to changes in the
   selective environment. Thus, climate change might generate rapid,
   complex changes in sexual signals with important evolutionary
   consequences.},

Title = {Testing the importance of individual nest-site selection for a social

Abstract = {Nest-site selection by species is expected to be adaptive and lead to
   improved breeding productivity, but in some settings, there exist
   mismatches between preferred nesting habitat and breeding productivity.
   We tested the expectation that nest-site selection is adaptive in a
   sample of 63 nests of a long-lived social species that breeds and
   forages in groups: the critically endangered white-backed vulture (Gyps
   africanus). By studying breeding groups in the same area, we controlled
   for landscape-level effects on habitat selection and investigated how
   fine-scale nest-site characteristics affect breeding productivity. We
   developed models to assess how nine characteristics of nest sites
   selected by breeding vultures compared with 70 random trees and tested
   associations between these characteristics and breeding productivity.
   White-backed vultures selected nest sites in taller trees (>7 m), but
   neither tree height nor any other nest-site characteristics had a clear
   effect on breeding productivity. Vultures selected nest trees closer to
   each other than random trees, and the associations between nest density,
   nearest neighbour distance and breeding success were all positive. These
   positive associations and the absence of an observable effect between
   nest-site characteristics and breeding productivity suggest that for
   this semi-colonial breeder, the social imperative of proximity to
   conspecifics (i.e., nesting near other vultures and group foraging) may
   be more important than individual nest-site selection.},

Abstract = {Wildlife conservation is a big challenge for a developing country like
   Bangladesh. The present study claims that Bangladesh still lacks
   administrative, legislative, and technological capacities to protect and
   conserve biodiversity. This study finds that a great variety of wild
   animals and species is now under threat in Bangladesh due to factors
   like forest land grabbing, habitat destruction, human activities near
   the forests, human-animal interactions, illegal poaching and
   trafficking, excluding local communities in conservation process,
   socio-economic and political issues, and external problems like the
   refugee crisis and trans-border animal migration. In this paper, it is
   found that environmental crimes, specifically illicit wildlife crimes,
   have been increasing in Bangladesh in recent years, despite several
   legislations, including the prominent Wildlife (Conservation and
   Security) Act, 2012 (hereafter Wildlife Act 2012) and many international
   treaties, agreements, conventions, and protocols. To fully bear its
   responsibility to protect wildlife and conserve biodiversity, the author
   analyzes the role of the government through policy-making and
   implementation and the function of international institutions. Realizing
   the challenges in protecting wildlife and conserving biodiversity in
   Bangladesh, the author briefly points out the mitigation policies of the
   neighboring countries. The study data are based on reviewing existing
   literature, law and policy and referring to various international
   treaties and conventions.},

Title = {Diversity, diversification and distribution of Iranian vertebrates: the

Abstract = {Identifying historical drivers of biodiversity distribution patterns is
   a central issue in ecology and biogeography. Iran is a biodiversity-rich
   country in southwestern Asia. It is known that past events like climatic
   oscillations and mountains uplifting have had an outstanding impact on
   evolution, speciation, and diversification of biodiversity in the
   country. However, evidence of the impacts of past events on species
   distribution and genetic structure is sparse. Thus, in this paper, we
   have assembled the first review, combining results of different studies
   on different taxonomic groups (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and
   freshwater fishes) to identify the most important past events and
   geographical barriers that have shaped the current distribution patterns
   of vertebrate species and their genetic structure in Iran. We also
   presented the most comprehensive and updated checklist of vertebrate
   species of Iran. The vertebrates of Iran comprise 1317 species in 516
   genera, 167 families, and 53 orders, of which 180 species (13.67\% of
   total fauna) considered as endemic. By assessing 85 published papers we
   identified three major past events in Iran which are responsible for the
   current distribution patterns of vertebrate species and their genetic
   structure. These include mountain uplifting, past climatic oscillations,
   and sea level change. We also identified several geographical barriers
   which played a very critical role in shaping vertebrate species
   distribution patterns in Iran. The uplifting of the Zagros Mountains was
   the most important event that played a critical role in shaping the
   distribution and genetic structure of all vertebrate groups in Iran.
   Past climate change was found to be very influential in shaping species
   richness patterns, particularly reptile richness and genetic divergence
   patterns (Persian abstract presented in Online Resource 1).},

Abstract = {The monitoring of habitats at plant association level, has been
   developed by the French-National Forest Inventory (NFI) progressively
   since 2011, whereas ecological and floristic data exist since the
   mid-1980s. The NFI habitat monitoring is the French tool of surveillance
   of forest habitats decreed by Natura 2000 Directive (article 11).
   Determination of plant association in NFI plots concerns all the
   habitats, whether they are of community interest or not. The objective
   of this study is to compare different methods of automatic
   classification of floristic and ecological surveys into forest habitat
   groups. Indeed, enriching the old surveys, which contain only
   ecological, floristic and trees data, with information on habitats would
   increase the accuracy of the calculated statistical results on habitats.
   The uncertainty of the attribution of a habitat outside the field
   (ex-situ) by experts was quantified by comparison with the determination
   in the field (in situ). This result was used as a benchmark to compare
   to the error rates obtained by two methods of automatic classification:
   an algorithm inspired by the habitat identification key used in the
   field and Random forest, a learning classification method. The
   classification performance was evaluated for three levels of habitat
   groupings. The results showed that the lower the level of clustering,
   the higher the error rate. Depending on the classification method used
   and the level of aggregation, the error rates varied between 5 and 15\%.
   In all cases, the error rates were below the estimated uncertainty of
   the expert attribution of ex-situ habitat.},

Title = {Integrating habitat-masked range maps with quantifications of prevalence
   to estimate area of occupancy in IUCN assessments},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Estimates of species geographic ranges constitute critical input for
   biodiversity assessments, including those for the International Union
   for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.
   Area of occupancy (AOO) is one metric that IUCN uses to quantify a
   species' range, but data limitations typically lead to either under- or
   overestimates (and unnecessarily wide bounds of uncertainty).
   Fortunately, existing methods in which range maps and land-cover data
   are used to estimate the area currently holding habitat for a species
   can be extended to yield an unbiased range of plausible estimates for
   AOO. Doing so requires estimating the proportion of sites (currently
   containing habitat) that a species occupies within its range (i.e.,
   prevalence). Multiplying a quantification of habitat area by prevalence
   yields an estimate of what the species inhabits (i.e., AOO). For species
   with intense sampling at many sites, presence-absence data sets or
   occupancy modeling allow calculation of prevalence. For other species,
   primary biodiversity data (records of a species' presence at a point in
   space and time) from citizen-science initiatives and research
   collections of natural history museums and herbaria could be used. In
   such cases, estimates of sample prevalence should be corrected by
   dividing by the species' detectability. To estimate detectability from
   these data sources, extensions of inventory-completeness analyses merit
   development. With investments to increase the quality and availability
   of online biodiversity data, consideration of prevalence should lead to
   tighter and more realistic bounds of AOO for many taxonomic groups and
   geographic regions. By leading to more realistic and representative
   characterizations of biodiversity, integrating maps of current habitat
   with estimates of prevalence should empower conservation practitioners
   and decision makers and thus guide actions and policy worldwide.},

Title = {Identifying and developing effective post-2020 conservation bridging
   leaders},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective bridging leaders interact within and outside their group to
   facilitate collaboration required in multistakeholder contexts. This is
   particularly crucial to community-based conservation interventions that
   strive to achieve both ecological and social objectives by actively
   engaging or devolving decision-making and management authority to local
   communities. Although a viable approach in many contexts, achieving
   ``unprecedented collaboration{''} called for by the Post-2020 Global
   Biodiversity Framework in community-based conservation is problematic
   given the multiple and diverse actors affecting and affected by these
   interventions. Therefore, effective leadership becomes crucial to
   implementing necessary strategies to engage actors and resolve conflict
   inclusively. Yet, weak leadership commonly constrains these
   interventions. I reviewed relevant literature and devised a framework of
   effective bridging leadership characteristics. I then used this
   framework to appraise bridging leadership in two African coastal-marine
   community-based conservation cases. I employed social network analysis
   and semistructured and group interviews in the two cases. Several local
   leaders emerged as key (potential) bridging leaders. Furthermore, I
   found that effective bridging leaders require not only legal recognition
   but also perceived legitimacy resulting from building trust with other
   actors. Additionally, the inclusive collaboration required multiple
   sources of emotionally intelligent bridging leaders with the integrity,
   humility, empathy, and cultural awareness necessary to mitigate elite
   capture, effectively communicate, and empower and provide support to
   others. Because emotional intelligence in conservation leadership
   remains a knowledge gap, particularly in community-based conservation
   research, insights from this study should be useful to diverse
   conservation actors.},

Title = {Mounding treatments set back bryophyte recovery on linear disturbances
   in treed peatlands},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Treed peatlands are dominated by bryophytes, particularly Sphagnum spp.,
   which create the characteristic hummock-hollow microtopography. This, in
   turn, shapes the distribution of bryophyte communities. Disturbances can
   lead to a loss of this microtopographic variation, impacting the
   bryophyte community. Seismic lines are deforested linear disturbances
   (approximately 3-8 m wide) created during oil and gas exploration and
   very extensive in Alberta, Canada. Loss of microtopographic variation
   leads to slow tree recovery on seismic lines in treed peatlands. To
   facilitate tree establishment, mounding is being applied to restore the
   microtopography on seismic lines. We compared bryophyte communities on
   unmounded and mounded seismic lines (18 years after seismic line
   creation, 3 years after mounding), and in adjacent treed fens as the
   reference, to evaluate how recovery varies with microtopographic
   position (i.e., top of hummock, slope or side of the hummock, and level
   ground). We found that recovery on the unmounded seismic lines was
   underway 18 years after seismic lines were created, while mounding
   redisturbed the sites and thus set back recovery, at least in the short
   term (3 years post-mounding). In unmounded seismic lines, Sphagnum cover
   was similar to that of reference treatments at all microtopographic
   positions. In contrast, mounded seismic lines had lower Sphagnum cover
   and higher cover of true mosses (sans feather mosses) than reference and
   unmounded treatments. Overall, these results show mounding sets back the
   recovery of bryophyte communities-the very organisms responsible for the
   microtopographic variation we are trying to establish. Further
   monitoring is needed to understand how this changes over time.},

Title = {How does forest restoration affect the recovery of soil quality? A
   global meta-analysis for tropical and temperate regions},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Restoring forest ecosystems to reverse soil degradation is critical to
   maintain environmental quality, forest and agricultural productivity,
   biodiversity conservation, and to provide valuable ecosystem services.
   Yet the impacts of forest restoration on soil quality remain
   under-investigated. Here we aim to address a key knowledge gap: how does
   forest ecosystem restoration affect the recovery of soil quality in
   tropical and temperate regions? We conducted a global meta-analysis to
   compare soil physical, chemical, and biological properties between
   restoring forests and reference old-growth/less-disturbed forests. We
   revealed for the first time that differences between restoring and
   reference forests are lower for physical (12-25\%; based on median
   values of effect size) and chemical (10-74\%) properties than for
   biological (32-90\%) properties. More specifically, bulk density (12\%
   of difference), pH (10\%), and enzyme activity (32\%) had mean values in
   restoring forests closer to those observed in reference forests.
   Overall, our results suggest that the restoration of soil properties was
   greater in tropical regions, after longer periods (>30 years), through
   passive restoration, and over pasturelands. Our global meta-analysis
   helps to fill the soil information gap in forest restoration and
   increase our understanding of how to improve soil quality through forest
   restoration and soil monitoring processes in tropical and temperate
   regions.},

Title = {Economic costs of protecting islands from invasive alien species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Biological invasions represent a key threat to insular systems and have
   pronounced impacts across environments and economies. The ecological
   impacts have received substantial focus, but the socioeconomic impacts
   are poorly synthesized across spatial and temporal scales. We used the
   InvaCost database, the most comprehensive assessment of published
   economic costs of invasive species, to assess economic impacts on
   islands worldwide. We analyzed socioeconomic costs across differing
   expenditure types and examined temporal trends across islands that
   differ in their political geography-island nation states, overseas
   territories, and islands of continental countries. Over US\$36 billion
   in total costs (including damages and management) has occurred on
   islands from 1965 to 2020 due to invasive species' impacts. Nation
   states incurred the greatest total and management costs, and islands of
   continental countries incurred costs of similar magnitude, both far
   higher than those in overseas territories. Damage-loss costs were
   significantly lower, but with qualitatively similar patterns across
   differing political geographies. The predominance of management spending
   differs from the pattern found for most countries examined and suggests
   important knowledge gaps in the extent of many damage-related
   socioeconomic impacts. Nation states spent the greatest proportion of
   their gross domestic products countering these costs, at least 1 order
   of magnitude higher than other locations. Most costs were borne by
   authorities and stakeholders, demonstrating the key role of governmental
   and nongovernmental bodies in addressing island invasions. Temporal
   trends revealed cost increases across all island types, potentially
   reflecting efforts to tackle invasive species at larger, more socially
   complex scales. Nevertheless, the already high total economic costs of
   island invasions substantiate the role of biosecurity in reducing and
   preventing invasive species arrivals to reduce strains on limited
   financial resources and avoid threats to sustainable development goals.},

Title = {Close Kin Dyads Indicate Intergenerational Dispersal and Barriers},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The movement of individuals through continuous space is typically
   constrained by dispersal ability and dispersal barriers. A range of
   approaches have been developed to investigate these. Kindisperse is a
   new approach that infers recent intergenerational dispersal (sigma) from
   close kin dyads and appears particularly useful for investigating taxa
   that are difficult to observe individually. This study, focusing on the
   mosquito Aedes aegypti, shows how the same close kin data can also be
   used for barrier detection. We empirically demonstrate this new
   extension of the method using genome-wide sequence data from 266 Ae.
   aegypti. First, we use the spatial distribution of full-sib dyads
   collected within one generation to infer past movements of ovipositing
   female mosquitoes. These dyads indicated the relative barrier strengths
   of two roads and performed favorably against alternative genetic methods
   for detecting barriers. We then use Kindisperse to quantify recent
   intergenerational dispersal (sigma=81.5-197.1 m generation(-1/2)) from
   the difference in variance between the sib and the first cousin spatial
   distributions and, from this, estimate effective population density
   (rho=833-4,864 km(-2)). Dispersal estimates showed general agreement
   with those from mark-release-recapture studies. Barriers, sigma, rho,
   and neighborhood size (331-526) can inform forthcoming releases of
   dengue-suppressing Wolbachia bacteria into this mosquito population.},

Title = {Epigenetic Potential and DNA Methylation in an Ongoing House Sparrow
   (Passer domesticus) Range Expansion},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {During range expansions, organisms can use epigenetic mechanisms to
   adjust to conditions in novel areas by altering gene expression and
   enabling phenotypic plasticity. Here, we predicted that the number of
   CpG sites within the genome, one form of epigenetic potential, would be
   important for successful range expansions because DNA methylation can
   modulate gene expression and, consequently, plasticity. We asked how the
   number of CpG sites and DNA methylation varied across five locations in
   the similar to 70-year-old Kenyan house sparrow (Passer domesticus)
   range expansion. We found that the number of CpG sites was highest
   toward the vanguard of the invasion and decreased toward the range core.
   Analysis suggests that this pattern may have been driven by selection,
   favoring birds with more CpG sites at the range edge. However, we cannot
   rule out other processes, including nonrandom gene flow. Additionally,
   DNA methylation did not change across the range expansion, nor was it
   more variable. We hypothesize that as new areas are colonized,
   epigenetic potential may be selectively advantageous early but
   eventually be replaced by less plastic and perhaps genetically canalized
   traits as populations adapt to local conditions. Although further work
   is needed on epigenetic potential, this form (CpG number) appears to be
   a promising mechanism to investigate as a driver of expansions via
   capacitated phenotypic plasticity in other natural and anthropogenic
   range expansions.},

Title = {Benefits of Blue Carbon Stocks in a Coastal Jazan Ecosystem Undergoing
   Land Use Change},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are characterized by high content of soil carbon
   storage; however, they experience severe land conversions in the past
   decades. The current study aims to examine how different land use/land
   cover (LU/LC) impact carbon stock in coastal ecosystem along Jazan
   coast, Saudi Arabia. In this study, impacts of LU/LC on carbon stocks in
   the coastal zone of Jazan, Saudi Arabia in 2009, 2013, and 2021 were
   assessed. Also, the LU/LC dynamics were evaluated using data provided by
   the land use dynamic model. The carbon stocks were modelled based on
   LU/LC using the InVEST program. Our study results showed that the
   decrease in mangroves from 2013 to 2021 reflects the high atmospheric
   emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). Also, the increase in built-up areas
   might negatively impact total carbon stock. The estimated carbon stocks
   for the coastal zone of Jazan biome were 7279027.42 Mg C in 2009 (1Mg =

Title = {Predictors of Calcareous Fen Floristic Quality in a Rapidly Urbanizing
   County},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of urbanization on groundwater-dependent wetlands have been
   little studied. Here I determine whether variables associated with
   urbanization predict calcareous fen floristic quality in rapidly
   urbanizing Dane Co., WI, as well as likely degradation mechanisms. I
   measured: (1) floristic quality measures; (2) indicators of non-native
   propagule pressure (3) indicators of human influences on subsurface
   hydrology (4) patch characteristics; (5) presence of land-use legacies,
   and; (6) distance from urban structures for county fens. Partial Least
   Squares Regression (PLSR) showed that high floristic quality was
   positively associated with distance from roads and negatively associated
   with high-capacity-well (HCW) influence, land-use legacies, and
   population density. Non-native richness and cover were positively
   associated with HCW influence and population density, and negatively
   associated with distance from roads. Distance from urban structures
   other than roads did not factor into any model. These results indicate
   that urbanization impacts fen floristic quality through increasing
   groundwater extraction and non-native propagule pressure through
   processes that are not linked to developed areas, per se. In contrast,
   degraded fens in rural areas were impacted by legacies of past
   agricultural activities.},

Title = {Land-sea linkages depend on macroalgal species, predator invasion
   history in a New Zealand archipelago},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 17},
Abstract = {Seabirds on islands create a circular seabird economy-they feed in the
   ocean, transport marine-derived nutrients onshore to their breeding
   colonies, and then seabird-derived nutrients runoff into the ocean,
   enriching nearshore ecosystems. Invasive predators reduce seabird-driven
   nutrient subsidies; thus, predator eradication is critical for restoring
   seabird islands. Terrestrial recovery of seabird nutrients following
   predator eradication can take mere decades or longer, but few studies
   have linked nearshore marine recovery to terrestrial ecosystem
   attributes. We tested the influence of season, seabird variables,
   terrestrial abiotic variables, and marine variables on nearshore algal
   communities surrounding islands in a New Zealand island archipelago. The
   link from terrestrial to marine proved strong, with over 40\% of the
   variation in macroalgae community composition being driven by a
   combination of seabird and terrestrial abiotic variables. Season and
   depth were the strongest contributors to nitrogen enrichment. Two
   macroalgae species had seabird-derived nitrogen levels similar on
   eradicated and never invaded islands, but four more had lower
   seabird-derived nitrogen on eradicated versus never invaded islands. Our
   results suggest seabird land-sea linkages are disrupted when predators
   invade, and are not restored three decades after invasive predator
   removal in the studied archipelago. Moreover, some marine algae species
   are better indicators of seabird influence than others. This study
   provides baseline information about which abiotic and ecological
   variables are important when studying the linkages from land to sea in
   island ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) published the second
   edition of its International Principles and Standards for the Practice
   of Ecological Restoration in 2019. We conducted a pan-Canadian study
   using semi-structured interviews with restoration professionals to
   explore the extent to which restoration practitioners are aware of the
   document and use it. Overall, we found that direct uptake of the
   document by practitioners was lower than expected, with approximately
   37.7\% of all participants that were both aware of and consulting the
   publication for guidance in their practice of ecological restoration.
   This is due in part to low awareness of the document itself, with only a
   small majority (56.5\%) of interviewees being aware of it. Other reasons
   listed by practitioners such as the structure of the publication, its
   added value, and its suitability for on-the-ground work revealed why
   some individuals aware of the existence of the document still failed to
   consult it. Here, we present a more nuanced assessment of these
   observations and share our findings with the ecological restoration
   community to address this disconnection. With intensifying pressures to
   achieve restoration success internationally, SER's guidance is critical.
   We analyze why it seems guidance from SER is not being taken up as fully
   as it might, and ways in which future versions may be improved.},

Title = {Nitrogen fertilizer enhances vegetation establishment of a high-altitude
   machine-graded ski slope},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Machine grading is frequently required to prepare the terrain when
   building high-altitude ski slopes in the Alps. However, this kind of
   disturbance alters the natural environment, destroying the vegetation
   and hampering its reestablishment. Thus, specific restoration plans are
   necessary to encourage the recovery of vegetation, which is already
   affected by different natural constraints in this harsh environment. One
   of the main critical factors affecting plant growth in high-altitude
   areas is the lack of available nitrogen (N) in the soil. In this
   context, the addition of a slow-release N fertilizer was carried out in
   an experimental revegetated ski slope between 2,800 and 2,900 m above
   sea level in the western Italian Alps. Both vegetation and soil were
   monitored during a 5-year period in order to test the effectiveness of N
   addition on the restoration process. Even if effects on soil carbon and
   N contents were negligible, vegetation was remarkably affected by the
   fertilization, since the total vegetation cover and the species richness
   significantly increased. Against the expectations, there was a
   remarkable increase in spontaneous forbs, rather than in most of the
   sown graminoids, which slightly varied during the experimental period.
   Actually, graminoids responded in different ways, mostly increasing
   (likewise forbs), but the slight decrease of the dominant Festuca
   nigrescens (Chewing's Fescue) masked their spread. This study confirms
   the noteworthy role of N in high-altitude alpine soils and consequently
   its importance to improve the restoration process of degraded
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Extensive cattle ranging is an important economic activity in mountains,
   with diverse effects on native mammal communities. The effects of cattle
   Bos taurus can be negative, positive or neutral, mostly depending on the
   stocking rate. We examined the effect of cattle on the diversity and
   abundance of native mammalian species in the Austral Yungas region of
   Argentina, considering environmental variables, land protection status,
   and human influence. Using 12,512 trap-nights from 167 camera-trap
   stations over 11 years (2009-2019), we calculated a relative abundance
   index using camera events and used generalized linear models to estimate
   the effect of cattle on small mammals, large herbivores, species of
   conservation concern and felids. Cattle had different effects on each
   group of native mammals. We observed a lower abundance of large native
   herbivores and the absence of small mammals in areas with high cattle
   abundance. The tapir Tapirus terrestris, jaguar Panthera onca and
   white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari are rare in the Yungas and therefore
   potentially vulnerable to extinction there. Conservation of small felids
   and low cattle abundance could be compatible, but felids are threatened
   by other anthropogenic influences. Native mammalian diversity and
   richness were related to land protection status. The entire ecoregion is
   potentially suitable for cattle, suggesting the potential for further
   threats, and that cattle should be excluded from strictly protected
   areas. To ensure extensive cattle ranging is compatible with wildlife
   conservation in areas where exclusion is not possible, we recommend
   improved management of cattle and moderate stocking rates.},

Abstract = {Nothofagus alessandrii, categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List,
   is an endemic, deciduous tree species of the coastal range of central
   Chile. We assessed the effects of fire severity, invasion by the exotic
   fire-prone Pinus radiata, and land-cover composition and configuration
   of the landscape on the resilience of fragments of N. alessandrii after
   a mega-fire in 2017. We used remote sensing data to estimate land-use
   classes and cover, fire severity and invasion cover of P. radiata. We
   monitored forest composition and structure and post-fire responses of N.
   alessandrii forests in situ for 2 years after the mega-fire. In the
   coastal Maule region wildfires have been favoured by intense drought and
   widespread exotic pine plantations, increasing the ability of
   fire-adapted invasive species to colonize native forest remnants. Over
   85\% of N. alessandrii forests were moderately or severely burnt. The
   propagation and severity of fire was probably amplified by the exotic
   pines located along the edges of, or inside, the N. alessandrii
   fragments and the highly flammable pine plantations surrounding these
   fragments (> 60\% of land use is pine plantations). Pinus radiata, a
   fire-adapted pioneer species, showed strong post-fire recruitment within
   the N. alessandrii fragments, especially those severely burnt. Positive
   feedback between climate change (i.e. droughts and heat waves),
   wildfires and pine invasions is driving N. alessandrii forests into an
   undesirable and probably irreversible state (i.e. a landscape trap). A
   large-scale restoration programme to design a diverse and less flammable
   landscape is needed to avoid the loss of these highly threatened forest
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Urban developments in estuarine areas affect benthic organisms, notably
   the macrobenthos, by physically modifying the territory and generating
   waste. The polychaete assemblages and the environmental parameters in
   the estuarine area of Sungai Terengganu were examined based on nine
   stations along a salinity gradient from oligohaline to polyhaline.
   Samples were collected using a Smith McIntyre grab and yielded 1886
   individuals, from 43 species grouped into 24 families. The fauna was
   mainly dominated by Composetia sp. (39.48\%) and Cossura sp. (31.87\%);
   the former in oligohaline areas and the latter in the polyhaline areas.
   The densities of both species had significant positive correlations with
   salinity, temperature, and silt, clay, and gravel contents. This study
   will benchmark the polychaete community distribution in this tropical
   estuary, which could be similar to environments along the east coast of
   Peninsular Malaysia (South China Sea).},

Title = {Cattle Grazing of a Celtic Sea Saltmarsh Affects Invertebrate Community
   Composition and Biomass, but not Diversity},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large grazers can regulate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   through both direct and indirect effects on biological communities. For
   this reason, grazing by domestic livestock is frequently implemented as
   a conservation tool in many parts of the world and remains most popular
   in northwest Europe. Saltmarsh invertebrates support multiple ecosystem
   functions; therefore, understanding the effects of grazing on saltmarsh
   invertebrate fauna is important to enable the most apt decisions
   pertaining to grazing management on these highly valuable ecosystems.
   This study examined the effects of cessation of cattle grazing on the
   ground-invertebrate community in Ballyteige Burrow saltmarsh on the
   Celtic Sea coast of Ireland. We found that cessation of cattle grazing
   resulted in a shift of saltmarsh invertebrate community composition,
   with increases in Gastropoda and Amphipoda, and decreases to some
   Diptera and Coleoptera species. Cessation of grazing did not detectably
   affect invertebrate abundance, but biomass increased by 53\%. This was
   driven by higher abundance of the amphipod Orchestia gammarellus, a
   species with important roles in nutrient cycling, sediment bioturbation
   and sustaining fish of high fishery value. We did not find cessation of
   grazing to affect invertebrate richness or evenness. Although there is
   mounting evidence of the irreplaceable ecological value that
   invertebrates provide, conservation assessment of saltmarshes in Europe
   tends to be carried out without regard to resident invertebrate fauna.
   Therefore, grazing management of saltmarshes in Ireland and more widely
   need to give due attention towards understanding the role of
   invertebrates as a part of the biological diversity that maintains
   healthy saltmarshes.},

Title = {Hydrologic Restoration Decreases Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Shrub Bog
   Peatlands in Southeastern US},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Peatlands play a disproportionate role in the global carbon cycle.
   However, many peatlands have been ditched to lower the water table and
   converted into agriculture, which contributes to anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrologic restoration of drained peatlands
   could offset greenhouse gas emissions from these actions, but field
   examples that consider various greenhouse gases are still rare. Here, we
   examined emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
   oxide (N2O) from soils in drained shrub bogs in North Carolina, USA,
   before and after hydrologic restoration. We used static chamber methods
   and a before-and-after, control-impact (BACI) experimental design. We
   found that hydrologic manipulation (akin to restoration) increased water
   table levels by 65\%, even with the impact of two hurricanes before and
   one after hydrologic manipulation. Increased water table levels led to a
   58\% decrease in CO2 fluxes, and an increase in CH4 (251\%) and N2O
   fluxes (85\%). Water table depth and soil temperature explained 43\% of
   variation in CO2, while water table depth explained 25\% and 18\% of
   variation in CH4 and N2O fluxes, respectively. Despite the increases in
   CH4 and N2O, the higher magnitude of fluxes and large decline in CO2
   lead to an overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions after hydrologic
   restoration. Our results suggest that raising the water table in this
   shrub bog peatland decreased overall greenhouse gas emissions,
   illustrating that hydrologic restoration of peatlands can be a valuable
   climate mitigation practice.},

Title = {Wetland Successional State Affects Fire Severity in a Boreal Shield
   Landscape},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Boreal peatland ecosystems are generally resilient to low severity
   wildfire. However, climate change may increase wildfire intensity and
   frequency, potentially shifting wetlands to less wildfire resistant
   states. Peatlands formed by infilling generally undergo a succession
   from open water to grounded peat, with spatially complex intermediate
   states which may impact wildfire resistance. We explored the
   relationship between wetland successional states and fire severity
   following a > 11,000 ha wildfire in Ontario's Boreal Shield landscape.
   We digitized 144 wetlands of varying successional states from aerial
   imagery and assessed fire severity using the Relative differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio calculated from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery.
   Completely peat-filled wetlands were small in area (0.7 +/- 2 ha) but
   were most frequent on the landscape (n = 99/144) compared to a smaller
   number (n = 8) of large (19 +/- 2 ha) spatially complex wetlands that
   comprised > 30\% of the total wetland area. In wetlands covered
   completely, or nearly completely, by peat, fire severity was
   significantly higher compared to wetlands with interspersed patches of
   shallow open water. Moreover, > 90\% of fire resistant wetlands with
   open water were associated with beaver dams. Wetlands with more complex
   surface cover experienced lower mean fire severity but greater
   variability in fire severity suggesting that variable fuel configuration
   (i.e., spatially heterogeneous surface cover) in complex wetlands limit
   wildfire propagation across the wetland surface. Our findings are
   important for landscape conservation and wildfire management, as
   spatially complex wetlands host a diverse array of habitats for at-risk
   species and may offer protection from severe wildfires as fire refugia.},

Title = {Vegetation Dynamics on a Restored salt Marsh Mosaic: a Re-Visitation
   Study in a Coastal Wetland in Central Italy},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are biodiversity hotspots, highly threatened, and for
   which restoration actions have been widely implemented. Systematic
   monitoring of biodiversity after restoration actions on Mediterranean
   salt marshes vegetation needs further attention. We analyzed temporal
   changes in plant species composition and ecology in a restored brackish
   wetland on the Adriatic coast (Central Italy) by a re-visitation study
   of 33 historical plots (year 2010), newly collected after 10 years
   (2021), across a brackish mosaic composed by salt meadows, halophilous
   scrubs and salt steppes referable to three habitats of conservation
   concern in Europe (EU codes: 1410, 1420 and 1510{*}). Changes in species
   richness and cover, in the ecological characteristics of the mosaic and
   each habitat type were tested by comparing some ecological groups (e.g.
   diagnostic, alien and ruderal species) and Ellenberg bio-indicator
   values by a Mann-Whitney test. Similarity percentage procedure for
   identifying which species indicate temporal changes was also performed.
   After restoration, we observed a general improvement of the
   environmental quality of the brackish mosaic with the establishment of
   typical pauci-specific plant communities, a significant recovery of
   diagnostic species cover and a reduction of ruderal and alien ones. We
   also registered an increase in Ellenberg salinity and temperature values
   likely related also to coastal erosion and climatic change. The results
   of our study suggest that vegetation dynamics could be used to monitor
   coastal restoration trajectory in the Mid- and Long-Term local
   interventions.},

Title = {Modelling Changes in Distribution of the Rheophytic Tree Species
   Barringtonia Acutangula (L.) Gaertn. Due to Climate Change},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {Barringtonia acutangula is a tree species adapted to floodplains. The
   species has traditionally been managed over millennia as family and
   community forest in the Ganges- Brahmaputra- Meghna basin. Although much
   of the floodplain forest has been removed and converted to agriculture,
   some forest does remain along most banks. Here, we examined current and
   future habitat suitability under climate change scenarios that could
   help to manage Barringtonia acutangula, a rheophytic tree of
   socio-ecological importance. We model the habitat suitability class of
   B. acutangula under current and future climate (2050) scenarios based on
   89 (57 from India and 32 from Bangladesh) locations and bio-climatic and
   elevation variables using species distribution modelling (SDM) by
   MaxEnt. Out of the total area, i.e., 2,450,577 km(2), of the
   Indo-Bangladesh landscape, 199,063 km(2) (8.12\%) is highly suitable for
   the distribution of B. acutangula, but it is predicted to decrease by
   50.57\% (100,669 km(2)) by 2050 under the future climate change
   scenario. Country-wise habitat analysis revealed that out of the total
   area (139,799 km(2)) in Bangladesh, 95,541 km(2) (68.34\%) is highly
   suitable area for B. acutangula, but this is projected to decline under
   the climate change scenario by 34,801 km(2) (36.43\%) by 2050. While in
   India, the highly suitable area of B. acutangula is 103,522 km(2)
   (4.48\%) and is predicted to further decrease by 65,868 km(2) (63.63\%)
   by 2050. Our study highlights that precipitation seasonality,
   precipitation in the coldest quarter and precipitation in the driest
   period are the strongest predictors of the distribution of B. acutangula
   in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. In the climate change scenario,
   changes in the precipitation pattern, in particular, can put B.
   acutangula under stress and lead to a high risk of population shrinkage
   in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. Therefore, urgent attention is needed
   for conservation of B. acutangula, as it is sensitive and vulnerable to
   changing global climatic patterns.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth.
   Effective conservation strategies are essential to reverse this trend
   and should be based on sound knowledge of biodiversity patterns and the
   main drivers structuring them. In this study, we investigated the role
   of environmental and dispersal-connectivity controls on freshwater
   diatom and fish communities' variability. We used 441 biological samples
   obtained from Spanish biomonitoring datasets, which cover a highly
   variable environmental gradient across the national river network. We
   compared the taxonomic and trait-based spatial dependency of the two
   biotic groups using distance-decay relationships and variation
   partitioning with spatially constrained randomisations. Our findings
   showed that most of the diatoms and fish biological variation was
   attributed to pure spatial and spatially structured environmental
   variation. Compared to diatoms, fish community composition presented a
   stronger spatial dependency, likely because of their weaker dispersal
   ability. In addition, broad-scale environmental characteristics showed a
   higher predictive capacity for fish assemblages' variation. Trait-based
   similarities presented lower spatial dependency than taxonomic datasets,
   indicating that they are less susceptible to dispersal-connectivity
   effects. These findings contribute to understand the mechanisms
   underlying river community assembly at large spatial scales (i.e., at
   and beyond the river network) and point out the importance of
   dispersal-connectivity processes, which are usually neglected in
   traditional niche-based biomonitoring programmes but can influence their
   outcomes (e.g., masking the detection of anthropogenic impacts).
   Therefore, the integration of the dispersal-connectivity component, as
   well as information on organisms' dispersal abilities, are crucial when
   establishing effective conservation objectives and designing
   biomonitoring strategies.},

Title = {Effectiveness of higher-taxon approach on ants and sample size effect:
   an assessment in Brazilian biomes and states},

Abstract = {The effect of human activities on the suppression of biodiversity is
   visibly evident throughout the world. Monitoring and conservation
   services are usually expensive in terms of time and money, and potential
   savings in these areas are always welcome. The higher-taxon approach has
   been used as a possible alternative to overcome these impediments.
   However, there is little information about the effect of sample size on
   the effectiveness of the higher-taxon approach, mainly with empirical
   data. Using an extensive database, which compiles information on the
   distribution of ants between the years 1886 and 2020, I verified the
   effect of sample size on the predictive power of the higher-taxon
   approach in Brazil. I evaluated the effect of sample size on the
   predictive power of the Genus and Subfamily to represent species
   richness and composition at the spatial scales of State and Biomes. The
   associations between coarser taxonomic units and species-level are
   strong at both spatial scales, with metrics of richness and composition.
   In general, the genus has the results with the highest coefficients
   regardless of spatial scales. The sample size effect was sporadic and
   did not dramatically affect the effectiveness of the surrogates.
   Regardless of the possible biases that data compiled from the literature
   and taxonomic collections may have due to lack of standardization,
   coarser taxonomic units (Genus and Subfamily) were efficient predictors
   of species-level in Brazilian states and biomes. It reinforces the
   potential to save costs in monitoring and conserving ant biodiversity in
   a wide space-environmental gradient.},

Title = {Foxes and goats: the outcome of free-ranging livestock farming in
   Brazilian dry forests},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {715-734},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Humans are promoting drastic changes in biological communities that
   result in `winner-loser' species replacements across multiple spatial
   scales. In tropical regions, such replacements can be particularly
   driven by deforestation, especially in landscapes devoted to
   free-ranging livestock production in which mixing native and exotic
   species can create species-poor and homogenized communities. We tested
   this hypothesis assessing medium- and large-bodied non-volant mammals in
   four 16-km(2) landscapes with varying deforestation levels (5\%, 30\%,
   70\%, and 95\% forest cover), where exotic mammals (e.g., cows and
   goats) have free access to the remaining Caatinga dry forest. Using
   camera traps, we obtained 2808 independent records of 17 species, most
   of them (2054 records, 73\%) corresponding to seven exotic species.
   Native Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox) and exotic Capra hircus (goat)
   accounted for almost half of the records and 60-80\% of the records in
   the two most deforested landscapes. Alpha diversity did not differ
   significantly among landscapes, but the two more forested landscapes
   tended to have more native species than exotic ones. Beta diversity
   patterns among and within landscapes were relatively low regardless of
   species abundance, indicating biotic homogenization at multiple spatial
   scales. We conclude that a novel mammal community full of exotic mammals
   and a few generalist natives has been established in the study region.
   To promote environmental-friendly livestock farming in the largest
   tropical dry forest of South America, we should avoid deforestation,
   especially in sites that concentrate native species, segregate lands for
   livestock and conservation, and boost inspection against illegal
   hunting.},

Title = {Changes in management shape the spatial ecology of wild ponies in

Abstract = {Large herbivores are key regulators of open habitats across the world.
   Free roaming ponies have a prominent ecological role in many Atlantic
   landscapes, where different habitats with conservation interest are
   linked to ponies' occurrence. The traditional management of wild ponies,
   which implies minimum human intervention, is declining in Galicia, NW
   Spain. Changes in the management regimes include the confinement of
   ponies in fenced areas, the use of improved pastures (IPs) and rotation
   between fields. Indirect effects of these changes are expected on the
   ecological condition of important habitats for conservation such as dry
   and wet heathlands and bogs. We studied social structure, spatial
   ecology and habitat use in 29 mares fitted with global positioning
   system (GPS) collars and field observations in two areas of Galicia
   dominated by wet heaths and blanket bogs (Xistral), and dry heaths
   (Sabucedo). We used spatial location and field observations to identify
   each band, and calculated band size, sex ratio, home range (HR) and core
   areas size and overlap, and habitat use. We addressed differences and
   adjusted Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for these variables as
   functions of the type of management: free roaming vs rotation, use of
   IPs, fencing, and available ranging area. Larger bands were found in
   smaller commons, fenced and with rotation management. Home ranges, but
   not core area, varied as a function of the available ranging area. Bands
   overlap more on fenced areas with rotation management. Increasing
   management may concentrate grazing pressure by reducing HR and
   increasing bands overlapping areas, and this may have a long-term effect
   on habitat quality and conservation.},

Abstract = {Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade
   and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here
   we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus
   on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired
   transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola
   taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations
   with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical-chemical
   parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant
   richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal
   respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland
   afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil
   fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland
   afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the
   taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An
   environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover
   from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation).
   While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented
   Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented
   Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures. Our results on
   afforestation effects in subtropical grasslands are similar to those
   described for temperate zone, and may underpin the development of
   conservation strategies for land-use on subtropical grasslands.},

Title = {Including biological diversity in natural capital accounts for marine
   biodiversity conservation and human well-being},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Natural capital (NC) accounts measure and value the benefits that
   ecosystems provide to humans. Marine biodiversity supports human
   well-being directly by providing a source of food (e.g. wild fish), and
   indirectly by providing employment (e.g. fisheries, and tourism) and
   recreation (e.g. diving). The inclusion of the marine environment in NC
   accounting is relatively new. Central to the NC framework, biodiversity
   is one of the most challenging aspects to account for. Here, we consider
   the potential for marine biodiversity to be included in NC accounts, and
   explain why this is in line with current policy directions towards
   achieving sustainability and well-being. We present a set of potential
   indicators that could be used to assess ecosystem extent and ecosystem
   condition through their biodiversity, and inform policies aimed to
   improve sustainability and human well-being. We conclude that including
   biological indicators in NC accounts will help to consider marine
   biodiversity conservation and economic activities in blue spaces as
   complementary components of well-being. NC accounts can facilitate
   decision-making by showing, in few interconnected tables, trends in the
   provision of biodiversity in a specific area and for specific
   ecosystems. This makes potential trade-offs between ecosystems,
   ecosystem services, and economic activities more apparent.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {6},
Pages = {846-856},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {For a species to expand its range, it needs to be good at dispersing and
   also capable of exploiting resources and adapting to different
   environments. Therefore, behavioral and cognitive traits could play key
   roles in facilitating invasion success. Marine threespined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have repeatedly colonized freshwater
   environments and rapidly adapted to them. Here, by comparing the
   behavior of hundreds of lab-reared sticklebacks from six different
   populations, we show that marine sticklebacks are bold, while
   sticklebacks that have become established in freshwater lakes are
   flexible. Moreover, boldness and flexibility are negatively correlated
   with one another at the individual, family, and population levels. These
   results support the hypothesis that boldness is favored in invaders
   during the initial dispersal stage, while flexibility is favored in
   recent immigrants during the establishment stage, and they suggest that
   the link between boldness and flexibility facilitates success during
   both the dispersal stage and the establishment stage. This study adds to
   the growing body of work showing the importance of behavioral
   correlations in facilitating colonization success in sticklebacks and
   other organisms.},

Title = {Archaic Food Uses of Large Graminoids in Agro Peligno Wetlands (Abruzzo,

   Archaeological Literature},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large graminoid species, which often dominate wetland ecosystems with
   extensive and dense formations, are among the most indicative plants
   from the first human settlements, where they have been used (even
   transformed) for various functions ranging from food, cordage, weaving
   and other utilities. Wetland large graminoid foraging today represents
   one of the rarest and most archaic customs still in existence, as they
   have frequently disappeared following changes in society or the
   disappearance of marshes. These customs have (almost) disappeared in
   Europe, especially in Italy, following socio-economic changes and
   wetland reclamation; remaining uses can generally only be found in
   prehistoric traces. This research in Agro Peligno documents and
   describes for the first time the remains of these prehistoric uses,
   which are related to the ancient Peligni (or Paeligni) people. The data
   collected in the current field study were later compared with food uses
   of graminoids arising from a large spectrum of archaeological,
   ethnobotanical, and folkloric literature from other European areas, in a
   large sense. Problems and outlook regarding the loss of this traditional
   knowledge are also briefly discussed.},

Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Estuarine wetlands provide a wide range of ecosystem functions,
   including carbon storage, biodiversity maintenance, and shoreline
   protection, and have human recreational value. In recent years, over
   half of China's estuarine wetlands have been lost due to natural or
   anthropogenic stresses. Estuarine wetlands are facing great challenges
   regarding their protection, restoration and management. China's 18,436
   km of coastline support nearly half of its human population and 45 of
   its 60 major cities. It sustains over 28,000 species, and processes the
   outflow from seven of its nine major rivers. Rapid economic development
   in China is a cause of coastal degradation. In an attempt to mitigate
   habitat loss, over 1000 coastal restoration projects have been conducted
   in China in the past few decades. Great achievements have been made in
   the wetland restoration projects. In the future, biological combined
   restoration technology will become increasingly popular in China.},

Abstract = {The Colorado River and its tributaries on the Colorado Plateau are home
   to unique desert river ecosystems and changing environmental conditions.
   Within this region, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA) is
   composed of rugged, high desert terrain and is managed by the United
   States National Park Service as both a recreational and conservation
   area. Despite the ecological and economic importance of GCNRA,
   significant components of the ecological communities therein remain
   poorly characterized, including lichens. Accurately characterizing
   lichen-forming fungal diversity is challenging due to poorly known
   taxonomic groups, underexplored regions/habitats, and varying
   interpretations of morphological differences, including the recognition
   of environmentally modified forms. To better understand lichen diversity
   in GCNRA, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, incorporating both
   traditional morphology-based identification and information from the
   standard fungal DNA barcoding marker, the ITS, to compile a thorough
   inventory of lichen-forming fungi in Fifty-Mile Canyon. Vouchered lichen
   specimens were collected in 2019, and from these the ITS marker was
   sequenced. Candidate species-level lineages were delimited from
   family-level multiple sequence alignments using the Assemble Species by
   Automatic Partitioning web server. Specimens comprising DNA-based
   candidate species were then evaluated using traditional taxonomically
   diagnostic characters to link these, where possible, to currently
   described species. For Fifty-Mile Canyon, we document 100 putative
   species in 15 families, each represented by vouchered specimens, ITS
   sequence data, and photographic documentation. For comparison, a survey
   of historic records from GCNRA revealed a total of 124 documented
   lichen-forming fungal species throughout the NRA and adjacent land.
   Approximately 50\% of the species documented in Fifty-Mile Canyon had
   not previously been found in GCNRA, and similar proportions of species
   diversity have been documented in GCNRA but not observed in our survey.
   We report 3 species new to North America-Calogaya ferrugineoides (H.
   Magn.) Arup, Froden \& Sochting, Endocarpon deserticola T. Zhang, X.L.
   Wei \& J.C. Wei, and Xanthocarpia ferrarii (Bagl.) Froden, Arup \&
   Sochting-verified using ITS sequencing data. In addition, Circinaria
   squamulosa sp. nov. is formally described here, currently known only
   from sandstone slabs in Fifty-Mile Canyon. However, the taxonomic
   identity of many of the candidate species from Fifty-Mile Canyon
   remained ambiguous at the species level, and some collections likely
   represent undescribed species-level lineages. Our results revealed
   unexpected, high species-level diversity of lichen-forming fungi at
   local scales and that overall lichen diversity across the entire GCNRA
   is likely vastly undercounted. These data-including DNA barcodes for the
   vast majority of lichen-forming fungi occurring in this canyon-provide
   an important resource that can be integrated into subsequent lichen
   biodiversity research in the southwestern United States and other
   semiarid climates.},

Abstract = {Gene-by-environment interactions play a crucial role in horizontal gene
   transfer by affecting how the transferred genes alter host fitness.
   However, how the environment modulates the fitness effect of transferred
   genes has not been tested systematically in an experimental study. We
   adapted a high-throughput technique for obtaining very precise estimates
   of bacterial fitness, in order to measure the fitness effects of 44
   orthologs transferred from Salmonella Typhimurium to Escherichia coli in
   six physiologically relevant environments. We found that the fitness
   effects of individual genes were highly dependent on the environment,
   while the distributions of fitness effects across genes were not, with
   all tested environments resulting in distributions of same shape and
   spread. Furthermore, the extent to which the fitness effects of a gene
   varied between environments depended on the average fitness effect of
   that gene across all environments, with nearly neutral and nearly lethal
   genes having more consistent fitness effects across all environments
   compared to deleterious genes. Put together, our results reveal the
   unpredictable nature of how environmental conditions impact the fitness
   effects of each individual gene. At the same time, distributions of
   fitness effects across environments exhibit consistent features,
   pointing to the generalizability of factors that shape horizontal gene
   transfer of orthologous genes.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {The selection of the optimal substitution model of molecular evolution
   imposes a high computational burden for long sequence alignments in
   phylogenomics. We discovered that the analysis of multiple tiny
   subsamples of site patterns from a full sequence alignment recovers the
   correct optimal substitution model when sites in the subsample are
   upsampled to match the total number of sites in the full alignment. The
   computational costs of maximum-likelihood analyses are reduced by orders
   of magnitude in the subsample-upsample (SU) approach because the
   upsampled alignment contains only a small fraction of all site patterns.
   We present an adaptive protocol, ModelTamer, that implements the new SU
   approach and automatically selects subsamples to estimate optimal models
   reliably. ModelTamer selects models hundreds to thousands of times
   faster than the full data analysis while needing megabytes rather than
   gigabytes of computer memory.},

Title = {Ground-based vegetation descriptions and remote sensing as complementary
   methods describing habitat requirements of a frugivorous primate in
   northern Madagascar: implications for forest restoration},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Non-human primate species are threatened worldwide. Their population
   declines go along with the loss of ecological functions such as seed
   dispersal that plays a crucial role in plant regeneration. Restoring
   essential habitat structures could thus not only protect primates, but
   also facilitate forest regeneration. We used classical vegetation
   description on the ground and a remote sensing analysis to describe
   habitat use of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), a seed-dispersing
   primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Our aim was to find vegetation
   characteristics important for lemurs that might be targeted in a
   restoration approach. For this, we applied both methods in differently
   degraded forest types. Both classical vegetation description and remote
   sensing analysis were able to distinguish these forest types. The
   habitat use of our two study groups was associated consistently with
   vegetation structures measured on a small scale such as tree height and
   density of thick trees. In contrast, vegetation productivity and water
   content derived from satellite imagery on a larger scale could not
   consistently explain habitat use of lemurs. Thus, measurements on the
   ground can identify suitable microhabitats that do not show on the
   satellite imagery scale. These microhabitats might be very important
   conservation elements to create buffer zones and corridors. Further,
   they might attract seed-dispersing species into degraded areas targeted
   for forest restoration, acting as natural regeneration nuclei. The
   potential of these microhabitats for conservation would not be
   recognized when analyses were based solely on landscape analyses on
   large scales.},

Title = {Global warming facilitates the nesting of the loggerhead turtle on the

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The ranges of many species are shifting poleward as global warming
   intensifies, but this process might be less intense in philopatric
   species, i.e. those with the tendency to reproduce at their natal sites.
   Marine turtles are highly philopatric and their vulnerability to global
   warming is exacerbated by a life history combining delayed sexual
   maturity, temperature-dependent sex determination and low embryo
   survival at high incubation temperature. Detection of nesting events of
   loggerhead turtles in the Western Mediterranean Sea has increased
   largely during the first two decades of the 21st century, which could be
   a response to global warming or the result of increased sampling effort.
   The deployment of temperature data loggers at 52 beaches scattered along
   the Mediterranean coast of Spain demonstrated that sand temperature is
   currently high enough to allow the incubation of loggerhead turtles
   clutches in most Spanish beaches. However, the reconstruction of sand
   temperature from 1950 to 2019 revealed that thermal conditions suitable
   for the regular nesting of loggerhead turtles have existed in Spanish
   beaches only since 2010, although sporadic nesting was possible
   previously in exceptionally warm years. The future establishment of a
   self-sustained population would probably require further increases in
   temperature, to ensure a female-biased offspring production, but the
   process might be jeopardized by increased erosion and beach flooding
   resulting from sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations (EP) offer a number of goods and services that
   can reduce pressure on native forests. Eucalyptus trees can also be
   invasive and have a negative impact on native species diversity and
   regeneration. This article deals with the complex interaction between EP
   and native forests by studying the case of the humid forests of Malagasy
   Central High Land that are surrounded by EP. Floristic inventories were
   carried out on 400 m(2) plots in adjacent secondary forests (n = 5) and
   EP (n = 6). Eucalyptus has not spread to secondary forests understory.
   Native species from secondary forests have colonised EP understory.},

Abstract = {African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are a critically
   endangered and visually cryptic species that inhabits Central African
   rainforests. Using a 1250 sq-km grid of 50 acoustic sensors in Republic
   of Congo, we investigated the landscape-scale behavioural response of
   forest elephants to poaching events. We detected eight automatic weapon
   fire events over 1.5 years of recording (2017-2019). We examined
   detections of elephant vocalisations across grid sites within 10 km of
   the gunfire events in the 48 h surrounding the gunfire, and in paired
   48-h control periods free of gunfire. Fewer vocalisations were detected
   before gunfire events than during control periods, suggesting elephants
   show behavioural responses to poacher presence before any shots are
   fired. Immediately following the gunfire events, a significant increase
   in elephant calls was detected, which may indicate increased
   communication to facilitate group cohesion and movement. Elevated call
   levels dropped to lower-than-baseline rates after several hours,
   suggestive of a sustained response. These patterns indicate forest
   elephants respond to both poacher presence and to gunfire events
   themselves. As these patterns may reflect behaviours that mediate
   population processes, conservation strategies should account for the
   potential of poaching to impact populations via indirect effects on
   nontarget elephants in the area.},

Title = {Global effects of forest modification on herpetofauna communities},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As the area covered by human-modified environments grows, it is
   increasingly important to understand the responses of communities to the
   novel habitats created, especially for sensitive and threatened taxa. We
   aimed to improve understanding of the major evolutionary and ecological
   processes that shape the assemblage of amphibian and reptile communities
   to forest modifications. To this end, we compiled a global data set of
   amphibian and reptile surveys in natural, disturbed (burned, logged),
   and transformed (monocultures, polyspecific plantations) forest
   communities to assess the richness, phylogenetic diversity, and
   composition of those communities, as well as the morphological disparity
   among taxa between natural and modified forest habitats. Forest
   transformations led to a diversity reduction of 15.46\% relative to the
   statistically nonsignificant effect of disturbances. Transformations
   also led to a community composition that was 39.4\% dissimilar to that
   on natural forests, compared with 16.1\% difference in disturbances.
   Modifications did not affect the morphological disparity of communities
   (p = 0.167 and 0.744), and we found little evidence of taxon-specific
   responses to anthropic impacts. Monocultures and polyspecific
   plantations detrimentally affected the conservation and ecological value
   of both amphibian and reptile communities and altered the evolutionary
   processes shaping these communities, whereas forests with lower impact
   disturbances might, to some extent, serve as reservoirs of species.
   Although different mechanisms might buffer the collapse of
   herpetological communities, preserving remaining natural forests is
   necessary for conserving communities in the face of future anthropic
   pressures.},

Title = {Linking life history to landscape for threatened species conservation in
   a multiuse region},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Landscape-scale conservation that considers metapopulation dynamics will
   be essential for preventing declines of species facing multiple threats
   to their survival. Toward this end, we developed a novel approach that
   combines occurrence records, spatial-environmental data, and genetic
   information to model habitat, connectivity, and patterns of genetic
   structure and link spatial attributes to underlying ecological
   mechanisms. Using the threatened northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) as
   a case study, we applied this approach to address the need for
   conservation decision-making tools that promote resilient
   metapopulations of this threatened species in the Pilbara, Western
   Australia, a multiuse landscape that is a hotspot for biodiversity and
   mining. Habitat and connectivity were predicted by different landscape
   characteristics. Whereas habitat suitability was overwhelmingly driven
   by terrain ruggedness, dispersal was facilitated by proximity to
   watercourses. Although there is limited evidence for major physical
   barriers in the Pilbara, areas with high silt and clay content (i.e.,
   alluvial and hardpan plains) showed high resistance to dispersal.
   Climate subtlety shaped distributions and patterns of genetic turnover,
   suggesting the potential for local adaptation. By understanding these
   spatial-environmental associations and linking them to life-history and
   metapopulation dynamics, we highlight opportunities to provide targeted
   species management. To support this, we have created habitat,
   connectivity, and genetic uniqueness maps for conservation
   decision-making in the region. These tools have the potential to provide
   a more holistic approach to conservation in multiuse landscapes
   globally.},

Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tropical cyclones can severely disturb temperate and tropical ecosystems
   through damaging winds and excessive rainfall, but effects are often
   diverse, complex, and context-dependent. Coastal seagrass meadows are
   widespread, located along most temperate and tropical coastlines and
   often experience cyclones. Cyclone-associated damage following these
   events are variable, ranging from no seagrass damage to complete habitat
   destruction. Based on 51 studies examining cyclone effects on
   seagrasses, we did not uncover clear relationships between the number or
   severity of cyclones and declines in seagrass cover. Seagrasses were
   often minimally damaged following cyclones and were resilient to cyclone
   disturbances. When seagrass declines were reported, prolonged changes in
   seawater quality and plant burial were most often the causal factors.
   Methodological differences among studies and lack of data prior to a
   cyclone strike limited direct comparisons among articles. Suggestions to
   standardize future investigations of hurricane effects on seagrass
   meadows are provided.},

Title = {An Ancient Respiratory System in the Widespread Sedimentary Archaea
   Thermoprofundales},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {Thermoprofundales, formerly Marine Benthic Group D (MBG-D), is a
   ubiquitous archaeal lineage found in sedimentary environments worldwide.
   However, its taxonomic classification, metabolic pathways, and
   evolutionary history are largely unexplored because of its
   uncultivability and limited number of sequenced genomes. In this study,
   phylogenomic analysis and average amino acid identity values of a
   collection of 146 Thermoprofundales genomes revealed five
   Thermoprofundales subgroups (A-E) with distinct habitat preferences.
   Most of the microorganisms from Subgroups B and D were thermophiles
   inhabiting hydrothermal vents and hot spring sediments, whereas those
   from Subgroup E were adapted to surface environments where sunlight is
   available. H-2 production may be featured in Thermoprofundales as
   evidenced by a gene cluster encoding the ancient membrane-bound
   hydrogenase (MBH) complex. Interestingly, a unique structure separating
   the MBH gene cluster into two modular units was observed exclusively in
   the genomes of Subgroup E, which included a peripheral arm encoding the
   {[}NiFe] hydrogenase domain and a membrane arm encoding the Na+/H+
   antiporter domain. These two modular structures were confirmed to
   function independently by detecting the H-2-evolving activity in vitro
   and salt tolerance to 0.2 M NaCl in vivo, respectively. The peripheral
   arm of Subgroup E resembles the proposed common ancestral respiratory
   complex of modern respiratory systems, which plays a key role in the
   early evolution of life. In addition, molecular dating analysis revealed
   that Thermoprofundales is an early emerging archaeal lineage among the
   extant MBH-containing microorganisms, indicating new insights into the
   evolution of this ubiquitous archaea lineage.},

Title = {Learning from perpetrator replacement to remove crime opportunities and
   prevent poaching of the Sundarbans tiger},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is one of the leading causes of the decline
   in high-value species. Crime-reduction strategies to counter IWT can
   have unintended effects, with crime displacement occurring when
   offenders react to such interventions. Despite the value of
   understanding how and why displacement occurs for informing conservation
   strategies, few examples are published. We explored a case of
   perpetrator replacement following an intervention and drew lessons for
   conservation strategies for high-value species. Poaching and subsequent
   trade threaten the Sundarbans tiger (Panthera tigris). Pirate gangs were
   the dominant poachers from 1980 to 2017, but following an extensive
   campaign, the Sundarbans was declared pirate free in 2018. We
   interviewed 280 individuals, including 100 tiger poachers, from 26
   administrative unions bordering the Sundarbans and used interviewee
   responses to compare the poaching situation during and after the pirate
   era. We analyzed the spatial distribution of tiger poachers among the
   unions and used crime script analysis of the dominant poacher type to
   identify intervention. Because pirates opportunistically poached tigers,
   the government's successful counter-pirate campaign inadvertently
   removed the dominant tiger poaching type. However, a temporary reduction
   in poaching was rapidly cancelled out by the emergence of at least 32
   specialist tiger-poaching teams. With the risk of extortion and robbery
   from pirates gone, other groups increased the frequency of opportunistic
   and targeted tiger poaching. Based on expert interviews, we estimated
   that 341 tiger poachers of all types are active throughout the unions,
   with 79\% of specialists concentrated in 27\% of unions. The highly
   focused counter-pirate campaign reduced motivations and opportunities
   for piracy but left intact the opportunity structure and trade
   connections for tiger poaching, and with insufficient enforcement
   officers trading has flourished. Interventions targeting opportunities
   for poaching by specialist tiger poachers include heightened
   surveillance and reporting mechanisms and alternative livelihood
   provision to disincentivize poaching.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Assessing species' extinction risk is vital to setting conservation
   priorities. However, assessment endeavors, such as those used to produce
   the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, have significant gaps in
   taxonomic coverage. Automated assessment (AA) methods are gaining
   popularity to fill these gaps. Choices made in developing, using, and
   reporting results of AA methods could hinder their successful adoption
   or lead to poor allocation of conservation resources. We explored how
   choice of data cleaning type and level, taxonomic group, training
   sample, and automation method affect performance of threat status
   predictions for plant species. We used occurrences from the Global
   Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to generate assessments for
   species in 3 taxonomic groups based on 6 different occurrence-based AA
   methods. We measured each method's performance and coverage following
   increasingly stringent occurrence cleaning. Automatically cleaned data
   from GBIF performed comparably to occurrence records cleaned manually by
   experts. However, all types of data cleaning limited the coverage of
   AAs. Overall, machine-learning-based methods performed well across taxa,
   even with minimal data cleaning. Results suggest a
   machine-learning-based method applied to minimally cleaned data offers
   the best compromise between performance and species coverage. However,
   optimal data cleaning, training sample, and automation methods depend on
   the study group, intended applications, and expertise.},

Title = {The Evolution of Competitive Ability},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {201},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Competition drives evolutionary change across taxa, but our
   understanding of how competitive differences among species directs the
   evolution of interspecific interactions remains incomplete. Verbal
   models assume that interspecific competition will select for reducing a
   species' sensitivity to competition with their opponent; however, they
   do not consider the potential for other demographic components of
   competitive ability to evolve, specifically, interspecific effects,
   intraspecific interactions, and intrinsic growth rates. To better
   understand how competitive ability evolves, we set out to explore how
   each component has evolved and whether their evolution has been
   constrained by trade-offs. By setting sympatric and allopatric
   populations of an annual grass in competition with a dominant invader,
   we demonstrate (1) that in response to interspecific competition,
   populations can evolve increased competitive ability through either
   reduced interspecific or, surprisingly, reduced intraspecific
   competition; (2) that trade-offs do not always constrain the evolution
   of competitive ability but rather that parameters may correlate in ways
   that mutually beget higher competitive ability; and (3) that the
   evolution of one species can influence the competitive ability of its
   opponent, a consequence of how competitive ability is defined
   ecologically. Overall, our results reveal the complexity with which
   demographic components evolve in response to interspecific competition
   and the impact past evolution can have on present-day interactions.},

Title = {Inverse Lansing Effect: Maternal Age and Provisioning Affecting
   Daughters' Longevity and Male Offspring Production},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Maternal age effects on offspring life history are known in a variety of
   organisms, with offspring of older mothers typically having lower life
   expectancy (the Lansing effect). However, there is no consensus on the
   generality and mechanisms of this pattern. We tested predictions of the
   Lansing effect in several Daphnia magna clones and observed
   clone-specific magnitude and direction of the maternal age effect on
   offspring longevity. We also report ambidirectional, genotype-specific
   effects of maternal age on the propensity of daughters to produce male
   offspring. Focusing on two clones with contrasting life histories, we
   demonstrate that maternal age effects can be explained by lipid
   provisioning of embryos by mothers of different ages. Individuals from a
   single-generation maternal age reversal treatment showed intermediate
   life span and intermediate lipid content at birth. In the clone
   characterized by the ``inverse Lansing effect,{''} neonates produced by
   older mothers showed higher mitochondrial membrane potential in neural
   tissues than their counterparts born to younger mothers. We conclude
   that an inverse Lansing effect is possible and hypothesize that it may
   be caused by age-specific maternal lipid provisioning creating a
   calorically restricted environment during embryonic development, which
   in turn reduces fecundity and increases life span in offspring.},

Journal = {ORYX},

Volume = {57},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The prehensile-tailed skink Corucia zebrata is endemic to the Solomon
   Islands. It is the most traded reptile from the country. During
   2000-2019, CITES reported the legal export of 10,567 individuals.
   Although the level of this trade is well documented, impacts on the
   skink's survival in its native range are comparatively unknown. During
   January-May 2020, we surveyed 146 people on 12 islands to collect
   information on the habitats preferred by the prehensile-tailed skink, to
   understand perceptions of the species' conservation status and identify
   any potential threats. Respondents reported lowland and hill forests as
   being favoured habitats, with low proportions of respondents identifying
   coastal and montane forests as suitable habitat. Habitat loss (72\%),
   hunting (17\%), and predation (6\%) were identified as the main threats.
   People younger than 30 years of age reported killing the skinks more
   frequently than did people over the age of 30. Prehensile-tailed skinks
   have a relatively small home range, long reproductive cycle, and are
   vulnerable to numerous threats. We thus recommend a halt to the current
   practice of exporting wild-caught prehensile-tailed skinks, and
   replacement by a well-regulated captive breeding programme.},

Abstract = {Open-source intelligence (OSINT) evolved in spy agencies but now is
   rapidly changing many fields of study, from anthropology to zoology.
   Despite the fact that OSINT occasionally is used in conservation
   biology, there is little recognition that some tools and frameworks used
   by conservation professionals are drawn from this well-established
   field. In conservation biology, OSINT is sometimes used to evaluate
   wildlife crime, human-wildlife and human-environment interactions,
   animal behavior, and questions of distribution and abundance.
   Recognizing the conceptual foundations of the field would allow
   expansion of conservation biology, not only in the areas noted above,
   but also, for example, in study of habitat use, habitat change, and
   animal behavior. This recognition would also provide frameworks for
   conceptual advancement, especially in terms of data and privacy
   management. Failure to recognize the underpinnings of OSINT tools in
   conservation biology harms the field because it limits how research is
   framed, thought about, and implemented. Likewise, taking an OSINT
   perspective to conservation problems, rather than simply thinking in
   terms of big data, can enrich the field, expand science, and increase
   knowledge and understanding of biology and biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The blue stingray Dasyatis chrysonota is an important and endemic
   coastal inhabitant of southern African coastal waters however, it is
   listed as Near Threatened with declining populations. Understanding it's
   spatial ecology in the context of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
   is vital to not only inform population dynamics and ecological roles,
   but to determine whether currently zoned MPAs can provide sufficient
   protection to this species. Twenty-seven individuals were monitored
   using the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP-a nation-wide
   collaborative network of acoustic receivers) for up to 4.5 years.
   Individuals displayed site affinity to defined regions of the coast,
   with the majority of detections for most individuals being recorded in
   the shallow bay/coastal shelf they were tagged in. However, important
   movement corridors linking different habitats were also identified
   (inshore vs offshore and coastal bay vs coastal shelf habitats). This
   habitat use varied monthly and was influenced by temperature, with
   individuals displaying restricted movements to the shallow bay habitat
   in summer when deeper waters were much colder. The large collaborative
   nature of the ATAP allowed for the monitoring of a benthic ray across
   large spatial scales for the first time, challenging preconceived
   notions that small undulatory batoids cannot travel large distances
   (many individuals were found to travel up to 200 km). Insights can also
   assist in local management of this species, and highlight that current
   MPA zonation may not be sufficient to protect blue stingrays from
   further population declines.},

Title = {Anthropogenic activity and structures have varying effects on the
   activity of carnivores in a protected area in Wisconsin, United States},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13-14},
Pages = {3163-3178},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While protected areas are often considered strongholds for wildlife
   populations, recent research in protected areas has highlighted that
   both human activity (i.e. presence) and footprint (i.e. structures) can
   influence wildlife. To determine how human activity and structures
   affect the spatiotemporal activity of wildlife on the Apostle Islands
   National Lakeshore, Wisconsin, United States, we monitored the carnivore
   community for 5 years (2014-2018) using camera traps. We found that
   lighthouses had a negative impact on carnivore community richness, while
   historical sites had a positive impact. Responses of individual
   carnivore species to anthropogenic structures varied depending on
   structure type, with most of the canids and mustelids exhibiting
   negative associations with campgrounds. When examining the seasonal
   effects of human activity and footprint (i.e., when park visitation is
   relatively high or low), we found that carnivore richness was lower
   during the high human activity season, suggesting that seasonal
   variation in human activity influences carnivore activity. We also
   compared carnivore nocturnality along a gradient of anthropogenic
   activity, but our results indicate that the carnivore community did not
   become more nocturnal with increasing anthropogenic activity as
   expected. However, the carnivore community did display spatial avoidance
   of current anthropogenic structures, especially campgrounds. Our study
   indicates that human footprint in the form of structures and seasonal
   variation in human activity can influence wildlife activity within
   protected areas. Based on this study, species-specific research that
   includes multiple representations of potential human effects (i.e.,
   including categories of human footprint and activity) will allow for a
   more nuanced and cohesive understanding of the impacts of humans on the
   spatial and temporal distributions of wildlife species.},

Journal = {WETLANDS},

Abstract = {The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the
   devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where
   few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests
   are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and
   salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats
   ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These
   areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal
   coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure
   mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a
   mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former `apicum' area) in
   northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which
   involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and
   water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the
   intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia
   germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was
   high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia
   racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with
   respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide
   valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing
   tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with
   ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the
   return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like
   facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area.
   Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of
   degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and
   management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.},

Title = {CO2 Uptake Offsets Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Salt Marshes with
   Chronic Nitrogen Loading},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are known for exceptional productivity, but they also
   receive intense land-based nitrogen (N) loading. In Narragansett Bay, RI
   (USA), coastal ecosystems have received anthropogenic N inputs from
   wastewater for more than two centuries. Greenhouse gas fluxes were
   studied throughout a growing season (2016) in three coastal wetlands
   with contrasting histories of nitrogen loading. The wetland with the
   highest historic N load (Mary's Creek, Warwick, RI) had significantly
   greater nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions than the other
   two sites. However, the two marshes with historic N loads (Mary's Creek
   and Mary Donovan, Little Compton, RI) also had greater rates of CO2
   uptake than the reference site (Nag Marsh, Prudence Island, RI). Their
   CO2 uptake rates far outpaced their other greenhouse gas emissions.
   Mary's Creek had the greatest above- and below-ground plant biomass,
   vertical accretion rates, and carbon content of soils. Spartina
   alterniflora height was greatest at Mary's Creek and Mary Donovan marsh.
   The following growing season (2017), greenhouse gases were compared
   across four plant-defined ecological zones in Mary's Creek. Higher rates
   of CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions were found in the S.
   alterniflora-vegetated creekbank compared to high marsh zones or bare
   mudflats. Potential denitrifying enzyme activity did not significantly
   differ across the four zones nor between Mary's Creek and Nag Marsh,
   suggesting a consistently high capacity to completely reduce N loads.
   These results support efforts to protect and restore these coastal
   ecosystems for their carbon sequestration function even despite
   prevalence of anthropogenic N loading.},

Title = {Global justice and the opportunity costs of conservation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Opportunity costs can represent a significant portion of the costs
   associated with conservation projects and frequently outstrip other
   kinds of cost. They are typically understood to refer to the benefits
   someone would have obtained if conservation projects had not required
   them to give up current activities, such as farming or hunting or if the
   land had been available for uses other than conservation. This familiar
   way of identifying opportunity costs is flawed, however, because it
   threatens to condone, or take advantage of, the injustices that many
   people face that affect their opportunities. I integrated ideas from the
   political theory of global justice to examine how the analysis of
   opportunity costs illustrates the importance of considering conservation
   and issues of global justice together, rather than thinking about them
   in isolation. I distinguish four baselines for defining opportunity
   costs. A status quo baseline defines opportunity costs by asking what
   people would have earned had a conservation project not happened. A
   willingness to accept baseline defines them by asking people what it
   would take to make them indifferent to whether a conservation project
   takes place or not. An antipoverty baseline suggests that opportunity
   costs have been met when people affected by a project are not left in
   poverty. An egalitarian baseline suggests opportunity costs have been
   met when people are not left in relative disadvantage, with worse than
   average opportunities. I argue that the egalitarian baseline is the most
   acceptable from the point of view of justice. Such a baseline would
   suggest that, in practice, many of the world's poor are being unjustly
   treated, or even exploited, as a result of conservation activities.},

Title = {Rediscovery of the Critically Endangered Primula esquirolii, a karst
   cave species with an extremely small population endemic to China},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 25},
Abstract = {The rare plant Primula esquirolii, a karst cave species in the family
   Primulaceae, endemic to Guizhou, China, and with a presumed extremely
   small population, had not previously been observed since 1910. It is
   categorized as Endangered on the China Species Red List. In surveys
   during 2018-2022, we were unable to locate the species in its type
   location in Pingba county, but we discovered a previously unrecorded
   population of 44 mature individuals, 37 of which were long homostylous
   and seven of which were heterostylous. These individuals were discovered
   in Xiuwen county in February 2022, in an area of c. 50 m(2), c. 40 km
   from the type location. All seven heterostylous individuals showed the
   short-styled morph. The almost homostylous P. esquirolii potentially
   faces the same high genetic load as other homostylous plants, and this
   may have led to its small population size and potential sensitivity to
   habitat destruction. Field surveys and informal interviews with local
   people indicated that the main threats to this species are its small
   population size and the loss of suitable habitat as a result of human
   activities. The most urgent requirement for the conservation of this
   species is to protect the habitat of this single known extant population
   and to carry out ex situ conservation. Further field surveys and
   research are also required to improve our understanding of the status of
   this species.},

Abstract = {Long-term vegetation monitoring is essential to understanding plant
   responses to both climate and grazing. The objective of this study was
   to monitor the long-term effects of precipitation on vegetation changes
   within a salt desert shrub plant community and determine whether grazing
   by livestock altered the vegetation during this time. The study was
   located within the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah. Two sites were
   selected. One exclosure was constructed at each site, and foliar cover
   was measured inside and outside the exclosure to separate the effect of
   grazing from precipitation on vegetation change over a 30-year period.
   Shrubs were the dominant vegetative cover at the start of the study,
   with the invasive shrub Gutierrezia sarothrae being the dominant shrub
   accounting for 53\% of total plant cover. As the invasive shrub died out
   due to drought, native shrub cover as well as C-4 grass cover increased.
   Native shrub cover displayed positive correlations with current winter
   and cool-season precipitation. C-4 grass cover displayed positive
   correlation with cool-season precipitation. Winter and spring grazing at
   moderate stocking rates were not detrimental to these desert plant
   communities. Climatic conditions were the dominant influence on
   vegetation.},

Abstract = {The marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumenifer) is widespread and generally
   abundant in East and Southern Africa, but recent research has found
   range loss indicative of a population decline in West Africa in recent
   decades. In the absence of population data, we conducted an in-depth
   review of the status of the marabou in the region using a plethora of
   sources together comprising the largest database on the occurrence of
   the species. Despite caveats and coarseness of the assessment, we
   estimate the range loss at 52\% in West Africa, including extirpation of
   approximately 64\% of known nesting colonies since 2000. The resulting
   fragmentation has left a metapopulation of likely no more than 100
   breeding pairs in The Gambia and Benin and an unknown number of breeders
   in Cameroon. Knowledge gaps about marabou population ecology in West
   Africa are significant and prevent an empirical assessment of regional
   extinction probability. Therefore, we recommend immediate field surveys,
   especially for breeding colonies, and research into threats and
   population dynamics. We also recommend the West African metapopulation
   be listed as regionally critically endangered and that a working group
   be formed comprising stakeholders from across the region to aid in
   assessing threats and implementing research and conservation action.},

Abstract = {The present study aims at determining the phytogeographical distribution
   and economic potential and documenting the degree of risk to the
   extinction of tree species, and the changes these species have undergone
   over the past 20 years. Field surveys were conducted at many locations
   in Egypt between January 2017 and March 2020. From each location, GPS
   coordinates were taken and the number of individuals was estimated.
   Also, specimens and seed samples for each species were collected from
   different habitats as can as possible. Other data were collected through
   herbaria visits and existing literature. The recorded taxa were arranged
   alphabetically according to Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system (APG IV).
   Evaluation of conservation status was based on IUCN Red List Categories
   and Criteria. In the present study, we applied Criterion B that concerns
   the geographical range in the form of both B1 (extent of occurrence:
   EOO) and B2 (area of occupancy: AOO). Calculations of both AOO and EOO
   and the assessment process were assisted using the GeoCAT software.
   Fifty-seven taxa were recorded, and most of them occur in Elbanian
   sector. Among them, five alien species were recorded. Many taxa offered
   economic goods such as medicinal, timber and fuel values; and
   environmental services as shaders and phytoremediators. Fifty taxa
   suffered from over-collecting and over-cutting. Among the 52 native
   trees in the present study, 31 taxa are evaluated as threatened with
   extinction; 10 taxa are Critically Endangered, 16 are Endangered and 5
   are Vulnerable. There are two taxa assessed as Near Threatened and 15 as
   Least Concern. On the contrary, four taxa fall in the category of Data
   Deficient. There are 28 in situ conserved taxa in the protected areas.
   Also, 28 taxa are under ex situ conservation. In conclusion, land-use
   patterns, climate change and human impact lead to put about 61\% of the
   trees in Egypt under threat of extinction. Consequently, nature
   conservation organisations should take an action towards the
   conservation of these valuable taxa.},

Abstract = {The ecology and phenology of the Dysderidae (Araneae) were investigated
   in two different sites (Tala-Guilef and Tikjda), located at opposite
   slopes of the Djurdjura National Park in Algeria. The following
   questions were investigated: Are there any endemic species in the
   studied area? Do the slopes' orientation influence the abundance,
   richness and diversity of these spider communities? Are the activity and
   the vital cycle of the three most abundant species different in the two
   different plant physiognomies (cedar forests and alpine grasslands)? The
   Dysderidae were collected monthly for 2 years using pitfall traps. In
   total, 1532 specimens were collected: 333 males, 389 females and 381
   juveniles in Tala-Guilef and 230 males, 66 females and 133 juveniles in
   Tikjda. Among the total of 10 species sampled, three species belonging
   to three genera in Tala-Guilef, 10 species belonging to four genera in
   Tikdja and four endemic species was recorded. The slope orientation
   influence the abundance and the species richness. The activity and the

Title = {Experimental evidence of the impact of framing of actors and victims in
   conservation narratives},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Media narratives play a crucial role in framing marine conservation
   dilemmas by depicting human actors, such as fish consumers or the
   fishing industry, as responsible for negative effects of their actions
   on species and ecosystems. However, there is little evidence documenting
   how such narratives affect preferences for reducing bycatch. Behavioral
   science research shows that people can act less prosocially when more
   actors are responsible for a collective outcome (responsibility
   diffusion effect) and when more victims need to be helped (compassion
   fade effect); thus, the media's framing of actors and victims may have a
   significant effect on preferences. We conducted the first test of
   responsibility diffusion and compassion fade in a marine context in an
   online experiment (1548 participants in the United Kingdom). In 9 media
   narratives, we varied the type of actors responsible for fisheries
   bycatch (e.g., consumers and industry) and victims (e.g., a single
   species, multiple species, and ecosystems) in media narratives and
   determined the effects of the narratives on participants' support for
   bycatch policies and intentions to alter fish consumption. When
   responsibility for negative effects was attributed to consumers and
   industry, the probability of participants reporting support for
   fisheries policies (e.g., bycatch enforcement or consumer taxes) was
   similar to 30\% higher (odds ratio = 1.32) than when only consumers were
   attributed responsibility. These effects were primarily driven by female
   participants. Narratives had no effect on personal intentions to consume
   fish. Varying the type of victim had no effect on policy support and
   intentions. Our results suggest that neither responsibility diffusion
   nor compassion fade automatically follows from increasing the types of
   actors and victims in media narratives and that effects can depend on
   the type of outcome and population subgroup.},

Title = {The US market for imported wildlife not listed in the CITES multilateral

Abstract = {The international wildlife trade presents severe conservation and
   environmental security risks, yet no international regulatory framework
   exists to monitor the trade of species not listed in the appendices of
   the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
   Fauna and Flora (CITES). We explored the composition and dynamics of
   internationally regulated versus nonregulated trade, with a focus on
   importations of wild-caught terrestrial vertebrates entering the United
   States from 2009 to 2018. We used 10 years of species-level trade
   records of the numbers of live, wild-caught animals imported to the
   United States and data on International Union for the Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN) estimates of extinction risk to determine whether there
   were differences in the diversity, abundance, and risk to extinction
   among imports of CITES-listed versus unlisted species. We found 3.6
   times the number of unlisted species in U.S. imports compared with
   CITES-listed species (1366 vs. 378 species). The CITES-listed species
   were more likely to face reported conservation threats relative to
   unlisted species (71.7\% vs. 27.5\%). However, 376 unlisted species
   faced conversation threats, 297 species had unknown population trends,
   and 139 species were without an evaluation by the IUCN. Unlisted species
   appearing for the first time in records were imported 5.5 times more
   often relative to CITES-listed species. Unlisted reptiles had the
   largest rate of entry, averaging 53 unique species appearing in imports
   for the first time per year. Overall trade quantities were approximately
   11 times larger for imports of unlisted species relative to imports of
   CITES-listed species. Countries that were top exporters of CITES-listed
   species were mostly different from exporters of unlisted species.
   Because of the vulnerabilities of unlisted, traded species entering the
   United States and increasing global demand, we strongly recommend
   governments adapt their policies to monitor and report on the trade of
   all wildlife.},

Title = {Intraspecific Functional Variability and Functional Changes Along

   West-Central Mexico},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Functional diversity and the contribution of functional traits in
   mangrove ecosystems dynamics in western Mexico remain unknown. In this
   study, we assessed functional variability and intraspecific trait
   variation in three different mangrove zones. We developed and tested the
   following hypothesis: (i) mangrove species vary along trait axes
   associated with plant size and leaf economics. (ii) there is
   intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in leaf traits related to economic
   aspects of plant function among mangrove zones. (iii) the presence of
   functional variation in plant traits among mangrove zones is related to
   physicochemical ground-water gradients. We used 65 permanent plots,
   distributed across three contrasting mangrove zones to assess
   morphological functional traits: leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA),
   leaf dry-matter content (LDMC), tree height (H) and wood density; in
   each permanent plot, we recorded: water salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH
   and temperature. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine
   how mangrove and mangrove-associated species were assembled in the
   functional trait space; in order to identify ITV, we compared the mean
   functional trait values using general linear models (GLM) with the zone
   and species as fixed effects. We also tested for differences in
   functional composition by Community-Weighted Means (CWM) running GLM for
   each trait with mangrove zones as fixed effect. Finally, we ran a
   Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to identify interstitial water variables
   explaining functional composition. According to our GLM results, we
   found intraspecific variability in functional traits among the three
   mangrove zones; particularly LDMC varied the most among species inside
   the three zones. Regarding GLM results using CWM, traits such as SLA,
   LDMC and H were different among zones. Our findings suggested ITV among
   mangrove zones with spatial patterns related to interstitial water
   variables; mangrove species exhibited significant ITV mainly in SLA and
   LDMC; salinity and pH were relevant to the functional ecology in
   mangrove ecosystems.},

Title = {Health Assessment of Nayband National Park Mangroves and Genetic
   Diversity of Associated Sesarmid Crab Parasesarma Persicum},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests as one of the most important coastal ecosystems provide
   important ecological and economic performance to the world, have been
   threatened by developmental human activities and subsequent land use
   changes. The present study aims to assess mangrove ecosystem health in
   Nayband Marine National Park, Iran using Mangrove Quality Index (MQI),
   in addition to analyse the effect of mangrove habitat quality on the
   genetic diversity of Parasesarma persicum the associated mangrove crab
   by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Four stations were
   studied for mangrove quality index analysis as well as genetic analysis.
   The results of MQI survey based on hydrology, water, soil, biota
   criteria indicated moderate to low habitat quality of mangroves in the
   study area. Station 4 in the southern Nayband gulf showed highest impact
   by human activities and MQI of 0.7, indicating serious habitat
   alteration in this area. Station 2 in the northern part of Nayband gulf
   showed a moderate mangrove quality (MQI = 0.5). Based on the results of
   the AFLP genetic assessment, the estimated heterozygosity (He) of crabs
   was between 0.29 and 0.32 with a mean of 0.30. The highest genetic
   diversity was found at station 2, however, no complete population
   differentiation was observed between 4 stations. The analysis revealed a
   significant correlation between mangrove habitat alteration and
   heterozygosity reduction (p < 0.05). Based on the results of the present
   study, mangrove habitat destruction due to anthropogenic activities may
   directly reduce the genetic diversity of associated species of this
   ecosystem.},

Title = {An Ecological Expert System Optimization for Assessing Environmental
   Water Requirements of Hypersaline Lakes},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The present study proposes an applicable methodology to optimize
   environmental water requirement of hypersaline lakes with a focus on
   Urmia lake as the case study in which remote sensing analysis, machine
   learning model and fuzzy expert system are linked. A machine learning
   model was developed to simulate effective abiotic parameters in which
   bands of operational land imager (Landsat 8) were inputs and depth and
   total dissolved solids were the outputs of the model. Moreover, an
   ecological expert system using Mamadani fuzzy inference system was
   developed to generate the habitat suitability map for the selected
   target species. Then, a multivariate linear model was developed to
   assess unit habitat suitability in which water level and total inflow of
   the lake were the variables of the model. An optimization model was
   developed to assess environmental water requirement in which habitat
   suitability between natural and regulated flows and water supply loss
   was minimized. The multivariate linear model was applied to assess
   habitat suitability in the optimization model. Based on the results in
   the case study, the proposed combined model is able to balance the
   ecological requirements and water demand by allocating 60\% and 40\% of
   total inflow to environmental water requirement and water demand
   respectively. Average habitat loss proposed by the optimal environmental
   water requirement was less than 20\% which implies the robustness of the
   model. Generating habitat suitability maps of the lake by a reliable
   method which is used in the environmental flow optimization might be the
   significance of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {In wet peatlands, plant growth conditions are largely determined by
   local soil conditions, leading to locally adapted vegetation. Despite
   that Carex species are often the prevailing vascular plant species in
   fen peatlands of the temperate zone, information about how these species
   adapt to local environmental conditions is scarce. This holds true
   especially for below-ground plant traits and for adaptations to
   fen-typical nutrient level variations. To address this research gap, we
   investigated how different geographic origins (Germany, Poland, The
   Netherlands) of C. acutiformis and C. rostrata relate to their response
   to varying nutrient availability. We performed a common garden
   experiment with a controlled gradient of nutrient levels, and analyzed
   above- and below-ground biomass production of both Carex species from
   the different geographic origins. We related these traits to
   environmental conditions of the origins as characterized by vegetation
   composition-derived indicator values for ecological habitat conditions.
   While we detected high above-ground phenotypic plasticity of Carex from
   different origins, our data point to below-ground genotypic differences,
   potentially indicating local adaptation: Rhizome traits of C. rostrata
   differed significantly between origins with different nutrient indicator
   values. These results point towards differences in C. rostrata clonal
   spread behavior depending on local peatland conditions. Therefore, local
   adaptations of plant species and below-ground biomass traits should be
   taken into account when studying peatland vegetation ecology, as key
   functional traits can differ between genotypes within a single species
   depending on local conditions.},

Abstract = {To evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks of
   ash, alder and oak tree stands in Karacabey floodplain forest and
   adjacent Calabrian pine forest, grassland, cropland and sand dune in
   relation to soil depths (0-130 cm), a study in three replicate sites for
   each tree and the adjacent sites was carried out in northwest Turkey.
   The results indicated that among the tree species, alder stands had the
   greatest SOC (3.97\%) and TN (0.328\%) and total accumulation of SOC
   (405 Mg ha(-1)) and TN (34.4 Mg ha(-1)), followed by ash tree (3.11\%,
   0.302\%, 393 Mg ha(-1) and 26.2 Mg ha(-1) respectively) and oak (2.43\%,
   0.220\%, 293 Mg ha(-1) and 28.6 Mg ha(-1) respectively). However, the
   grassland showed the highest cumulative SOC densities within 0-130 cm
   depth (678 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the tree species. It also showed
   higher TN densities (27.5 Mg ha(-1)) than the ash tree and the Calabrian
   pine stands, whereas lower than the alder and oak stands. The sand dunes
   showed the lowest SOC and TN values. Compared to the soil depth of 0-30
   cm, mean SOC and TN stored in 30-130 cm soil depth accounted for 58\%
   and 40\% in ash stands, 41\% and 45\% in alder stands, 52\% and 56\% in
   oak stands, 57\% and 66\% in Calabrian pine stands respectively. Thick
   alluvial soil and dry climate in the region could be responsible for the
   better root system development, and thus much higher SOC and TN stocks
   into deeper soil layers.},

Title = {Soil Carbon within the Mangrove Landscape in Rufiji River Delta,
   Tanzania},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mangroves are among the most carbon-rich terrestrial ecosystems,
   primarily attributable to the soil pool. There are substantial
   differences in soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) due to the disparities
   in geomorphic settings and ecological drivers, but this insight is drawn
   primarily from observational studies. An objective inventory of carbon
   stocks in mangroves of the Rufiji River Delta, Tanzania was conducted.
   Seventy-five soil cores were collected within a 12,164 ha inventory
   area, comprising the northern portion of the delta. Cores were collected
   from intact and dwarf mangroves, agricultural fields, and mudflats. The
   spatial mean soil organic carbon (SOC) density in mangroves was 16.35
   +/- 6.25 mg C cm(-3). Mean SOC density in non-vegetated mudflats was
   12.16 +/- 4.57 mg C cm(-3), demonstrating that mangroves develop on
   soils with a substantial soil C stock. However, long-established
   mangroves had had a higher C density (17.27 +/- 5.87 mg C cm(-3)). Using
   a delta C-13 mixing model, the source of soil organic matter in mudflats
   was primarily marine, while long-established mangroves was predominantly
   mangrove. There were small differences in SOC among long-established
   mangrove sites in different geomorphic settings. The proportion of
   marine-sourced SOC increased with soil depth in mangroves. The SOC and
   nitrogen of agricultural sites resemble those of mudflats, suggesting
   those sites are developed from relatively young forests. The SOC and
   nitrogen density in dwarf mangrove sites were lower than others, perhaps
   reflecting past disturbances.},

Title = {Cascading effects of social dynamics on the reproduction, survival, and
   population growth of mountain gorillas},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {398-411},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Whilst the conservation impacts of density-dependent population effects
   have been well studied, the impact that socially-driven changes (e.g.
   group fissions that increase group density) can have on population
   growth in social species have only recently come to light. An increase
   in group density and intergroup encounters in a subpopulation of
   mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei was shown to have driven a
   more than fourfold increase in infanticide, slowing population growth.
   In this study, we delve deeper into the consequences of these
   socially-driven changes in group density, examining how patterns of
   reproduction and survival have changed in this subpopulation across more
   than 50 years. We show that adult female survival increased with
   strengthening conservation efforts early in the study, then remained
   stable, while age at first birth remained stable across the entire
   study. Interbirth intervals and female reproductive success did not vary
   significantly across time overall. However, socially-driven increases in
   group density since the mid-2000s appear to have had a cascade of
   effects. In addition to the increase in infant and adult male mortality
   from violence during intergroup encounters, higher encounter rates, and
   mortality were likely responsible for an increase in female transfers,
   which delayed reproduction. Females faced a 7.5-month delay when
   transferring once and a 1.5-year delay when transferring twice or more
   between births. We show these changes correspond with a 26.63\%
   reduction in female reproductive success in 2007 to 2018, compared to
   1994 to 2006, with females taking more than 2 years longer to produce an
   offspring that survived infancy. These findings demonstrate that social
   dynamics can have consequences for population growth beyond the
   immediate mortality effects of violent encounters. This further
   highlights the critical importance of social dynamics in the
   conservation of social species, particularly when populations are
   restricted to small or fragmented regions of habitat.},

Title = {Influence of landscape and connectivity on anuran conservation:
   population viability analyses to designate protected areas},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-397},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Threatened species with restricted ranges are at risk from habitat
   fragmentation and loss, which amplifies genetic bottleneck and impacts
   of small changes to their environments. Ecological models including
   population viability analyses (PVAs) can predict the trajectory of
   populations in a way that is not invasive or detrimental to the study
   species. They can therefore be a vital tool in modeling populations for
   conservation purposes. Although habitat suitability models have been
   used in studies to suggest areas for protected area designation, PVAs
   are generally not used in this regard. Dryophytes suweonensis and
   Dryophytes flaviventris are two threatened treefrog species endemic to
   the Korean Peninsula. The two species face threats of habitat loss and
   degradation and predation by invasive species among others. We used an
   integrated modeling approach combining ecological niche, connectivity,
   and PVAs in Vortex to determine the likelihood of extinction of each
   species under baseline and protected area designation scenarios.
   Designation scenarios were simulated in Vortex through halting future
   reduction in carrying capacity (halting future degradation to sites
   through protected area status), reducing effects of catastrophes
   (mitigating the effects of drought), and reducing mortality rates
   (controlling invasive predator populations and ex situ raising of
   tadpoles to maturity). We classified the combination of these management
   efforts as ``active management{''} as opposed to ``no management,{''}
   which is currently being practiced. We additionally used a stepwise
   approach to determine designation priority of individual patches. Under
   current conditions (no management), the resulting effective
   metapopulations after 100 years were 167 +/- 325 individuals with an
   86.5\% extinction probability for D. suweonensis and 165 +/- 200
   individuals with a 90.3\% extinction probability for D. flaviventris.
   Under active management of all sites (93 sites covering 426.9 km(2)),
   the extinction probability was 0\% for both species with significantly
   increased metapopulation sizes, 15 910 +/- 2855 for D. suweonensis, and
   4400 +/- 874 for D. flaviventris. Determining designation priority can
   inform the regulatory bodies on which habitat to designate and whether
   active or passive management should be applied. Without intervention,
   these species will be likely to face imminent extinction. In addition to
   being useful for government-imposed conservation management, our study
   can be followed by future studies as a methodology for prioritizing
   sites for protected area designation.},

Abstract = {Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponinae) are essential pollinators of
   numerous native and cultivated plant species, especially in the tropics.
   Knowledge of the distance over which the bee travels in search of food
   is crucial for successful pollination. Less is known about foraging
   ranges of African stingless bee species. This study investigated the
   foraging range of an African stingless bee species, Hypotrigona
   gribodoi, using translocation experiments. The capture-mark-recapture
   method and release at various designated distances were used. This study
   showed >90\% returning success of the bees when released up to 120 m
   from the hive. The distance at which bees attained 50\% returns (typical
   distance) was 250 m, while the distance in which 90\% of bees failed to
   return based on our regression function was 540 m. These results
   indicate that colonies of H. gribodoi placed in a field crop might
   provide good pollination within a radius of up to 250 m. The ability of
   foragers to collect pollen and nectar and the information about the
   distance they use for foraging is vital for managing and conserving
   stingless bees.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Larval dispersal connectivity is typically integrated into spatial
   conservation decisions at regional or national scales, but implementing
   agencies struggle with translating these methods to local scales. We
   used larval dispersal connectivity at regional (hundreds of kilometers)
   and local (tens of kilometers) scales to aid in design of networks of
   no-take reserves in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used Marxan with
   Connectivity informed by biophysical larval dispersal models and
   remotely sensed coral reef habitat data to design marine reserve
   networks for 4 commercially important reef species across the region. We
   complemented regional spatial prioritization with decision trees that
   combined network-based connectivity metrics and habitat quality to
   design reserve boundaries locally. Decision trees were used in
   consensus-based workshops with stakeholders to qualitatively assess site
   desirability, and Marxan was used to identify areas for subsequent
   network expansion. Priority areas for protection and expected benefits
   differed among species, with little overlap in reserve network
   solutions. Because reef quality varied considerably across reefs, we
   suggest reef degradation must inform the interpretation of larval
   dispersal patterns and the conservation benefits achievable from
   protecting reefs. Our methods can be readily applied by conservation
   practitioners, in this region and elsewhere, to integrate connectivity
   data across multiple spatial scales.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Translocations are a widespread approach to conserve threatened
   populations. Given the rapid decline and genetic deterioration of many
   natural populations, translocations are expected to become even more
   common in the future. The success of translocations is, however,
   dependent on multiple context-dependent factors, such as demographic and
   genetic status, habitat quality and animal behaviour. The Scandinavian
   arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) exists in a small, fragmented population
   that is demographically vulnerable and exposed to inbreeding depression.
   In the early 2000 s, releases of arctic foxes from the Norwegian Captive
   Breeding Programme were initiated with the purpose of reintroducing
   populations to formerly inhabited areas and promoting connectivity.
   Since 2008/2009, 61 foxes have been released in Junkeren, Norway to
   re-establish an unoccupied area. We used a combination of field
   observations and microsatellite genotyping from the release site and two
   neighbouring subpopulations to investigate (i) the probability of
   establishment and reproduction for released foxes at the release site
   and in neighbouring subpopulations, and (ii) the impact on litter size
   and genetic composition in the recipient populations. Results showed
   that 18\% of the released foxes were established at the release site, or
   in neighbouring subpopulations and 11.5\% reproduced successfully. The
   extent of post-release dispersal into neighbouring subpopulations was
   also relatively high (11.5\%). During the study period, the number of
   litters more than doubled in the subpopulations with released foxes
   contributing 29.5\% to this increase, but no clear effect of immigration
   on litter size was found. There was a slight increase in genetic
   variation in one of the subpopulations, and a significant decline in
   genetic divergence between subpopulations. We conclude that despite
   extensive releases, demographic and genetic effects were highly
   context-dependent. This study highlights the challenges of reinforcement
   programmes in small populations and reintroductions to unoccupied sites,

Title = {Estimating arboreality and the effects of forest structure on tropical
   tree-dwelling mesomammals using arboreal camera traps},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {140-153},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tropical forests are the most species-rich biomes in the world but
   suffer high rates of logging and conversion. Tropical tree-dwelling
   (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals reliant on old-growth forest
   structures are especially vulnerable. The degree of behavioral
   arboreality of semi-arboreal mammals can be related to forest structure
   and perceived terrestrial threats. Paired arboreal and terrestrial
   camera traps are a promising new method for estimating the arboreality
   of cryptic and nocturnal species. Our study aimed to (1) model the
   effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on the
   detection and occurrence of arboreal and semi-arboreal mesomammals and
   (2) evaluate differences in occurrence and detection between paired
   arboreal and terrestrial camera trap sites for semi-arboreal mammals
   while estimating the degree of arboreality. We set 20 terrestrial and
   arboreal camera trap pairs in eastern Cat Tien National Park (Nam Cat
   Tien), Vietnam, from June 2019 to September 2020. We evaluated the
   effects of forest structure and proximity to roads on nine arboreal
   mesomammal species using single-season occupancy models. We used
   multi-scale occupancy modeling to estimate the degree of arboreality for
   four semi-arboreal mammals. All models were fit using hierarchical
   Bayesian modeling and compared using WAIC. We detected most arboreal and
   terrestrial mesomammal species currently known to inhabit Nam Cat Tien,
   including rare and cryptic species. Canopy connectivity and other mature
   forest characteristics were important for explaining the detection and
   occurrence of highly arboreal species, while the effect of a tree and
   focal limb characteristics on detection was species-specific. All
   semi-arboreal species had a greater probability of terrestrial station
   use than arboreal, suggesting a greater vulnerability to terrestrial
   threats, though the degree of arboreality varied by species. Using one
   sampling method underestimated occupancy for most semi-arboreal species.
   Multi-method sampling designs with multi-scale occupancy modeling can
   improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use for guiding
   management and conservation decisions.},

Title = {DNA barcodes reveal the hidden arthropod diversity in a threatened
   cactus forest of the central Andes},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {567-587},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Desert ecosystems are currently threatened by human activities resulting
   in the rapid decline of xerophytic plants and specialized fauna. In
   South America, the demise of cactus species already resulted in the
   population decline of > 30\% of the iconic giant columnar cactus
   Trichocereus terscheckii. The increasing vulnerability of these keystone
   species could trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions in highly
   dependent organisms. Thus, necrotic cacti constitute an important
   habitat for desert arthropods, yet little is known on the hidden
   diversity of this neglected niche. We used DNA barcode techniques to
   survey the diversity of arthropods in a threatened cactus forest
   dominated by T. terscheckii in northwestern Argentina. We obtained a
   total of 542 mitochondrial barcode sequences, resulting in 323 Molecular
   Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) associated to the xerophytic forest and 21 MOTUs
   exclusive to the giant cactus necrosis. Our results indicated that the
   area is a biodiversity hotspot within the harsh Andean desert and
   suggests that nearly 30 species could occur in the decaying cactus,
   representing the highest richness of cactophilic arthropods recorded in
   any cactus on the continent to date (6 orders and 16 families). The
   community structure of cactophilic arthropods showed a phylogenetic
   clustering pattern, suggesting the coexistence of closely related
   species. Overall, our study indicates that the giant cactus necrosis
   sustains a particular phylogenetic diversity of desert arthropods, while
   demonstrating the efficacy of DNA barcodes for biodiversity assessments
   in complex and poorly understood ecological systems.},

Title = {Restoring the orangutan in a Whole- or Half-Earth context},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Various global-scale proposals exist to reduce the loss of biological
   diversity. These include the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth visions that
   respectively seek to set aside half the planet for wildlife conservation
   or to diversify conservation practices fundamentally and change the
   economic systems that determine environmental harm. Here we assess these
   visions in the specific context of Bornean orangutans Pongo pygmaeus and
   their conservation. Using an expert-led process we explored three
   scenarios over a 10-year time frame: continuation of Current Conditions,
   a Half-Earth approach and a Whole-Earth approach. In addition, we
   examined a 100-year population recovery scenario assuming 0\% offtake of
   Bornean orangutans. Current Conditions were predicted to result in a
   population c. 73\% of its current size by 2032. Half-Earth was judged
   comparatively easy to achieve and predicted to result in an orangutan
   population of c. 87\% of its current size by 2032. Whole-Earth was
   anticipated to lead to greater forest loss and ape killing, resulting in
   a prediction of c. 44\% of the current orangutan population for 2032.
   Finally, under the recovery scenario, populations could be c. 148\% of
   their current size by 2122. Although we acknowledge uncertainties in all
   of these predictions, we conclude that the Half-Earth and Whole-Earth
   visions operate along different timelines, with the implementation of
   Whole-Earth requiring too much time to benefit orangutans. None of the
   theorized proposals provided a complete solution, so drawing elements
   from each will be required. We provide recommendations for equitable
   outcomes.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Citizen science is filling important monitoring gaps and thus
   contributing to the conservation of rare or threatened animals However,
   most researchers have used peer-reviewed publications to evaluate
   citizen science contributions. We quantified a larger spectrum of
   citizen science's contributions to the monitoring of rare or threatened
   animals, including contributions to the peer-reviewed publications, gray
   literature and to conservation measures (i.e., actions taken as a direct
   result of citizen science monitoring). We sought to provide broad
   information on how results of studies of citizen science monitoring is
   used. We also evaluated factors associated with success of citizen
   science projects. We conducted a web search to find citizen science
   projects focusing on rare and threatened species and surveyed citizen
   science project managers about their contributions and factors
   influencing their success. The number of projects increased rapidly
   after 2010. Almost one-half of the citizen science projects produced at
   least 1 peer-reviewed publication, 64\% produced at least 1 gray
   literature publication, and 64\% resulted in at least 1 conservation
   measure. Conservation measures covered a wide range of actions,
   including management and mitigation plans, modification of threat
   status, identification and establishment of protected areas, habitat
   restoration, control of invasive species, captive breeding programs, and
   awareness campaigns. Longevity, data quality, and collaboration type
   best explained quantities of all types of scientific contributions of
   citizen science. We found that citizen science contributed substantially
   to knowledge advancement and conservation, especially when programs were
   long term and had rigorous data collection and management standards, and
   multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary collaborations.},

Title = {Threat Perception of Stakeholders: Case study of Loktak Lake, a Ramsar

Abstract = {Identifying, assessing, and addressing threats are vital elements in the
   management plan formulation of a protected area. Loktak Lake, a Ramsar
   Wetland of international importance placed under the Montreux Record
   since 1993, exemplifies this need. The study focuses on 11 direct
   threats in Loktak Lake based on a standard classification nomenclature
   by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Three
   different parameters (scope, severity and magnitude) were assessed using
   a rating scale from four stakeholder groups (Government Departments,
   Experts, Community Based Organizations and Fisherman Community). Eight
   of these direct threats were prioritised based on high ratings in the
   assessment among which the absence of fishing bans, the inflow of
   municipal waste and the maintenance of the water level by Ithai Barrage
   showed significant differences in threat perception among stakeholders.
   The study also showed the resource conflicts underpinning some of the
   highly ranked threats such as encroachment in peripheral areas and
   absence of fishing bans. The heterogeneity in stakeholder groups and
   their select dependence on resource use explains the significant
   differences observed in the prioritisation of the threats. The study
   demonstrated the use of threat ranking as an efficient method for
   management plan formulation in a conservation site. It also highlighted
   the urgent need to address the gaps observed in the management plans
   with regard to present management interventions. It is envisaged that an
   analysis of threat perceptions among different stakeholders will help
   decision-making in lake management in light of its inclusion in the
   Montreux Record.},

Title = {Roads and water availability influence the occurrence of koalas

Abstract = {Given the high proportion of Earth's ecosystems already
   anthropogenically modified, especially through clearing, it is critical
   we determine whether species can persist outside of their primary
   habitat as a means of ensuring population persistence in the remaining
   landscape. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) has been heavily impacted
   by habitat loss through clearing, and recently upgraded to endangered
   across its eastern distribution. It is timely to understand what
   variables may influence the occurrence of koalas in secondary habitat,
   which can then guide conservation efforts. We surveyed 959 sites with
   detection dogs to determine the occurrence of koalas through the
   presence of scats. Using GLMMs, we accounted for environmental and
   anthropogenic variables that may influence koala occurrence, meanwhile
   focusing on the use of secondary eucalyptus forests at multiple spatial
   scales (250, 500, 1500 m radii). Overall koala occurrence was negatively
   associated with secondary eucalyptus forests compared to primary
   forests, while there was no effect of total forest area present at any
   scale. However, we found interactive effects between secondary forest
   and (1) distance from the closest major road at the smallest landscape
   scale (250 m radii) and (2) water area at the larger landscape scales
   (500 m, 1500 m radii). This suggests that occurrence of koalas in
   secondary forests are predicted to increase when the distance to major
   roads, and the water area, increase. While protecting primary eucalyptus
   forests should always be a prioritisation for the conservation of
   koalas, our results emphasize the important role that secondary
   eucalyptus forests can play in conservation, as long as these are
   carefully considered in the landscape context to maximise restoration
   investments.},

Title = {Widespread Gene Expression Divergence in Butterfly Sensory Tissues Plays
   a Fundamental Role During Reproductive Isolation and Speciation},

Abstract = {Neotropical Heliconius butterflies are well known for their intricate
   behaviors and multiple instances of incipient speciation. Chemosensing
   plays a fundamental role in the life history of these groups of
   butterflies and in the establishment of reproductive isolation. However,
   chemical communication involves synergistic sensory and accessory
   functions, and it remains challenging to investigate the molecular
   mechanisms underlying behavioral differences. Here, we examine the gene
   expression profiles and genomic divergence of three sensory tissues
   (antennae, legs, and mouthparts) between sexes (females and males) and
   life stages (different adult stages) in two hybridizing butterflies,
   Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno. By integrating comparative
   transcriptomic and population genomic approaches, we found evidence of
   widespread gene expression divergence, supporting a crucial role of
   sensory tissues in the establishment of species barriers. We also show
   that sensory diversification increases in a manner consistent with
   evolutionary divergence based on comparison with the more distantly
   related species Heliconius charithonia. The findings of our study
   strongly support the unique chemosensory function of antennae in all
   three species, the importance of the Z chromosome in interspecific
   divergence, and the nonnegligible role of nonchemosensory genes in the
   divergence of chemosensory tissues. Collectively, our results provide a
   genome-wide illustration of diversification in the chemosensory system
   under incomplete reproductive isolation, revealing strong molecular
   separation in the early stage of speciation. Here, we provide a unique
   perspective and relevant view of the genetic architecture (sensory and
   accessory functions) of chemosensing beyond the classic chemosensory
   gene families, leading to a better understanding of the magnitude and
   complexity of molecular changes in sensory tissues that contribute to
   the establishment of reproductive isolation and speciation.},

Title = {A CLAVATA3-like Gene Acts as a Gynoecium Suppression Function in White
   Campion},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {How do separate sexes originate and evolve? Plants provide many
   opportunities to address this question as they have diverse mating
   systems and separate sexes (dioecy) that evolved many times
   independently. The classic ``two-factor{''} model for evolution of
   separate sexes proposes that males and females can evolve from
   hermaphrodites via the spread of male and female sterility mutations
   that turn hermaphrodites into females and males, respectively. This
   widely accepted model was inspired by early genetic work in dioecious
   white campion (Silene latifolia) that revealed the presence of two
   sex-determining factors on the Y-chromosome, though the actual genes
   remained unknown. Here, we report identification and functional analysis
   of the putative sex-determining gene in S. latifolia, corresponding to
   the gynoecium suppression factor (GSF). We demonstrate that GSF likely
   corresponds to a Y-linked CLV3-like gene that is specifically expressed
   in early male flower buds and encodes the protein that suppresses
   gynoecium development in S. latifolia. Interestingly, GSFY has a
   dysfunctional X-linked homolog (GSFX) and their synonymous divergence
   (dS = 17.9\%) is consistent with the age of sex chromosomes in this
   species. We propose that female development in S. latifolia is
   controlled via the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA feedback loop, with the X-linked
   WUSCHEL-like and Y-linked CLV3-like genes, respectively. Evolution of
   dioecy in the S. latifolia ancestor likely involved inclusion of
   ancestral GSFY into the nonrecombining region on the nascent
   Y-chromosome and GSFX loss of function, which resulted in disbalance of
   the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA feedback loop between the sexes and ensured
   gynoecium suppression in males.},

Title = {Effects of interactions between anthropogenic stressors and recurring

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Insights into declines in ecosystem resilience and their causes and
   effects can inform preemptive action to avoid ecosystem collapse and
   loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being.
   Empirical studies of ecosystem collapse are rare and hampered by
   ecosystem complexity, nonlinear and lagged responses, and interactions
   across scales. We investigated how an anthropogenic stressor could
   diminish ecosystem resilience to a recurring perturbation by altering a
   critical ecosystem driver. We studied groundwater-dependent,
   peat-accumulating, fire-prone wetlands known as upland swamps in
   southeastern Australia. We hypothesized that underground mining
   (stressor) reduces resilience of these wetlands to landscape fires
   (perturbation) by diminishing groundwater, a key ecosystem driver. We
   monitored soil moisture as an indicator of ecosystem resilience during
   and after underground mining. After landscape fire, we compared
   responses of multiple state variables representing ecosystem structure,
   composition, and function in swamps within the mining footprint with
   unmined reference swamps. Soil moisture declined without recovery in
   swamps with mine subsidence (i.e., undermined), but was maintained in
   reference swamps over 8 years (effect size 1.8). Relative to burned
   reference swamps, burned undermined swamps showed greater loss of peat
   via substrate combustion; reduced cover, height, and biomass of
   regenerating vegetation; reduced postfire plant species richness and
   abundance; altered plant species composition; increased mortality rates
   of woody plants; reduced postfire seedling recruitment; and extirpation
   of a hydrophilic animal. Undermined swamps therefore showed strong
   symptoms of postfire ecosystem collapse, whereas reference swamps
   regenerated vigorously. We found that an anthropogenic stressor
   diminished the resilience of an ecosystem to recurring perturbations,
   predisposing it to collapse. Avoidance of ecosystem collapse hinges on
   early diagnosis of mechanisms and preventative risk reduction. It may be
   possible to delay or ameliorate symptoms of collapse or to restore
   resilience, but the latter appears unlikely in our study system due to
   fundamental alteration of a critical ecosystem driver. Efectos de las

Title = {Ecological relevance of non-perennial rivers for the conservation of
   terrestrial and aquatic communities},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {River conservation efforts traditionally focus on perennial watercourses
   (i.e., those that do not dry) and their associated aquatic biodiversity.
   However, most of the global river network is not perennial and thus
   supports both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. We assessed the
   conservation value of nonperennial rivers and streams (NPRS) in one of
   Europe's driest regions based on aquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms)
   and terrestrial (riparian plants, birds, and carabid beetles) community
   data. We mapped the distribution of taxa at 90 locations and across wide
   environmental gradients. Using the systematic planning tool Marxan, we
   identified priority conservation sites under 2 scenarios: aquatic taxa
   alone or aquatic and terrestrial taxa together. We explored how
   environmental factors (runoff, flow intermittence, elevation, salinity,
   anthropogenic impact) influenced Marxan's site selection frequency. The
   NPRS were selected more frequently (over 13\% on average) than perennial
   rivers when both aquatic and terrestrial taxa were considered,
   suggesting that NPRS have a high conservation value at the catchment
   scale. We detected an underrepresentation of terrestrial taxa
   (8.4-10.6\% terrestrial vs. 0.5-1.1\% aquatic taxa were unrepresented in
   most Marxan solutions) when priority sites were identified based
   exclusively on aquatic biodiversity, which points to a low surrogacy
   value of aquatic taxa for terrestrial taxa. Runoff explained site
   selection when focusing on aquatic taxa (all best-fitting models
   included runoff, r(2) = 0.26-0.27), whereas elevation, salinity, and
   flow intermittence were more important when considering both groups. In
   both cases, site selection frequency declined as anthropogenic impact
   increased. Our results highlight the need to integrate terrestrial and
   aquatic communities when identifying priority areas for conservation in
   catchments with NPRS. This is key to overcoming drawbacks of traditional
   assessments based only on aquatic taxa and to ensure the conservation of
   NPRS, especially as NPRS become more prevalent worldwide due to climate
   change and increasing water demands.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Personality in wildlife has been linked to several ecological processes
   including mortality risk, facultative migration, and behavioral
   plasticity. In this paper I examined the relationship between
   personality and antipredator tactics exhibited by 20 wild female elk
   (Cervus canadensis) in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Two observers
   conducted 106 separate chases designed explicitly to resemble predator
   pursuits by wolves, the main predator of elk. We quantified and
   classified elk tactical responses during each chase. Elk with ``shy{''}
   type personalities responded to 84\% of predator-resembling pursuits by
   employing speed-based tactics to outrun pursuers or rejoin conspecifics.
   Elk with ``bold{''} type personalities adopted this tactic just 11\% of
   the time, and instead employed tactics where they stopped and evaluated
   pursuers in 45\% of chases, attempted to hide from pursuers in 19\% of
   chases, and turned aggressively toward pursuers in 17\% of chases. Bold
   animals employed a greater variety of tactics overall and were more
   likely to try multiple tactics within the same 10-min chase. Shyness was
   also positively correlated with flight initiation distance at the start
   of chases. These results are important for wildlife managers who may be
   artificially and unwittingly selecting against certain personalities and
   thereby influencing management and conservation outcomes.},

Abstract = {Aim Viviparity has evolved more times in squamates than in any other
   vertebrate group; therefore, squamates offer an excellent model system
   in which to study the patterns, drivers and implications of reproductive
   mode evolution. Based on current species distributions, we examined
   three selective forces hypothesized to drive the evolution of squamate
   viviparity (cold climate, variable climate and hypoxic conditions) and
   tested whether viviparity is associated with larger body size. Location
   Global. Time period Present day. Taxon Squamata. Methods We compiled a
   dataset of 9061 squamate species, including their distributions,
   elevation, climate, body mass and reproductive modes. We applied
   species-level and assemblage-level approaches for predicting
   reproductive mode, both globally and within biogeographical realms. We
   tested the relationships of temperature, interannual and intra-annual
   climatic variation, elevation (as a proxy for hypoxic conditions) and
   body mass with reproductive mode, using path analyses to account for
   correlations among the environmental predictors. Results Viviparity was
   strongly associated with cold climates at both species and assemblage
   levels, despite the prevalence of viviparity in some warm climates.
   Viviparity was not clearly correlated with climatic variability or
   elevation. The probability of being viviparous exhibited a weak positive
   correlation with body size. Conclusions Although phylogenetic history is
   important, potentially explaining the occurrence of viviparous species
   in regions that are warm at present, current global squamate
   distribution is characterized by a higher relative abundance of
   viviparity in cold environments, supporting the prediction of the
   ``cold-climate{''} hypothesis. The roles of climatic variation and
   hypoxia are less important and not straightforward. Elevation probably
   exerts various selective pressures and influences the prevalence of
   viviparity primarily through its effect on temperature rather than on
   oxygen concentration.},

Abstract = {Understanding the impact and dynamics of invasive alien species (IAS) is
   essential for tailoring appropriate management plans. This information
   can be difficult to obtain in the short term, and intrinsic difficulties
   of monitoring hard-to-reach areas may hamper prompt estimation of IAS
   distributions. Using the case of the invasive Asian common toad
   (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) in Madagascar, we show how public surveys
   coupled with a multi-analytical approach can promptly provide accurate
   information on invasion dynamics and impacts. On the basis of
   key-informant responses, we built polynomial regressions to investigate
   the spatiotemporal invasion patterns, false-positive occupancy models to
   estimate species occupancy, and mixed-effect models to evaluate the
   public perception and attitudes. The invasion followed a linear
   expansion of approx. 2 km year(-1), with human-mediated dispersal
   facilitating the spread of the species. Toad occupancy decreased towards
   the invasion front and increased in the southern portion of its range.
   Negative perception decreased in urban areas, where people were less
   concerned by toad impacts on ecosystems, and in recently invaded
   localities, suggesting density- or time-dependent effects. We also
   identified 12 potential impacts, with ``loss of domestic apiaries{''},
   ``poisoning of poultry{''} and ``decline of snakes{''} standing out for
   prevalence and potential severity. Our results bring important insights
   into the invasion dynamics and the human-toad interactions in
   Madagascar, highlighting the versatility of public surveys to obtain
   essential information for invasion science and management, which can be
   especially useful in hard-to-monitor regions of the world with a low
   in-country capacity to counter invasive species.},

Title = {Landcover change and habitat quality mediate impacts of temperature and

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Climate and landcover change can have synergistic impacts on wildlife
   populations, but the pervasiveness of these threats and factors that
   buffer them remain unclear despite important implications for
   conservation. I evaluated the additive and interactive effects of
   spatiotemporal variation in temperature, precipitation, and landcover
   change on annual territory occupancy, colonization, and extinction of a
   threatened top-predator, the ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium
   brasilianum), across a vast binational region of the Sonoran Desert over
   16years. I also assessed how local habitat quality and regional
   population size mediate impacts of these stressors. Despite significant
   bivariate associations between occupancy and temperature, precipitation,
   and landcover change, evidence for interactions was much greater than
   for additive effects. Occupancy of territories imbedded in increasingly
   disturbed landscapes declined at greater rates with warming winter
   temperatures, but the temperature had little effect in intact landscapes
   suggesting they buffer impacts of climate warming. Occupancy increased
   markedly with precipitation due likely to major positive impacts on
   prey, but again, interactive effects were stronger given territories of
   higher quality amplified benefits of precipitation. Impacts of landcover
   change and habitat quality on extinction depended markedly on regional
   population sizes. When populations were small and few potential
   colonists were present, high-quality habitat and low landcover change
   failed to reduce extinction. When populations were large, however,
   high-quality habitat and more intact landscapes, which best foster
   dispersal, reduced extinction. Hence, complex interacting processes
   linked to the effects of precipitation and habitat quality on carrying
   capacity, landcover change on habitat connectivity and vulnerability to
   rising temperatures, and local population sizes simultaneously drove
   dynamics. Efforts to identify and protect high-quality habitat and limit
   landcover change can enhance conservation but will be most efficient in
   intact landscapes. Efforts to enhance local habitat quality and
   quantity, and directly augment populations should consider broader
   landscape contexts linked to habitat connectivity and potential source
   populations.},

Abstract = {The taxonomy of sculpins (Cottus, Cottidae) remains one of the last
   major unresolved puzzles in the systematics of North American freshwater
   fishes. We used molecular approaches to identify candidate taxa and
   their distribution across western North America. We crowd-sourced the
   collection of specimens (n = 8272) via outreach to biologists in the
   western United States and Canada. From that collection, we sequenced-at
   up to 2 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear genes-a subset (n = 4009) of
   specimens from most basins in the western United States, added sequences
   from public sequence databases, and applied an array of species
   delimitation and specimen identification methods to assess phylogenetic
   and spatial patterns of diversity. Species delimitation methods,
   primarily relying on a conservative interpretation of the phylogenetic
   species concept, were broadly concordant and indicated that 43 candidate
   species were present. Some named taxa were unsupported, whereas others,
   if recognized, would violate the phylogenetic species concept. Specimen
   assignment was largely unambiguous and geographic distributions were
   consistent with phylo-geographic patterns in other taxa. Our work
   establishes a benchmark for understanding the diversity of sculpin in
   western North America and suggests new species hypotheses both there and
   in eastern North America.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the floral diversity of the Lagos coastal
   environments by sampling 21 points using the quadrat method. The study
   revealed two major aquatic ecosystem types (mangrove and freshwater
   swamp) and recorded 125 species belonging to 108 genera and 49 families.
   While Alchornea cordifolia and Raphia hookeri were found as the most
   frequent, Acalypha crenata and Acrostichum aureum were the least
   abundant species. The highest and lowest species-rich locations were
   Unilag (n = 125 species) and Abule Osun (n = 2 species), respectively.
   The vegetation structure of the LCE is dominated by herbaceous species.
   Our findings provide insights on the flora diversity of the LCE, and a
   guideline for the effective conservation of near-threatened species such
   as Nauclea diderrichii and Mitragyna stipulosa in this coastal ecosystem
   is presented.},

Title = {New distributional data for the northern forestfly, Lednia borealis

Abstract = {The northern forestfly, Lednia borealis Baumann and Kondratieff, 2010
   (Plecoptera: Nemouridae), is a rare montane stonefly that until recently
   was thought to be endemic to Washington State. It is one of 4 described
   Lednia species in the western United States and Canada and the only
   member of its genus known to occur in Washington. All 4 Lednia species
   are associated with cold-water habitat in alpine and subalpine habitats;
   because of this, they may be especially vulnerable to threats associated
   with climate change. However, L. borealis is rarely targeted in species
   inventories or survey efforts, and more information is needed about its
   distribution and habitat associations in order to assess its
   conservation status. To address these data gaps, we conducted targeted
   surveys at 94 sites in montane areas of Washington State from 2015 to
   2019. We collected L. borealis at only 8 of these (8.5\%), bringing the
   total number of known sites to 19. In this paper, we update the known
   distribution for the species, report recent COI barcoding results,
   highlight a confirmed habitat association with glacial edge meltwater,
   and provide recommendations for future surveys.},

Abstract = {Many North American populations of lekking grouse have declined across
   their ranges, and understanding and evaluating population trajectories
   can assist in better managing these iconic species. Columbian
   Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) is a
   subspecies of Sharp-tailed Grouse that has declined across its range in
   the Intermountain West over the past century. Management of this species
   primarily focuses on habitat around leks; therefore, knowing where
   Columbian Sharp-tailed Grouse leks occur is key to their conservation.
   We used a resource selection framework to predict lek occurrence in an
   area with multiple known leks in Carbon County, Wyoming. We used this
   model to predict lek occurrence in an area with only one known lek in
   Grand Teton National Park. Our model predicting lek locations in Carbon
   County was a strong predictor of lek occurrence in that area (r(s) =
   0.97), and when this model was projected onto Grand Teton National Park,
   the one known lek in the park was located in an area of very high
   probability for lek occurrence (>90\% probability of lek occurrence). We
   also used this predictive surface to locate 1 unknown lek and 7 other
   locations in Grand Teton National Park used by Columbian Sharp-tailed
   Grouse as detected by fecal droppings, feathers, or birds flushed. Our
   methods demonstrated that a resource selection framework from one area
   can be used to predict lek and other occurrences in another area when
   these areas have similar vegetation compositions.},

Abstract = {The burrow systems (warrens) of whistling rat Parotomys brantsii are
   confined to patches of deep soil (biogenic mounds known as heuweltjies)
   on stony plains in the arid Succulent Karoo region of South Africa.
   Whistling rat warrens were recorded on heuweltjies at the Tierberg
   Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the southern Karoo, Western
   Cape Province, South Africa, on eight occasions between 1988 and 2001.
   Increasing temperatures over the study period combined with a severe
   drought from 2015 to 2021 caused a 36\% dieback in perennial shrub cover
   on the research site. The percentage of heuweltjies occupied by
   whistling rats declined from 44\% occupation to 20\% occupation between
   2005 and 2021 during unusually hot, dry conditions indicated by low
   values in the Standardised Evapotranspiration Index. Around their
   warrens, whistling rats had no influence on species richness of
   perennial plants but reduced vegetation cover.},

Title = {Baseline biodiversity assessment of South Texas small mammals and

Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Baseline biodiversity surveys are necessary to assess organismal
   diversity across spatial and temporal scales. These surveys can be
   particularly useful for monitoring changes in organismal diversity and
   pathogen spread in response to climate change. Arthropod vectors such as
   ticks are susceptible to geographic range shifts with a warming climate,
   potentially resulting in the expansion of risk areas for vector-borne
   disease. Biodiversity data are deficient from South Texas, which is
   particularly concerning given the abundance of wildlife and livestock
   that may be important in perpetuating tick and pathogen populations. We
   performed a baseline biodiversity assessment of small mammals, ticks,
   and tick-borne pathogens in South Texas using a combination of
   fieldwork, collections-based research, and molecular approaches. We
   recorded 19 species of small mammals and 3 species of ticks, and we
   detected no tick-borne pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia or
   Rickettsia in the ticks or mammals. Given the continued emergence of
   tick-borne disease, we recommend collaborations with natural history
   collections and private landowners interested in land stewardship so
   researchers can develop a better understanding of changing small mammal,
   tick, and pathogen diversity with implications for human and veterinary
