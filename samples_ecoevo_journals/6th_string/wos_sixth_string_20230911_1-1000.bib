Abstract = {Environmental issues have been addressed on the basis of three different
   approaches. (i) The earliest is the `Human-centered' approach; it was
   characterized by the dichotomy between `useful' species (for Man) and
   pests (competitors of humans). (ii) The species-centered approach was
   characteristic of the 20th century and remains the most common approach
   adopted in many countries and by several international agencies. It is
   based upon the notion of outstanding species, which are designated as
   deserving appropriate management, in contrast to `ordinary' species.
   (iii) Finally, the 21st century ecosystem-based approach is the one that
   can best meet the challenges driven by global change and ensure the
   proper management of natural habitats. In contrast with indices based
   upon a species, or a group of species belonging to a given taxon, that
   may not detect a strong impact on the ecosystem, and even erroneously
   suggest a `good ecological status', indices based on the functioning of
   the entire ecosystem, from primary producers to top predators, such as
   Ecosystem-Based Quality Indices (EBQIs), provide a realistic assessment
   of the ecological status. EBQIs have already been established for
   northwestern Mediterranean marine ecosystems: the Posidonia oceanica
   seagrass meadow, underwater marine caves and infralittoral reef
   macroalgal forests. They are currently being developed for coralligenous
   habitats, saltmarshes and circalittoral coastal detritic bottoms. The
   ecosystem-based approach can be applied to all types of ecosystem and it
   is important now to extend this approach to other ecosystems and
   regions. Ecosystem-based management and EBQIs are not incompatible with
   specific management measures based upon certain iconic species, which
   are also part of an ecosystem. The interest of ecosystem-based
   management is that it is not limited to the accumulation of specific
   management measures for iconic species, which can be mutually
   incompatible.},

Abstract = {We report on a case of natural Posidonia oceanica recovery after partial
   meadow destruction due to the laying of a submarine gas pipeline covered
   with rubble. Ten years later, the new patches were mapped combining the
   use of an underwater photogrammetry technique and GIS; at the same time,
   the ecosystem function of the new settled plants was assessed by
   analyzing major elements of the Posidonia motile invertebrate fauna
   (amphipods, isopods and mollusks). Recruitment of detached plants from
   nearby meadows was only successful on rubble compared with on adjacent
   sandy zones. In a subarea of 736.83 m(2), 184 new Posidonia spots were
   established. A high complexity of patch structure (i.e., shoot/unit
   area) and community richness (i.e., number of species, abundance and
   diversity) was detected in comparison with other historic shallow stands
   with the same geographical exposure. The richness in the epifaunal
   population and the assemblage composition of the three main epifaunal
   taxocenes also point to a good recolonization capacity. These results
   call for additional investigations to assess the functioning of the P.
   oceanica ecosystem through the associated epifauna; however, the success
   of reforestation on rubble along a channel with intensive shipping
   activity can suggest a solution to manage human requirements and
   landscape integrity at low cost and with natural donors.},

   DAMAGE},
Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {70},

Pages = {113-119},
Abstract = {The Law of August 8, 2016 for ``the Recovery of biodiversity, nature and
   landscapes{''} introduced the principle of compensation for ecological
   damage into French civil liability law. The definition of ecological
   damage given by the Law refers to the work of the Millennium Ecosystem
   Assessment by distinguishing the ecosystem elements and their functions
   and services. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether the
   different ways of repairing ecological damage are in line with an
   ecosystem-based approach. For a very long time, legal doctrine has
   argued that reparation for ecological damage should be made ``in
   kind{''}. But restoration to return to the statu quo ante is not always
   possible and can sometimes prove dangerous for the ecosystems concerned.
   It appears that the most appropriate in-kind repair often consists
   simply in recreating the conditions that will allow new processes and
   new functions to be expressed. Where reparation in kind is impossible,
   to what extent are the various methods of assessment currently used by
   the courts compatible with an ecosystem-based approach? Finally, what
   are the recommendations that the scientific community can make to the
   judicial authorities to avoid mistakes being made on this point?},

Abstract = {Posidonia oceanica is a seagrass, which can build original reef
   structures. A unique emerging P. oceanica reef was encountered in the Le
   Brusc Bay on the French Mediterranean coast. Extending over 1,600 m in
   width, the reef appears to be one of the last remaining large P.
   oceanica reefs. This reef has two distinct profiles: a barrier reef on
   the eastern front and a fringing reef on the western front. Located on
   the outer section of the bay, the barrier reef limits water turnover in
   the bay, thus forming a lagoon. The presence of three small passes in
   the inner section of the bay has shaped an original current dynamic. The
   unique morphology of the Le Brusc lagoon makes it a site of high
   naturalistic value. To assess the health status of the Le Brusc reef,
   the present study precisely maps it for the first time using unmanned
   aerial vehicle imagery coupled with field observations. We also studied
   its evolution since 1950 using historic aerial photographs. Results
   indicate a regression of the reef, mainly due to the artificialization
   of the coastal area and the development of harbor facilities, causing
   the loss of 29.3 \% of the reef's surface including the disappearance of
   more than two-thirds of the barrier reef's profile. In addition, 8,180 m
   of boat stranding marks were observed in the barrier reef.},

Abstract = {Macroinvertebrate assemblages in Kebi-Rhumel, one of the largest
   watersheds in Algeria, are insufficiently documented. During spring,
   summer and autumn 2018, macro-benthos and water samples were collected
   and treated out at 16 stations located in the main confluence area along
   the Kebir-Rhumel wadi. One of the main objectives of the present work
   was to investigate diversity and distribution of benthic
   macroinvertebrates species according to environmental characteristics in
   this catchment area. The pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonia,
   nitrite and phosphate were significantly different (P value < 0.05)
   between the sampling sites. The conductivity and nutrient concentrations
   were higher in the upstream part of the Kebir-Rhumel catchment, while
   dissolved oxygen decreased, indicating that Rhumel wadi is more
   polluted. A total of 16,069 individuals and 129 taxa, belonging to 77
   families in 15 orders, were identified. Mean values of taxon richness,
   Shannon-Wiener (1949), Pielou's (1966) evenness, Margalef (1958) and
   Simpson (1949) indices indicate that Kebir wadi and their tributaries
   supported a more macro-benthos diversity than Rhumel wadi. The species
   composition and the EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera)
   showed the occurrence of pollution-sensitive macro-benthos groups in
   Kebir wadi, while the Rhumel wadi was mainly characterized by
   pollution-tolerant taxa, indicating anthropogenic disturbance and
   habitat degradation, which is evident by the diagnosis of the
   physicochemical water quality at Kebir-Rhumel wadi. Canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that altitude, conductivity,
   dissolved oxygen and nitrate were found to be the primary factors
   affecting the communities structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in the
   study area.},

Abstract = {Within the frame of a natural environment impacted by anthropogenic
   activities, assessing and quantifying their related pressures are
   essential to its management and are linked to its status. However, there
   are no, or very few, geographical areas where thorough knowledge of
   human uses and sources of impact is available as a basis to quantify
   these pressures. For this reason, we propose to grade impact sources
   based on risk assessment index using semi-quantitative rating grids. The
   impact source is defined as the environmental factor responsible for the
   impact (e.g., sewage, fishing activity or coastal development). The
   environmental Risk Assessment of Marine Ecosystems (RAME) is based on
   several combined rating criteria in order to obtain a criticality score.
   These semi-quantitative criteria are: (S) the sensitivity of the
   environment, the ecosystem or the species; (I) the importance of the
   impact source; (D) the distance from the impact source, and (O) the
   frequency of occurrence of the pressure. Thereafter, the index is
   weighted by a criterion of control that is related to the environmental
   management (M). This method can be adapted to all types of pressure and
   is not specific to any situation.},

   introduction and proliferation of Mnemiopsis leidyi since 2005 could
   limit their effectiveness. The originality of this study is to associate
   oceanography and sociology to estimate the impact of M. leidyi on the
   functioning of this socio-ecosystem. This article presents an overview
   of a broad range of results obtained using interdisciplinary approach.
   It appeared that M. leidyi has an impact on plankton community
   functioning and on human activities, particularly on fishing. Therefore,
   in the context of biological invasions, the prospects for the
   rehabilitation of Berre Lagoon remain subject to the unpredictability of

   can develop a biogenic structure called matte, a typical terraced
   formation built up by itself, consisting of intertwined rhizomes, roots
   and sediment, which may allow shoots to reach the sea surface forming
   reefs ( recif barriere), considered natural monuments. Posidonia
   oceanica reefs are particularly exposed to the ongoing increase in
   temperature and in storm frequency and intensity due to climate change,
   with negative repercussions on their conservation. Much more attention
   must be paid to the implementation of monitoring tools able to detect
   early signs of reef regression. In this study, the distribution of P.
   oceanica reefs located along southern coasts of Sicily (Italy,
   Mediterranean Sea) was investigated. A remote sensing approach was used
   to assess reef extension, morphological features (e.g., atolls), upper
   limit and occurrence of dead matte. In particular, very high-resolution
   drone images (similar to 2 cm pixel size), combined with GPS field data,
   were used for 2D- and 3D-reconstruction of P. oceanica reefs. The
   3D-model allowed to estimate bathymetrical distribution of P. oceanica
   reef enabling to achieve a more detailed and complete understanding of
   the P. oceanica reef architecture.},

Abstract = {Habitat connectivity is central to several key evolutionary and
   ecological processes, having implications for the spatial structuring of
   marine populations. For benthic species that have no or little mobility
   as adults, connectivity is evaluated by analyzing the dispersal of
   propagules across the seascape. We investigate fine-scale connectivity
   of coralligenous habitats in Marseille Bay (located in the north-western
   Mediterranean Sea) using high-resolution cartography and a
   particle-tracking model ran over a range of parameters derived from the
   biological traits of potential target species. We present annual and
   seasonal means of various connectivity diagnostics measuring the
   retention and exchange of propagules among coralligenous patches. A
   synthetic view is obtained by clustering individual patches into
   ``coralligenous provinces{''} (ensemble of patches tightly connected by
   ocean currents). When discussing our results against historical
   observations, we highlight some genetic breaks, sharp community changes
   and ecological clusters that fit well our simulated connectivity
   patterns. Consistent findings include reduced biodiversity along Cote
   Bleue, high biodiversity at Planier Island and the presence of various
   dispersal barriers, which evolve with dispersal durations and provide
   the backbone of habitat connectivity. Our results help to apprehend and
   test hypothesis on marine population structures, providing useful
   information for ecologists and conservationists.},

Title = {A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IN THE TRADITIONAL OASIS

Abstract = {Estimating the evapotranspiration is important for many sides. The first
   is to determine the amount of water really needed by vegetable canopies.
   The second is to analyse the role of plants in buffering the effects of
   climatic change. In this work we have tried to evalu-ate the amount of
   evapotranspiration inside and above the traditional oasis of Tozeur by
   moni-toring profiles of global radiation, net radiation, sap flow,
   sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, air temperature and air humidity.
   We have used fixed captors installed at different heights inside the
   oasis and mobile captors carried by a meteorological balloon. Results
   show that evapotranspira-tion deduced from the total global radiation
   intercepted inside the oasis is equivalent to 4,4 mm/ day. That
   estimated from global radiation received above the oasis is equivalent
   to 6,81 mm/day. When using the total net radiation intercepted by all
   the oasis (respectively the net radiation received above the oasis), the
   evapotranspiration is equivalent to 3,24 mm/day (respectively about 4
   mm/day). The evapotranspiration estimated from daily sap flow transpired
   is about 3,3 mm/day. We have noticed also, that inside the oasis air
   temperature follows a decreasing func-tion with the altitude in the
   early morning and later in the afternoon. It follows an increasing
   function between 9 and 15 hours. Above the oasis, air temperature,
   relative humidity and air pressure, follow globally decreasing functions
   with altitudes. However, considerable levels of fluctuation were
   recorded for all the parameters throughout the first altitudes above the
   oasis.},

Abstract = {The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams \& Reeve, 1850) is one of
   the most commercially exploited bivalve in the world (Dang et al. 2010).
   Since 2013, it has expanded into Berre lagoon. In 2017, the density was
   between 41 and 1,264 clams.m(-2), higher than that of other French sites
   (Mahe 2017, Sanchez et al. 2014). In February 2018, the professional
   clam fishery opened in the Berre lagoon. Starting in July 2018, an
   ecological crisis occurred and the clam stock was decimated (Mayot et
   al. 2020). Consequently, the fishery was closed. Following this event,
   the impact assessment was initiated with a clam stock study in spring
   2019. During this campaign, 238 stations were sampled where the number
   and the size of R. philippinarum were assessed. To explain the clam
   distribution into Berre lagoon in relation to environmental conditions,
   hydrological condition and grain size were analyzed. These parameters
   are well known to control clam expansion (Le Treut 1986) and are
   believed to lead the clam distribution. Preliminary results show a total
   abundance of 552.07 million clams. No clear correlation was found
   between the hydrological condition, sedimentary data and the clams'
   distribution at a large scale into Berre lagoon.},

Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {77-82},
Abstract = {Berre lagoon is a Mediterranean lagoon deeply impacted by industry and
   urban activities. Since 1966, a hydroelectric powerplant has discharged
   large quantities of freshwater and nutrients into the lagoon, inducing
   major ecosystemic changes. The lagoon ecosystem has declined to a
   eutrophic state with the loss of Zostera meadows and marine macrofauna.
   In 1994, an extensive monitoring network for Berre lagoon was set up.
   Different compartments of the ecosystem were measured: water quality,
   sediment quality, macrophytes (including Magnoliophyta), benthic
   macrofauna, fisheries, and ichthyofauna. Results show a pattern of
   change in the ecosystem linked to the different phases of eutrophication
   reduction. However, in 2018, a major ecological crisis occurred,
   inducing anoxia over more than 90 \% of the lagoon surface area.
   Analysis of data from the monitoring network during and after this
   crisis, taking into account environmental and climatic factors, provides
   a basis for understanding the degradation of the different compartments
   of the ecosystem. The origin of this crisis is a `cocktail effect' of
   high spring nutrient inputs, high water temperature, strong water
   stratification, lack of wind, lack of Zostera meadows and high benthic
   biomass. This crisis highlights the extreme fragility of the Berre
   lagoon ecosystem and shows the importance of an ecosystemic approach for
   the monitoring network.},

Abstract = {The census of common water-related species as indicators is strategic
   for its ecological implication on assessing the status of wetlands.
   Here, we carried out a study on the abundance of the most common
   wintering rallids (Eurasian Coot, Fulica atra and Common Moorhen,
   Gallinula chloropus) in a remnant Mediterranean wetland (central Italy),
   comparing two largely used sampling methods: point counts and total
   census method (comparable to a mapping method). We performed a
   Generalised Additive Model (GAM), which indicated that both sampling
   methods gave similar results, i.e., point counts allow us to obtain
   reliable data when compared to a more fine-grained and time-consuming
   total census method. The use of GAMs to monitor the abundance of
   wintering rallids considers the sampling dates and the auto -correlated
   nature of the sampling data. Therefore, we suggest rapid surveys of
   wintering rallids could be carried out by using point counts.},

   desiccation and the heat tolerance of an epedaphic springtail community
   of a grassland habitat (lawn). Survival at high temperatures with regard
   to these parameters has also been investigated. Out of the seven
   collected species (Ceratophysella cavicola, Entomobrya multifasciata,
   Lepidocyrtus cyaneus, Sminthurinus aureus, Sminthurinus elegans,
   Sminthurus viridis, and Sphaeridia pumilis) diapause was observed in S.
   elegans (up to 60 days), S. viridis (90 days), S. pumilis and C.
   cavicola (246 days). Only C. cavicola showed anhydrobiosis. Sphaeridia
   pumilis survives extreme heating up to 120 degrees C.},

Title = {OIL SPILL RESPONSE IN MANGROVES: WHY A SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEM-BASED

Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},

Pages = {69-76},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are formed by mangrove trees and shrubs that grow in
   the intertidal zone at the sea-continent interface. They constitute
   major ecosystems of tropical to subtropical muddy coasts that perform
   several ecological functions, including: mitigation of coastal erosion
   and flooding hazards associated with storm waves, extreme tides and
   tsunami, providing nurseries for some estuarine and coastal species
   (e.g., shrimps, fishes), production and recycling of organic matter,
   carbon storage, functioning as long-term sinks for several contaminants.
   World mangroves face a number of threats with increasing habitat
   destruction caused by direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures
   coupled with global climate change. They are known to be extremely
   vulnerable to oil spills. Even if the fate and impact of oil spills in
   such ecosystems have been partially monitored and experimentally studied
   (e.g., 30-year TROPICS field experiment in Panama islands, replicated
   field trials conducted in central Queensland, Australia) significant
   gaps in knowledge remain. The oil dynamic in such ecosystem is complex
   and depends on the abiotic-biotic processes interactions. Understanding
   the fate and impact of the oil spill thus requires an integrated
   approach of the functioning of the whole mangroves system facing the
   pollution. The case of the French Guiana mangroves, subjected to intense
   hydromorpho-sedimentary dynamics under the direct influence of the
   massive discharge of suspended sediments from the Amazon River, will
   serve as conceptual model to highlight the importance of the need for a
   specific Ecosystem-based Management response in case of oil spill.},

Abstract = {Twenty-two of the Mediterranean coastal Salinas in S. France have been
   abandoned for salt extraction since 1950 and most are now available for
   nature conservation purposes. Their management is a challenge as the
   abandoned Salinas are human-modified systems, compartmentalized in salt
   ponds, with other important modifications in the landscape. These
   landscape modifications were studied in more detail in two examples by
   studying historic maps. Thus, for the Salin de Peyriac (Aude), an
   original endorheic lake (Etang du Doul) was converted into a
   pre-concentrating pond and nowadays persists as a hypersaline coastal
   lagoon. Salin des Pesquiers (Var) was created since 1848 within the
   Etang du Pesquier coastal lagoon. Therefore, the course of the Roubaud
   River, the tributary to this lagoon, was deviated to flow directly to
   the sea. Together with the creation of a circumferential canal this
   resulted in destruction of the original Roubaud delta and its fringing
   wetlands with ecotones in their freshwater - salt water transition
   zones. Both abandoned Salinas can in principle be managed as coastal
   lagoons, because the sediment surfaces of their ponds are located below
   mean sea level. Nevertheless, the Ecosystem-based management of these
   systems has to acknowledge a large degree of artificiality. Complete
   ecological restoration to historic conditions appears unrealistic and is
   often not desirable. Hence, abandoned Salinas offer many possibilities
   for creative and experimental management that should be followed by
   action monitoring and assessed by scientific studies.Y},

Title = {FAVORING EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE LAGOONS: A NECESSARY SUPPORT
   FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE AS FISH NURSERY IN THE
   SALTMARSHES OF HYERES (PROVENCE, FRANCE)},
Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {243-252},
Abstract = {The salt exploitation of the saltmarshes of Hyeres (Salin des Pesquiers
   and Vieux Salins sites) has led to the isolation of the lagoon from the
   sea to control evaporation. The question of whether or not the
   saltmarshes' ecological functioning is impaired with regard to the fish
   population is one aspect that has been studied at the ecosystem scale.
   During 2018-2019, 4 samplings with 4 mm-mesh size fyke nets (24 h
   fishing duration) confirmed that the two saltmarshes still have a
   relictual nursery role. If juvenile fishes were numerically dominant in
   the catches, adults were also present. A few euryhaline and permanent
   small-sized taxa (Atherinidae, Gobiidae, Syngnathidae) contributed to 90
   \% of the total abundance in the catches. The amphihaline migrator
   Anguilla anguilla (mainly adult stages) was the main contributor to the
   biomass of catches. Juveniles of commercial species such as
   Dicentrarchus labrax, Sparus aurata, Mugilidae and Soleidae were caught
   in autumn and spring when going back and forth between the lagoon and
   the sea. Their tolerance of a wide range of salinity enables them to
   benefit temporarily from good environmental conditions for their growth.
   However, considering the low connectivity and the high salinity of most
   of the ponds, most of those marine fish juveniles are probably trapped
   inside the lagoon. In both lagoons, the closer the sampling sites were
   to the open sea, the higher were the species richness and density of the
   juveniles, suggesting that other parts of the lagoons function as an
   ecological sink. The diversity of the fish assemblages of the
   saltmarshes of Hyeres is directly dependent on the effectiveness of the
   connection with the open sea. Among the different actions emerging from
   this study, the introduction of a sluice gate between the northern pond
   (Salin des Pesquiers) and the input channel could significantly enhance
   exchanges and potentially provide support for fish resources at sea.},

   diversified and abundant but dominated by a few species of herbivores,
   mesocarnivores and planktivores. Fish species belonging to higher
   trophic levels were rare. The fish assemblages of this area differed
   from those observed in marine protected areas, where appropriate

Title = {COUPLING THE MAP OF MARINE HABITATS AND FISH ACCUMULATION ZONES: A

   RESOURCES},
Journal = {VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {175-182},
Abstract = {The spatialization of halieutic data is an essential element to define
   and create efficient protected and managed areas. Moreover, the
   distribution of fish schools is not homogeneous in the water column and
   is strongly linked with marine habitats. It is thus necessary to develop
   techniques allowing a spatial evaluation of halieutic resources.
   Multibeam echo sounders (MBES) provide acoustic data of the seafloor and
   the water column with a high accuracy and resolution. A single
   acquisition gives the bathymetry, a backscatter mosaic of the sea bottom
   and an acoustic imagery of the water column. The bathymetric data
   processing highlights the seafloor rugosity using several metric
   indices. A semi-automated classification including depth, rugosity
   indices and backscatter values provides maps of marine habitats, which
   are finally validated with ground truth. Data from the water column are
   analyzed using an algorithm that detects acoustic targets corresponding
   to fishes. A georeferenced scatter graph of fish schools is thus
   automatically created. The 3D model of the seafloor obtained from the
   bathymetry is textured with the map of marine habitats. Points
   corresponding to fish detection are then added on the 3D model to
   provide a complete map. Through this process managers can access to a
   clear visualization of fish accumulations and the key marine habitats
   within their areas of interest.},

Abstract = {For almost 60 years, the management policy of the Port-Cros National
   Park (PCNP) has steadily progressed, in phase with human impacts,
   changes in doctrines and goals in the field of nature conservation, what
   was socially acceptable at a given time, a very active Scientific
   Council and a gradual shift from species-centered to ecosystem-based
   management. Here, we illustrate problems faced by a national park,
   together with responses or practices that are suited, or not, to an
   ecosystem-based approach. PCNP's doctrine has been to explain that the
   abundance of species fluctuates naturally, and that we must not be too
   hasty to intervene, that nature sometimes does things better than
   humans, that a national park is neither a zoo nor a botanical garden,
   and the purpose is not to artificially increase the species diversity.
   The management approach of the PCNP can constitute a source of lessons
   for nature protection and management.},

Abstract = {Recreational and professional fishing are spread all over the world,
   generating revenues and opportunities but impacting on limited fish
   stocks. Even if stocks can recover, over-exploitation and permanent
   damages to ecosystems must be avoided. The aim of this work is to
   provide a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) to develop sustainable
   management strategies for fishing in marine protected areas (MPAs). The
   system, based on a generalized and iterable procedure and tested on the
   Portofino MPA (Italy), can be applied to any area. Starting from the
   assessment of the natural capital, the SDSS allows an ecosystem-based
   evaluation of fishing impact based on information (namely the harvest
   per species) gathered during the authorization procedure, mandatory for
   fishermen in MPA. The system assists MPA managers to understand if the
   MPA is able to support fishing or if there is an over-fishing status, by
   subtracting the fishing annual catches flow from the fish biomass
   production flow for each species. Being fishing spatially distributed,
   the SDSS generates results (e.g., values, maps) at different spatial
   level: MPA, protection zones and even smaller. The implementation of
   fishing management procedures through the SDSS allows the quick update
   of results and the simulation of alternative management scenarios.},

Abstract = {The management of saltmarshes, the complex ecosystem constituted by
   coastal wetlands and lagoons (SME - Saltmarsh Ecosystem), is often
   centered on the so-called `heritage species' (rare, threatened and
   charismatic species). This `species-centered' or `taxon-centered'
   approach, a legacy from the 20th century, is fully understandable in
   areas where definitely and critically endangered species occur. However,
   an ecosystem-based approach, of course including species and higher
   taxa, but based upon the whole functioning of the ecosystem, from
   primary producers to e.g., detritus feeders and top predators, would
   present advantages of paramount importance. The ecosystem-based approach
   (EBA) involves the management of the interactions between functional
   compartments, and the search for equilibrium according to the supposed
   baseline, ecosystem services and management goals. This approach offers
   a basis for considering the current global change. A conceptual model of
   the whole saltmarsh ecosystem, including lagoon bottom, water body and
   terrestrial adjacent habitats, has been established. Taking into account
   the high diversity of saltmarsh environments physically and biologically
   as well, this model is a frame that should be adapted to each case
   study. Here, the authors focus on two case studies in Provence (Vieux
   Salins and Salin des Pesquiers), northwestern Mediterranean. The
   weaknesses of the traditional species-centered approach and the
   advantages of an ecosystem-based approach are highlighted through novel
   applications.},

Abstract = {The aim of the European program Life Integrated Project Environment
   (IPE) MarHa (2018-2025) is to restore and sustain the favorable
   conservation status of marine natural habitats in French Natura 2000
   sites. In this context, Ecosystem Service Assessments (ESA) are carried
   out at various French sites including the Bay of Marseille (Provence,
   France). First, we applied the TRIAGE methodology: a strategic
   assessment of the issues with experts of the area (local MPA managers
   and scientists). TRIAGE raises two main concerns: (i) the
   intensification of recreational uses (by both residents and visitors),
   and (ii) the conservation of Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile, 1813
   seagrass meadows. In order to address both issues, we selected two
   adapted methodologies based on the strategic assessment: (i) a study
   oriented toward understanding the demand for ecosystem services (focused
   on recreational activities), and (ii) a study of the capacity of P.
   oceanica meadows to deliver ecosystem services using
   state-and-transition modeling. The objective of this work is to present
   the ESA process, from the strategic assessment to the analysis results.
   We focus on the study of the capacity of P. oceanica seagrass meadows to
   provide ecosystem services. State and transition models consist in
   defining alternative states of the habitat based on ecological
   indicators, identifying the bundle of services associated with each
   state and identifying transition vectors capable of explaining the
   shifts between each state. State-and-transition models can be very
   powerful frameworks for integrating multiple functions and services
   delivered by ecosystems while accounting for their temporal dynamics.},

Volume = {70},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {297-301},
Abstract = {Photogrammetry can be used to generate maps based on a large number of
   photographs and the tie points between them. Commonly used in
   terrestrial mapping with drones, georeferenced photogrammetry is
   currently seldom used in underwater studies. In order to obtain a
   centimetric positioning accuracy through direct georeferencing, we
   developed a floating platform encompassing two submerged cameras
   synchronized with a RTK GNSS at the surface. This device can be used
   from 1 m to 10 m depth in clear waters and the photographic views of the
   seafloor, with millimetric resolution, make it possible to map shallow
   habitats previously impossible to detect with classic methods such as
   acoustic sounding and aerial photographs. With this in mind, we used the
   platform to shoot 3 400 photos over a distance of about 500 m along the
   upper limit of the shallow Posidonia oceanica meadows of the Mugel, a
   creek in La Ciotat (France). The underwater photographs and the position
   data from the GNSS were synchronized to provide each picture with
   geographic coordinates. All the photos were then processed to build an
   orthomosaic of the meadow limit. Owing to its high resolution, the
   orthomosaic enabled the mapping of various features of the seascape such
   as the position of the limit with a centimetric accuracy, dead matte
   patches, litter detritus, artificial objects (moorings, wrecks) and
   marine organisms living on the seafloor.},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows have long been recognized for their high ecological and
   economic value (ecosystem services). More recently, a potential role in
   climate regulation, due to their ability to fix and sequester carbon,
   has been the focus of intensive study. In the Mediterranean Sea, the
   matte, a specific structure built by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, is
   of particular interest because it keeps buried for thousands of years
   massive amounts of carbon. Recent studies carried out along the Corsican
   coasts show a mean fixation of 1.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), with a
   sequestration rate of between 27 and 30 \%, a mean matte thickness of
   210 cm and 711 Mg C ha(-1) of organic carbon trapped in the matte. That
   is to say, a stock corresponding to 1,580 years of P. oceanica carbon
   sequestration, confirmed by radiocarbon analysis. An extrapolation to
   the Mediterranean basin (1.0 to 1.5 million hectares covered by P.
   oceanica meadow; mean matte thickness: 210 cm) shows that the total
   stock of organic carbon sequestered in the P. oceanica matte might be as
   much as 711 to 1,067 million Mg C. The conservation of the P. oceanica
   meadows thus constitutes an issue of major importance since any
   degradation of the matte, which has been built up over the past
   millennia, would very likely result in the release of considerable
   quantities of carbon. Rather than playing a major role in the
   attenuation of the impact of climate change (blue carbon sequestration),
   the P. oceanica meadow would then become a source of carbon that would
   be likely to amplify the greenhouse gas emissions. Management of P.
   oceanica meadows should take into account not only their role in carbon
   sequestration, but also the whole the full range of their ecosystem
   services, in relation with the functioning of the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Littorals represent highly dynamic and complex systems which undergo
   changes imposed by several environmental factors and human-induced
   disturbances. Among coastal ecosystems, seagrass meadows represent a key
   habitat and, according to the European Water Framework Directive, the
   endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica is considered as biological
   indicators thanks to their susceptibility to pressures and changes. In
   this work, four P. oceanica meadows in the Portofino Marine Protected
   Area (NW Mediterranean) are investigated to evaluate the potential
   effects of different disturbances (i.e., anchoring and a severe sea
   storm) on them through the study of their conservation status (measured
   with the Conservation Index, CI) and their natural capital (NC). Results
   obtained for CI and NC are not always consistent: meadows with high
   conservation status often showed low NC values. A link between the
   ability of ecosystems to store NC and develop a complex functioning and
   the meadows conservation is evident only when ecosystems are subjected
   to strong disturbances like the sea storm that hit the Ligurian coast on
   October 2018. The two indices should thus be integrated in monitoring
   activities because they account for different and complementary aspects
   of the meadow status.},

Abstract = {In this study, a Citizens' Observatory, the Osservatorio del Mare a
   Molfetta (OMM), has monitored the proliferation of the toxic microalgae
   Ostreopsis ovata along the coast of Molfetta, an Italian city on the
   Southern Adriatic Sea, where blooms have been reported since summer
   2009. To establish an alternative low cost and effective monitoring
   protocol, planktonic cells were counted for four years in seawater
   sampled at two stations along the urban coast. We show that: (i) O.
   ovata blooms occur along the coast of the city of Molfetta; (ii) the
   presence of O. ovata was detected from May up until January of the
   following year; (iii) blooms of O. ovata are concomitant with those of
   non-toxic diatoms of the genus Coscinodiscus, which were predominant in
   the phytoplankton community; (iv) during the time frame of this study,
   Ostreopsis and Coscinodiscus proliferation start at the station closest
   to the urban centre. The traditional O. ovata-monitoring protocols,
   based on single sampling station/city every 15 days between June and
   September, need improvement. The weekly sampling of seawater along the
   urban coast from June to January is an effective and low-cost method to
   predict toxic algal blooms in our city. As a local citizen's
   observatory, we intend to support traditional monitoring programs by
   providing our data set to improve the surveillance.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems is affecting water quality
   and seafloor integrity. Mediterranean seagrass meadows of endemic
   Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile are considered a priority habitat
   under the European Directive 92/43/ CEE, given their ecological and
   economic importance and being an environmental quality indicator.
   Availability of historical data on three P. oceanica meadows along the
   Ligurian coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) allowed assessing change in the
   meadow status over time. A number of indicators and ecological indices
   at different levels of ecological complexity, including the multimetric
   PREI (Posidonia Rapid Easy Index) adopted by the environmental agencies,
   were employed and compared. This paper aims at a) defining the health
   status of the P. oceanica meadows and measuring their changes through
   time collating available historical information; b) evaluating the
   discriminating power of the different indices and assessing their
   consistency with each other. The different indices adopted revealed
   little consistency thus suggesting that no single index can define the
   health status of P. oceanica meadows; as a consequence the use of an
   indices set is highly recommended to monitor meadow evolution over time.},

Abstract = {The Biguglia lagoon, located in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea
   (Corsica), is a natural reserve, which has been affected by a tremendous
   territorial change since last decades. An ecosystem-based approach
   should enable to understand the functioning of an ecosystem, which can
   be considered, as a socio-ecosystem in order to provide decision support
   for its conservation and restoration. The objective of this work is to
   present the research approach carried out on the Biguglia lagoon. The
   decreasing of the water quality is reflected by a shift from a dominance
   of aquatic magnoliophytes in the 1970s to varying dominance of
   phytoplankton and opportunistic macroalgae in the early 2000s. At the
   same time, it has been observed an ongoing deterioration of the quality
   of groundwater partly providing the lagoon with fresh water, which can
   be attributed to the uncontrolled urbanization development all over the
   alluvial plain surrounding the lagoon. Efforts undertaken to improve the
   hydraulic management and the reduction of nutrient inputs in the
   watershed allowed to observe signs of ecological restoration.
   Nevertheless, the socio-ecosystem functioning study requires a
   multidisciplinary approach where the natural and social scientists must
   work together as it is conducted within the framework of the
   Human-Environment Observatory of the Mediterranean coast (OHM-LM).},

Abstract = {The Institute of Speleology{*}{*} founded by EG Racovitza in Romania,
   arrived in 2020 at its centennial anniversary. We recount the way in
   which the idea of an institution dealing with diverse research aspects
   of the subterranean domain, at the time accessible mainly through the
   exploration of the caves, became a reality. The favorable cultural
   atmosphere of the Labora-toire Arago, at Banyuls- sur-Mer, during the
   time when EG Racovitza worked there, played an important role for the
   creation of the first institute of speleology in the world. The history
   of the scientific activity of this institution, founded in 1920 at Cluj
   under the leadership of Racovitza is briefly recounted. The second part
   of the essay stresses the existential difficulties of this institute
   after the death of Racovitza in 1947 and the successes obtained after
   its reorganization in 1956 as a national centre of speleological
   research in Romania, nowadays widely recognized within the international
   scientific community. The long-term functioning of the institute is
   metaphorically compared to a ``dynamical and multifunctional house{''}.
   The reasons for such a long existence depend on the personalities of the
   ``house's inhabitants{''} and their capacity for active production and
   communication of innovative research.},

Abstract = {In semi-arid areas of the Saharan Atlas region in Algeria, 33 tortoises

   infestation intensity was 4.04 and the parasite abundance was 2.57. The
   infestation prevalence, the mean infestation intensity and the parasite
   abundance in female tortoises were higher than in males, but this
   variation was statistically insignificant. The number of ticks was
   positively and significantly correlated with tortoises' body
   measurements: body weight, straight carapace length, carapace height,
   mid-body carapace width and plastron length. The parasitism by female
   and male ticks separately was not statistically significant. A total of

Abstract = {Nowadays, the copper shark Carcharhinus brachyurus Gunther, 1870
   displays an antitropical, disjunct distribution in marginal-marine
   environments of both the hemispheres. Differing from other species of
   Carcharhinus, C. brachyurus inhabits temperate rather than tropical
   coastal waters, and its dispersal abilities are strongly conditioned by
   the presence of habitats suitable as nursery grounds. Here we analyze,
   through well-defined geological time-slices, the global fossil record of
   C. brachyurus in order to identify the main biogeographic dynamics that
   led to the present-day biogeographic segregation pattern of this requiem
   shark species. By integrating a thorough review of the paleontological
   literature with the results of recent phylogeographic analyses on extant
   copper shark populations, our study provides a first integrated
   reconstruction of the historical distributional patterns of this shark
   species that allows for proposing the identification of some dispersal
   trajectories as well as of a number of key events in the
   paleobiogeographic history of C. brachyurus. Our research supports the
   notion that the present-day distributional pattern of C. brachyurus is
   the product of historical biogeographic processes and events that might
   be traced back to an early Miocene East Pacific-central West Atlantic
   center of origin and likely reflect major changes in the global ocean
   system (including the closure of major seaways and the emergence of new
   oceanic circulation patterns).},

Abstract = {A citizens' observatory, the Osservatorio del Mare a Molfetta (OMM),
   monitors the health status of the marine/coastal environment of the
   city. Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile meadows are considered as
   bioindicators revealing the health status of the related marine/coastal
   ecosystem. To gather information necessary for the preservation of this
   ecosystem, OMM investigated the health status of the local San
   Vito-Barletta P. oceanica meadow extending along the coast of the Apulia
   region in the Italian Southern Adriatic Sea, which has been lately
   graded as `disturbed'. Volunteers conducted underwater visual census of
   the epiphytes on P. oceanica leaves. Two campaigns of investigations at
   three different stations, namely Molfetta, Giovinazzo and Mola di Bari,
   evidenced differences in the distribution of the epiphytic communities.
   Furthermore, a population genetics study performed together with a
   scientific research centre using highly variable microsatellite markers
   showed an excess of heterozygosity and demonstrated the existence of at
   least two subpopulations within the meadow. Since the sampling areas
   were situated along the coasts of different urban centers, this
   situation may reflect the diverse anthropogenic pressures differing from
   city to city. Therefore, this study highlights the need to promote good
   conservation practices to preserve the San Vito-Barletta meadow and the
   whole related coastal/marine ecosystem.},

   saltator (Montagu, 1808) were studied through 18 months in Bizerte beach
   (37 degrees 19'17.1{''}N; 09 degrees 51'57.3{''}E). During this period,
   6255 and 2152 specimens, respectively, of Deshayesorchestia deshayesii
   and Talitrus saltator were identified. The reproductive season extended
   from April to November for D. deshayesii and from March to November for
   T. saltator, with a sexual rest period during winter for both species.
   During the study period, three cohorts were identified on the first
   sampling date for T. saltator and twelve new cohorts were detected
   later, while D. deshayesii has presented six cohorts on the first
   sampling date and twelve new cohorts were detected during the study
   period. The life span was estimated at 4 to 10 months and at 5 to 7
   months depending on the time of birth, respectively, for D. deshayesii
   and T. saltator. These results suggest that the two species can be
   considered as a semiannual species, with iteroparous females.},

Abstract = {Isolation trials from various tomato-growing sites in Kafrelsheikh
   governorate showing characteristic symptoms of wilt yielded one fungal
   isolate which was purified and identified as Fusarium solani. In vitro
   study, the synthetization of silver nanoparticles by Men-tha spicata
   leaf extract was subjected to physical characterization using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) images, which confirmed that the particle
   diameters of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) ranged from 57 to 97
   nanometers. The antifungal activity of synthesized AgNPs with poisoned
   food technique was used against a pathogenic fungus with different
   concentrations (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/l); furthermore, different
   concentrations of the fungicide Vitavax (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/l) and
   two biological control agents (Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis)
   were also applied to investigate their antifungal activity against the
   fungus. The pots experiment was applied under greenhouse conditions
   during the 2020 season by soaking tomato seedlings in different
   treatments. The results indicated that the AgNPs treatment yielded the
   least disease severity among various treatments. All treatments were
   found effective at different rates, in particular, AgNPs to promote the
   vegetative growth parameters of tomato plants and controlling the root
   rot disease caused by pathogenic fungus. Treated plants with AgNPs
   record-ed a low concentration of proline and the highest values of
   chlorophyll pigments. Furthermore, AgNPs improved the anatomical
   measurements compared with infected plants without treat-ment. This
   study demonstrated the biosynthesis of AgNPs by Mentha spicata leaves
   extract, which proved a distinct fungicidal activity against pathogenic
   fungus.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Marine hard bottoms support the highest proportion of marine
   biodiversity. In addition, there are a wide range of sizes and forms
   among the benthic species of a hard bottom community: solitary or
   modular, from small organisms to large erected colonies, epibionts,
   encrusting fauna, mobile predators, etc. These habitats and their
   biological communities have a high heterogeneity at different
   spatio-temporal scales. The high diversity and heterogeneity of the hard
   bottom habitats can present considerable difficulties to obtain accurate
   and statistically comparable data for community monitoring. Thus, marine
   hard bottoms are complex habitats where monitoring protocols vary
   considerably. We review the main approaches used in the study of this
   type of habitat, assessing some of their main advantages and
   disadvantages, and highlight a not sufficiently explored alternative
   where the sampling effort is controlled by a set period of sampling
   time. Time-constrained searches have been routinely used in terrestrial
   ecological studies but few explore in marine habitats. However, it is an
   acceptable alternative that would be worth further exploring for
   studding marine hard bottom communities. Time-constrained methodology
   presents a good cost-benefit balance: It provides a good representation
   of the diversity of hard bottom communities, the costs (both in time and
   economic resources) for sampling and sorting are lower, and the
   quantification of taxa allows their relative abundance to influence the
   results.},

Abstract = {The saltmarshes of Hyeres (Provence; France) are Mediterranean lagoons
   and wetlands deeply altered since Antiquity; they are an example of a
   socio-ecosystem characterized by industrial activities since 1848 for
   salt production and artisanal fishing. After the end of the industrial
   exploitation in 1995, saltmarshes of Hyeres became property of the
   Conservatoire du Littoral (Coastal Protection Agency) in 2001 and
   managed by the Toulon Provence Mediterranee metropolitan area. Since
   then, access to the sites is still restricted in order to preserve the
   historical heritage of the site and biodiversity of birds. The present
   work aims to localize and map Magnoliophyta aquatic meadow habitats in
   order to: (i) better understand the water management of the saltmarshes,
   inducing the presence or absence of Magnoliophyta and (ii) assess the
   health status of macrophytes community. The main observed Magnoliophyta
   was Ruppia spiralis, Linnaeus ex Dumortier, its presence in such
   brackish waters can be considered as an indicator of good conservation
   status. Our results show a relatively high abundance of R. spiralis,
   strongly related with environmental conditions and water management.
   This study is the first step of an ecosystem-based approach; R.
   spiralis, as a primary producer, belongs to a major functional
   compartment of the ecosystem, which constitutes the saltmarshes.},

Pages = {133-140},
Abstract = {Skates are the main elasmobranch species exploited in the Northern
   Atlantic Ocean in France and the United Kingdom, especially in the
   English Channel. The reported international landings show that the
   fishery is actually dominated by five species Raja clavata, R.
   brachyura, R. montagui, Leucoraja naevus and R. undulata. The stomach
   contents of R. clavata showed that crustaceans and fish dominate the
   diet. The on-board observations showed that females lay eggs in pairs on
   sand or mud between February and September, especially in June. The diet
   of R. montagui (mainly juveniles in the sample) is strongly dominated by
   crustaceans mainly, decapods (crabs and shrimps), mysida (mysids) and
   amphipoda (amphipods). The spotted ray breeds between April and July.
   Despite their critical conservation status and the current OSPAR
   conventions, the different species of skates were subject to intensive
   fishing in the last 40 years. The Total Allowable Catches (TACs) applied
   for 2020 concerns all skate species (Raja spp.) except R. undulata.
   However, there is no size limit based on the sexual maturity of each
   species, or any restriction during the laying period. The preservation
   of protected coastal sites that play a functional role for these species

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the diet of the invasive species
   Holothuria (Roweothuria) arguinensis Koehler \& Vaney, 1906 and its
   competitive potential in food intake, with native Mediterranean
   holothurian species in Salamandre province (Algeria). Crustaceans are
   widely consumed by all native species {[}21.33 \%, 16 \%, 10 \% and 9.06
   \%, respectively in Holothuria (Panningothuria) forskali Delle Chiaje,
   1823, H. (Platyperona) sanctori Delle Chiaje, 1823, H. (Holothuria)
   tubulosa Gmelin, 1791 and H. (Roweothuria) poli Delle Chiaje, 1824].
   Foraminifera are also well appreciated by H. (R.) poli and H. (H.)
   tubulosa (respectively with 17.33 \% and 29.33 \%). Holothuria (R.)
   arguinensis stands out with high consumption of bivalve fragments (24.80
   \%), sponges fragments (11.6 \%) and nematodes (6.80 \%). However,
   cyanophyceae, crustaceans and foraminifera are not consumed by this
   invasive species. There was a very highly significant difference
   (Permanova, p < 0.001) between H. (R.) arguinensis and the four native
   Mediterranean holothurians. Holothuria (R.) arguinensis prefers food
   resources which are little or not consumed by the other native sea
   cucumbers; it could therefore be considered as a ``specialist{''}
   species which shows no tendency to competition with the other
   holothurians species.},

Abstract = {Network analysis is used to address diverse ecological, social, economic
   and management questions, but few studies combine social and ecological
   issues in a single analysis. Understanding the links between social and
   ecological networks helps in establishing coastal management strategy
   for the sustainable use of marine resources. The aim of this research
   study is to apply this approach to artificial reefs (AR) along the
   French metropolitan coasts. For fifty years, AR has been deployed in
   France with a single main goal: to sustain artisanal fisheries by
   enhancing resources. Assessing the effectiveness of this tool requires
   considering each stakeholder's initial intentions and comparing them to
   the actual results (social and ecological). Network analysis provides a
   holistic view of the relations between all the actors of the system that
   offers a basis for suggesting a suitable management strategy for each
   objective identified.},

Volume = {15},
Pages = {12-16},
Abstract = {Screens are an ineliminable component of contemporary society for most
   humans. Consequently, tools and ideas that provide a heuristic and
   support for conceptually mitigating and balancing the costs of screen
   times at an individual level are critical. Here, screen adaptation
   theory (SAT) is proposed as a shorthand tool to frame the wealth of
   research examining human-screen interactions. Screens are best
   conceptualized as a place. Adaptation (to screens) are acquired or
   cultivated traits that enable us to not only survive with screens but
   potentially thrive-provided that we leverage research on costs and
   benefits. Adaptive behavioral traits suggest that we approach these
   interactions with purposeful intent. Finally, the theory associated with
   humans with screens is rich and interdisciplinary. We must design and
   adopt principles from theory relevant to our work, leisure, and
   individual choices to use screens as we move from tolerance to
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {Stories shape the human experience. Fairy tales, fables, and historical
   stories from many peoples influence contemporary culture and science.
   The Little Prince is an excellent example of a short tale that
   highlights the relative importance of living with ecology and
   connectedness. It also clearly illuminates the absurdity that can emerge
   when one becomes isolated from even the simple processes associated with
   the functioning of other natural systems or from ecological
   interactions. This is one of many excellent stories that can be used in
   teaching science to frame theory for learners into different and larger
   novel contexts. This fairy tale provides morals for daily living
   too-tend to your garden, watch sunsets, and use nature to tame your
   absurd life and connect to others. We use humour, stories, and current
   cultural memes from television and movies in many publications and/or
   their titles and in classroom lessons. Looking more broadly for tales
   and stories from different cultures and times promotes justice and
   openness.},

Abstract = {The article by Kayal et al. (2021) constitutes an important reminder to

   this short response, I discuss Latour's portrayal of scientists as
   ``savage capitalists{''} to relocate a part of these issues in the
   practices held by researchers themselves. By depicting scientists as
   capitalist agents publishing articles as investors awaiting returns in
   capital, I question the compatibility between the stated goal to
   transform today's publishing system and a potential collective inertia
   rooted in personal and career goals. So-called ``individual
   solutions{''} with deep collective and institutional roots are therefore
   calling for social momentum to effectively be activated; this vision
   could be translated into more specific goals for future research and

   and disorders is retracting, though it is likely to remain critical for
   decades. In light of increasing regulation and expectations of judicious
   use of animal subjects, we examine the idea that the use of animal
   models can be guided by phylogenetic relationships and modern
   evolutionary and cladistic analyses. Given that inherited disorders, and
   indeed, even the developmental and physiological responses to non
   inherited conditions, are subject to evolutionary forces, it follows
   that the observed differences in model organisms are the products of
   evolutionary divergence. Understanding that divergence has the potential
   to elucidate which taxa are most likely to exhibit any given symptom or
   manifest a reaction in a broadly predictable fashion. We examine two
   case studies, one the inherited disorder Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,
   and the other an entirely environmentally induced problem, Fetal Alcohol
   Spectrum Disorder, or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Both case studies reveal
   symptoms are largely congruent with phylogeny, suggesting relatively
   conservative evolution of developmental pathways. It follows that it is
   possible to characterize the manifestation of symptoms or
   dysmorphologies to broad phylogenetic groups. These data can then be
   used to inform research into possible treatments based on molecular
   genetic techniques sourced from unaffected taxa or even provide an
   evolutionary rationale for maximizing ethical decisions in the use and
   development of animal models in biomedical research. We argue that the
   technique should become standard practice in the development of animal
   models.},

Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Bayesian inference is a powerful tool that is increasingly being used by
   ecologists. This is largely due to the flexibility in model
   specification and improvements in software that makes this tool easier
   to use. However, with increasing ease of use comes a risk of misuse or
   abuse. We review four major issues we have identified in the use of
   Bayesian methods and offer reminders and suggestions that will improve
   the application and reporting of Bayesian inference while at the same
   time, hopefully, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued null hypothesis
   statistical testing (NHST). These issues include; 1) understanding
   software and model specification; 2) use of prior probability
   distributions; 3) maximizing utility of posterior probability
   distributions; and 4) avoiding dichotomous thinking (i e , the NHST
   pitfall). We suggest ecologists should strive for openness in their use
   of statistical software by understanding their model and providing the
   full computer code used, develop reasonable and informative priors, and
   make full use of posterior information that Bayesian methods provide. At
   the same time, ecologists should avoid dichotomizing results into
   significant/non-significant boxes, eliminate null hypothesis tests
   (including probability intervals for hypothesis testing), and use clear
   language when describing results. Finally, quantitative training should
   be expanded in undergraduate curricula to provide students with a larger
   suite of foundational core concepts that extend beyond NHST.},

Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-30},
Abstract = {Communicating new scientific discoveries is key to human progress. Yet,
   this endeavor has been increasingly hindered by monetary restrictions
   that restrain scientists from publishing their findings and accessing
   other scientists' reports. This process is further exacerbated by a
   large portion of publishing media owned by private companies that, in
   contrast with journals from scientific societies, do not reinject
   academic publishing benefits into the scientific community. As the
   academic world is not exempt from economic crises and funding
   restrictions, new alternatives are necessary to support a fair and
   economically sustainable publishing system for scientists and society as
   a whole. After summarizing major shortcomings of academic publishing
   today, we present several solutions that span the levels of the
   individual scientist, the scientific community, and the publisher to
   initiate a transformative change towards more sustainable scientific
   publishing. By providing a voice to the many scientists who are
   fundamental protagonists, yet often powerless witnesses, of the academic
   publishing system, as well as a roadmap for implementing solutions, we
   hope this initiative will go beyond sparking increased awareness and
   promote a shift towards more sustainable scientific publishing
   practices.},

Title = {The third dimension: How fire-related research can advance ecology and
   evolutionary biology},
Journal = {IDEAS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-58},
Abstract = {Most of the Earth's vegetated surface is fireprone but the relevance of
   fire in understanding how nature works is not always recognized. We aim
   to show that, by adding the fire dimension to observations on biological
   phenomena, interpretations can be improved; how fire-related research
   can be used to answer `fundamental' questions in ecology; and how
   theories/models developed for fireprone ecosystems can be applied to
   advancing disturbance ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology
   more generally. We compiled lists from the world-wide web of the most
   highly cited papers in fire ecology, and examined papers that had been
   approached from multiple viewpoints, including fire. We show that great
   advances over the last 20 years have been made in our understanding of
   the pivotal role of fire as a driver of many ecological processes and a
   powerful selective agent/evolutionary trigger among biota. We document
   21 sets of observations originally interpreted in the context of the two
   traditional dimensions, prevailing environment and biotic interactions,
   but can also be shown to have a strong, if not dominant, historical link
   to fire. We note that fire-related research is able to address 55 of the
   100 questions considered `fundamental' in ecology and that many have
   already received some attention in fireprone ecosystems. We show how
   theories/models that had their origins in fireprone systems can be
   applied to other disturbance-prone systems and thus have wide
   application in ecology and evolutionary biology. Fire and other
   disturbances should be included as variables in research about possible
   critical environmental and biotic constraints controlling ecosystem
   function in general. Adding this third dimension to research endeavours
   greatly enriches our understanding of how nature works at the global
   scale in an era where ecosystems are changing rapidly and novel
   species-environmental interactions are emerging.},

Title = {Serial passage in an insect host indicates genetic stability of the

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle
   1917 (EcN) has been shown to effectively prevent and alleviate
   intestinal diseases. Despite the widespread medical application of EcN,
   we still lack basic knowledge about persistence and evolution of EcN
   outside the human body. Such knowledge is important also for public
   health aspects, as in contrast to abiotic therapeutics, probiotics are
   living organisms that have the potential to evolve. This study made use
   of experimental evolution of EcN in an insect host, the red flour beetle
   Tribolium castaneum, and its flour environment. Methodology Using a
   serial passage approach, we orally introduced EcN to larvae of
   T.castaneum as a new host, and also propagated it in the flour
   environment. After eight propagation cycles, we analyzed phenotypic
   attributes of the passaged replicate EcN lines, their effects on the
   host in the context of immunity and infection with the entomopathogen
   Bacillus thuringiensis, and potential genomic changes using WGS of three
   of the evolved lines. Results We observed weak phenotypic differences
   between the ancestral EcN and both, beetle and flour passaged EcN lines,
   in motility and growth at 30 degrees C, but neither any genetic changes,
   nor the expected increased persistence of the beetle-passaged lines. One
   of these lines displayed distinct morphological and physiological
   characteristics. Conclusions and implications Our findings suggest that
   EcN remains rather stable during serial passage in an insect. Weak
   phenotypic changes in growth and motility combined with a lack of
   genetic changes indicate a certain degree of phenotypic plasticity of
   EcN. Lay Summary For studying adaptation of the human probiotic
   Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, we introduced it to a novel insect
   host system and its environment using a serial passage approach. After
   passage, we observed weak phenotypic changes in growth and motility but
   no mutations or changes in persistence inside the host.},

Title = {Daily rhythms of both host and parasite affect antimalarial drug
   efficacy},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {208-219},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Circadian rhythms contribute to treatment
   efficacy in several non-communicable diseases. However, chronotherapy
   (administering drugs at a particular time-of-day) against infectious
   diseases has been overlooked. Yet, the daily rhythms of both hosts and
   disease-causing agents can impact the efficacy of drug treatment. We use
   the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi, to test whether the
   daily rhythms of hosts, parasites and their interactions affect
   sensitivity to the key antimalarial, artemisinin.
   Methodology: Asexual malaria parasites develop rhythmically in the
   host's blood, in a manner timed to coordinate with host daily rhythms.
   Our experiments coupled or decoupled the timing of parasite and host
   rhythms, and we administered artemisinin at different times of day to
   coincide with when parasites were either at an early (ring) or later
   (trophozoite) developmental stage. We quantified the impacts of parasite
   developmental stage, and alignment of parasite and host rhythms, on drug
   sensitivity.
   Results: We find that rings were less sensitive to artemisinin than
   trophozoites, and this difference was exacerbated when parasite and host
   rhythms were misaligned, with little direct contribution of host
   time-of-day on its own. Furthermore, the blood concentration of haem at
   the point of treatment correlated positively with artemisinin efficacy
   but only when parasite and host rhythms were aligned.
   Conclusions and implications: Parasite rhythms influence drug
   sensitivity in vivo. The hitherto unknown modulation by alignment
   between parasite and host daily rhythms suggests that disrupting the
   timing of parasite development could be a novel chronotherapeutic
   approach.
   Lay Summary: We reveal that chronotherapy (providing medicines at a
   particular time-of-day) could improve treatment for malaria infections.
   Specifically, parasites' developmental stage at the time of treatment
   and the coordination of timing between parasite and host both affect how
   well antimalarial drug treatment works.},

Abstract = {Background National responses to the Covid-19 pandemic varied markedly
   across countries, from business-as-usual to complete shutdowns. Policies
   aimed at disrupting the viral transmission cycle and preventing the
   overwhelming of healthcare systems inevitably exact an economic toll.
   Methodology We developed an intervention policy model that comprised the
   relative human, implementation and healthcare costs of
   non-pharmaceutical epidemic interventions and identified the optimal
   strategy using a neuroevolution algorithm. The proposed model finds the
   minimum required reduction in transmission rates to maintain the burden
   on the healthcare system below the maximum capacity. Results We find
   that such a policy renders a sharp increase in the control strength
   during the early stages of the epidemic, followed by a steady increase
   in the subsequent ten weeks as the epidemic approaches its peak, and
   finally the control strength is gradually decreased as the population
   moves towards herd immunity. We have also shown how such a model can
   provide an efficient adaptive intervention policy at different stages of
   the epidemic without having access to the entire history of its
   progression in the population. Conclusions and implications This work
   emphasizes the importance of imposing intervention measures early and
   provides insights into adaptive intervention policies to minimize the
   economic impacts of the epidemic without putting an extra burden on the
   healthcare system. Lay Summary We developed an intervention policy model
   that comprised the relative human, implementation and healthcare costs
   of non-pharmaceutical epidemic interventions and identified the optimal
   strategy using a neuroevolution algorithm. Our work emphasizes the
   importance of imposing intervention measures early and provides insights
   into adaptive intervention policies to minimize the economic impacts of
   the epidemic without putting an extra burden on the healthcare system.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {26-35},
Abstract = {Although fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of COVID-19
   infection, little public attention has been given to fever as an evolved
   defense. Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part
   of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase
   response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells,
   induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines
   with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense.
   Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever,
   and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever
   reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that
   seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they
   can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with
   novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence
   suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its
   course.},

Title = {How a pregnant woman's relationships with her siblings relate to her
   mental health: a prenatal allocare perspective},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Lay Summary Individuals may increase their number of indirect
   descendants by caring for a pregnant sister. Results suggest that it is
   not how often a pregnant woman sees, but rather, how frequently she
   communicates with siblings that is associated with less depression.
   Having sisters also was associated with less depression.
   Background In cooperatively breeding species, individuals may promote
   their inclusive fitness through allomothering. Humans exhibit some
   features of cooperative breeding, and previous studies have focused on
   allomothering by grandparents and juvenile siblings in the postnatal
   period. We hypothesize that a pregnant woman's relationships with her
   siblings (offspring's maternal aunts and uncles) are beneficial for
   maternal affect in ways that can enhance the siblings' inclusive
   fitness. Maternal affect during pregnancy is a salient target of
   allocare given the detrimental effects of antepartum mood disorders on
   birth and infant outcomes. Methodology We test our hypotheses in a
   cohort of pregnant Latina women in Southern California (N = 201).
   Predictor variables of interest include number of siblings a participant
   has, if she has sisters, frequency of seeing siblings, and frequency of
   communication with siblings. Outcome variables measuring maternal affect
   include depression, state anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety and
   perceived stress. Results Having at least one sister and greater
   frequency of communication with siblings were associated with fewer
   depressive symptoms during pregnancy. No significant associations were
   found between sibling variables and other measures of affect. Conclusion
   and implications Results suggest that how frequently you communicate
   with, and not how often you see, siblings could be protective against
   risk of antepartum depression. Sibling allomothering could impart
   effects through social-emotional support rather than instrumental
   support, as a strategy to benefit the prenatal environment in which
   future nieces and nephews develop. Allomothering may be particularly
   important in cultural contexts that value family relationships. Future
   studies should investigate other communities.},

Title = {Cesarean section and breastfeeding outcomes in an Indigenous Qom
   community with high breastfeeding support},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-46},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Lay Summary We examined associations between cesarean section and
   breastfeeding transitions among Indigenous mothers in Argentina. Mothers
   delivering via cesarean section did not introduce complementary foods
   earlier, and conversely weaned later than mothers who delivered
   vaginally. Postpartum kin support typical of traditional birthing
   practices may help mothers overcome early breastfeeding problems.
   Background and objectives Cesarean section may lead to suboptimal
   breastfeeding outcomes, though evidence has been mixed. Factors, such as
   premature birth, birth weight and maternal age may independently
   increase risk of cesarean and hinder breastfeeding initiation, while
   maternal preferences, support and sociostructural barriers may influence
   breastfeeding practices beyond the immediate postpartum period.
   Methodology We assessed impacts of cesarean section and gestational
   factors on breastfeeding duration among Indigenous Qom mothers in
   Argentina who have strong traditional breastfeeding support. We modeled
   transitions from exclusive breastfeeding to complementary feeding and
   from complementary feeding to full weaning in a Bayesian time-to-event
   framework with birth mode and gestational covariates (n = 89 infants).
   Results Estimated median time to full weaning was 30 months.
   Cesarean-delivered babies were weaned an average of 5 months later
   adjusting for gestational age, maternal parity and infant sex. No
   factors were associated with time-to-complementary feeding, and
   time-to-complementary feeding was not associated with time-to-full
   weaning. Conclusions and implications Among Indigenous Qom mothers in
   Argentina, cesarean section was not associated with suboptimal
   breastfeeding outcomes. Although some Qom mothers do experience early
   breastfeeding problems, particularly following first birth, problems are
   not more frequent following cesarean delivery. Traditional postpartum
   kin and community support during prolonged postpartum periods may be
   instrumental in helping mothers to overcome early breastfeeding problems
   due to cesarean or other risk factors.},

Title = {Evolved resistance to a novel cationic peptide antibiotic requires high
   mutation supply},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {266-276},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Lay Summary Antimicrobial resistance is a significant challenge in
   evolutionary biology and medicine. New compounds are scant and must be
   designed to avoid resistance. We experimentally manipulated mutation
   supply to define the causes of resistance to a promising cationic
   peptide antibiotic as well as the probability that it will evolve during
   treatment.
   Background and Objectives A key strategy for resolving the antibiotic
   resistance crisis is the development of new drugs with antimicrobial
   properties. The engineered cationic antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 (also
   known as PLG0206) is a promising broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound
   that has completed Phase I clinical studies. It has activity against
   Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including infections associated
   with biofilm. No definitive mechanisms of resistance to WLBU2 have been
   identified. Methodology Here, we used experimental evolution under
   different levels of mutation supply and whole genome sequencing (WGS) to
   detect the genetic pathways and probable mechanisms of resistance to
   this peptide. We propagated populations of wild-type and hypermutator
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of WLBU2 and performed WGS of
   evolved populations and clones. Results Populations that survived WLBU2
   treatment acquired a minimum of two mutations, making the acquisition of
   resistance more difficult than for most antibiotics, which can be
   tolerated by mutation of a single target. Major targets of resistance to
   WLBU2 included the orfN and pmrB genes, previously described to confer
   resistance to other cationic peptides. More surprisingly, mutations that
   increase aggregation such as the wsp pathway were also selected despite
   the ability of WLBU2 to kill cells growing in a biofilm. Conclusions and
   implications The results show how experimental evolution and WGS can
   identify genetic targets and actions of new antimicrobial compounds and
   predict pathways to resistance of new antibiotics in clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a
   global public health emergency causing a disparate burden of death and
   disability around the world. The viral genetic variants associated with
   outcome severity are still being discovered.
   Methods: We downloaded 155 958 severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from GISAID. Of these genomes, 3637
   samples included useable metadata on patient outcomes. Using this
   subset, we evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic variants improved
   prediction of reported severity beyond age and region. First, we
   established whether including genomic variants as model features
   meaningfully increased the predictive power of our model. Next, we
   evaluated specific variants in order to determine the magnitude of
   association with severity and the frequency of these variants among
   SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
   Results: Logistic regression models that included viral genomic variants
   outperformed other models (area under the curve = 0.91 as compared with
   0.68 for age and gender alone; P < 0.001). We found 84 variants with
   odds ratios greater than 2 for outcome severity (17 and 67 for higher
   and lower severity, respectively). The median frequency of associated
   variants was 0.15\% (interquartile range 0.09-0.45\%). Altogether 85\%
   of genomes had at least one variant associated with patient outcome.
   Conclusion: Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have 2-fold or greater
   association with odds of mild or severe outcome and collectively, these
   variants are common. In addition to comprehensive mitigation efforts,
   public health measures should be prioritized to control the more severe
   manifestations of COVID-19 and the transmission chains linked to these
   severe cases.
   Lay summary: This study explores which, if any, SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic
   variants are associated with mild or severe COVID-19 patient outcomes.
   Our results suggest that there are common genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2
   that are more often associated with negative patient outcomes, which may
   impact downstream public health measures.},

Abstract = {The author apply concepts and tools from evolutionary medicine to
   understanding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The pandemic represents a
   mismatched conflict, with dynamics and pathology apparently driven by
   three main factors: (i) bat immune systems that rely on low inflammation
   but high efficacy of interferon-based defenses; (ii) viral tactics that
   differentially target the human interferon system, leading to
   substantial asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission; and (ii) high
   mortality caused by hyper-inflammatory and hyper-coagulatory phenotypes,
   that represent dysregulated tradeoffs whereby collateral immune-induced
   damage becomes systemic and severe. This framework can explain the
   association of mortality with age (which involves immune life-history
   shifts towards higher inflammation and coagulation and reduced adaptive
   immunity), and sex (since males senesce faster than females).
   Genetic-risk factors for COVID-19 mortality can be shown, from a
   phenome-wide association analysis of the relevant SNPs, to be associated
   with inflammation and coagulation; the phenome-wide association study
   also provides evidence, consistent with several previous studies, that
   the calcium channel blocking drug amlodipine mediates risk of mortality.
   Lay Summary: SARS-CoV-2 is a bat virus that jumped into humans. The
   virus is adapted to bat immune systems, where it evolved to suppress the
   immune defenses (interferons) that mammals use to tell that they are
   infected. In humans, the virus can apparently spread effectively in the
   body with a delay in the production of symptoms and the initiation of
   immune responses. This delay may then promote overactive immune
   responses, when the virus is detected, that damage the body as a side
   effect. Older people are more vulnerable to the virus because they are
   less adapted to novel infectious agents, and invest less in immune
   defense, compared to younger people. Genes that increase risk of
   mortality from SARS-CoV-2 are functionally associated with a drug called
   amlodipine, which may represent a useful treatment.},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Theory suggests that some types of vaccines
   against infectious pathogens may lead to the evolution of variants that
   cause increased harm, particularly when they infect unvaccinated
   individuals. This theory was supported by the observation that the use
   of an imperfect vaccine to control Marek's disease virus in chickens
   resulted in the virus evolving to be more lethal to unvaccinated birds.
   This raises the concern that the use of some other vaccines may lead to
   similar pernicious outcomes. We examine that theory with a focus on
   considering the regimes in which such outcomes are expected. Methodology
   We evaluate the plausibility of assumptions in the original theory. The
   previous theory rested heavily on a particular form of
   transmission-mortality-recovery trade-off and invoked other assumptions
   about the pathways of evolution. We review alternatives to mortality in
   limiting transmission and consider evolutionary pathways that were
   omitted in the original theory. Results The regime where the pernicious
   evolutionary outcome occurs is narrowed by our analysis but remains
   possible in various scenarios. We propose a more nuanced consideration
   of alternative models for the within-host dynamics of infections and for
   factors that limit virulence. Our analysis suggests imperfect vaccines
   against many pathogens will not lead to the evolution of pathogens with
   increased virulence in unvaccinated individuals. Conclusions and
   implications Evolution of greater pathogen mortality driven by
   vaccination remains difficult to predict, but the scope for such
   outcomes appears limited. Incorporation of mechanistic details into the
   framework, especially regarding immunity, may be requisite for
   prediction accuracy. Lay Summary A virus of chickens appears to have
   evolved high mortality in response to a vaccine that merely prevented
   disease symptoms. Theory has predicted this type of evolution in
   response to a variety of vaccines and other interventions such as drug
   treatment. Under what circumstances is this pernicious result likely to
   occur? Analysis of the theory in light of recent changes in our
   understanding of viral biology raises doubts that medicine-driven,
   pernicious evolution is likely to be common. But we are far from a
   mechanistic understanding of the interaction between pathogen and host
   that can predict when vaccines and other medical interventions will lead
   to the unwanted evolution of more virulent pathogens. So, while the
   regime where a pernicious result obtains may be limited, caution remains
   warranted in designing many types of interventions.},

Title = {Phylogenetic prioritization of HIV-1 transmission clusters with viral

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Lay Summary Public health officials faced with more transmitting groups
   than can be immediately addressed require an efficient way to prioritize
   limited resources. We demonstrate that phylogenetic approximations of
   transmission derived from viral sequence data offer advantages over
   other common methods of prioritizing clusters, while meeting and
   frequently exceeding existing performance standards.
   Background and objectives Public health officials faced with a large
   number of transmission clusters require a rapid, scalable and unbiased
   way to prioritize distribution of limited resources to maximize
   benefits. We hypothesize that transmission cluster prioritization based
   on phylogenetically derived lineage-level diversification rates will
   perform as well as or better than commonly used growth-based
   prioritization measures, without need for historical data or subjective
   interpretation. Methodology 9822 HIV pol sequences collected during
   routine drug resistance genotyping were used alongside simulated
   sequence data to infer sets of phylogenetic transmission clusters via
   patristic distance threshold. Prioritized clusters inferred from
   empirical data were compared to those prioritized by the current public
   health protocols. Prioritization of simulated clusters was evaluated
   based on correlation of a given prioritization measure with future
   cluster growth, as well as the number of direct downstream transmissions
   from cluster members. Results Empirical data suggest diversification
   rate-based measures perform comparably to growth-based measures in
   recreating public heath prioritization choices. However, unbiased
   simulated data reveals phylogenetic diversification rate-based measures
   perform better in predicting future cluster growth relative to
   growth-based measures, particularly long-term growth. Diversification
   rate-based measures also display advantages over growth-based measures
   in highlighting groups with greater future transmission events compared
   to random groups of the same size. Furthermore, diversification rate
   measures were notably more robust to effects of decreased sampling
   proportion. Conclusions and implications Our findings indicate
   diversification rate-based measures frequently outperform growth-based
   measures in predicting future cluster growth and offer several
   additional advantages beneficial to optimizing the public health
   prioritization process.},

Title = {Strength is negatively associated with depression and accounts for some
   of the sex difference A replication and extension},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-141},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background Depression occurs about twice as often in women as in men, a
   disparity that remains poorly understood. In a previous publication,
   Hagen and Rosenstrom predicted and found that grip strength, a highly
   sexually dimorphic index of physical formidability, mediated much of the
   effect of sex on depression. Striking results like this are more likely
   to be published than null results, potentially biasing the scientific
   record. It is therefore critical to replicate and extend them.
   Methodology Using new data from the 2013-14 cycle of the National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of
   US households (n = 3650), we replicated models of the effect of sex and
   grip strength on depression reported in Hagen and Rosenstrom, along with
   additional potential confounds and a new detailed symptom-level
   exploration. Results Overall, the effects from the original paper were
   reproduced although with smaller effect sizes. Grip strength mediated
   38\% of the effect of sex on depression, compared to 63\% in Hagen and
   Rosenstrom. These results were extended with findings that grip strength
   had a stronger association with some depression symptoms, like
   suicidality, low interest and low mood than with other symptoms, like
   appetite changes. Conclusions Grip strength is negatively associated
   with depression, especially its cognitive-affective symptoms,
   controlling for numerous possible confounds. Although many factors
   influence depression, few of these reliably occur cross-culturally in a
   sex-stratified manner and so are unlikely to explain the
   well-established, cross-cultural sex difference in depression. The sex
   difference in upper body strength occurs in all populations and is
   therefore a candidate evolutionary explanation for some of the sex
   difference in depression. Lay summary: Why are women at twice the risk
   of developing depression as men? Depression typically occurs during
   social conflicts, such as physical or sexual abuse. Physically strong
   individuals can often single-handedly resolve conflicts in their favor,
   whereas physically weaker individuals often need help from others. We
   argue that depression is a credible cry for help. Because men generally
   have greater strength than women, we argue that men may be more likely
   to resolve conflicts using physical formidability and women to signal
   others for help. We find that higher grip strength is associated with
   lower depression, particularly symptoms like feeling down or thoughts of
   suicide and that strength accounts for part of the sex difference in
   rates of depression.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-77},
Abstract = {The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately
   affected some communities and populations more than others. We propose
   that an interdisciplinary framework of `One Health Disparities' advances
   understanding of the social and systemic issues that drive COVID-19 in
   vulnerable populations. One Health Disparities integrates the social
   environment with One Health perspectives on the interconnectedness of
   human, animal, and environmental health. To apply this framework, we
   consider One Health Disparities that emerge in three key components of
   disease transmission: exposure, susceptibility, and disease expression.
   Exposure disparities arise through variation in contact with COVID-19's
   causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. Disparities in susceptibility and disease
   expression also exist; these are driven by biological and social
   factors, such as diabetes and obesity, and through variation in access
   to healthcare. We close by considering how One Health Disparities
   informs understanding of spillback into new animal reservoirs, and what
   this might mean for further human health disparities.
   Lay summary: One Health focuses on interconnections between human,
   animal, and environmental health. We propose that social environments
   are also important to One Health and help illuminate disparities in the
   coronavirus pandemic, including its origins, transmission and
   susceptibility among humans, and spillback to other species. We call
   this framework One Health Disparities.},

Title = {Postpartum depression and mother-offspring conflict over maternal
   investment},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-23},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: As the mother-offspring relationship is
   central to human reproduction, postpartum depression symptoms are
   difficult to explain in evolutionary terms. We proposed that postpartum
   depression might arise as a result of evolutionary mother-offspring
   conflict over maternal investment, and investigated the association
   between postpartum depression symptoms, infant night waking, maternal
   sleep disturbance and breastfeeding frequency.
   Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using survey
   responses at 6 months postpartum from 1598 Finnish mothers. We
   hypothesized that infant night waking at 6 months postpartum would be
   associated with postpartum depression symptoms, and that this
   association would be mediated by maternal sleep disturbance and a higher
   breastfeeding frequency.
   Results: Infant night waking was moderately associated with postpartum
   depression symptoms, and this association was mediated by maternal sleep
   disturbance (R-2=0.09). Contrary to our prediction, we found that
   increased breastfeeding was associated with less postpartum depression
   symptoms.
   Conclusions and implications: We conclude that postpartum depression
   symptoms might partly be the result of increased maternal fatigue
   stemming from high offspring demands on maternal investment, but that
   this is not due to the metabolic strain from increased breastfeeding.
   Studying postpartum depression from the mother-offspring conflict
   perspective can potentially improve our understanding of the involved
   behavioral processes of both mother and offspring, and allow
   interventions designed to benefit the well-being of both parties.
   Lay Summary: We proposed that postpartum depression is due to an
   evolutionary conflict between mother and infant, where the infant tires
   the mother to delay the arrival of a sibling. We found a link between
   infant night waking and postpartum depression, mediated by the mother's
   sleep, but not by breastfeeding frequency.},

Abstract = {Energy expenditure (EE) is generally viewed as tumorigenic, due to
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage cells and
   DNA. On this basis, individuals within a species that sustain high EE
   should be more likely to develop cancer. Here, we argue the opposite,
   that high EE may be net protective effect against cancer, despite high
   ROS production. This is possible because individuals that sustain high
   EE have a greater energetic capacity (=greater energy acquisition,
   expenditure and ability to up-regulate output), and can therefore
   allocate energy to multiple cancer-fighting mechanisms with minimal
   energetic trade-offs. Our review finds that individuals sustaining high
   EE have greater antioxidant production, lower oxidative stress, greater
   immune function and lower cancer incidence. Our hypothesis and
   literature review suggest that EE may indeed be net protective against
   cancer, and that individual variation in energetic capacity may be a key
   mechanism to understand the highly individual nature of cancer risk in
   contemporary human populations and laboratory animals.},

Title = {A novel predictor of ACE2-binding ability among betacoronaviruses},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {360-373},
Abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in -4.8
   million deaths worldwide as of this writing. Almost all conceivable
   aspects of SARS-CoV-2 have been explored since the virus began spreading
   in the human population. Despite numerous proposals, it is still unclear
   how and when the virus gained the ability to efficiently bind to and
   infect human cells. In an effort to understand the evolution of receptor
   binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and
   specifically, how the ability of RBD to bind to angiotensin-converting
   enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) of humans evolved in coronaviruses, we have
   applied an alignment-free technique to infer functional relatedness
   among betacoronaviruses. This technique, concurrently being optimized
   for identifying novel prions, was adapted to gain new insights into
   coronavirus evolution, specifically in the context of the ongoing
   COVID-19 pandemic. Novel methods for predicting the capacity for
   coronaviruses, in general, to infect human cells are urgently needed.
   Methodology: proposed method utilizes physicochemical properties of
   amino acids to develop fully dynamic waveform representations of
   proteins that encode both the amino acid content and the context of
   amino acids. These waveforms are then subjected to dynamic time warping
   (DTW) and distance evaluation to develop a distance metric that is
   relatively less sensitive to variation in sequence length and primary
   amino acid composition.
   Results and Conclusions: Using our proposed method, we show that in
   contrast to alignment-based maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining
   (NJ) phylogenetic analyses, all bat betacoronavirus spike protein RBDs
   known to bind to the ACE2 receptor are found within a single
   physicochemical cluster. Further, other RBDs within that cluster are
   from pangolin coronaviruses, two of which have already been shown to
   bind to ACE2 while the others are suspected, yet unverified ACE2 binding
   domains. This finding is important because both severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 use the host ACE2
   receptor for cell entry. Surveillance for coronaviruses belonging to
   this cluster could potentially guide efforts to stifle or curtail
   potential and/or early zoonotic outbreaks with their associated deaths
   and financial devastation.
   Lay Summary: Robust methods for predicting human ACE2 receptor binding
   by the spike protein of coronaviruses are needed for the early detection
   of zoonotic coronaviruses and biosurveillance to prevent future
   outbreaks. Here we present a new waveform-based approach that utilizes
   the physicochemical properties of amino acids to determine the
   propensity of betacoronaviruses to infect humans. Comparison with the
   established phylogenetic methods demonstrates the usefulness of this new
   approach in the biosurveillance of coronaviruses.},

Title = {Helminth infection is associated with dampened cytokine responses to
   viral and bacterial stimulations in Tsimane forager-horticulturalists},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {349-359},
Abstract = {Background: Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and humans share long
   co-evolutionary histories over which STHs have evolved strategies to
   permit their persistence by downregulating host immunity. Understanding
   the interactions between STHs and other pathogens can inform our
   understanding of human evolution and contemporary disease patterns.
   Methodology: We worked with Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the
   Bolivian Amazon, where STHs are prevalent. We tested whether STHs and
   eosinophil levels-likely indicative of infection in this population-are
   associated with dampened immune responses to in vitro stimulation with
   H1N1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. Whole blood samples ( n=179)
   were treated with H1N1 vaccine and LPS and assayed for 13 cytokines
   (INF-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10,
   IL-12p70, IL-13, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha). We evaluated how STHs and
   eosinophil levels affected cytokine responses and T helper (Th) 1 and
   Th2-cytokine suite responses to stimulation.
   Results: Infection with Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly (P <=
   0.05) associated with lower response of some cytokines to H1N1 and LPS
   in women. Eosinophils were significantly negatively associated with some
   cytokine responses to H1N1 and LPS, with the strongest effects in women,
   and associated with a reduced Th1- and Th2-cytokine response to H1N1 and
   LPS in women and men.
   Conclusions and implications: Consistent with the `old friends' and
   hygiene hypotheses, we find that STHs were associated with dampened
   cytokine responses to certain viral and bacterial antigens. This
   suggests that STH infections may play an essential role in immune
   response regulation and that the lack of STH immune priming in
   industrialized populations may increase the risk of over-reactive
   immunity.
   Lay Summary: Indicators of helminth infection were associated with
   dampened cytokine immune responses to in vitro stimulation with viral
   and bacterial antigens in Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the
   Bolivian Amazon, consistent with the `old friends' and hygiene
   hypotheses.},

Title = {Evolution of higher mesenchymal CD44 expression in the human lineage A
   gene linked to cancer malignancy},

Abstract = {Lay Summary While all multicellular organisms can develop tumors, cancer
   mortality is, to a large degree, determined by the tendency of tumors to
   progress to malignant cancer, i.e. the spread of cancer cells to other
   parts of the body. There are large differences in the rate of cancer
   malignancy, with many hoofed animals (cow, horses, etc.), for instance,
   less vulnerable to malignancy than say humans. In order to understand
   the species differences in cancer malignancy, we investigated the
   evolutionary changes in the expression of a gene that has been
   implicated in cancer malignancy, called CD44. We find that the primate
   lineage has evolved high levels of CD44 expression, while that in other
   animals remained comparatively modest. This result suggests that the
   expression of this gene might explain, in part, the human vulnerability
   to malignant cancer.
   CD44 is an extracellular matrix receptor implicated in cancer
   progression. CD44 increases the invasibility of skin (SF) and
   endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESF) by cancer and trophoblast cells.
   We reasoned that the evolution of CD44 expression can affect both, the
   fetal-maternal interaction through CD44 in ESF as well as vulnerability
   to malignant cancer through expression in SF. We studied the evolution
   of CD44 expression in mammalian SF and ESF and demonstrate that in the
   human lineage evolved higher CD44 expression. Isoform expression in
   cattle and human is very similar suggesting that differences in
   invasibility are not due to the nature of expressed isoforms. We then
   asked whether the concerted gene expression increase in both cell types
   is due to shared regulatory mechanisms or due to cell type-specific
   factors. Reporter gene experiments with cells and cis-regulatory
   elements from human and cattle show that the difference of CD44
   expression is due to cis effects as well as cell type-specific trans
   effects. These results suggest that the concerted expression increase is
   likely due to selection acting on both cell types because the
   evolutionary change in cell type-specific factors requires selection on
   cell type-specific functions. This scenario implies that the malignancy
   enhancing effects of elevated CD44 expression in humans likely evolved
   as a side-effect of positive selection on a yet unidentified other
   function of CD44. A possible candidate is the anti-fibrotic effect of
   CD44 but there are no reliable data showing that humans and primates are
   less fibrotic than other mammals.},

Title = {Mismatch: a comparative study of vitamin D status in British-Bangladeshi
   migrants},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {164-173},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Low levels of vitamin D among dark-skinned
   migrants to northern latitudes and increased risks for associated
   pathologies illustrate an evolutionary mismatch between an environment
   of high ultraviolet (UV) radiation to which such migrants are adapted
   and the low UV environment to which they migrate. Recently, low levels
   of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting
   COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D
   levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of
   British-Bangladeshi migrants compared with white British residents and
   Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh ('sedentees').
   Methodology: The cross-sectional study compared serum vitamin D levels
   among 149 women aged 35-59, comprising British-Bangladeshi migrants
   (n=50), white British neighbors (n=54) and Bangladeshi sedentees (n=45).
   Analyses comprised multivariate models to assess serum levels of
   25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and associations with anthropometric,
   lifestyle, health and migration factors.
   Results: Vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants were very low: mean
   25(OH)D=32.2 nmol/L +/- 13.0, with 29\% of migrants classified as
   deficient (<25 nmol/L) and 94\% deficient or insufficient (<= 50
   nmol/L). Mean levels of vitamin D were significantly lower among
   British-Bangladeshis compared with Bangladeshi sedentees (50.9 nmol/L
   +/- 13.3, P< 0.001) and were also lower than in white British women
   (55.3 nmol/L +/- 20.9). Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with
   increased body mass index and low iron status.
   Conclusions and implications: We conclude that lower exposure to
   sunlight in the UK reduces vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants.
   Recommending supplements could prevent potentially adverse health
   outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency.
   Lay Summary: Vitamin D deficiency is one example of mismatch between an
   evolved trait and novel environments. Here we compare vitamin D status
   of dark-skinned British-Bangladeshi migrants in the UK to Bangladeshis
   in Bangladesh and white British individuals. Migrants had lower levels
   of vitamin D and are at risk for associated pathologies.},

Abstract = {The evolved adaptations of other species can be a source of insight for
   novel biomedical innovation. Limitations of traditional animal models
   for the study of some pathologies are fueling efforts to find new
   approaches to biomedical investigation. One emerging approach recognizes
   the evolved adaptations in other species as possible solutions to human
   pathology. The giraffe heart, for example, appears resistant to
   pathology related to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
   (HFpEF)-a leading form of hypertension-associated cardiovascular disease
   in humans. Here, we postulate that the physiological pressure-induced
   left ventricular thickening in giraffes does not result in the
   pathological cardiovascular changes observed in humans with
   hypertension. The mechanisms underlying this cardiovascular adaptation
   to high blood pressure in the giraffe may be a bioinspired roadmap for
   preventive and therapeutic strategies for human HFpEF.},

Title = {Age-related change in adult chimpanzee social network integration},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {448-459},
Abstract = {Background: Social isolation is a key risk factor for the onset and
   progression of age-related disease and mortality in humans.
   Nevertheless, older people commonly have narrowing social networks, with
   influences from both cultural factors and the constraints of senescence.
   We evaluate evolutionarily grounded models by studying social aging in
   wild chimpanzees, a system where such influences are more easily
   separated than in humans, and where individuals are long-lived and
   decline physically with age.
   Methodology: We applied social network analysis to examine age-related
   changes in social integration in a 7 + year mixed-longitudinal dataset
   on 38 wild adult chimpanzees (22 females, 16 males). Metrics of social
   integration included social attractivity and overt effort (directed
   degree and strength), social roles (betweenness and local transitivity)
   and embeddedness (eigenvector centrality) in grooming networks.
   Results: Both sexes reduced the strength of direct ties with age (males
   in-strength, females outstrength). However, males increased embeddedness
   with age, alongside cliquishness. These changes were independent of
   age-related changes in social and reproductive status. Both sexes
   maintained highly repeatable inter-individual differences in
   integration, particularly in mixed-sex networks.
   Conclusions and implications: As in humans, chimpanzees appear to
   experience senescence-related declines in social engagement. However,
   male social embeddedness and overall sex differences were patterned more
   similarly to humans in non-industrialized versus industrialized
   societies. Such comparisons suggest common evolutionary roots to ape
   social aging and that social isolation in older humans may hinge on
   novel cultural factors of many industrialized societies. Lastly,
   individual and sex differences are potentially important mediators of
   successful social aging in chimpanzees, as in humans.
   Lay summary: Few biological models explain why humans so commonly have
   narrowing social networks with age, despite the risk factor of social
   isolation that small networks pose. We use wild chimpanzees as a
   comparative system to evaluate models grounded in an evolutionary
   perspective, using social network analysis to examine changes in
   integration with age. Like humans in industrialized populations,
   chimpanzees had lower direct engagement with social partners as they
   aged. However, sex differences in integration and older males' central
   positions within the community network were more like patterns of
   sociality in several non-industrialized human populations. Our results
   suggest common evolutionary roots to human and chimpanzee social aging,
   and that the risk of social isolation with age in industrialized
   populations stems from novel cultural factors.},

Title = {Too much of a good thing Adaption to iron (II) intoxication in
   Escherichia coli},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-67},
Abstract = {Background: There has been an increased usage of metallic antimicrobial
   materials to control pathogenic and multi-drug resistant bacteria. Yet,
   there is a corresponding need to know if this usage leads to genetic
   adaptations that could produce more harmful strains.
   Methodology: Experimental evolution was used to adapt Escherichia coli
   K-12 MG1655 to excess iron (II) with subsequent genomic analysis.
   Phenotypic assays and gene expression studies were conducted to
   demonstrate pleiotropic effects associated with this adaptation and to
   elucidate potential cellular responses.
   Results: After 200days of adaptation, populations cultured in excess
   iron (II), showed a significant increase in 24-h optical densities
   compared to controls. Furthermore, these populations showed increased
   resistance toward other metals {[}iron (III) and gallium (III)] and to
   traditional antibiotics (bacitracin, rifampin, chloramphenicol and
   sulfanilamide). Genomic analysis identified selective sweeps in three
   genes; fecA, ptsP and ilvG unique to the iron (II) resistant
   populations, and gene expression studies demonstrated that their
   cellular response may be to downregulate genes involved in iron
   transport (cirA and fecA) while increasing the oxidative stress response
   (oxyR, soxS and soxR) prior to FeSO4 exposure.
   Conclusions and implications: Together, this indicates that the selected
   populations can quickly adapt to stressful levels of iron (II). This
   study is unique in that it demonstrates that E. coli can adapt to
   environments that contain excess levels of an essential micronutrient
   while also demonstrating the genomic foundations of the response and the
   pleiotropic consequences. The fact that adaptation to excess iron also
   causes increases in general antibiotic resistance is a serious concern.
   Lay summary: The evolution of iron resistance in E. coli leads to
   multi-drug and general metal resistance through the acquisition of
   mutations in three genes (fecA, ptsP and ilvG) while also initiating
   cellular defenses as part of their normal growth process.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have long understood race to be a social category
   invented to justify slavery and evolutionary biologists know the
   socially constructed racial categories do not align with our biological
   understanding of genetic variation. The completion of the Human Genome
   Project in 2003 confirmed humans are 99.9\% identical at the DNA level
   and there is no genetic basis for race. A systematic review of the
   PubMed medical literature published since 2003 was conducted to assess
   the use of African ancestry to denote study populations in genetic
   studies categorized as clinical trials, to examine the stated rationale
   for its use and to assess the use of evolutionary principles to explain
   human genetic diversity. We searched for papers that included the terms
   `African', `African American' or `Black' in studies of behavior (20
   papers), physiological responses, the pharmacokinetics of drugs and/or
   disease associations (62 papers), and as a genetic category in studies,
   including the examination of genotypes associated with life stress,
   pain, stuttering and drug clearance (126 papers). Of these, we
   identified 74 studies in which self-reported race alone or in
   combination with admixture mapping was used to define the study
   population. However, none of these studies provided a genetic
   explanation for the use of the self-identified race as a genetic
   category and only seven proffered evolutionary explanations of their
   data. The concept of continuous genetic variation was not clearly
   articulated in any of these papers, presumably due to the paucity of
   evolutionary science in the college and medical school curricula.
   Lay Summary: A review of the medical literature since the completion of
   the Human Genome Project in 2003 revealed that race, a social construct
   created to justify slavery, continues to be used as a genetic category,
   due to a lack of understanding of the continuous nature of human genetic
   variation.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Pages = {157-163},
Abstract = {An evolutionary perspective provides a unifying explanation for the
   modifiable risk factors and lifestyle-based interventions for the
   leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Non-communicable
   diseases develop from an evolutionary mismatch between the prior
   environment and modern patterns of behavior; however, it is unclear
   whether an evolutionary mismatch narrative could promote positive
   behavior change in patients. We hypothesize that educating patients
   about evolutionary mismatch could augment efforts to improve healthful
   behavior. Specifically, explaining the `why' behind what is being
   recommended could promote health literacy and adherence. Furthermore, we
   offer suggestions of how clinicians could educate patients about
   evolutionary mismatch for key-lifestyle factors, diet and physical
   activity, as well as several specific modern diseases. We also consider
   how to sidestep patients' skepticism of evolutionary theory. Here, we
   lay the groundwork for research on how educating patients with an
   evolutionary mismatch narrative could impact health behaviors and
   improve outcomes.},

Title = {Vector dynamics influence spatially imperfect genetic interventions
   against disease},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Genetic engineering and similar technologies
   offer promising new approaches to controlling human diseases by blocking
   transmission from vectors. However, in spatially structured populations,
   imperfect coverage of the vector will leave pockets in which the
   parasite may persist. Movement by humans may disrupt this local
   persistence and facilitate eradication when these pockets are small,
   spreading parasite reproduction outside unprotected areas and into areas
   that block its reproduction. Here, we consider the sensitivity of this
   process to biological details: do simple generalities emerge that may
   facilitate interventions?
   Methodology: We develop formal mathematical models of this process
   similar to standard Ross-Macdonald models, but (i) specifying spatial
   structure of two patches, with vector transmission blocked in one patch
   but not in the other, (ii) allowing temporary human movement (travel
   instead of migration) and (iii) considering two different modes of
   mosquito biting.
   Results: We find that there is no invariant effect of disrupting spatial
   structure with travel. For both biting models, travel out of the
   unprotected patch has different consequences than travel by visitors
   into the patch, but the effects are reversed between the two biting
   models.
   Conclusions and implications: Overall, the effect of human travel on the
   maintenance of vector-borne diseases in structured habitats must be
   considered in light of the actual biology of mosquito abundances, biting
   dynamics and human movement patterns.
   Lay summary: Genetic interventions against pathogens transmitted by
   insect vectors are promising methods of controlling infectious diseases.
   These interventions may be imperfect, leaving pockets where the parasite
   persists. How will human movement between protected and unprotected
   areas affect persistence? Mathematical models developed here show that
   the answer is ecology-dependent, depending on vector biting behavior.},

Title = {Immune cell type and DNA methylation vary with reproductive status in

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background Consistent with evolutionarily theorized costs of
   reproduction (CoR), reproductive history in women is associated with
   life expectancy and susceptibility to certain cancers, autoimmune
   disorders and metabolic disease. Immunological changes originating
   during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.
   Methodology To explore the potential role of the immune system in female
   CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes
   using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22
   years old) women differing in reproductive status.
   Results Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by
   differential methylation at 828 sites, 96\% of which were hypomethylated
   and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate
   immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with
   differential methylation at 1107 sites (71\% hypermethylated), enriched
   for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and
   neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between
   nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant
   women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK)
   cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte
   counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and
   remained so among parous women.
   Implications Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during
   pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may
   accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous
   and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more
   persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support
   transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes
   associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways
   contributing to CoR.
   Lay Summary: Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of
   reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune
   function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene
   regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these
   differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain,
   suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.},

Abstract = {Lay Summary In lowland Nepal, the primary determinant of women's
   nutritional status was age at pregnancy. However, among those pregnant
   early, those married earlier had poorer nutritional status, suggesting
   they were married to ameliorate food insecurity. Marriage age determines
   which household funds adolescent weight gain, with fitness implications
   for members of both households.
   Background and objectives Women's nutritional status is important for
   their health and reproductive fitness. In a population where early
   marriage is common, we investigated how women's nutritional status is
   associated with their age at marriage (marking a geographical transfer
   between households), and at first pregnancy. Methodology We used data
   from a cluster-randomized control trial from lowland Nepal (n = 4071).
   Outcomes including body mass index (BMI) were measured in early
   pregnancy and trial endpoint, after delivery. We fitted mixed-effects
   linear and logistic regression models to estimate associations of age at
   marriage and age at pregnancy with outcomes, and with odds of chronic
   energy deficiency (CED, BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)), at both timepoints. Results
   BMI in early pregnancy averaged 20.9 kg/m(2), with CED prevalence of
   12.5\%. In 750 women measured twice, BMI declined 1.2 (95\% confidence
   interval 1.1, 1.3) kg/m(2) between early pregnancy and endpoint, when
   CED prevalence was 35.5\%. Early pregnancy was associated in
   dose-response manner with poorer nutritional status. Early marriage was
   independently associated with poorer nutritional status among those
   pregnant <= 15 years, but with better nutritional status among those
   pregnant >= 19 years. Conclusions and implications The primary
   determinant of nutritional status was age at pregnancy, but this
   association also varied by marriage age. Our results suggest that natal
   households may marry their daughters earlier if food insecure, but that
   their nutritional status can improve in the marital household if
   pregnancy is delayed. Marriage age therefore determines which household
   funds adolescent weight gain, with implications for Darwinian fitness of
   the members of both households.},

Title = {Integrating evolutionary aspects into dual-use discussion: the cases of
   influenza virus and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {383-392},
Abstract = {Research in infection biology aims to understand the complex nature of
   host-pathogen interactions. While this knowledge facilitates strategies
   for preventing and treating diseases, it can also be intentionally
   misused to cause harm. Such dual-use risk is potentially high for highly
   pathogenic microbes such as Risk Group-3 (RG3) bacteria and RG4 viruses,
   which could be used in bioterrorism attacks. However, other pathogens
   such as influenza virus (IV) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
   (EHEC), usually classified as RG2 pathogens, also demonstrate high
   dual-use risk. As the currently approved therapeutics against these
   pathogens are not satisfactorily effective, previous outbreaks of these
   pathogens caused enormous public fear, media attention and economic
   burden. In this interdisciplinary review, we summarize the current
   perspectives of dual-use research on IV and EHEC, and further highlight
   the dual-use risk associated with evolutionary experiments with these
   infectious pathogens. We support the need to carry out experiments
   pertaining to pathogen evolution, including to gain predictive insights
   on their evolutionary trajectories, which cannot be otherwise achieved
   with stand-alone theoretical models and epidemiological data. However,
   we also advocate for increased awareness and assessment strategies to
   better quantify the risks-versus-benefits associated with such
   evolutionary experiments. In addition to building public trust in
   dual-use research, we propose that these approaches can be extended to
   other pathogens currently classified as low risk, but bearing high
   dual-use potential, given the particular pressing nature of their rapid
   evolutionary potential.
   Lay summary: Scientific research is usually conducted for the good of
   humanity, e.g. to promote health and cure and prevent diseases. However,
   it can also intentionally be misused, and this potential is called
   `dual-use'. We discuss this issue with special emphasis on evolution
   exemplified with two pathogens in an interdisciplinary manner from a
   biological and philosophical perspective.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Several recent studies have provided evidence that use of calcium
   channel blockers (CCBs), especially amlodipine and nifedipine, can
   reduce mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover,
   hypocalcemia (a reduced level of serum ionized calcium) has been shown
   to be strongly positively associated with COVID-19 severity. Both
   effectiveness of CCBs as antiviral therapy, and positive associations of
   hypocalcemia with mortality, have been demonstrated for many other
   viruses as well. We evaluate these findings in the contexts of
   virus-host evolutionary conflicts over calcium metabolism, and
   hypocalcemia as either pathology, viral manipulation or host defence
   against pathogens. Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that
   hypocalcemia represents a host defence. Indeed, hypocalcemia may exert
   antiviral effects in a similar manner as do CCBs, through interference
   with calcium metabolism in virus-infected cells. Prospective clinical
   studies that address the efficacy of CCBs and hypocalcemia should
   provide novel insights into the pathogenicity and treatment of COVID-19
   and other viruses.},

Title = {The evolutionary biology of endometriosis},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {174-191},
Abstract = {We provide the first analysis and synthesis of the evolutionary and
   mechanistic bases for risk of endometriosis in humans, structured around
   Niko Tinbergen's four questions about phenotypes: phylogenetic history,
   development, mechanism and adaptive significance. Endometriosis, which
   is characterized by the proliferation of endometrial tissue outside of
   the uterus, has its phylogenetic roots in the evolution of three
   causally linked traits: (1) highly invasive placentation, (2)
   spontaneous rather than implantation-driven endometrial decidualization
   and (3) frequent extensive estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation and
   inflammation, followed by heavy menstrual bleeding. Endometriosis is
   potentiated by these traits and appears to be driven, proximately, by
   relatively low levels of prenatal and postnatal testosterone.
   Testosterone affects the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO)
   axis, and at low levels, it can result in an altered trajectory of
   reproductive and physiological phenotypes that in extreme cases can
   mediate the symptoms of endometriosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome, by
   contrast, is known from previous work to be caused primarily by high
   prenatal and postnatal testosterone, and it demonstrates a set of
   phenotypes opposite to those found in endometriosis. The hypothesis that
   endometriosis risk is driven by low prenatal testosterone, and involves
   extreme expression of some reproductive phenotypes, is supported by a
   suite of evidence from genetics, development, endocrinology, morphology
   and life history. The hypothesis also provides insights into why these
   two diametric, fitness-reducing disorders are maintained at such high
   frequencies in human populations. Finally, the hypotheses described and
   evaluated here lead to numerous testable predictions and have direct
   implications for the treatment and study of endometriosis.
   Lay summary: Endometriosis is caused by endometrial tissue outside of
   the uterus. We explain why and how humans are vulnerable to this
   disease, and new perspectives on understanding and treating it.
   Endometriosis shows evidence of being caused in part by relatively low
   testosterone during fetal development, that `programs' female
   reproductive development. By contrast, polycystic ovary syndrome is
   associated with relatively high testosterone in prenatal development.
   These two disorders can thus be seen as `opposite' to one another in
   their major causes and correlates. Important new insights regarding
   diagnosis, study and treatment of endometriosis follow from these
   considerations.},

Title = {How evolutionary behavioural sciences can help us understand behaviour
   in a pandemic},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {264-278},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought science into the public eye and to the
   attention of governments more than ever before. Much of this attention
   is on work in epidemiology, virology and public health, with most
   behavioural advice in public health focusing squarely on `proximate'
   determinants of behaviour. While epidemiological models are powerful
   tools to predict the spread of disease when human behaviour is stable,
   most do not incorporate behavioural change. The evolutionary basis of
   our preferences and the cultural evolutionary dynamics of our beliefs
   drive behavioural change, so understanding these evolutionary processes
   can help inform individual and government decision-making in the face of
   a pandemic.
   Lay summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought behavioural sciences into
   the public eye: Without vaccinations, stopping the spread of the virus
   must rely on behaviour change by limiting contact between people. On the
   face of it, ``stop seeing people{''} sounds simple. In practice, this is
   hard. Here we outline how an evolutionary perspective on behaviour
   change can provide additional insights. Evolutionary theory postulates
   that our psychology and behaviour did not evolve to maximize our health
   or that of others. Instead, individuals are expected to act to maximise
   their inclusive fitness (i.e, spreading our genes) - which can lead to a
   conflict between behaviours that are in the best interests for the
   individual, and behaviours that stop the spread of the virus. By
   examining the ultimate explanations of behaviour related to
   pandemic-management (such as behavioural compliance and social
   distancing), we conclude that ``good of the group{''} arguments and
   ``one size fits all{''} policies are unlikely to encourage behaviour
   change over the long-term. Sustained behaviour change to keep pandemics
   at bay is much more likely to emerge from environmental change, so
   governments and policy makers may need to facilitate significant social
   change - such as improving life experiences for disadvantaged groups.},

Title = {The impact of early life antibiotic use on atopic and metabolic

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {279-289},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: The impact of antibiotics use early in life
   on later-in-life morbidities has received substantial attention as
   explanations for atopic and metabolic disorders with a surge as modern
   lifestyle diseases. The objective of this study was to perform
   meta-analyses to determine if antibiotics administration during the
   first 2 years of infant life is associated with increased risks of
   atopic or metabolic disorders later in life.
   Methodology: We screened more than 100 English-language prospective and
   retrospective studies published between January 2002 and March 2020 and
   assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. We performed
   overall and subgroup meta-analyses on 31 high-quality comparable studies
   on atopic and 23 on metabolic disorders, involving more than 3.5 million
   children.
   Results: Antibiotic exposure prenatally and during the first 2 years of
   life significantly impacts the risk of developing atopic and metabolic
   disorders. Exposure during the first 6 months of life appears most
   critical, consistent with this being the time when the microbiome is
   most susceptible to irreversible perturbations. The presence of
   dose-response associations and stronger impacts of broad-than
   narrow-spectrum antibiotics further point to effects being mediated by
   microbiota-induced changes.
   Conclusions and implications: Our findings support that antibiotics use
   is a mismatch to modernity that can negatively affect the symbiotic
   associations we rely on for proper immune function and metabolism.
   Improving our understanding of these associations, the underlying
   proximate mechanisms and the impact of antibiotics use on future
   human-symbiont evolution will be important to improve human health.
   Lay Summary: The use of antibiotics in infancy has been suggested to
   increase the risks of atopic and metabolic disorders later in life.
   Through meta-analyses of more than 100 studies of >3.5 million children,
   we confirm these risks, and show that patterns are consistent with
   effects being due to microbiota-driven changes.},

   outcomes among a population of traditional pastoralists, the Turkana of
   northwest Kenya, who are currently transitioning toward a more urban,
   market-integrated lifestyle. We assessed whether wealth associations
   with health differed in subsistence-level versus urban contexts. We also
   explored the causes and consequences of wealth-health associations by
   measuring serum cortisol, potential sociobehavioral mediators in early
   life and adulthood, and adult reproductive success (number of surviving
   offspring).
   Results: Higher socioeconomic status and greater material wealth
   predicts better self-reported health and more offspring in traditional
   pastoralist Turkana, but worse cardiometabolic health and fewer
   offspring in urban Turkana. We do not find robust evidence for either
   direct biological mediators (cortisol) or indirect sociobehavioral
   mediators (e.g. adult diet or health behaviors, early life experiences)
   of wealth-health relationships in either context.
   Conclusions and implications: While social gradients in health are
   well-established in humans and animals across a variety of
   socioecological contexts, we show that the relationship between wealth
   and health can vary within a single population. Our findings emphasize
   that changes in economic and societal circumstances may directly alter
   how, why and under what conditions socioeconomic status predicts health.
   Lay Summary: High socioeconomic status predicts better health and more
   offspring in traditional Turkana pastoralists, but worse health and
   fewer offspring in individuals of the same group living in urban areas.
   Together, our study shows that under different economic and societal
   circumstances, wealth effects on health may manifest in very different
   ways.},

Title = {Anthropometrics of Estonian children in relation to family disruption
   Thrifty phenotype and Trivers-Willard effects},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {276-286},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposes
   that at resource limitation, the growth of some organs/tissues is
   selectively spared to preserve more critical ones, such as the brain or
   lungs. The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH) predicts that boys are more
   vulnerable in the case of resource limitation than girls. Both
   hypotheses were tested in children from disrupted families, differing in
   the extent of deprivation/adversities imposed on them.
   Methodology: In a retrospective cohort study in the mid-20th century
   Estonia (Juhan Aul's database), different types of orphans and children
   of divorced parents (treatment groups; n = 106-1401) were compared with
   children from bi-parental families (control groups; n = 2548-8648) so
   that children from treatment groups were matched with control children
   on the basis of sex, age, year of birth, urban versus rural origin and
   socioeconomic position.
   Results: Children in orphanages suffered strong growth suppression, best
   explained by psychosocial deprivation. Their feet were on average 0.5 SD
   shorter than the feet of the controls, followed by height, leg/torso
   ratio and cranial volume that differed from controls by ca 0.4 SD.
   Weight difference was 0.2 SD units, while body mass index did not differ
   from controls. The growth of boys and girls in orphanages was suppressed
   to the same extent. Boys whose mothers were dead were relatively smaller
   and less masculine than girls from such families. Fathers' absence was
   unrelated to growth suppression. Sons of divorced parents had broader
   shoulders than boys whose fathers were dead.
   Conclusions and implications: Prediction of TWH about the greater
   vulnerability of male growth may hold under some conditions but not
   universally. Predictions of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis were partly
   supported: trunk growth was spared at the expense of leg growth;
   however, no evidence for brain sparing was found. Comparison of children
   of divorced versus dead fathers may appear useful for indirect
   assessment of sexual selection on offspring quality.
   Lay Summary: Boys and girls in orphanages suffered similarly strong
   growth suppression, best explained by psychosocial deprivation. Boys
   whose mothers were dead were relatively smaller and less masculine than
   girls from such families. The occurrence of sex-specific associations
   between family structure and children's growth depends on the type of
   family disruption.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Some vaccines, such as diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis
   vaccines (aPVs), may favor the emergence of less pathogenic strains of
   the respective bacteria they target. This review discusses the impact of
   the wide use of aPV on Bordetella pertussis phenotype evolutions and
   their beneficial consequences in the light of the diphtheria toxoid
   immunization program experience and structuring evidence review in a
   causal analysis following Bradford Hill's causality criteria. All aPVs
   contain the pertussis toxin (PT), the main virulence factor of
   B.pertussis, alone or with one adhesin (filamentous hemagglutinin
   (FHA)), two adhesins (FHA and pertactin (PRN)) or four adhesins (FHA,
   PRN and two fimbriae (Fim 2/3)). In countries where the coverage of aPVs
   containing PRN is high, PRN negative B.pertussis isolates are increasing
   in prevalence, but isolates nonproducing the other antigens are rarely
   reported. We hypothesize that the selective pressure at play with PRN
   should exist against all aVP antigens, although detection biases may
   hinder its detection for other antigens, especially PT. PT being
   responsible for clinically frank cases of the disease, the opportunity
   to collect PT negative isolates is far lower than to collect PRN
   negative isolates which have a limited clinical impact. The replacement
   of the current B.pertussis by far less pathogenic isolates no longer
   producing the factors contained in aPVs should be expected as a
   consequence of the wide aPV use.
   Lay Summary Reviewing the existing evidence, we hypothesize that
   acellular whooping cough vaccines induced selective pressure on the
   bacteria causing whooping cough. To survive the bacteria must stop the
   production of virulence factors targeted by the vaccine that should
   decrease the severity of the disease and jeopardize the detection of the
   bacteria.},

Title = {The evolution of the human healthcare system and implications for
   understanding our responses to COVID-19},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed an urgent need for a comprehensive,
   multidisciplinary understanding of how healthcare systems respond
   successfully to infectious pathogens-and how they fail. This study
   contributes a novel perspective that focuses on the selective pressures
   that shape healthcare systems over evolutionary time. We use a
   comparative approach to trace the evolution of care-giving and disease
   control behaviours across species and then map their integration into
   the contemporary human healthcare system. Self-care and pro-health
   environmental modification are ubiquitous across animals, while derived
   behaviours like care for kin, for strangers, and group-level
   organizational responses have evolved via different selection pressures.
   We then apply this framework to our behavioural responses to COVID-19
   and demonstrate that three types of conflicts are occurring: (1)
   conflicting selection pressures on individuals, (2) evolutionary
   mismatches between the context in which our healthcare behaviours
   evolved and our globalized world of today and (3) evolutionary
   displacements in which older forms of care are currently dispensed
   through more derived forms. We discuss the significance of understanding
   how healthcare systems evolve and change for thinking about the role of
   healthcare systems in society during and after the time of COVID-19-and
   for us as a species as we continue to face selection from infectious
   diseases.
   Lay Summary The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need to understand how
   healthcare systems respond successfully to pathogens - and how they
   fail. To understand this problem, we develop a novel evolutionary
   approach which can be applied across species. We trace the evolution of
   care-giving and disease control behaviours across species, mapping out
   how they likely integrated in our lineage to form the foundation of the
   healthcare systems we have today. We then use our evolutionary
   perspective to analyse our behavioural responses to COVID-19 and find
   that three types of evolutionary conflicts are occurring that make our
   healthcare systems vulnerable to failure: 1) conflicting selection
   pressures on individuals, 2) mismatches between the context in which our
   healthcare behaviours evolved and our globalised world of today and 3)
   displacements in which evolutionarily older forms of care are dispensed
   through more recently evolved forms. This paper presents the first
   theoretical framework for tracking the evolution of healthcare systems
   across species. It has implications for understanding our responses to
   COVID-19 and for thinking about the role of healthcare going forward.},

Abstract = {Lay Summary We explored whether mothers with lower socio-economic and
   reproductive capital were more likely to give birth to girls than to
   boys. We found that girls were more likely than boys to be born to
   mothers with markers of reduced human capital, which has implications
   for their future health and fitness.
   Background and objectives Evolutionary research on the sex ratio at
   birth (SRB) has focused on explaining variability within and between
   populations, and whether parental fitness is maximized by producing
   daughters or sons. We tested predictors of SRB in a low-income setting,
   to understand whether girls differ from boys in their likelihood of
   being born into families with the capacity to invest in them, which has
   implications for their future health and fitness. Methodology We used
   data from a cluster randomized control trial from lowland rural Nepal
   (16 115 mother-child dyads). We applied principal component analysis to
   extract two composite indices reflecting maternal socio-economic and
   reproductive (parity, age) capital. We fitted mixed-effects logistic
   regression models to estimate odds ratios of having a girl in
   association with these individual factors and indices. Results The SRB
   was 112. Compared to the global reference SRB (105), there were seven
   missing girls per 100 boys. Uneducated, early-marrying, poorer and
   shorter mothers were more likely to give birth to girls. Analysing
   composite maternal indices, lower socio-economic and reproductive
   capital were independently associated with a greater likelihood of
   having a girl. Conclusions and implications In this population, girls
   start life facing composite disadvantages, being more likely than boys
   to be born to mothers with lower socio-economic status and reproductive
   capital. Both physiological and behavioural mechanisms may contribute to
   these epidemiological associations. Differential early exposure by sex
   to maternal factors may underpin intergenerational cycles of gender
   inequality, mediated by developmental trajectory, education and
   socio-economic status.},

Abstract = {The severity of COVID-19 is age-related, with the advantage going to
   younger age-groups. Five reasons are presented. The first two are
   well-known, are being actively researched by the broader medical
   community, and therefore are discussed only briefly here. The third,
   fourth and fifth reasons derive from evolutionary life history theory,
   and potentially fill gaps in current understanding of why and how young
   and old age-groups respond differently to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Age
   of onset of generalized somatic aging and the timing of its progression
   are identified as important causes of these disparities, as are specific
   antagonistic pleiotropic tradeoffs in immune system function.

Abstract = {As global obesity rates continue to rise, it is important to understand
   the origin, role and range of human variation of body mass index (BMI)
   in assessing health and healthcare. A growing body of evidence suggests
   that BMI is a poor indicator of health across populations, and that
   there may be a metabolically healthy obese phenotype. Here, we review
   the reasons why BMI is an inadequate tool for assessing cardiometabolic
   health. We then suggest that cold climate adaptations may also render
   BMI an uninformative metric. Underlying evolutionary and environmental
   drivers may allow for heat conserving larger body sizes without
   necessarily increasing metabolic health risks. However, there may also
   be a potential mismatch between modern obesogenic environments and
   adaptations to cold climates, highlighting the need to further
   investigate the potential for metabolically healthy obese phenotypes
   among circumpolar and other populations as well as the broader meaning
   for metabolic health.
   Lay Summary Global obesity rates are on the rise; however, body mass
   index (BMI) is a poor indicator of metabolic health. Here, we propose
   that cold climate populations may exhibit high BMIs, but relatively
   healthy metabolic profiles (metabolically healthy obesity) due to
   environmental and evolutionary pressures associated with inhabiting a
   cold climate.},

Abstract = {Background Violence against women is often studied in the context of
   violence from intimate partners. However, women receive violence from a
   wider range of individuals-such as their natal kin-including their
   siblings, parents, uncles and cousins. Applying insights from
   evolutionary theory, we examine whether cousin marriage, which has been
   hypothesized to both reduce the risk of partner violence but increase
   the risk of natal family violence, associates differently with each type
   of violence. Second, we test whether common risk factors for partner
   violence, such as wealth, associate similarly with natal violence.
   Methodology We analyse over 16 000 Jordanian women from three cohorts of
   the Jordan Demographic Health Surveys. Predictor variables include type
   of cousin marriage (patrilateral or matrilateral), education, wealth,
   number of children, urban living and polygyny. Outcome variables include
   whether a woman's husband or her natal family has ever been physically
   violent towards her. Results Being married to a patrilateral cousin but
   not a matrilateral cousin is associated with a reduced risk of reporting
   intimate partner violence (IPV). By contrast being married to a
   matrilateral cousin but not a patrilateral one is associated with a
   reduced risk of reporting natal family violence. As expected, wealth is
   negatively associated with reporting partner violence, but we find no
   association with reports of natal family violence. Finally, individuals
   with more children are more likely to report IPV. Conclusions and
   implications Findings indicate the importance of distinguishing between
   types of cousin marriage and highlight substantial differences in risk
   factors for intimate partner compared to natal family violence. Lay
   Summary Sociodemographic risk factors, such as wealth, may associate
   differently with intimate partner and natal family violence. Results
   suggest that whether cousin marriage is protective of violence may
   depend on the type of cousin and secondly, that violence can have
   fitness relevant outcomes.},

Title = {Exome sequencing of hepatocellular carcinoma in lemurs identifies

Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in
   prosimians, but the cause of these liver cancers in this group is
   unknown. Characterizing the genetic changes associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma in prosimians may point to possible causes,
   treatments and methods of prevention, aiding conservation efforts that
   are particularly crucial to the survival of endangered lemurs. Although
   genomic studies of cancer in non-human primates have been hampered by a
   lack of tools, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using
   human exome capture reagents across primates. Methodology In this
   proof-of-principle study, we applied human exome capture reagents to
   tumor-normal pairs from five lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma to
   characterize the mutational landscape of this disease in lemurs. Results
   Several genes implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, including
   ARID1A, TP53 and CTNNB1, were mutated in multiple lemurs, and analysis
   of cancer driver genes mutated in these samples identified enrichment of
   genes involved with TP53 degradation and regulation. In addition to
   these similarities with human hepatocellular carcinoma, we also noted
   unique features, including six genes that contain mutations in all five
   lemurs. Interestingly, these genes are infrequently mutated in human
   hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting potential differences in the
   etiology and/or progression of this cancer in lemurs and humans.
   Conclusions and implications Collectively, this pilot study suggests
   that human exome capture reagents are a promising tool for genomic
   studies of cancer in lemurs and other non-human primates. Lay Summary
   Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in prosimians, but the cause
   of these liver cancers is unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we
   applied human DNA sequencing tools to tumor-normal pairs from five
   lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma and compared the lemur mutation
   profiles to those of human hepatocellular carcinomas.},

Title = {Women who breastfeed exhibit cognitive benefits after age 50},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {322-331},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Women who breastfeed may experience long-term
   benefits for their health in addition to the more widely appreciated
   effects on the breastfed child. Breastfeeding may induce long-term
   effects on biopsychosocial systems implicated in brain health. Also, due
   to diminished breastfeeding in the postindustrial era, it is important
   to understand the lifespan implications of breastfeeding for surmising
   maternal phenotypes in our species' collective past. Here, we assess how
   women's breastfeeding history relates to postmenopausal cognitive
   performance.
   Methodology: A convenience sample of Southern California women age 50+
   was recruited via two clinical trials, completed a comprehensive
   neuropsychological test battery and answered a questionnaire about
   reproductive life history. General linear models examined whether
   cognitive domain scores were associated with breastfeeding in depressed
   and non-depressed women, controlling for age, education and ethnicity.
   Results: Women who breastfed exhibited superior performance in the
   domains of Learning, Delayed Recall, Executive Functioning and
   Processing Speed compared to women who did not breastfeed (P-values
   0.0003-0.015). These four domains remained significant in analyses
   limited to non-depressed and parous subsets of the cohort. Among those
   depressed, only Executive Functioning and Processing Speed were
   positively associated with breastfeeding.
   Conclusions and implications: We add to the growing list of lifespan
   health correlates of breastfeeding for women's health, such as the lower
   risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. We
   surmise that women's postmenopausal cognitive competence may have been
   greater in past environments in which breastfeeding was more prevalent,
   bolstering the possibility that postmenopausal longevity may have been
   adaptive across human evolutionary history.
   Lay Summary: Breastfeeding may affect women's cognitive performance.
   Breastfeeding's biological effects and psychosocial effects, such as
   improved stress regulation, could exert long-term benefits for the
   mother's brain. We found that women who breastfed performed better on a
   series of cognitive tests in later life compared to women who did not
   breastfeed.},

Title = {Reinterpreting patterns of variation in human thyroid function An
   evolutionary ecology perspective},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-112},
Abstract = {Two hundred million people worldwide experience some form of thyroid
   disorder, with women being especially at risk. However, why human
   thyroid function varies between populations, individuals, and across the
   lifespan has attracted little research to date. This limits our ability
   to evaluate the conditions under which patterns of variation in thyroid
   function are best understood as `normal' or `pathological'. In this
   review, we aim to spark interest in research aimed at understanding the
   causes of variation in thyroid phenotypes. We start by assessing the
   biomedical literature on thyroid imbalance to discuss the validity of
   existing reference intervals for diagnosis and treatment across
   individuals and populations. We then propose an evolutionary ecological
   framework for understanding the phylogenetic, genetic, ecological,
   developmental, and physiological causes of normal variation in thyroid
   function. We build on this approach to suggest testable predictions for
   how environmental challenges interact with individual circumstances to
   influence the onset of thyroid disorders. We propose that dietary
   changes, ecological disruptions of co-evolutionary processes during
   pregnancy and with pathogens, emerging infections, and exacerbated
   stress responses can contribute to explaining the onset of thyroid
   diseases. For patients to receive the best personalized care, research
   into the causes of thyroid variation at multiple levels is needed.
   Lay summary: Thyroid hormone reference intervals-used to determine
   normal thyroid function -currently don't take into account many
   significant factors that can cause variation in thyroid hormone levels.
   These factors include age, sex, ethnicity, season, time of day, iodine
   content in the diet, socioeconomic status, stress levels, body
   composition, immune status, menstrual cycle phase, and overall health
   status. This paper shows how early life experiences as well as short
   term stressors may affect variation in thyroid function. These are
   energetic challenges to which the thyroid physiology can respond to. Our
   investigation shows that much variation in thyroid function is natural.
   It may result from a complex interplay of evolutionary, genetic,
   developmental, and physiological factors in response to energetic
   challenges in the environment, beyond what is currently considered in
   biomedicine. A new research agenda for thyroid health should explore the
   way that diversity in thyroid function has evolved as a response to
   different contexts people live in-like focusing on how people's
   metabolisms adapt to the energetic requirements of their environments.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives To understand how organisms evolve, it is
   fundamental to study how mutations emerge and establish. Here, we
   estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and
   investigated the repeatability of its evolution when facing a new cell
   type but no immune or drug pressures. Methodology We performed
   experimental evolution with two strains of SARS-CoV-2, one carrying the
   originally described spike protein (CoV-2-D) and another carrying the
   D614G mutation that has spread worldwide (CoV-2-G). After 15 passages in
   Vero cells and whole genome sequencing, we characterized the spectrum
   and rate of the emerging mutations and looked for evidences of selection
   across the genomes of both strains. Results From the frequencies of the
   mutations accumulated, and excluding the genes with signals of
   selection, we estimate a spontaneous mutation rate of 1.3 x 10(-6) +/-
   0.2 x 10(-6) per-base per-infection cycle (mean across both lineages of
   SARS-CoV-2 +/- 2SEM). We further show that mutation accumulation is
   larger in the CoV-2-D lineage and heterogeneous along the genome,
   consistent with the action of positive selection on the spike protein,
   which accumulated five times more mutations than the corresponding
   genomic average. We also observe the emergence of mutators in the
   CoV-2-G background, likely linked to mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA
   polymerase and/or in the error-correcting exonuclease protein.
   Conclusions and implications These results provide valuable information
   on how spontaneous mutations emerge in SARS-CoV-2 and on how selection
   can shape its genome toward adaptation to new environments. Lay Summary:
   Each time a virus replicates inside a cell, errors (mutations) occur.
   Here, via laboratory propagation in cells originally isolated from the
   kidney epithelium of African green monkeys, we estimated the rate at
   which the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates-an important parameter for
   understanding how it can evolve within and across humans. We also
   confirm the potential of its Spike protein to adapt to a new environment
   and report the emergence of mutators-viral populations where mutations
   occur at a significantly faster rate.},

Abstract = {Background High rates of tuberculosis (TB) in migrants from Tibet and
   Nepal have been documented for over 120 years and were previously
   ascribed to poor living conditions in the places of settlement.
   Adaptations to altitude involving genes in the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor
   pathway are present in 90-95\% of Tibetans and in Nepalis these allele
   frequencies increase by 17\% with each 1000 m increase in altitude.
   Methods We calculated the incidence of TB by country of origin in
   immigrants from South and East Asia in New South Wales (NSW), Australia
   between 2004 and 2018, and compared disease severity, site of infection,
   evidence of local transmission and prevalence of latent TB, among these
   groups. Results The incidence of active TB was consistently higher among
   30 000 Nepalese and 1000 Tibetans than among all other immigrants to
   NSW. Nepal was the only country of origin where TB incidence in
   immigrants was not significantly lower than the reported TB incidence in
   the country of origin. Conclusions and implications High rates of TB
   among Nepalese and Tibetan immigrants in Australia are unlikely to be
   attributable to pre-existing disease or local acquisition. Phenotypic
   effects of high-altitude adaptations may include a dampening of
   inflammatory responses to hypoxia, an effect unmasked by descent to a
   normoxic environment. A corollary of these findings may be that
   hypoxia-induced inflammation limits TB progression, reconfirming
   previous explanations for the apparent efficacy of high-altitude
   sanatoria. If vindicated by subsequent research, these provisional
   findings could open new avenues into preventive and host-directed
   interventions for tuberculosis. Lay Summary The incidence of
   tuberculosis among Nepalese immigrants to Australia and other people of
   Tibetan heritage who migrate to lower altitudes is very high. In these
   screened populations, pre-existing active TB or locally acquired
   infection are unlikely explanations. We suggest that adaptations to
   altitude combined with descent to higher oxygen levels in air at sea
   level may be contributing factors.},

Abstract = {Studies of living children demonstrate that early life stress impacts
   linear growth outcomes. Stresses affecting linear growth may also impact
   later life health outcomes, including increased cardiometabolic disease
   risk. Palaeopathologists also assess the growth of children recovered
   from bioarchaeological contexts. Early life stresses are inferred to
   affect linear growth outcomes, and measurements of skeletal linear
   dimensions alongside other bioarchaeological information may indicate
   the types of challenges faced by past groups. In clinical settings, the
   impacts of stress on growing children are typically measured by
   examining height. Palaeopathologists are limited to examining bone
   dimensions directly and must grapple with incomplete pictures of
   childhood experiences that may affect growth. Palaeopathologists may use
   clinical growth studies to inform observations among past children;
   however, there may be issues with this approach. Here, we review the
   relationship between contemporary and palaeopathological studies of
   child and adolescent growth. We identify approaches to help bridge the
   gap between palaeopathological and biomedical growth studies. We
   advocate for: the creation of bone-specific growth reference information
   using medical imaging and greater examination of limb proportions; the
   inclusion of children from different global regions and life
   circumstances in contemporary bone growth studies; and greater
   collaboration and dialogue between palaeopathologists and clinicians as
   new studies are designed to assess linear growth past and present. We
   advocate for building stronger bridges between these fields to improve
   interpretations of growth patterns across human history and to
   potentially improve interventions for children living and growing today.

Title = {Greater chronic morbidity is associated with greater fatigue in six

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Human susceptibility to chronic
   non-communicable disease may be explained, in part, by mismatches
   between our evolved biology and contemporary environmental conditions.
   Disease-induced fatigue may function to reduce physical activity during
   acute infection, thereby making more energy available to mount an
   effective immune response. However, fatigue in the context of chronic
   disease may be maladaptive because long-term reductions in physical
   activity increase risks of disease progression and the acquisition of
   additional morbidities. Here, we test whether cumulative chronic
   morbidity is associated with subjective fatigue. Methodology We
   constructed a cumulative chronic morbidity score using self-reported
   diagnoses and algorithm-based assessments, and a subjective fatigue
   score based on four questionnaire items using cross-sectional survey
   data from the Study on global AGEing and adult health, which features
   large samples of adults from six countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico,
   Russia and South Africa). Results In a mixed-effects linear model with
   participants nested in countries (N = 32 455), greater cumulative
   chronic morbidity is associated with greater subjective fatigue (beta =
   0.34, SE = 0.005, P < 2e-16). This association replicates within each
   country and is robust to adjustment for key sociodemographic and
   physical covariates (sex, age, household wealth, physical function
   score, habitual physical activity, BMI and BMI2). Conclusions and
   implications Fatigue is a common but perhaps maladaptive
   neuropsychological response to chronic morbidity. Disease-induced
   fatigue may mediate a self-perpetuating cycle, in which chronic
   morbidity reduces physical activity, and less physical activity
   increases cumulative chronic morbidity. Longitudinal research is needed
   to test whether chronic morbidity, fatigue and physical activity form a
   cyclical feedback loop. Lay Summary: Fatigue during acute illness may
   promote recovery, but persistent fatigue in the context of chronic
   disease may make matters worse. We present evidence from six countries
   that more chronic disease is associated with more fatigue. This fatigue
   may reduce physical activity, which increases risks of acquiring
   additional chronic health problems.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives Humans co-evolved with pathogens, especially
   helminths, that educate the immune system during development and lower
   inflammatory responses. The absence of such stimuli in industrialized
   countries is associated with higher baseline levels of C-reactive
   protein (CRP) among adults who appear at greater risk for inflammatory
   disorders. This cross-sectional study examined effects of early life
   development on salivary CRP levels in 452 British-Bangladeshis who spent
   varying periods growing up in Bangladesh or UK. We also analyzed how
   gender and central obesity modulate effects on CRP. We hypothesized
   that: (i) first-generation Bangladeshis with higher childhood exposure
   to pathogens would have chronically lower CRP levels than
   second-generation British-Bangladeshis; (ii) effects would be greater
   with early childhoods in Bangladesh; (iii) effects by gender would
   differ; and (iv) increasing obesity would mitigate early life effects.
   Methodology Saliva samples were assayed for CRP using ELISAs, and
   anthropometric data collected. Participants completed questionnaires
   about demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health histories. Data
   were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results First-generation
   migrants who spent early childhoods in mostly rural, unhygienic areas,
   and moved to UK after age 8, had lower salivary CRP compared to the
   second-generation. Effects differed by gender, while waist circumference
   predicted higher CRP levels. CRP increased with years in UK, alongside
   growing obesity. Conclusions and implications Our study supports the
   hypothesis that pathogen exposure in early life lowers inflammatory
   responses in adults. However, protective effects differed by gender and
   can be eroded by growing obesity across the life course which elevates
   risks for other inflammatory disorders. Lay Summary: Migrants to the UK
   who spent early childhoods in less hygienic environments in Bangladesh
   that help to educate their immune systems had lower levels of the
   inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to migrants who
   grew up in UK. Both gender and increasing obesity were associated with
   increased levels of CRP.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives Social and behavioral non-pharmaceutical
   interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing, social distancing and travel
   restrictions, as well as diagnostic tests, have been broadly implemented
   in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiological models and data
   analysis affirm that wide adoption of NPIs helps to control the
   pandemic. However, SARS-CoV-2 has extensively demonstrated its ability
   to evolve. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how NPIs may affect the
   evolution of the virus. Such evolution could have important effects on
   the spread and impact of the pandemic. Methodology We used
   evo-epidemiological models to examine the effect of NPIs and testing on
   two evolutionary trajectories for SARS-CoV-2: attenuation and test
   evasion. Results Our results show that when stronger measures are taken,
   selection may act to reduce disease severity. Additionally, the timely
   application of NPIs could significantly affect the competition between
   viral strains, favoring the milder strain. Furthermore, a higher testing
   rate can select for a test-evasive viral strain, even if that strain is
   less infectious than the detectable competing strain. Importantly, if a
   less detectable strain evolves, epidemiological metrics such as
   confirmed daily cases may distort our assessment of the pandemic.

Abstract = {Lay Summary The community of microorganisms in the mouth (oral
   microbiota) has recently been linked to several chronic diseases that
   disproportionately impact Indigenous Australians. In this study, oral
   microbiota differ significantly between Indigenous Australians and
   non-Indigenous counterparts, suggesting the microbiota could be a novel
   factor with the potential to improve Indigenous health outcomes.
   Background and objectives Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait
   Islanders (hereafter respectfully referred to as Indigenous Australians)
   experience a high burden of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
   Increased NCD risk is linked to oral diseases mediated by the oral
   microbiota, a microbial community influenced by both vertical
   transmission and lifestyle factors. As an initial step towards
   understanding the oral microbiota as a factor in Indigenous health, we
   present the first investigation of oral microbiota in Indigenous
   Australian adults. Methodology Dental calculus samples from Indigenous
   Australians with periodontal disease (PD; n = 13) and non-Indigenous
   individuals both with (n = 19) and without PD (n = 20) were
   characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha
   and beta diversity, differentially abundant microbial taxa and taxa
   unique to different participant groups were analysed using QIIME2.
   Results Samples from Indigenous Australians were more phylogenetically
   diverse (Kruskal-Wallis H = 19.86, P = 8.3 x 10(-6)), differed
   significantly in composition from non-Indigenous samples (PERMANOVA
   pseudo-F = 10.42, P = 0.001) and contained a relatively high proportion
   of unique taxa not previously reported in the human oral microbiota
   (e.g. Endomicrobia). These patterns were robust to stratification by PD
   status. Oral microbiota diversity and composition also differed between
   Indigenous individuals living in different geographic regions.
   Conclusions and implications Indigenous Australians may harbour unique
   oral microbiota shaped by their long relationships with Country
   (ancestral homelands). Our findings have implications for understanding
   the origins of oral and systemic NCDs and for the inclusion of
   Indigenous peoples in microbiota research, highlighting the microbiota
   as a novel field of enquiry to improve Indigenous health.},

Abstract = {Childbirth is commonly viewed as difficult in human females, encompassed
   by the `Obstetrical Dilemma' (OD) described by early
   palaeoanthropologists as an evolved trade-off between a narrow pelvis
   necessitated by bipedalism and a large-brained fetal head. The OD has
   been challenged on several grounds. We add to these challenges by
   suggesting humans likely squatted regularly during routine tasks prior
   to the advent of farming societies and use of seats. We suggest that
   habitual squatting, together with taller stature and better nutrition of
   ancestral hunter-gatherers compared with later Neolithic and industrial
   counterparts, obviated an OD. Instead, difficulties with parturition may
   have arisen much later in our history, accompanying permanent
   settlements, poorer nutrition, greater infectious disease loads and
   negligible squatting in daily life. We discuss bioarchaeological and
   contemporary data that support these viewpoints, suggest ways in which
   this hypothesis might be tested further and consider its implications
   for obstetrical practice.
   Lay Summary Human childbirth is viewed as universally difficult.
   Evidence from physical therapies/engineering and studies of living and
   ancestral humans illustrates habitual squatting widens the pelvis and
   could improve childbirth outcomes. Obstetrical difficulties emerged late
   in prehistory accompanying settled agriculture, poorer nutrition and
   less squatting. Specific physical exercises could improve obstetrical
   practice.},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Individuals who experience early life
   adversity are at an increased risk for chronic disease later in life.
   Less is known about how early life factors are associated with cancer
   susceptibility. Here, we use a life history framework to test whether
   early life adversity increases the risk of breast cancer. We predict
   that early life adversity can shift investment in somatic maintenance
   and accelerate the timing of reproduction, which may mediate or interact
   with the risk of breast cancer. Methodology We use population-wide data
   from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) and Utah Cancer Registry,
   leading to 24 957 cases of women diagnosed with breast cancer spanning
   20 years (1990-2010) and 124 785 age-matched controls. We generated a
   cumulative early life adversity summation score to evaluate the
   interaction (moderation) and mediation between early life adversity,
   reproductive history and their association with breast cancer risk.
   Results Our analyses led to three key findings: (i) more early life
   adversity, when considered as a main effect, accelerates the time to
   first birth and death, (ii) early age at first birth and high parity
   decreases the risk of breast cancer and (iii) we find no association
   between early adversity and breast cancer risk either as a main effect
   or in its interaction with reproductive history. Conclusion and
   implications Early adversity elevates the risk of overall mortality
   through mechanisms other than breast cancer risk. This suggests early
   life factors can generate different effects on health. Future work
   should incorporate more complex view of life history patterns, including
   multiple life stages, when making predictions about cancer
   susceptibility.
   Lay Summary Previous work has shown that childhood adversity can
   contribute to poor health later in life. We tested whether childhood
   adversity was associated with increased risk of breast cancer in US
   women. We found that childhood adversity was associated with earlier age
   at first birth but not higher breast cancer risk.},

Title = {Socioeconomic impacts on Andean adolescents' growth Variation between
   households, between communities and over time},

Abstract = {Lay Summary Andean adolescents exhibited elevated rates of stunting;
   their height varied with socioeconomic status within and between
   high-altitude communities. Unlike some lowland populations, the
   prevalence of overweight/obesity was not elevated. Population-specific
   growth assessments and targeted interventions (e.g. maternal education
   and employment) are likely to help alleviate disparities in Andean
   children's growth.
   Background/Objectives We evaluated potential socioeconomic contributors
   to variation in Andean adolescents' growth between households within a
   peri-urban community undergoing rapid demographic and economic change,
   between different community types (rural, peri-urban, urban) and over
   time. Because growth monitoring is widely used for assessing community
   needs and progress, we compared the prevalences of stunting,
   underweight, and overweight estimated by three different growth
   references. Methods Anthropometrics of 101 El Alto, Bolivia, adolescents
   (Altenos), 11.0-14.9 years old in 2003, were compared between households
   (economic status assessed by parental occupations); to one urban and two
   rural samples collected in 1983/1998/1977, respectively; and to the WHO
   growth reference, a representative sample of Bolivian children (MESA),
   and a region-wide sample of high-altitude Peruvian children (Puno).
   Results Female Altenos' growth was positively associated with household
   and maternal income indices. Altenos' height averaged similar to
   0.8SD/similar to 0.6SD/similar to 2SDs greater than adolescents' height
   in urban and rural communities measured in 1983/1998/1977, respectively.
   Overweight prevalence was comparable to the WHO, and lower than MESA and
   Puno, references. Stunting was 8.5/2.5/0.5 times WHO/MESA/Puno samples,
   respectively. Conclusions/Implications Both peri-urban conditions and
   temporal trends contributed to gains in Altenos' growth. Rural
   out-migration can alleviate migrants' poverty, partly because of more
   diverse economic options in urbanized communities, especially for women.
   Nonetheless, Altenos averaged below WHO and MESA height and weight
   medians. Evolved biological adaptations to environmental challenges, and
   the consequent variability in growth trajectories, favor using multiple
   growth references. Growth monitoring should be informed by community-
   and household-level studies to detect and understand local factors
   causing or alleviating health disparities.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {374-382},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: The suspicion that a population stressor as
   profound as the COVID-19 pandemic would increase preterm birth among
   cohorts in gestation at its outset has not been supported by data
   collected in 2020. An evolutionary perspective on this circumstance
   suggests that natural selection in utero, induced by the onset of the
   pandemic, caused pregnancies that would otherwise have produced a
   preterm birth to end early in gestation as spontaneous abortions. We
   test this possibility using the odds of a live-born twin among male
   births in Norway as an indicator of the depth of selection in birth
   cohorts.
   Methodology: We apply Box-Jenkins methods to 50 pre-pandemic months to
   estimate counterfactuals for the nine birth cohorts in gestation in
   March 2020 when the first deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection
   occurred in Norway. We use Alwan and Roberts outlier detection methods
   to discover any sequence of outlying values in the odds of a live-born
   twin among male births in exposed birth cohorts.
   Results: We find a downward level shift of 27\% in the monthly odds of a
   twin among male births beginning in May and persisting through the
   remainder of 2020.
   Conclusions and implications: Consistent with evolutionary theory and
   selection in utero, birth cohorts exposed in utero to the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic yielded fewer male twins than expected.
   Lay Summary: Our finding of fewer than expected male twin births during
   the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic provides more evidence that evolution
   continues to affect the characteristics and health of contemporary
   populations.},

Pages = {83-92},
Abstract = {Since the identification of severe illness caused by the novel
   coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the role of the host immune system in causing
   disease has attracted widespread attention, along with intense interest
   in medical interventions that target the host immune response. A wide
   variety of agents have been proposed to treat a cytokine storm in
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but so far, only one class of
   medications, corticosteroids, has proved useful. In recent decades,
   experimental therapies for cytokine storms have been tried and mostly
   failed to help patients with severe sepsis and other infections. We
   summarize this history in order to frame expectations for novel
   interventions in COVID-19 and to bring an evolutionary medicine
   perspective to the concept of cytokine storms and their treatment.
   Lay Summary: Many treatments for COVID-19 are aimed at calming a
   cytokine storm, a dangerous immune overreaction to the infection.
   Treating cytokine storms has been tried for decades in sepsis and other
   viral illnesses, but these treatments most often do not work. We explain
   why cytokine storms should be rare, and what special evolutionary
   circumstances can cause them to occur.},

Abstract = {Dietary patterns spanning millennia could inform contemporary public

   diets throughout human evolution, despite prevalent malnutrition today
   signaling a potential genome-environment divergence. This systematic
   review aimed to identify dietary patterns of children ages 6 months to

   of mention frequency (counts of food types reported) and food groups
   (globally standardized categories) were applied to: compare diets across
   subsistence modes {[}gatherer-hunter-fisher (GHF), early agriculture
   (EA) groups]; examine diet quality and diversity; and characterize
   differences by life course phase and environmental context defined using
   Koppen-Geiger climate zones. The review yielded child diet information
   from 95 cultural groups (52 from GHF; 43 from EA/mixed subsistence
   groups). Animal foods (terrestrial and aquatic) were the most frequently
   mentioned food groups in dietary patterns across subsistence modes,
   though at higher frequencies in GHF than in EA. A broad range of fruits,
   vegetables, roots and tubers were more common in GHF, while children
   from EA groups consumed more cereals than GHF, associated with poor
   health consequences as reported in some studies. Forty-eight studies
   compared diets across life course phases: 28 showed differences and 20
   demonstrated similarities in child versus adult diets. Climate zone was
   a driver of food patterns provisioned from local ecosystems. Evidence
   from Homo sapiens evolution points to the need for nutrient-dense foods
   with high quality proteins and greater variety within and across food
   groups. Public health solutions could integrate these findings into
   food-based dietary guidelines for children.
   Lay Summary Drawing insights from child dietary patterns of our
   evolutionary past might better inform public health nutrition today.
   This systematic review revealed higher intakes of animal source foods
   (ASF), fruits, roots/tubers, nuts and overall dietary diversity among
   gather-hunter-fisher compared to early agriculture groups. To prevent
   child malnutrition, dietary guidelines might incorporate these findings.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives The human immune system has evolved to balance
   protection against infection with control of immune-mediated damage and
   tolerance of commensal microbes. Such tradeoffs between protection and
   harm almost certainly extend to the immune system of milk. Methodology
   Among breastfeeding mother-infant dyads in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, we
   characterized in vitro proinflammatory milk immune responses to
   Salmonella enterica (an infectious agent) and Escherichia coli (a benign
   target) as the increase in interleukin-6 after 24 h of incubation with
   each bacterium. We characterized incident infectious diseases among
   infants through passive monitoring. We used Cox proportional hazards
   models to describe associations between milk immune activity and infant
   infectious disease. Results Among infants, risk for respiratory
   infections declined with increasing milk in vitro proinflammatory
   response to S. enterica (hazard ratio {[}HR]: 0.68; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.54, 0.86; P: 0.001), while risk for gastrointestinal
   infections increased with increasing milk in vitro proinflammatory
   response to E. coli (HR: 1.44; 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.99; P: 0.022). Milk
   proinflammatory responses to S. enterica and E. coli were positively
   correlated (Spearman's rho: 0.60; P: 0.000). Conclusions and
   implications These findings demonstrate a tradeoff in milk immune
   activity: the benefits of appropriate proinflammatory activity come at
   the hazard of misdirected proinflammatory activity. This tradeoff is
   likely to affect infant health in complex ways, depending on prevailing
   infectious disease conditions. How mother-infant dyads optimize
   proinflammatory milk immune activity should be a central question in
   future ecological-evolutionary studies of the immune system of milk.
   Lay Summary While vital to infant health, the immune system of milk
   (ISOM), like all immune activity, comes with potential for both
   protection and harm. We described the ISOM's capacity to respond to
   bacteria among mother-infant pairs, and found that milk immune activity
   may both lower and increase infants' infectious disease risk.},

Title = {Evolutionary context of psoriatic immune skin response},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {474-486},
Abstract = {The skin is vital for protecting the body and perceiving external
   stimuli in the environment. Ability to adapt between environments is in
   part based on skin phenotypic plasticity, indicating evolved homeostasis
   between skin and environment. This homeostasis reflects the greater
   relationship between the body and the environment, and disruptions in
   this balance may lead to accumulation of susceptibility factors for
   autoimmune conditions like psoriasis. In this study, we examined the
   relationship between rapid, lineage-specific evolution of human skin and
   formation of psoriatic skin responses at the transcriptome level. We
   collected skin tissue biopsies from individuals with psoriasis and
   compared gene expression in psoriatic plaques to non-plaque psoriatic
   skin. We then compared these data with non-psoriatic skin transcriptome
   data from multiple primate species. We found 67 genes showing
   human-specific skin expression that are also differentially regulated in
   psoriatic skin; these genes are significantly enriched for skin barrier
   function, immunity and neuronal development. We identified six gene
   clusters with differential expression in the context of human evolution
   and psoriasis, suggesting underlying regulatory mechanisms in these
   loci. Human and psoriasis-specific enrichment of neuroimmune genes shows
   the importance of the ongoing evolved homeostatic relationship between
   skin and external environment. These results have implications for both
   evolutionary medicine and public health, using transcriptomic data to
   acknowledge the importance of an individual's surroundings on their
   overall health.
   Lay Summary: The skin is important for protecting the body from the
   environment and perceiving external stimuli, creating an evolved balance
   between skin and the environment. We compare skin gene expression in
   humans with psoriasis to humans and non-human primates without psoriasis
   to better understand human-specific evolutionary changes in the skin.
   Our results suggest important evolutionary links between skin
   perception, human-specific skin development and immune response.},

Pages = {420-430},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Ischemic events, such as ischemic heart
   disease and stroke, are the number one cause of death globally. Ischemia
   prevents blood, carrying essential nutrients and oxygen, from reaching
   tissues, leading to cell and tissue death, and eventual organ failure.
   While humans are relatively intolerant to ischemic events, other
   species, such as marine mammals, have evolved a unique tolerance to
   chronic ischemia/reperfusion during apneic diving. To identify possible
   molecular features of an increased tolerance for apnea, we examined
   changes in gene expression in breath-holding dolphins.
   Methodology: Here, we capitalized on the adaptations possesed by
   bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) for diving as a comparative
   model of ischemic stress and hypoxia tolerance to identify molecular
   features associated with breath holding. Given that signals in the blood
   may influence physiological changes during diving, we used RNA-Seq and
   enzyme assays to examine time-dependent changes in gene expression in
   the blood of breath-holding dolphins.
   Results: We observed time-dependent upregulation of the arachidonate
   5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) gene and increased lipoxygenase activity during
   breath holding. ALOX5 has been shown to be activated during hypoxia in
   rodent models, and its metabolites, leukotrienes, induce
   vasoconstriction.
   Conclusions and implications: The upregulation of ALOX5 mRNA occurred
   within the calculated aerobic dive limit of the species, suggesting that
   ALOX5 may play a role in the dolphin's physiological response to diving,
   particularly in a pro-inflammatory response to ischemia and in promoting
   vasoconstriction. These observations pinpoint a potential molecular
   mechanism by which dolphins, and perhaps other marine mammals, respond
   to the prolonged breath holds associated with diving.
   Lay Summary: Reductions in blood flow are associated with tissue damage
   in humans; however, marine mammals have evolved remarkable tolerance to
   reductions in tissue blood flow during diving. We found that changes in
   gene expression in breath-holding dolphins may support a response to
   diving highlighting a potential molecular underpinning for apnea
   tolerance.},

Title = {Evolutionary selection of alleles in the melanophilin gene that impacts
   on prostate organ function and cancer risk},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {311-321},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Several hundred inherited genetic variants or
   SNPs that alter the risk of cancer have been identified through
   genome-wide association studies. In populations of European ancestry,
   these variants are mostly present at relatively high frequencies. To
   gain insight into evolutionary origins, we screened a series of genes
   and SNPs linked to breast or prostate cancer for signatures of
   historical positive selection.
   Methodology: We took advantage of the availability of the 1000 genome
   data and we performed genomic scans for positive selection in five
   different Caucasian populations as well as one African reference
   population. We then used prostate organoid cultures to provide a
   possible functional explanation for the interplay between the action of
   evolutionary forces and the disease risk association.
   Results: Variants in only one gene showed genomic signatures of
   positive, evolutionary selection within Caucasian populations
   melanophilin (MLPH). Functional depletion of MLPH in prostate organoids,
   by CRISPR/Cas9 mutation, impacted lineage commitment of progenitor cells
   promoting luminal versus basal cell differentiation and on resistance to
   androgen deprivation.
   Conclusions and implications: The MLPH variants influencing prostate
   cancer risk may have been historically selected for their adaptive
   benefit on skin pigmentation but MLPH is highly expressed in the
   prostate and the derivative, positively selected, alleles decrease the
   risk of prostate cancer. Our study suggests a potential functional
   mechanism via which MLPH and its genetic variants could influence risk
   of prostate cancer, as a serendipitous consequence of prior evolutionary
   benefits to another tissue.
   Lay Summary: We screened a limited series of genomic variants associated
   with breast and prostate cancer risk for signatures of historical
   positive selection. Variants within the melanophilin (MLPH) gene fell
   into this category. Depletion of MLPH in prostate organoid cultures,
   suggested a potential functional mechanism for impacting on cancer risk,
   as a serendipitous consequence of prior evolutionary benefits to another

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Active infection results in several outward

   signals/cues of health status would vary based on context and
   sociocultural norms.
   Methodology: We explored self-reported, recalled sickness behavior,
   communication style, demographics and theoretically relevant cultural
   factors in a large national US sample (n = 1259) using multinomial
   probit regressions.
   Results: In accordance with predictions, relatively few participants
   were willing to talk or complain about sickness to strangers.
   Self-reported, recalled sickness behavior was associated with some
   communication styles but attention received from others was more
   consistently associated with potential signaling. Several cultural
   factors, including stoicism and traditional machismo, were also
   associated with different sickness signaling styles.
   Conclusions and implications: These preliminary, self-reported data lend
   some tentative support to the sickness behavior signaling hypothesis,
   though experimental or observational support is needed. The role of
   cultural norms in shaping how such signals are transmitted and received
   also deserves further attention as they may have important implications
   for disease transmission.
   Lay Summary: Evolutionary medicine hypothesizes that signs and symptoms
   of infectious disease-including sickness behavior-have adaptive
   functions, one of which might be to reliably signal one's health status
   to others. Our results suggest that evolved signals like these are
   likely shaped by cultural factors.},

Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological autoimmune disorder, has
   recently been linked to neuro-inflammatory influences from the gut. In
   this review, we address the idea that evolutionary mismatches could
   affect the pathogenesis of MS via the gut microbiota. The evolution of
   symbiosis as well as the recent introduction of evolutionary mismatches
   is considered, and evidence regarding the impact of diet on the
   MS-associated microbiota is evaluated. Distinctive microbial community
   compositions associated with the gut microbiota of MS patients are
   difficult to identify, and substantial study-to-study variation and even
   larger variations between individual profiles of MS patients are
   observed. Furthermore, although some dietary changes impact the
   progression of MS, MS-associated features of microbiota were found to be
   not necessarily associated with diet per se. In addition, immune
   function in MS patients potentially drives changes in microbial
   composition directly, in at least some individuals. Finally, assessment
   of evolutionary histories of animals with their gut symbionts suggests
   that the impact of evolutionary mismatch on the microbiota is less
   concerning than mismatches affecting helminths and protists. These
   observations suggest that the benefits of an anti-inflammatory diet for
   patients with MS may not be mediated by the microbiota per se.
   Furthermore, any alteration of the microbiota found in association with
   MS may be an effect rather than a cause. This conclusion is consistent
   with other studies indicating that a loss of complex eukaryotic
   symbionts, including helminths and protists, is a pivotal evolutionary
   mismatch that potentiates the increased prevalence of autoimmunity
   within a population.
   Lay Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with the microbiota in
   some experimental models, and diets that modulate the microbiota may
   help treat MS. However, available data suggest that the beneficial
   effects of healthy diets for MS may be mediated directly by decreasing
   inflammation rather than by altering the gut microbiota composition.},

Title = {An evolutionary explanation for antibiotics' association with increased

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {214-220},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {More than 10 studies have confirmed the association of antibiotic
   overuse with colorectal cancer. The exact cause is unknown, but most
   authors hypothesize that disturbance of colon microbiota is the main
   culprit. In this commentary, an evolutionary explanation is proposed. It
   is well known that antibiotics can induce antibiotic resistance in
   bacteria through selection of mutators-DNA mismatch repair deficient
   (dMMR) strains. Mutators have an increased survival potential due to
   their high mutagenesis rate. Antibiotics can also cause stress in human
   cells. Selection of dMMR colon cells may be advantageous under this
   stress, mimicking selection of bacterial mutators. Concomitantly,
   mismatch repair deficiency is a common cause of cancer, this may explain
   the increased cancer risk after multiple cycles of oral antibiotics.
   This proposed rationale is described in detail, along with supporting
   evidence from the peer-reviewed literature and suggestions for testing
   hypothesis validity. Treatment schemes could be re-evaluated,
   considering toxicity and somatic selection mechanisms. Lay Summary The
   association of antibiotics with colon cancer is well established but of
   unknown cause. Under an evolutionary framework, antibiotics may select
   for stress-resistant cancerous cells that lack mechanisms for DNA
   mismatch repair (MMR). This mimics the selection of antibiotic resistant
   `mutators'-MMR-deficient micro-organisms-highly adaptive due to their
   increased mutagenesis rate.

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {332-337},
Abstract = {Homo sapiens, as well as other primates, developed the evolutionary
   advantage of storing excess energy as body fat, primarily in the readily
   accessible visceral fat compartment when food is plentiful for use
   during scarcity. However, uniquely to female humans, a second transient
   dimorphic phenotypic change begins at menarche and is reversed by
   menopause. It is the diversion of visceral fat stores from the abdominal
   cavity to the gluteofemoral region. The evolutionary purpose for this
   remains unclear. The author proposes the gestational potential space
   hypothesis: that such fat diversion is for the reproductive purpose of
   increasing the potential abdominal space available for gestation and
   reducing the intra-abdominal pressure. This hypothesis is supported by
   the basic laws of physics and increased rates of maternal and fetal
   complications experienced by those with visceral adiposity.
   Lay Summary: The author proposes that fat shifting from the abdominal
   cavity to the hips and thighs in women, during the childbearing period,
   is for the evolutionary benefit of reducing the intra-abdominal contents
   consequently increasing pregnancy potential space. Secondarily, it
   prevents intra-abdominal pressure elevation and reduces maternal and
   fetal complications associated with visceral fat in pregnancy.},

Title = {Species interactions drive the spread of ampicillin resistance in
   human-associated gut microbiota},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {256-266},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Slowing the spread of antimicrobial
   resistance is urgent if we are to continue treating infectious diseases
   successfully. There is increasing evidence microbial interactions
   between and within species are significant drivers of resistance. On one
   hand, cross-protection by resistant genotypes can shelter susceptible
   microbes from the adverse effects of antibiotics, reducing the advantage
   of resistance. On the other hand, antibiotic-mediated killing of
   susceptible genotypes can alleviate competition and allow resistant
   strains to thrive (competitive release). Here, by observing interactions
   both within and between species in microbial communities sampled from
   humans, we investigate the potential role for cross-protection and
   competitive release in driving the spread of ampicillin resistance in
   the ubiquitous gut commensal and opportunistic pathogen Escherichia
   coli.
   Methodology: Using anaerobic gut microcosms comprising E.coli embedded
   within gut microbiota sampled from humans, we tested for
   cross-protection and competitive release both within and between species
   in response to the clinically important beta-lactam antibiotic
   ampicillin.
   Results: While cross-protection gave an advantage to
   antibiotic-susceptible E.coli in standard laboratory conditions
   (well-mixed LB medium), competitive release instead drove the spread of
   antibiotic-resistant E.coli in gut microcosms (ampicillin boosted growth
   of resistant bacteria in the presence of susceptible strains).
   Conclusions and implications: Competition between resistant strains and
   other members of the gut microbiota can restrict the spread of
   ampicillin resistance. If antibiotic therapy alleviates competition with
   resident microbes by killing susceptible strains, as here,
   microbiota-based interventions that restore competition could be a key
   for slowing the spread of resistance.
   Lay Summary: Slowing the spread of global antibiotic resistance is an
   urgent task. In this paper, we ask how interactions between microbial
   species drive the spread of resistance. We show that antibiotic killing
   of susceptible microbes can free up resources for resistant microbes and
   allow them to thrive. Therefore, we should consider microbes in light of
   their social interactions to understand the spread of resistance.},

Title = {Between a hygiene rock and a hygienic hard place Avoiding SARS-CoV-2
   while needing environmental exposures for immunity},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-130},
Abstract = {Suboptimal understanding of concepts related to hygiene by the general
   public, clinicians and researchers is a persistent problem in health and
   medicine. Although hygiene is necessary to slow or prevent deadly
   pandemics of infectious disease such as coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19), hygiene can have unwanted effects. In particular, some
   aspects of hygiene cause a loss of biodiversity from the human body,
   characterized by the almost complete removal of intestinal worms
   (helminths) and protists. Research spanning more than half a century
   documents that this loss of biodiversity results in an increased
   propensity for autoimmune disease, allergic disorders, probably
   neuropsychiatric problems and adverse reactions to infectious agents.
   The differences in immune function between communities with and
   communities without helminths have become so pronounced that the reduced
   lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in
   low-income countries compared to high-income countries was predicted
   early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This prediction, based on the
   maladaptive immune responses observed in many cases of COVID-19 in
   high-income countries, is now supported by emerging data from low-income
   countries. Herein, hygiene is subdivided into components involving
   personal choice versus components instituted by community wide systems
   such as sewage treatment facilities and water treatment plants. The
   different effects of personal hygiene and systems hygiene are described,
   and appropriate measures to alleviate the adverse effects of hygiene
   without losing the benefits of hygiene are discussed. Finally, text
   boxes are provided to function as stand-alone, public-domain handouts
   with the goal of informing the public about hygiene and suggesting
   solutions for biomedical researchers and policy makers.
   Lay Summary: Hygiene related to sewer systems and other technology can
   have adverse effects on immune function, and is distinct from personal
   hygiene practices such as hand washing and social distancing. Dealing
   with the drawbacks of hygiene must be undertaken without compromising
   the protection from infectious disease imposed by hygiene.},

Abstract = {Lay Summary Evidence suggests that mammals harbor trillions of
   microorganisms on and in their bodies. Understanding the ecological and
   evolutionary processes structuring these ecosystems has the potential to
   provide insights relevant to public health and medicine, some of which
   are explored here. Specifically, I examine ways in which the phage
   diversity of non-human primates could be useful for combatting
   antibiotic-resistant infections and understanding disease emergence
   risk. This includes an exploration of ways to select phages for
   therapeutic interventions based on their ecological and evolutionary
   history, as well as how phages might be useful for studying rates of
   microorganism transmission at human-wildlife interfaces. The hope is
   that these frameworks may allow primate-associated phages to be
   incorporated into the arsenal of clinicians.
   Mammals harbor trillions of microorganisms and understanding the
   ecological and evolutionary processes structuring these ecosystems may
   provide insights relevant to public health and medicine. Comparative
   studies with our closest living relatives, non-human primates, have
   provided first insights into their rich bacteriophage communities. Here,
   I discuss how this phage diversity can be useful for combatting
   antibiotic-resistant infections and understanding disease emergence
   risk. For example, some primate-associated phages show a pattern
   suggesting a long-term co-divergence with their primate
   superhosts-co-diverging phages may be more likely to exhibit a narrow
   host range and thus less useful for phage therapy. Captive primates lose
   their natural phageome, which is replaced by human-associated phages
   making phages an exciting tool for studying rates of microorganism
   transmission at human-wildlife interfaces. This commentary tackles
   avenues for selecting phages for therapeutic interventions based on
   their ecological and evolutionary history, while discussing frameworks
   to allow primate-associated phages to be incorporated into the arsenal
   of clinicians.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Immune system evolution is shaped by the fitness costs and trade-offs
   associated with mounting an immune response. Costs that arise mainly as
   a function of the magnitude of investment, including energetic and
   immunopathological costs, are well-represented in studies of immune
   system evolution. Less well considered, however, are the costs of immune
   cell plasticity and specialization. Hosts in nature encounter a large
   diversity of microbes and parasites that require different and sometimes
   conflicting immune mechanisms for defense, but it takes precious time to
   recognize and correctly integrate signals for an effective polarized
   response. In this perspective, we propose that bet-hedging can be a
   viable alternative to plasticity in immune cell effector function,
   discuss conditions under which bet-hedging is likely to be an
   advantageous strategy for different arms of the immune system, and
   present cases from both innate and adaptive immune systems that suggest
   bet-hedging at play.
   Lay Summary Organismal immune systems must contend with an onslaught of
   viruses, bacteria, and other parasites. Given the uncertainty of
   infection and the diversity of infectious organisms, the type of immune
   response, and to the extent that the immune system anticipates
   infection, can be beneficial or detrimental to host fitness depending on
   the context. In this perspective, we discuss the limits of these immune
   response types, and suggest that one overlooked but particularly
   important one - bet-hedging - may explain patterns of variation among
   cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: An individual's risk of breast cancer is
   profoundly affected by evolutionary mismatch. Mismatches in Western
   society known to increase the risk of breast cancer include a sedentary
   lifestyle and reproductive factors. Biota alteration, characterized by a
   loss of biodiversity from the ecosystem of the human body as a result of
   Western society, is a mismatch known to increase the risk of a variety
   of inflammation-related diseases, including colitis-associated colon
   cancer. However, the effect of biota alteration on breast cancer has not
   been evaluated.
   Methodology: In this study, we utilized the C3(1)-TAg mouse model of
   breast cancer to evaluate the role of biota alteration in the
   development of breast cancer. This model has been used to recapitulate
   the role of exercise and pregnancy in reducing the risk of breast
   cancer. C3(1)-TAg mice were treated with Hymenolepis diminuta, a benign
   helminth that has been shown to reverse the effects of biota alteration
   in animal models.
   Results: No effect of the helminth H. diminuta was observed. Neither the
   latency nor tumor growth was affected by the therapy, and no significant
   effects on tumor transcriptome were observed based on RNAseq analysis.
   Conclusions and implications: These findings suggest that biota
   alteration, although known to affect a variety of Western-associated
   diseases, might not be a significant factor in the high rate of breast
   cancer observed in Western societies.
   Lay summary: An almost complete loss of intestinal worms in high-income
   countries has led to increases in allergic disorders, autoimmune
   conditions, and perhaps colon cancer. However, in this study, results
   using laboratory mice suggest that loss of intestinal worms might not be
   associated with breast cancer.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Number = {1},
Pages = {304-310},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {While the Anthropocene is often discussed in terms of the health of the
   planet, there has been less attention paid to its impact on the health
   of humans. We argue that there is now sufficient evidence of broad and
   growing adverse effects on human health to consider Anthropocene-related
   diseases and their impact on public health as a category of conditions
   needing specific recognition and preventative action. Using the examples
   of climate change-related health challenges, non-communicable disease,
   antimicrobial resistance and the unique challenges of the digital
   environment, we discuss how the profound and pervasive environmental
   changes of the Anthropocene can affect our health, with broad effects on
   societal health. We frame this concept in terms of human evolutionary
   history and cultural evolution's runaway characteristics, reflecting our
   drive for continual and cumulative innovation for reasons beyond simply
   survival and Darwinian fitness. As the causative agents are often remote
   from those populations most adversely affected, prevention and
   mitigation require collective societal and policy actions.
   Lay summary: There is increasing evidence that our uniquely evolved
   ability to modify our environments rapidly and at an accelerating pace
   is having impacts on our health, particularly non-communicable diseases
   and poor mental wellbeing. Reframing these public health challenges as
   Anthropocene-related diseases emphasizes the need for collective
   responsibility and systems approaches to prevention.},

Title = {Implications of leg length for metabolic health and fitness},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {316-324},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Several studies have linked longer legs with
   favorable adult metabolic health outcomes and greater offspring birth
   weight. A recent Mendelian randomization study suggested a causal link
   between height and cardiometabolic risk; however, the underlying reasons
   remain poorly understood. Methodology Using a cross-sectional design, we
   tested in a convenience sample of 70 healthy young women whether birth
   weight and tibia length as markers of early-life conditions associated
   more strongly with metabolically beneficial traits like organ size and
   skeletal muscle mass (SMM) than a statistically derived height-residual
   variable indexing later, more canalized growth. Results Consistent with
   the `developmental origins of health and disease' hypothesis, we found
   relatively strong associations of tibia length-but not birth weight-with
   adult organ size, brain size, SMM and resting energy expenditure
   measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Conclusions and
   implications Building on prior work, these results suggest that leg
   length is a sensitive marker of traits directly impacting metabolic and
   reproductive health. Alongside findings in the same sample relating
   tibia length and height-residual to MRI-measured pelvic dimensions, we
   suggest there may exist a degree of coordination in the development of
   long bone, lean mass and pelvic traits, possibly centered on early,
   pre-pubertal growth periods. Such phenotypic coordination has important
   implications for fitness, serving to benefit both adult health and the
   health of offspring in subsequent generations.
   Lay Summary We provide a potential explanation for why adding
   centimeters to one's leg length appears to benefit the metabolic health
   of mothers (and fathers) and the health of offspring; namely, that
   favorable environmental conditions in early life support both leg growth
   and the development of metabolically beneficial lean mass.},

Title = {Variation among human populations in endometriosis and PCOS A test of
   the inverse comorbidity model},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {295-310},
Abstract = {Evidence linking endometriosis to low prenatal testosterone, and
   evidence that risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated
   with high prenatal testosterone, have motivated the hypothesis that
   endometriosis and PCOS exhibit inverse comorbidity. The inverse
   comorbidity hypothesis predicts that populations exhibiting higher
   prevalence of one disorder should show lower prevalence of the other. To
   test this prediction, data were compiled from the literature on the
   prevalence of endometriosis and PCOS, levels of serum testosterone in
   women during pregnancy and digit ratios as indicators of prenatal
   testosterone, in relation to variation in inferred or observed
   population ancestries. Published studies indicate that rates of
   endometriosis are highest in women from Asian populations, intermediate
   in women from European populations and lowest in women from African
   populations (i.e. with inferred or observed African ancestry); by
   contrast, rates of PCOS show evidence of being lowest in Asian women,
   intermediate in Europeans and highest in individuals from African
   populations. Women from African populations also show higher serum
   testosterone during pregnancy (which may increase PCOS risk, and
   decrease endometriosis risk, in daughters), and higher prenatal
   testosterone (as indicated by digit ratios), than European women. These
   results are subject to caveats involving ascertainment biases,
   socioeconomic, cultural and historical effects on diagnoses, data
   quality, uncertainties regarding the genetic and environmental bases of
   population differences and population variation in the causes and
   symptoms of PCOS and endometriosis. Despite such reservations, the
   findings provide convergent, preliminary support for the inverse
   comorbidity model, and they should motivate further tests of its
   predictions.
   Lay Summary: Given that endometriosis risk and risk of polycystic ovary
   syndrome show evidence of having genetically, developmentally, and
   physiologically opposite causes, they should also show opposite patterns
   of prevalence within populations: where one is more common, the other
   should be more rare. This hypothesis is supported by data from studies
   of variation among populations in rates of endometriosis and PCOS and
   studies of variation among populations in levels of prenatal
   testosterone, which mediaterisks of both conditions.},

Title = {Live fast, die young and sleep later Life history strategy and human
   sleep behavior},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-52},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Life History Theory (LHT) describes
   trade-offs that organisms make with regard to three investment pathways:
   growth, maintenance and reproduction. In light of the reparative
   functions of sleep, we examine sleep behaviors and corresponding
   attitudes as proximate manifestations of an individual's underlying
   relative prioritization of short-term reproduction versus long-term
   maintenance.
   Methodology: We collected survey data from 568 participants across two
   online studies having different participant pools. We use a mixture of
   segmented and hierarchical regression models, structural equation
   modeling and machine learning to infer relationships between sleep
   duration/quality, attitudes about sleep and biodemographic/psychometric
   measures of life history strategy (LHS).
   Results: An age-mediated U- or V-shaped relationship appears when LHS is
   plotted against habitual sleep duration, with the fastest strategies
   occupying the sections of the curve with the highest mortality risk: <
   6.5 hr (short sleep) and > 8.5 hr (long sleep). LH `fastness' is
   associated with increased sleepiness and worse overall sleep quality:
   delayed sleep onset latency, more wakefulness after sleep onset, higher
   sleep-wake instability and greater sleep duration variability. Hedonic
   valuations of sleep may mediate the effects of LHS on certain sleep
   parameters.
   Conclusions and implications: The costs of deprioritizing maintenance
   can be parameterized in the domain of sleep, where `life history
   fastness' corresponds with sleep patterns associated with greater
   senescence and mortality. Individual differences in sleep having
   significant health implications can thus be understood as components of
   lifelong trajectories likely stemming from calibration to developmental
   circumstances. Relatedly, hedonic valuations of sleep may constitute
   useful avenues for non-pharmacological management of chronic sleep
   disorders.
   Lay Summary: Sleep is essential because it allows the body to repair and
   maintain itself. But time spent sleeping is time that cannot be spent
   doing other things. People differ in how much they prioritize immediate
   rewards, including sociosexual opportunities, versus long-term goals. In
   this research, we show that individual differences in sleep behaviors,
   and attitudes toward sleep, correspond with psychological and behavioral
   differences reflecting such differing priorities. Orientation toward
   sleep can thus be understood as part of the overall lifetime strategies
   that people pursue.},

Title = {Kin-based alloparenting and infant hospital admissions in the UK
   Millennium cohort},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-81},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Kin-selected altruism is an evolutionary
   explanation for why biological kin other than parents are willing
   childcare providers or alloparents. Kin alloparents may increase lineage
   fitness by reducing maternal energy depletion and improving child
   survival through childcare activities. The aim of this research was to
   apply the hypothesis that kin-based alloparental care has benefits for
   child health in a western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic
   context.
   Methodology: The hypothesis was tested using the first sweep of the UK
   Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18 552 infants). The outcome was number of
   hospitalizations by age 9 months, and the main predictors were kin-based
   alloparental care during work hours, socioeconomic position and infant
   health-related variables and their interactions with kin-based
   alloparenting. Analysis of hospitalizations was carried out using
   negative binomial regression.
   Results: Kin alloparents were primary day carers in 17\% of households.
   Infants whose main care arrangement during work hours was with kin
   allocarers had statistically significantly fewer hospitalizations than
   infants in all other care arrangements combined (Incidence rate ratio =
   0.86, P < 0.03), and when contrasted with maternal day care (Incidence
   rate ratio = 0.79, P < 0.02).
   Conclusions and implications: Kin-based allocare was associated with
   about a 15\% reduction in the risk of infant hospitalization in the
   first 9 months. The difference appeared to be due in part to a
   difference in the risk of hospitalization for infectious diseases.
   Sensitivity analyses indicated that infants cared for by their mother
   during the day rather than in day-care facilities were most at risk of
   hospitalization compared with those in kin-based care.
   Lay summary: Modern industrialized societies are generally characterized
   by nuclear family households, with grandparents and other extended
   family often living a considerable distance away. Studies carried out in
   societies which have not undergone the fragmentation of extended
   families have shown that grandmothers and other biological kin reduce
   infant mortality, most likely because they distribute the burden of
   infant care so that it does not fall exclusively on the mother. Here,
   the hypothesis that grandparental and other family care would be
   beneficial for infant health in the contemporary UK was testing using
   the UK Millennium cohort. Infant health was measured as number of
   hospitalizations in the first 9 months from birth. The main findings
   were that kin-based infant care, which was most commonly by
   grandparents, was associated with a 15\% reduction in the risk of
   hospitalization in infants up to 9 months of age. Further analysis
   suggested that the difference was larger for risk of infant
   hospitalization due to infectious diseases rather than non-infectious
   diseases. The results also suggested that the finding may have been
   driven by increased risk for infants of mothers caring for their infant
   during normal working hours with no other help, such as from the father
   or pay-for day-care.},

Title = {An orally administered drug prevents selection for antibiotic-resistant
   bacteria in the gut during daptomycin therapy},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {439-446},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Background and objectives Previously, we showed proof-of-concept in a
   mouse model that oral administration of cholestyramine prevented
   enrichment of daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract during daptomycin therapy. Cholestyramine
   binds daptomycin in the gut, which removes daptomycin selection pressure
   and so prevents the enrichment of resistant clones. Here, we
   investigated two open questions related to this approach: (i) can
   cholestyramine prevent the enrichment of diverse daptomycin mutations
   emerging de novo in the gut? and (ii) how does the timing of
   cholestyramine administration impact its ability to suppress resistance?
   Methodology Mice with GI E. faecium were treated with daptomycin with or
   without cholestyramine, and E. faecium was cultured from feces to
   measure changes in daptomycin susceptibility. A subset of clones was
   sequenced to investigate the genomic basis of daptomycin resistance.
   Results Cholestyramine prevented the enrichment of diverse resistance
   mutations that emerged de novo in daptomycin-treated mice. Whole-genome
   sequencing revealed that resistance emerged through multiple genetic
   pathways, with most candidate resistance mutations observed in the clsA
   gene. In addition, we observed that cholestyramine was most effective
   when administration started prior to the first dose of daptomycin.
   However, beginning cholestyramine after the first daptomycin dose
   reduced the frequency of resistant E. faecium compared to not using
   cholestyramine at all. Conclusions and implications Cholestyramine
   prevented the enrichment of diverse daptomycin-resistance mutations in
   intestinal E. faecium populations during daptomycin treatment, and it is
   a promising tool for managing the transmission of daptomycin-resistant
   E. faecium.
   Lay Summary Intravenous antibiotics can select for drug-resistant
   bacteria in the gut. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for preventing this
   selection in a mouse model. We show that an orally administered drug can
   capture antibiotic in the gut, thus preventing selection for resistance.
   This strategy allows for antibiotic treatment while reducing
   transmission of resistance.},

Title = {Adaptive function and correlates of anxiety during a pandemic},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {393-405},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Most studies to date have focused on the
   negative aspects of anxiety. Anxiety, however, is an evolved emotional
   response that can provide protection in the face of risk. Pandemics are
   characterized by increased mortality risk coupled with future
   uncertainties, which both cause heightened anxiety. Here, we examine the
   factors associated with anxiety levels and risk avoidance behaviours
   during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked how individual
   time perspectives (future-oriented consideration and attention to
   present moment experience) affect anxiety in uncertain times, and
   whether anxiety reduces mortality risk by promoting risk avoidance
   behaviour.
   Methodology: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and
   Turkey (N = 3935) and measured participants' generalized and
   pandemic-related anxiety levels, future-oriented consideration,
   mindfulness, intolerance of uncertainty, risk perception and risk
   avoidance behaviours.
   Results: We found that people less tolerant of uncertainties had higher
   levels of pandemic anxiety. Those with higher pandemic anxiety exhibited
   risk avoidance behaviours more frequently. Mindfulness and increased
   financial satisfaction reduced pandemic anxiety. People in Turkey
   reported higher levels of generalized and pandemic anxiety and greater
   engagement in risk avoidance behaviours than people in the UK.
   Conclusions and implications: Our study shows an elevated anxiety
   response can help mitigate infection risk during pandemics and
   emphasizes the importance of the underlying situation in understanding
   whether an anxiety response is adaptive or pathological. Maintaining a
   healthy level of anxiety can promote engagement in protective
   behaviours. Therapies addressing anxiety can focus on increasing
   tolerance to future uncertainties.
   Lay summary: Anxiety is an emotional response triggered in the
   anticipation of a possible threat. We found that intolerance of
   uncertainty strongly predicted anxiety and that people with elevated
   anxiety levels engaged in protective behaviours more frequently during
   the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that anxiety can help mitigate
   mortality risk.},

Title = {Concordance of HIV transmission risk factors elucidated using viral
   diversification rate and phylogenetic clustering},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {338-348},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Although HIV sequence clustering is routinely
   used to identify subpopulations experiencing elevated transmission, it
   over-simplifies transmission dynamics and is sensitive to methodology.
   Complementarily, viral diversification rates can be used to approximate
   historical transmission rates. Here, we investigated the concordance and
   sensitivity of HIV transmission risk factors identified by phylogenetic
   clustering, viral diversification rate, changes in viral diversification
   rate and a combined approach.
   Methodology: Viral sequences from 9848 people living with HIV in British
   Columbia, Canada, sampled between 1996 and February 2019, were used to
   infer phylogenetic trees, from which clusters were identified and viral
   diversification rates of each tip were calculated. Factors associated
   with heightened transmission risk were compared across models of cluster
   membership, viral diversification rate, changes in diversification rate,
   and viral diversification rate among clusters.
   Results: Viruses within larger clusters had higher diversification rates
   and lower changes in diversification rate than those within smaller
   clusters; however, rates within individual clusters, independent of
   size, varied widely. Risk factors for both cluster membership and
   elevated viral diversification rate included being male, young, a
   resident of health authority E, previous injection drug use, previous
   hepatitis C virus infection or a high recent viral load. In a
   sensitivity analysis, models based on cluster membership had wider
   confidence intervals and lower concordance of significant effects than
   viral diversification rate for lower sampling rates.
   Conclusions and implications: Viral diversification rate complements
   phylogenetic clustering, offering a means of evaluating transmission
   dynamics to guide provision of treatment and prevention services.
   Lay Summary: Understanding HIV transmission dynamics within clusters can
   help prioritize public health resource allocation. We compared
   socio-demographic and clinical risk factors associated with phylogenetic
   cluster membership and viral diversification rate, a historical
   branching rate, in order to assess their relative concordance and
   sampling sensitivity.},

Title = {Prevalence and factors related to psychological distress among ethnic
   minority adults in a semi-modern village in rural Vietnam: an
   evolutionary mismatch framework},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Psychological distress is one of the greatest
   health threats facing humanity and has been hypothesized to represent an
   evolutionary mismatch. This hypothesis can be tested in semi-traditional
   societies that are undergoing transitions to modern lifestyles. This
   study used an evolutionary medicine framework to examine the predictors
   of psychological distress symptomology in a semi-modern ethnic minority
   village in rural Vietnam that is transitioning into a developing
   economy.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Chieng Sai
   Village among White Thai ethnic minority adults aged 18-75. The DASS-21
   scale was used to measure the prevalence of psychological distress
   symptoms (depression and stress), and a closed format questionnaire was
   used to collect data on independent variables within an evolutionary
   mismatch framework. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to
   determine associated factors of psychological distress symptomology.
   Results: The prevalence of psychological distress symptoms was 22\%
   (depression = 16.9\%, stress = 16.3\%). Common features of modernity,
   such as low levels of exercise, boredom, and low income, showed positive
   associations with psychological distress, while lifestyle features that
   were more similar to those expected in the evolutionary past and that
   fulfill evolutionary adaptations, such as getting enough sleep, adequate
   physical exertion, and access to resources (higher level of income),
   showed negative associations with psychological distress.
   Conclusions and implications: This study suggests that modern lifestyles
   might have generated evolutionary mismatches that are negatively
   impacting mental health in Chieng Sai Village. Further investigations on
   mental health in rural Vietnam are warrented. Future research should
   focus on determining the causal relationship between psychological
   distress and evolutionary mismatches. Evolutionary medicine approaches
   to understanding and preventing psychological distress are potential
   forces of insight to be considered in public health and educational
   policy.
   Lay summary: Approximately 22\% of White Thai ethnic minority adults in
   the village of Cheing Sai reported psychological distress symptoms. I
   found that lifestyle factors prevalent in modern society had positive
   associations with psychological distress symptomology, while lifestyle
   factors that mimic aspects of the human evolutionary past, such as
   adequate physical exertion, had negative associations with psychological
   distress symptoms.},

Title = {Reconsidering LINE-1's role in cancer: does LINE-1 function as a
   reporter detecting early cancer-associated epigenetic signatures?},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-82},
Abstract = {Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only
   autonomously active retrotransposon in humans. While L1 has been
   implicated in several pathologies and the aging process, I present a
   model which challenges an understanding of L1 as predominantly
   antagonistic to human health. I hypothesize that L1 serves as a reporter
   in an early cancer alert system: a tripwire strung throughout the genome
   poised to trigger p53 and a type I interferon (IFN-1) response when the
   epigenetic landscape portends cancer. Cell proliferation and a shift to
   aerobic glycolysis cause dramatic changes in the epigenome which are
   permissive to L1's escape from suppression. L1 has several properties
   which make it particularly apt to fulfill this hypothesized sentinel
   function. Being present in many copies spread throughout the genome
   allows it to monitor many regions for epigenetic instability and renders
   it robust to deactivation by mutation. This proposed cancer alert system
   would alter the cancer cell fitness landscape discouraging the use of
   growth-favoring aerobic glycolysis by threatening the activation of
   tumor-suppressive mechanisms. It also imposes costs on a strategy of
   non-specific global transcriptional derepression aimed at activating
   oncogenes. Erroneous activations of this system are predicted to
   increase the rate of aging, suggesting this represents a case of
   antagonistic pleiotropy trading prolonged youth for cancer prevention.
   More research is needed to assess this model.
   Lay summary: During carcinogenesis the epigenome is remodeled by the
   Warburg effect and cellular proliferation. These processes globally
   relax chromatin. This epigenetic environment is permissive to the
   retrotransposon long interspersed nuclear element-1's (LINE-1 or L1)
   escape from suppression. I hypothesize and present evidence for the
   notion that L1 has been co-opted to serve as a reporter in an early
   cancer alert system, poised to trigger tumor suppressive mechanisms when
   the epigenetic landscape portends cancer. This hypothesis describes a
   potentially major means by which transformation is thwarted early on.},

Title = {Conservation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike suggests complicated viral
   adaptation history from bat to human},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {290-303},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, has become the
   most devastating public health emergency in the 21st century and one of
   the most influential plagues in history. Studies on the origin of
   SARS-CoV-2 have generally agreed that the virus probably comes from bat,
   closely related to a bat CoV named BCoV-RaTG13 taken from horseshoe bat
   (Rhinolophus affinis), with Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) being a
   plausible intermediate host. However, due to the relatively low number
   of SARS-CoV-2-related strains available in public domain, the
   evolutionary history remains unclear.
   Methodology: Nine hundred ninety-five coronavirus sequences from NCBI
   Genbank and GISAID were obtained and multiple sequence alignment was
   carried out to categorize SARS-CoV-2 related groups. Spike sequences
   were analyzed using similarity analysis and conservation analyses.
   Mutation analysis was used to identify variations within
   receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike for SARS-CoV-2-related strains.
   Results: We identified a family of SARS-CoV-2-related strains, including
   the closest relatives, bat CoV RaTG13 and pangolin CoV strains. Sequence
   similarity analysis and conservation analysis on spike sequence
   identified that N-terminal domain, RBD and S2 subunit display different
   degrees of conservation with several coronavirus strains. Mutation
   analysis on contact sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD reveals that
   human-susceptibility probably emerges in pangolin.
   Conclusion and implication: We conclude that the spike sequence of
   SARS-CoV-2 is the result of multiple recombination events during its
   transmission from bat to human, and we propose a framework of
   evolutionary history that resolve the relationship of BCoV-RaTG13 and
   pangolin coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2.
   Lay Summary: This study analyses whole-genome and spike sequences of
   coronavirus from NCBI using phylogenetic and conservation analyses to
   reconstruct the evolutionary history of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and proposes an evolutionary history of spike in
   the progenitors of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human through mammal hosts
   before they recombine into the current form.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {391-397},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {We hypothesize that some placental hormones-specifically those that
   arise by tandem duplication of genes for maternal hormones-may behave as
   gestational drivers, selfish genetic elements that encourage the
   spontaneous abortion of offspring that fail to inherit them. Such
   drivers are quite simple to evolve, requiring just three things: a
   decrease in expression or activity of some essential maternal hormone
   during pregnancy; a compensatory increase in expression or activity of
   the homologous hormone by the placenta; and genetic linkage between the
   two effects. Gestational drive may therefore be a common selection
   pressure experienced by any of the various hormones of mammalian
   pregnancy that have arisen by tandem gene duplication. We examine the
   evolution of chorionic gonadotropin in the human lineage in light of
   this hypothesis. Finally, we postulate that some of the difficulties of
   human pregnancy may be a consequence of the action of selfish genes.
   Lay Summary We show how placental hormones that have arisen via tandem
   gene duplication from maternally produced hormones may subsequently
   experience selection as selfish genetic elements and spread through
   populations despite causing reproductive inefficiency. We examine the
   implications of this hypothesis and point to some empirical tests.},

Title = {US fathers' reports of bonding, infant temperament and psychosocial
   stress based on family sleep arrangements},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {460-469},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Evolutionary-grounded sleep research has been
   critical to establishing the mutual dependence of breastfeeding and
   nighttime sleep proximity for mothers and infants. Evolutionary
   perspectives on cosleeping also often emphasize the emotional
   motivations for and potential benefits of sleep proximity, including for
   parent-infant bonding. However, this potential link between infant sleep
   location and bonding remains understudied for both mothers and fathers.
   Moreover, in Euro-American contexts bedsharing has been linked to family
   stress and difficult child temperament, primarily via maternal reports.
   We know relatively little about whether paternal psychosocial dynamics
   differ based on family sleep arrangements, despite fathers and other kin
   often being present in the cosleeping environment across cultures. Here,
   we aim to help address some of these gaps in knowledge pertaining to
   fathers and family sleep arrangements.
   Methodology: Drawing on a sample of Midwestern U.S. fathers (N=195), we
   collected sociodemographic and survey data to analyze links between
   infant nighttime sleep location, paternal psychosocial well-being,
   father-infant bonding, and infant temperament. From fathers' reports,
   families were characterized as routinely solitary sleeping, bedsharing,
   or roomsharing (without bedsharing).
   Results: We found that routinely roomsharing or bedsharing fathers,
   respectively, reported stronger bonding than solitary sleepers.
   Bedsharing fathers also reported that their infants had more negative
   temperaments and also tended to report greater parenting-related stress
   due to difficulties with their children.
   Conclusions: These cross-sectional results help to highlight how a
   practice with deep phylogenetic and evolutionary history, such as
   cosleeping, can be variably expressed within communities with the
   potential for family-dependent benefits or strains.
   Lay Summary: Evolutionary-grounded cosleeping research has elucidated
   the intimate connections between mother-infant sleep proximity and
   breastfeeding. However, some Euro-American research indicates that
   bedsharing can coincide with family strain and stress. Here, U.S.
   fathers who routinely roomshared or bedshared, respectively, reported
   stronger bonds to their babies than solitary sleeping fathers, but
   bedsharing fathers also reported more negative infant temperament.},

Title = {Bitter taste receptors Genes, evolution and health},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {431-447},
Abstract = {Bitter taste perception plays vital roles in animal behavior and
   fitness. By signaling the presence of toxins in foods, particularly
   noxious defense compounds found in plants, it enables animals to avoid
   exposure. In vertebrates, bitter perception is initiated by TAS2Rs, a
   family of G protein-coupled receptors expressed on the surface of taste
   buds. There, oriented toward the interior of the mouth, they monitor the
   contents of foods, drinks and other substances as they are ingested.
   When bitter compounds are encountered, TAS2Rs respond by triggering
   neural pathways leading to sensation. The importance of this role placed
   TAS2Rs under selective pressures in the course of their evolution,
   leaving signatures in patterns of gene gain and loss, sequence
   polymorphism, and population structure consistent with vertebrates'
   diverse feeding ecologies. The protective value of bitter taste is
   reduced in modern humans because contemporary food supplies are safe and
   abundant. However, this is not always the case. Some crops, particularly
   in the developing world, retain surprisingly high toxicity and
   bitterness remains an important measure of safety. Bitter perception
   also shapes health through its influence on preference driven behaviors
   such as diet choice, alcohol intake and tobacco use. Further, allelic
   variation in TAS2Rs is extensive, leading to individual differences in
   taste sensitivity that drive these behaviors, shaping susceptibility to
   disease. Thus, bitter taste perception occupies a critical intersection
   between ancient evolutionary processes and modern human health.
   Lay Summary: Bitter tastes warn animals about noxious substances in the
   environment, especially toxins found in plants. This has placed the
   genes controlling bitter taste under eons of pressure from natural

Title = {Epidemiological transitions in human evolution and the richness of
   viruses, helminths, and protozoa},
Journal = {EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-147},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: In absolute terms, humans are extremely
   highly parasitized compared to other primates. This may reflect that
   humans are outliers in traits correlated with parasite richness:
   population density, geographic range area, and study effort. The high
   degree of parasitism could also reflect amplified disease risk
   associated with agriculture and urbanization. Alternatively, controlling
   for other variables, cultural and psychological adaptations could have
   reduced parasitism in humans over evolutionary time.
   Methodology: We predicted the number of parasites that would infect a
   nonhuman primate with human phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic
   position, and then compared observed parasitism of humans in eight
   geopolitical countries to the predicted distributions. The analyses
   incorporated study effort, phylogeny, and drivers of parasitism in 33
   primate species.
   Results: Analyses of individual countries were not supportive of either
   hypothesis. When analyzed collectively, however, human populations
   showed consistently lower than expected richness of protozoa and
   helminths, but higher richness of viruses. Thus, human evolutionary
   innovations and new parasite exposures may have impacted groups of
   parasites in different ways, with support for both hypotheses in the
   overall analysis.
   Conclusions and implications: The high level of parasitism observed in
   humans only applies to viruses, and was not extreme in any of our tests
   of individual countries. In contrast, we find consistent reductions in
   protozoa and helminths across countries, suggesting reduced parasitism
   by these groups during human evolution. We propose that hygienic and
   technological advances might have extinguished fecal-orally or
   indirectly transmitted parasites like helminths, whereas higher human
   densities and host-shifting potential of viruses have supported
   increased virus richness.
   Lay Summary: Vastly more parasite species infect humans than any other
   primate host. Controlling for factors that influence parasite richness,
   such as the intensity of study effort and body mass, we find that humans
   may have more viruses, but fewer helminths and protozoa, than expected
   based on evolutionary analyses of parasitism in other primates.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of pathological conditions is usually centered on
   human and domesticated species. Thus, a vast array of pathologies within
   vertebrates are unknown, especially those that occur in exotics and
   those that lack external characters, such as conditions that affect the
   skeleton. Exotics represent a majority of the vertebrates housed in zoos
   and other wildlife centers, and in the larger picture of conservation,
   represent the best way to determine potential health threats and cures
   for endangered and threatened species in the wild. Here we describe a
   case of acromegaly, a rare condition of excess growth hormone, in a hog
   badger (Arctonyx collaris) based on Computed Tomography (CT). This is
   the first documented occurrence of this condition in non-human or
   non-domesticated mammals, and the first occurrence within Mustelidae.
   The recognition of this rare condition within a badger suggests that
   acromegaly may be more widespread within mammals than previously
   thought, and has implications for diagnosis of other exotics within
   zoos.},

Title = {Cichla cataractae (Cichliformes: Cichlidae), new species of peacock bass

Abstract = {A new species of peacock bass, Cichla cataractae, is distinguished from
   all congeners by molecular evidence and unique patterns of adult and
   juvenile pigmentation. Juveniles (<150 mm SL) have sides of body
   dominated by a series of three conspicuous dark blotches with the one
   below soft dorsal fin largest, attenuated posteriorly (long teardrop
   shape) but distinctly separated from elliptical caudal blotch; same
   blotches eventually with pale border (ocellated) in largest juveniles.
   Adult pattern on sides dominated by two distinct dark blotches, each one
   ocellated; anterior blotch rounded, located below anterior base of
   spinous dorsal fin and not extending above anterior lateral line;
   posterior blotch highly irregular in shape, located below soft dorsal
   fin and often displaced dorsally; additional dark blotch below posterior
   base of spinous dorsal fin generally absent or small, ocellated or not,
   and level with anterior blotch; vertical bars on sides generally absent
   or faint; postorbital stripe always present, highly broken into
   irregular series of dark spots, each one usually ocellated. Cichla
   cataractae is endemic to the Essequibo Basin where it typically inhabits
   rocky shoals in river channels with swift current. The new species is
   sympatric with the more widely distributed C. ocellaris, a species that
   prefers lentic habitats. Molecular analysis supports C. cataractae as a
   distinct lineage in a clade of Cichla containing C. temensis, C.
   melaniae, C. mirianae, C. piquiti and C. pinima. The oldest extant
   specimens of the new species were collected by Carl H. Eigenmann in 1908
   and documented in his seminal ``The Freshwater Fishes of British
   Guiana{''} (Eigenmann, 1912).},

   This study compared morphometric and meristic data for A. heckeli with
   lentic and lotic populations of A. sellal. The only significant
   difference was in the number of gill rakers in lotic populations of A.
   sellal (10-25) vs. lentic populations of A. sellal (26-35) and A.
   heckeli (28-35). Although our results are consistent with the
   interpretation of A. heckeli and A. sellal as ``young species{''}, the
   amiguity of available morphological and molecular sequence data suggest
   that A. heckeli is best treated as a junior synonym of A. sellal until

   (Peale) Museum. Wilson's illustration of the specimen was engraved and
   hand-colored prints were published in American Ornithology voL 6 (1812b.

   the path of Wilson's type specimens became difficult to trace after the
   Peale Museum closed in 1846 and its collections were sold and dispersed.
   Wilson's holotype of F. atricapillas was presumed lost or destroyed
   until November 2020, when I rediscovered it in the collection of the
   Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSP), thanks to a
   penciled note made by the late Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, former ANSP
   curator of birds. This research also sheds new light on the history or
   the Peale Museum bird collection. exposing a basic misunderstanding
   about the ``Peale numbers{''} cited by Wilson, which has broad

Abstract = {Public communication is increasingly recognized as a key component in
   successful natural resource management within government agencies
   responsible for conservation. However, communication practices and
   beliefs among government conservation scientists and practitioners are
   not well studied or understood. Herein, we present the results of a
   communication survey disseminated to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   employees working for the agency???s Ecological Services program, a
   program charged with endangered species recovery. We asked respondents
   about public communication practices and beliefs, and factors that may
   motivate or discourage participation in public communication activities.
   Study respondents reported the lowest levels of participation in
   media-related, one-way communication activities, including writing
   educational materials and answering media inquiries. Respondents
   reported most frequently engaging in one-on-one communication with
   stakeholders. Although our results suggest that respondents engage in
   frequent communication with stakeholders, our results also suggest that
   they mostly communicate with stakeholders remotely, and especially by
   email, rather than in person. Furthermore, only 36\% reported that they
   go out of their way to visit people in communities. On the other hand, a
   majority agreed that they learn new things about species and landscapes
   (80\%) from conversations with stakeholders and often use this knowledge
   to solve conservation problems (89\%). With respect to factors that
   encourage and discourage participation, 93\% of respondents indicated
   that a desire to produce better conservation outcomes motivates them to
   communicate with stakeholders and the public. Many agreed that a lack of
   time was an obstacle to participating in public communication (68\%),
   but an even larger majority (86\%) indicated that public unfamiliarity
   with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service presented a barrier to public
   communication. Similarly, a majority of employees agreed that public and
   stakeholder unfamiliarity with themselves and their work also presented
   a communication barrier (62\%). Our findings suggest that agencies
   responsible for conservation may want to assess whether the agency and
   its employees adequately invest in communication activities that foster
   public familiarity.},

Title = {Evaluation of the AHDriFT Camera Trap System to Survey for Small Mammals
   and Herpetofauna},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-207},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Traditional surveys for small mammals and herpetofauna require intensive
   field effort because these taxa are often difficult to detect. Dynamic
   environmental conditions and dense vegetative cover, both of which are
   attributes of biodiverse wet meadow ecosystems, further hamper field
   surveys. Camera traps may be a solution, but commonly used passive
   infrared game cameras face difficulties photographing herpetofauna and
   small mammals. The adapted-Hunt drift fence technique (AHDriFT) is a
   camera trap and drift fence system designed to overcome traditional
   limitations, but has not been extensively evaluated. We deployed 15
   Y-shaped AHDriFT arrays (three cameras per array) in northern Ohio wet
   meadows from March 10 to October 5, 2019. Equipment for each array cost
   approximately US\$1,570. Construction and deployment of each array took
   approximately 3 h, with field servicing requiring 15 min per array.
   Arrays proved durable under wind, ice, snow, flooding, and heat.
   Processing 2 wk of images of 45 cameras averaged about 13 person-hours.
   We obtained 9,018 unique-capture events of 41 vertebrate species
   comprised of 5 amphibians, 13 reptiles (11 snakes), 16 mammals, and 7
   birds. We imaged differing animal size classes ranging from
   invertebrates to weasels. We assessed detection efficacy by using
   expected biodiversity baselines. We determined snake communities from 3
   y of traditional surveys and possible small mammal and amphibian
   biodiversity from prior observations and species ranges and habitat
   requirements. We cumulatively detected all amphibians and 92\% of snakes
   and small mammals that we expected to be present. We also imaged four
   mammal and two snake species where they were not previously observed.
   However, capture consistency was variable by taxa and species, and
   low-mobility species or species in low densities may not be detected. In
   its current design, AHDriFT proved to be effective for terrestrial
   vertebrate biodiversity surveying.},

Title = {Gonad Size Measured by Ultrasound to Assign Stage of Maturity in Burbot},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {241-249},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We measured gonad size (diameter and circumference) by ultrasound and
   used it as a metric to assign stage of maturity in Burbot Lota Iota from
   Lake Roosevelt, Washington. We collected paired gonad tissue and
   ultrasound measurements monthly from November 2017 to March 2018 and
   processed gonad tissue for histological analysis to confirm stage of
   maturity. We measured gonad diameter and circumference by ultrasound. We
   also measured excised gonad diameter (i.e., true gonad diameter) by
   digital calipers and excised gonad circumference (i.e., true gonad
   circumference) by a measuring tape. All late vitellogenic (stage 6)
   ovaries measured by ultrasound had a diameter greater than 3.90 cm,
   suggesting a value of 3.90 cm or greater may be used to characterize
   females capable of spawning in the current reproductive cycle. One
   mid-spermatogenic (stage 3) and all ripe (stage 4) testes were too large
   to be measured and were assigned a diameter of 5.11 cm, the maximum
   value capable of being measured by our ultrasound transducer. A value of
   5.11 cm or greater may be used to characterize males capable of spawning
   in the current reproductive cycle. Testis circumference measured by
   ultrasound is not reported because some testes were wider than the
   ultrasound transducer and could not be measured. Measurements of testis
   diameter did not differ between measurement methods (ultrasound versus
   true), but ultrasound measurements of ovary diameter and circumference
   were higher than true measurements. We attributed the difference between
   measurement methods to flattening of the ovary while applying the
   ultrasound transducer. Gonad diameter and circumference measured by
   ultrasound were highly correlated with gonadosomatic index and ovarian
   follicle diameter, indicating gonad size measured by ultrasound is an
   appropriate index of gonad development in Burbot.},

Title = {Does Invasive Common Reed in Coastal Salt Marshes Affect Dabbling Duck
   Food Availability?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Common reed, Phragmites australis, a nonnative perennial grass, is
   considered a nuisance species to land managers and wildlife biologists.
   Common reed thrives in areas with reduced soil salinities, increased
   nitrogen availability, and anthropogenic shoreline development. The
   expansion of nonnative common reed into tidal wetlands of North America
   detrimentally affects native wildlife by altering resource utilization,
   modifying trophic structures, and changing disturbance regimes. Thus, it
   also has the potential to drastically affect dabbling duck (Family
   Anatidae, SubFamily Anatinae, Tribe Anatini) energetic carrying capacity
   in salt marsh ecosystems. We assessed whether invaded monocultures of
   common reed in dabbling duck habitat could alter the availability of
   invertebrate and seed foods for the mallard Anas platyrhynchos, American
   black duck Anas rubripes, green-winged teal Anas crecca, northern
   shoveler Spatula clypeata, and northern pintail Anas acuta as compared
   with wetland type (mudflat, low marsh, high marsh, and impoundments). We
   compared food and energy availability in > 90\% common reed monocultures
   with noncommon reed-invaded salt marshes in five study areas in Edwin B.
   Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey, 2015-2016. To estimate
   wetland-specific food energy supply, we collected sediment core samples,
   fixed them with formalin, and washed, dried, sorted, and weighed them
   for seeds and invertebrates. We multiplied biomass (g) by true
   metabolizable energy values to estimate species-specific dabbling duck
   food energy availability. We further estimated wetland-specific
   energetic carrying capacity (duck energy days) on the basis of known
   species-specific energetic demands. We determined that duck energy
   days/ha were greater for dabbling ducks in wetlands invaded with common
   reed because they contained more consumable seed energy and less
   consumable invertebrate energy. However, future research should explore
   how accessible these foods are when common reed grass is dense. To aid
   in restoration efforts once common reed is removed by control efforts,
   our results indicate that a robust seed bank exists in the soil strata,
   thus increasing salt-marsh seed biodiversity.},

Title = {Annual Summer Submersed Macrophyte Standing Stocks Estimated From
   Long-Term Monitoring Data in the Upper Mississippi River},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {System-scale restoration efforts within the Upper Mississippi River
   National Wildlife and Fish Refuge have included annual monitoring of
   submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) since 1998 in four representative
   reaches spanning similar to 440 river kilometers. We developed
   predictive models relating monitoring data (site-scale SAV abundance
   indices) to diver-harvested SAV biomass, used the models to
   back-estimate annual standing stock biomass between 1998 and 2018, and
   compared biomass estimates with previous abundance measures. We modeled
   two morphologically distinct groups of SAV with differing sampling
   efficiencies and estimated each separately: the first category included
   only wild celery Vallisneria americana, which has long, unbranched
   leaves and dominates lotic environments, while the second category
   included 17 branched morphology species (e.g., hornwort Ceratophyllum
   demersum and Canadian water weed Elodea canadensis) and dominates lentic
   environments. Wild celery accounted for approximately half of total
   estimated total biomass in the four reaches, combined branched species
   accounted for half, and invasive species (Eurasian watermilfoil
   Myriophyllum spicatum and curly-leaf pondweed Potamogeton crispus), a
   fraction of the branched species, accounted for < 1.5\%. Site-scale SAV
   estimates ranged from 0 to 535 g.m(-2) (dry mass). We observed increases
   in biomass in most areas between 1998 and 2009 and substantial increases
   (e.g., from < 10 g.m(-2) to similar to 125 g.m(-2)) in wild celery in
   extensive impounded areas between 2002 and 2007. Analyses also indicate
   a transitional period in 2007-2010 during which changes in biomass
   trajectories were evident in all reaches and included the start of a
   9-y, similar to 70\% decrease in wild celery biomass in the southernmost
   impounded area. Biomass estimates provided new insights and illustrated
   scales of change that were not previously apparent using traditional
   metrics. The ability to estimate biomass from Long Term Resource
   Monitoring data improves conservation efforts through better
   understanding of changes in habitat and food resources for biota,
   improved goal setting for restoration projects and improved
   quantification of SAV-mediated structural effects such as anchoring of
   sediments and feedbacks with water quality.},

Title = {An Evaluation of Goldeye Life History Characteristics in Two Kansas
   Reservoirs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {243-249},

Abstract = {Goldeye Hiodon alosoides are native through much of Canada and the
   Mississippi River drainage in the United States. Life history
   characteristics have been described for several commercially important
   populations in northern portions of their range, but there is a paucity
   of information available for more southernly populations. Milford and
   Lovewell Reservoirs are in the Kansas River basin and harbor the only
   two lentic Goldeye populations in Kansas. Further, anecdotal
   observations suggest declining population abundance. We sought to
   examine temporal trends in relative abundance and describe current size
   structure, body condition, and population dynamics of these two remnant
   populations. Both populations had decreasing relative abundance over the
   previous 24-y period, although decreases in the Lovewell population were
   most profound. In Milford Reservoir, the median total length of sampled
   Goldeye was 268 mm (minimum = 235 mm; maximum = 431 mm). The estimated
   maximum observed age for Goldeye was 8; however, age-1 Goldeye were the
   most abundant year-class that we collected, accounting for 80\% of
   sampled fish. We fit a von Bertalanffy growth model to back-calculated
   length at annulus formation with parameter estimates of L-infinity = 402
   mm, K = 0.93, and t(0) = 0.29. We collected two individuals at Lovewell
   Reservoir; therefore, no analyses were conducted. Overall, this study
   provides cursory knowledge of two remnant Goldeye populations in Kansas.
   These results can be applied to promote better understanding of their
   ecological role in these reservoirs and other midwestern impoundments
   with remnant populations.},

Title = {A Guide to Sexing Salamanders in Central Appalachia, United States},

Abstract = {Documenting the sex of individuals encountered during wildlife research
   and monitoring activities is important for understanding and tracking
   changes in populations. However, sexing salamanders can be particularly
   difficult because secondary sex characters are often subtle or only
   visible during the breeding season, and guidance on species-specific sex
   determination is lacking from most field guides. The purpose of this
   guide is to provide a reference to assist biologists in the Central
   Appalachian region with identifying sex of live adult salamanders. In
   the main text we provide summary tables and figures to serve as concise
   references in the field. We provide individual species accounts that
   contain concise yet comprehensive information for each species based on
   the published literature, as well as many images depicting sexually
   dimorphic characters. Our focal region encompasses partial or entire
   distributions for 56 species of salamanders in 5 families (Ambystomidae,
   Cryptobranchidae, Plethodontidae, Proteidae, and Salamandridae). We
   identified seven morphological characters that are strongly sexually
   dimorphic and useful for sexing live, nonanesthetized, adult salamanders
   in the field, with males of individual species exhibiting one to five of
   the characters. We identified more than 20 additional characters that
   are weakly sexually dimorphic, difficult to distinguish in the field, or
   species-specific. Our guide serves as a synthesis of sexually dimorphic
   characters for salamanders in Central Appalachia, and we anticipate it
   will have broad value for researchers, monitoring programs, and
   salamander enthusiasts in eastern and central North America.},

Title = {Status of an Anomalous Population of Northern Long-Eared Bats in Coastal
   North Carolina},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {665-678},

Abstract = {The northern long-eared bat Myotis septentrionalis was discovered in
   coastal North Carolina in 2007. Work began in 2015 to document the
   species' distribution and behavior in eastern North Carolina, and the
   known range of the species has expanded from 4 coastal counties to 19.
   Captures occurred in all months of the year and mostly occurred in or
   adjacent to wetland forest. Captures occurred exclusively in the Middle
   Atlantic Coastal Plain ecoregion of the state, and the species has not
   been documented in the Southeastern Plains or Piedmont ecoregions. The
   lack of captures in the middle of the state suggests spatially disjunct
   populations in North Carolina. The bats were observed to be active
   throughout most of the winter and roosted in trees. During late
   fall-winter 2015-2018, 43 bats were tracked to 165 winter roost trees
   located mostly in wetland forest. The species' winter activity in
   coastal North Carolina represents a novel survival strategy as opposed
   to the hibernation behavior it is assumed to use in the rest of its
   range. This portion of the state is nearly devoid of caves or mines
   suitable for hibernacula, but has milder winters with insect activity.
   During spring 2019, 21 reproductive females were captured in the
   northern coastal plain and tracked to 64 maternity roost trees located
   mostly in wetland forest. Pregnant females began to be captured on April
   25 and juveniles on June 16, indicating that pups are likely born in
   late May. Swab samples collected during late fall-winter from species
   susceptible to white-nose syndrome provided no evidence of
   Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Since northern long-eared bats in coastal
   North Carolina are active most of the winter and not dependent upon
   caves or mines for hibernation, they are likely not susceptible to
   white-nose syndrome. With the species in sharp decline elsewhere due to
   white-nose syndrome, this coastal population may serve as a refugium.},

Title = {Using Random Forest Algorithm to Model Cold-Stunning Events in Sea
   Turtles in North Carolina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {531-541},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sea turtle strandings due to cold-stunning are seen when turtles are
   exposed to ocean temperatures that acutely and persistently drop below
   approximately 12 degrees C. In North Carolina, this syndrome affects
   imperiled loggerhead Caretta caretta, green Chelonia mydas, and Kemp's
   ridley Lepidochelys kempii sea turtle species. Based on oceanic and
   meteorological patterns of cold-stunning in sea turtles, we hypothesized
   that we could predict the daily size of cold-stunning events in North
   Carolina using random forest models. We used cold-stunning data from the
   North Carolina Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network from 2010 to
   2015 and oceanic and meteorological data from the National Data Buoy
   Center from 2009 to 2015 to create a random forest model that explained
   99\% of the variance. We explored additional models using the 10 and 20
   most important variables or only oceanic and meteorological variables.
   These models explained similar percentages of variance. The variables
   most frequently found to be important were related to air temperature,
   atmospheric pressure, wind direction, and wind speed. Surprisingly,
   variables associated with water temperature, which is critical from a
   biological perspective, were not among the most important variables
   identified. We also included variables for the mean change in these
   metrics daily from 4 d before the day of stranding. These variables were
   among the most important in several of our models, especially the change
   in mean air temperature from 4 d before stranding to the day of
   stranding. The importance of specific variables from our random forest
   models can be used to guide the selection of future model predictors to
   estimate daily size of cold-stunning events. We plan to apply the
   results of this study to a predictive model that can serve as a warning
   system and to a downscaled climate projection to determine the potential
   impact of climate change on cold-stunning event size in the future.},

Title = {Rating the Potential Suitability of Habitat in Michigan Stream Reaches
   for Arctic Grayling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {540-553},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Present-day environments and anticipated future conditions often pose a
   significant challenge to efforts to reintroduce extirpated species,
   highlighting the need for collaborative, thorough approaches to
   reintroductions. Such is the case in Michigan, where numerous partners
   are working to reintroduce Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus with hopes
   of reestablishing self-sustaining populations. With . 47,000 km of
   coldwater stream habitat in the state and limited numbers of eggs for
   reintroductions, a prioritization framework was needed to provide a
   standardized, finescale method for rating suitability of streams for
   reintroductions. Through facilitated discussions with stakeholders and
   experts, we developed an overall prioritization framework for rating
   Michigan streams with components evaluating a reach's thermal, instream
   habitat, biological, and connectivity characteristics. Within the
   context of this broader framework, we developed the habitat rating
   component for assessing suitability of instream conditions for egg, fry,
   juvenile, and adult life stages of Arctic Grayling. Life-stage-specific
   habitat metrics and scoring criteria from this effort were used to rate
   habitat conditions for 45 reaches in tributaries of Michigan's Manistee
   River, enabling identification of reaches likely having instream habitat
   most suitable for Arctic Grayling. Numbers of reaches meeting or
   exceeding 60\%, 70\%, and 80\% of the maximum score for overall habitat
   suitability were 31, 8, and 1. Upon completion of the fish assemblage
   and connectivity components, the prioritization framework and habitat
   rating process described here will be used for comparing suitability
   among streams throughout the historical range of Arctic Grayling in
   Michigan and guiding reintroduction efforts. Though it will take
   considerable time before instream habitat suitability criteria can be
   evaluated for all life-stages of Arctic Grayling in Michigan, the
   collaborative stream prioritization framework developed for Arctic
   Grayling reintroduction can be readily adapted to reintroduction efforts
   for other species elsewhere.},

Title = {Use of Anthropogenic Nest Materials by Black-Crested Titmice Along an

Abstract = {Numerous avian species use anthropogenic materials in constructing
   nests, particularly in urbanized environments. Researchers have
   demonstrated anthropogenic materials, including plastics, to have both
   beneficial and harmful effects on survival and reproduction. During the
   spring of 2018, we collected 45 black-crested titmouse Baeolophus
   atricristatus nests in San Marcos, Texas, with two objectives: 1) to
   assess and compare the mass and proportion of nest materials along an
   urban gradient and 2) to examine the relationship between nest
   materials, clutch size, and hatching success. We categorized each nest
   based on collection location as urban, residential, park, or rural and
   separated nest materials into six categories: leaves, snake skin, twigs,
   moss, plastic, and nonplastic artificial materials. We then compared raw
   mass and proportion of mass of each nest material among urbanization
   categories. Nests in the urban category were 1.6???1.9 times lighter in
   mass than nests in other locations along the urban gradient (P 1/4 0.01)
   and contained 4???5 times greater proportion, but not mass, of plastic
   compared to nests in all other locations. Nests in residential areas
   contained the greatest mass of combined anthropogenic materials. Neither
   clutch size nor hatching success differed based on urbanization
   category, nest mass, or proportions of anthropogenic or natural nest
   materials. The differences in mass of nests and increased proportion of
   plastics could have been due to a lack of natural nesting materials;
   however, we did not estimate availability of nesting materials at any
   location. Results add to the growing literature that the use of
   anthropogenic materials in nests varies across an urban gradient, and
   the effect of anthropogenic materials on nesting parameters varies among
   species.},

Abstract = {The Florida sandhill crane Antigone canadensis pratensis is designated

   simultaneously occupy potential nests given that they both must be of
   some minimum quality and must be spaced some minimal distance apart.
   Mapping results reveal that nesting habitat is concentrated in the
   central portion of the state, with adequate brooding habitat appearing
   to be the most limiting factor affecting habitat suitability. Assuming
   nesting only occurs in habitat rated as high quality (HSI >= 0.7) and
   spacing between adjacent nests is >= 1,000 m, we conservatively estimate
   that 5,540 nesting pairs of Florida sandhill cranes can potentially be
   supported. Additional nesting pairs may be supported in habitats of
   marginal (HSI >= 0.3; 14,530) to moderate (HSI >= 0.5; 8,723) quality.
   The suitability maps and breeding pair estimates can be used to identify
   important habitat areas to focus crane conservation efforts, determine
   potentially limiting habitat features across the landscape, and
   potentially guide future population monitoring efforts. For example,
   grassland or prairie restoration could be used to potentially increase
   nesting pairs in the southern portion of the state where emergent
   wetlands are abundant but brooding habitat is lacking.},

Abstract = {White-nose syndrome is an introduced fungal disease that has reduced the
   size of hibernating populations of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus by
   90\% across much of eastern North America since 2007. Herein, we report
   the recapture of eight banded little brown bats, all males, with minimum
   ages of 18.6-25.6 y. The recaptures occurred during winter 2019-2020, at
   a hibernaculum in Michigan where white-nose syndrome likely has been
   present since 2013-2014, indicating that these old and apparently
   healthy males are in their seventh season of exposure to the disease.
   Hence, our data suggest that a long life in little brown bats and
   existence of white-nose syndrome are not necessarily incompatible.},

Title = {Efficacy of Visual Surveys for Monitoring Populations of Talus-Roosting
   Bats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {597-608},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Winter cave and mine surveys have been the primary method to monitor
   status of bat populations but they are not equally effective across
   regions or species. Many species of bats that roost in rock outcrops
   during the nonhibernation period are difficult for researchers to
   monitor with existing methods. Although some wildlife biologists have
   speculated visual surveys could be used to monitor populations of bats
   roosting on talus slopes, they did not know the efficacy of the method.
   We used standardized plot-based visual surveys to quantify presence and
   abundance of eastern small-footed bats Myotis leibii on talus slopes in
   Virginia, and studied sources of variation and error. Detection
   probability for talus surveys was relatively high but varied based on
   search effort and site characteristics. Both abundance and detection
   probability varied more among plots within sites than among sites or
   years. In trials with radio-tagged bats to study the causes of false
   negatives, 18\% of bats roosted where surveyors could not see them, and
   18\% of bats were visible but overlooked due to human error. Less
   experienced surveyors counted slightly fewer bats than the principal
   investigator, we suspect because the principal investigator simply found
   the bats first. There also was a slight learning curve among less
   experienced observers. Visual surveys have strong potential to aid in
   the study of bats that roost on talus slopes. Talus surveys, unlike
   longer-established methods to monitor bat populations, provide ways to
   assess error. We recommend using talus surveys to monitor other
   rock-roosting bat species with poorly understood populations, such as
   many species in western North America.},

Title = {Seasonal Sampling Influence on Population Dynamics and Yield of Channel
   Catfish and Walleye in a Large Great Plains Reservoir},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fish samples collected during different times of the year can be subject
   to various biases, but the influence of sampling during different
   seasons on population dynamics and yield metrics in large reservoirs is
   not well reported. This study compared the age structure, growth,
   mortality, and yield estimates of Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus
   and Walleye Sander vitreus collected during spring and fall with
   standardized gill netting in a large Nebraska, USA, reservoir. We
   sampled fish by using the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission
   standardized gill net survey methodology. We estimated ages from
   pectoral spines of Channel Catfish and from sagittal otoliths of
   Walleye, derived age-length keys, and compared mean spring and fall ages
   with t-tests. We compared spring and fall von Bertalanffy growth curves
   with likelihood-ratio tests and mortality estimates from weighted catch
   curves with an analysis of variance. We visually compared spring and
   fall yield estimates derived from yield-per-recruit models to assess the
   impact of variable population dynamics estimates. Estimates of mean age,
   growth coefficient, mean asymptotic length, total annual mortality, and
   yield of Channel Catfish did not differ between spring and fall.
   Conversely, older age structure of Walleye in spring resulted in lower
   estimates of total annual mortality and higher yield than in fall.
   Estimates of mean asymptotic length and growth coefficient differed
   between spring and fall for female Walleye, and mean asymptotic length,
   growth coefficient, and theoretical time at age 0 estimates varied
   between spring and fall for male Walleye. Fall yield estimates were
   substantially lower than spring estimates for both male and female
   Walleye. These results demonstrate that the sample collection season can
   impact population dynamics estimates for certain species, whereas others
   remain relatively unaffected.},

Title = {Carnivore Occupancy within the Early Successional Habitat of New England
   Cottontails},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {192-204},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Predation pressure from carnivores can shape ecological communities and
   has significant consequences for prey species that are declining or
   recovering from historical declines. New England cottontails Sylvilagus
   transitionalis are a species of greatest conservation need in
   Connecticut and are experiencing continued decline associated with
   habitat loss. Restoration of early successional habitat is underway to
   address the most significant threat to their populations. However, one
   of the largest documented sources of mortality is associated with
   several key predators and remains a threat to recovery efforts. We
   sought to develop species-specific occupancy estimates of carnivores in
   early successional habitat and relate our findings to the potential
   recovery of New England cottontails. We conducted camera surveys at 34
   sites in early successional habitat in or near New England cottontail
   focus areas throughout Connecticut and used the program MARK to estimate
   occupancy and detectability from detection data. We found key predators
   in early successional habitat, but their detectability was generally
   low. Occupancy was highest for coyotes Canis latrans, and regional
   occupancy differed only for bobcats Lynx rufus. Covariates that
   influenced parameter estimates in our models included high road
   densities and the intensity of New England cottontail and eastern
   cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus detections. Expanding carnivores,
   particularly coyote and bobcat, may place additional pressure on New
   England cottontail recovery in the state, but restoration efforts that
   promote contiguous habitat and reduce isolated patches where predation
   risk is higher will improve their chances of a long-term recovery.},

Title = {American Woodcock Singing-Ground Survey: Comparison of Four Models for
   Trend in Population Size},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-97},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wildlife biologists monitor the status and trends of American woodcock
   Scolopax minor populations in the eastern and central United States and
   Canada via a singing-ground survey, conducted just after sunset along
   roadsides in spring. Annual analyses of the survey produce estimates of
   trend and annual indexes of abundance for 25 states and provinces,
   management regions, and survey-wide. In recent years, researchers have
   used a log-linear hierarchical model that defines year effects as random
   effects in the context of a slope parameter (the S model) to model
   population change. Recently, researchers have proposed alternative
   models suitable for analysis of singing-ground survey data. Analysis of
   a similar roadside survey, the North American Breeding Bird Survey, has
   indicated that alternative models are preferable for almost all species
   analyzed in the Breeding Bird Survey. Here, we use leave-one-out
   cross-validation to compare model fit for the present singing-ground
   survey model to fits of three alternative models, including a model that
   describes population change as the difference in expected counts between
   successive years (the D model) and two models that include t-distributed
   extra-Poisson overdispersion effects (H models) as opposed to normally
   distributed extra-Poisson overdispersion. Leave-one-out cross-validation
   results indicate that the Bayesian predictive information criterion
   favored the D model, but a pairwise t-test indicated that the D model
   was not significantly better-fitting to singing-ground survey data than
   the S model. The H models are not preferable to the alternatives with
   normally distributed overdispersion. All models provided generally
   similar estimates of trend and annual indexes suggesting that, within
   this model set, choice of model will not lead to alternative conclusions
   regarding population change. However, as in Breeding Bird Survey
   analyses, we note a tendency for S model results to provide slightly
   more extreme estimates of trend relative to D models. We recommend use
   of the D model for future singing-ground survey analyses.},

Title = {Bioacoustic Monitoring Reveals Details of Tricolored Blackbird Breeding
   Phenology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {518-530},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bioacoustic monitoring has been used to study behaviors of organisms
   from insects to whales. Studies using multiple vocalizations of a single
   species have the potential to determine detailed phenology, but to date
   they are rare. We tested whether bioacoustic monitoring of multiple
   gender- and age-specific vocalizations of the imperiled tricolored
   blackbird Agelaius tricolor could provide detailed information on
   reproductive phenology and breeding success. Using inexpensive cell
   phones and free software applications, we collected audio recordings of
   tricolored blackbird colonies during their breeding season. Adding solar
   panels enabled the stations to run autonomously, and use of cellular
   data enabled remote uploading of recordings. Analysis of the presence or
   absence of three vocalizations-male song, female song, and nestling
   call-provided a rich and detailed description of the breeding phenology
   including the dates for courtship; onset of nest building, incubation,
   and nestling hatching; and fledgling departure from nesting colonies.
   The resulting detail was more granular and accurate than comparable data
   from field monitoring, although field monitoring provides data such as
   abundance counts that bioacoustic monitoring does not. This information
   has a wide range of applications to research and conservation, from
   enabling more accurate abundance estimates, to assessing colony success
   or failure with fewer visits, to providing stronger guidance for when a
   colony must be protected from disruption.},

Abstract = {Fisheries managers have a growing interest in the use of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) as a tool for controlling invasive fishes. However, limited
   published data exist on susceptibility of many commonly encountered
   species to elevated CO2 concentrations. Our objective was to estimate
   the 24-h 50\% lethal concentration (LC50) and 95\% lethal concentration
   (LC95) of CO2 for four fishes (Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Common
   Carp Cyprinus carpio, Channel Catfish lctalurus punctatus, and Westslope
   Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi). In the laboratory, we
   exposed juvenile fish to a range of CO2 concentrations for 24 h in
   unpressurized, flow-through tanks. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical
   model to estimate the dose-response relationship for each fish species
   with associated uncertainty, and estimated 24-h LC50 and LC95 values
   based on laboratory trials for each species. The minimum concentration
   inducing mortality differed among cold water-adapted species and warm
   water-adapted species groups: 150 mg CO2/L for Westslope Cutthroat Trout
   and Rainbow Trout and 225 mg CO2/L for Common Carp and Channel Catfish.
   We observed complete mortality at 275 mg CO2/L (38,672 microatmospheres
   {[}mu atm]), 225 mg CO2/L (30,711 mu atm), and 495 mg CO2/L (65,708 mu
   atm {[}Common Carp]; 77,213 mu atm {[}Channel Catfish]) for Westslope
   Cutthroat Trout, Rainbow Trout, and both Common Carp and Channel
   Catfish, respectively. There was evidence of a statistical difference
   between the 24-h LC\% values of Westslope Cutthroat Trout and Rainbow
   Trout (245.0 {[}222.2-272.2] and 190.6 {[}177.2-207.8] mg CO2/L,
   respectively). Additionally, these values were almost half the estimated
   24-h LC95 values for Common Carp and Channel Catfish (422.5
   {[}374.7-474.5] and 434.2 {[}377.2-492.2] mg CO2/L, respectively).
   Although the experimental findings show strong relationships between
   increased CO2 concentration and higher mortality, additional work is
   required to assess the efficacy and feasibility of a CO2 application in
   a field setting.},

Title = {Factors Influencing the Postrelease Movements of Translocated Fishers:
   Implications for Translocation Success},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-67},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Long-distance, postrelease movements of translocated wildlife can be a
   key factor limiting translocation success. Yet, for many species, we
   have little or no understanding of factors that influence postrelease
   movements. Translocations have been important for recovering fisher
   Pekania pennanti populations across the southern portion of their North
   American range. However, little is known about the postrelease movements
   of translocated fishers and how these movements may be influenced by
   demographic or translocation-process factors. To restore fishers in
   Washington State, we moved 90 fishers from central British Columbia and
   released them at nine sites in the Olympic Fisher Recovery Area on the
   Olympic Peninsula of Washington from 2008 to 2010. We evaluated
   postrelease movements of 48 fishers to determine both the distance and
   duration of movements prior to home range establishment. Fishers moved
   extensively following their release. Multimodel selection indicated a
   high level of support for the hypothesis that postrelease movements
   differed by fisher sex and age; whereas, year of release had no apparent
   effect on movements, and release date had only a marginal influence on
   movements. Mean distance (??95\% CI) from a release site to a home range
   was greater for adult males (62.0 ?? 19.6 km) than for juvenile males
   (31.4 ?? 16.0 km), adult females (30.9 ?? 21.1 km), and juvenile females
   (29.0 ?? 13.5 km). Mean number of days from release until home range
   establishment was similar for the sexes; however, the variance in
   movement duration was greater for females. Twentysix of 27 females
   established home ranges over an 11-mo period (December???October), while
   19 of 21 males did so within a 4-mo period (April???July). Mean home
   range sizes differed between males (128.3 ?? 21.1 km2) and females (63.5
   ?? 9.0 km2) and were among the largest reported for the species. A
   greater proportion of females (18 of 27; 67\%) than males (8 of 21;
   38\%) established home ranges within or partially within the recovery
   area. Six females left a previously established home range during the
   breeding season, presumably to find breeding males. Given the large
   distances that fishers can move following release, translocation success
   could be furthered by releasing individuals at fewer sites in the
   interior of large reintroduction areas to facilitate greater exposure to
   a recovery area and greater opportunity to interact with conspecifics
   and potential mates.},

Title = {Efficacy of Visual Encounter Surveys for Coastal Tailed Frog Detection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal tailed frogs Ascaphus truei inhabit montane streams and forested
   habitats in the Coast and Cascade mountains from northern California to
   the Skeena River watershed in northwestern British Columbia. Terrestrial
   adults and juveniles of this cryptic biphasic species are difficult to
   survey as they are small, do not vocalize, and may be associated with
   woody ground structures or subsurface refugia at considerable distances
   from natal streams. We performed a comparative analysis of the detection
   rate of postmetamorphic coastal tailed frogs and ecological factors
   hypothesized to influence detection when conducting visual encounter and
   pitfall trap surveys. We conducted concurrent surveys in northwestern
   British Columbia at six sites over similar time periods using both
   techniques. The average detection rate of visual encounter surveys (mean
   = 0.249, SD = 0.702) was greater than that of pitfall sampling (mean =
   0.138, SD = 0.773) when cool temperatures and high humidity favor
   aboveground movement during the daytime. Light-touch ground searches of
   refuge habitats likely enhanced detection during visual surveys.
   Although the average detection rate was less, pitfall traps provided
   24-h sampling and were less affected by the experience of the surveyor
   and the occurrence of ground cover. In general, variation in seasonal
   behavior influenced detection regardless of method. The relatively
   higher cost and fixed nature of pitfall traps should be weighed against
   the ability to apply more cost-effective visual encounter surveys to a
   greater number of sites.},

Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Consumer-grade side-scan sonar has become a versatile fisheries
   management tool. First applied to assess habitat, its use has expanded
   to surveying fishes in recent years. However, an important consideration
   is the skill and experience of users, which can affect both the accuracy
   and comparability of surveys. To this end, we characterized the ability
   of a small sample of novice users (N = 8) to identify Alligator Gar
   Atractosteus spatula in imagery, as well as the effect of a 2-h training
   exercise on user performance. Prior to training, mean accuracy
   (expressed as the difference between observed and expected counts) among
   participants ranged from -2.6 to 1.3 fish and precision ranged from +/-
   1.2 to +/- 2.4 fish, with the majority of participants underestimating
   the number of Alligator Gar present in the imagery. False positives
   (i.e., identifying Alligator Gar in imagery when none were present) were
   common among participants. Posttraining mean accuracy ranged from -3.1
   to 0 among participants and precision ranged from +/- 1.6 to +/- 3.2
   fish. The frequency of false positives was significantly reduced
   following training, and participants reported significant increases in
   confidence associated with image interpretation. The relatively high
   accuracy and precision we observed prior to training indicated that
   side-scan sonar can be easily incorporated into large-scale fishery
   monitoring efforts for Alligator Gar. However, our results also
   suggested that a rather minimal investment in training can further
   improve consistency and reduce uncertainty among novice users.},

Abstract = {American Eel Anguilla rostrata populations along the Atlantic coast of
   the United States have been in decline over the past several decades.
   One suggested cause of the decline is construction of barriers that
   block access to upstream tributaries where they can spend a significant
   portion of their lives. Success of reintroduction efforts above barriers
   has rarely been evaluated. Within the Susquehanna River (Chesapeake Bay
   watershed), over 1 million eels were released above four major
   downstream barriers in the past decade. We used backpack electrofishing
   and tagging to monitor growth, sexual differentiation, and population
   density of reintroduced eels in Buffalo Creek, a tributary to the
   Susquehanna River (Pennsylvania). From 2012 to 2019, we caught over
   2,000 individuals, tagged more than 1,800, and recaptured 229.
   Recaptured eels provided insight into growth, sexual differentiation,
   and movement. Nearly 99\% of recaptures remained near stocking
   locations. The average growth rate was 47.8 mm/y and ranged between -5.8
   and 116.0 mm/y. Females generally grew significantly faster than males,
   and growth rates of several females exceeded 100 mm/y, a rate typically
   associated with estuarine residents. The population density within
   stocking sites was over 2,300 eels/km, roughly four times higher than
   Susquehanna River tributaries below the most downstream dam, and
   exceeded the target stocking goal of 529 eels/km. While we caught most
   eels in areas sampled near stocking locations, we captured some eels in
   smaller upstream tributaries away from stocking locations. Our study is
   the first to examine how reintroduced eels grow following stocking above
   four major dams on the Susquehanna River. We suggest that managers
   considering moving eels above blockages account for release location and
   density to achieve desired benefits to the overall population.},

Title = {Embracing Ensemble Species Distribution Models to Inform At-Risk Species
   Status Assessments},

Abstract = {Conservation planning depends on reliable information regarding the
   geographic distribution of species. However, our knowledge of species'
   distributions is often incomplete, especially when species are cryptic,
   difficult to survey, or rare. The use of species distribution models has
   increased in recent years and proven a valuable tool to evaluate habitat
   suitability for species. However, practitioners have yet to fully adopt
   the potential of species distribution models to inform conservation
   efforts for information-limited species. Here, we describe a species
   distribution modeling approach for at-risk species that could better
   inform U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's species status assessments and
   help facilitate conservation decisions. We applied four modeling
   techniques (generalized additive, maximum entropy, generalized boosted,
   and weighted ensemble) to occurrence data for four at-risk species
   proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Papaipema
   eryngii, Macbridea caroliniana, Scutellaria ocmulgee, and Balduina
   atropurpurea) in the Southeastern United States. The use of ensemble
   models reduced uncertainty caused by differences among modeling
   techniques, with a consequent improvement of predictive accuracy of
   fitted models. Incorporating an ensemble modeling approach into species
   status assessments and similar frameworks is likely to benefit survey
   efforts, inform recovery activities, and provide more robust status
   assessments for at-risk species. We emphasize that co-producing species
   distribution models in close collaboration with species experts has the
   potential to provide better calibration data and model refinements,
   which could ultimately improve reliance and use of model outputs.},

Abstract = {The North American beaver Castor canadensis is widely recognized for its
   ability to modify freshwater habitats and facilitate changes in
   community composition. However, the seasonal composition of terrestrial
   wildlife at littoral beaver lodges remains poorly described, even though
   beaver lodges are distinctive semipermanent features of the
   terrestrial-aquatic interface and thus important resources for wildlife.
   Over 17 months, we used camera trapping, weather data, and satellite
   vegetation data to determine how vertebrate species richness and
   seasonal changes in community composition are associated with beaver
   activity and beaver lodges in a temperate artificial pond. Our results
   indicate clear changes in the composition of beaver lodge visitors
   across seasons. Moreover, there was not a strong association of species
   richness with beaver activity, vegetative condition, or weather
   condition. Littoral beaver lodges are likely important foraging sites
   for a wide range of taxa throughout the year. Our findings highlight the
   importance of beaver lodges in facilitating seasonal interactions and
   variation in species composition. We hope our work can be used as a
   baseline to investigate the importance of beaver lodges in promoting
   diversity at the terrestrial-aquatic interface.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Many applications in wildlife management require knowledge of the sex of
   individual animals. The Yuma Ridgway's rail Rallus obsoletus yumanensis
   is an endangered marsh bird with monomorphic plumage and secretive
   behaviors, thereby complicating sex determination in field studies. We
   collected morphometric measurements from 270 adult Yuma Ridgway's rails
   and quantified the plumage and mandible color of 91 of those individuals
   throughout their geographic range to evaluate intersexual differences in
   morphology and coloration. We genetically sexed a subset of adult Yuma
   Ridgway's rails (n = 101) and used these individuals to determine the
   optimal combination of measurements (based on discriminant function
   analyses) to distinguish between sexes. Males averaged significantly
   larger than females in all measurements, and the optimal discriminant
   function contained whole leg, culmen, and tail measurements and
   classified correctly 97.8\% (95\% CI: 92.5-100.0\%) of genetically sexed
   individuals. We used two additional functions that classified correctly
   >= 95.6\% of genetically sexed Yuma Ridgway's rails to assign sex to
   individuals with missing measurements. These simple models provide
   managers and researchers with a practical tool to determine the sex of
   Yuma Ridgway's rails based on morphometric measurements. Although color
   measurements were not in the most accurate discriminant functions, we
   quantified subtle intersexual differences in the color of mandibles and
   greater coverts of Yuma Ridgway's rails. These results document
   sex-specific patterns in coloration that allow future researchers to
   test hypotheses to determine the mechanisms underlying sex-based
   differences in plumage coloration.},

Title = {How Many Ciscoes Are Needed for Stocking in the Laurentian Great Lakes?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-49},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Historically, Cisco Coregonus artedi and deepwater ciscoes Coregonus
   spp. were the most abundant and ecologically important fish species in
   the Laurentian Great Lakes, but anthropogenic influences caused nearly
   all populations to collapse by the 1970s. Fishery managers have begun
   exploring the feasibility of restoring populations throughout the basin,
   but questions regarding hatchery propagation and stocking remain. We
   used historical and contemporary stock-recruit parameters previously
   estimated for Ciscoes in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior, with
   estimates of age-1 Cisco rearing habitat (broadly defined as total
   hectares <= 80 m depth) and natural mortality, to estimate how many fry
   (5.5 mo posthatch), fall fingerling (7.5 mo posthatch), and age-1 (at
   least 12 mo posthatch) hatchery-reared Ciscoes are needed for stocking
   in the Great Lakes to mimic recruitment rates in Lake Superior, a lake
   that has undergone some recovery. Estimated stocking densities suggested
   that basin-wide stocking would require at least 6.41 x 10(8) fry, 4.69 x
   10(8) fall fingerlings, or 3.43 x 10(8) age-1 fish for a simultaneous
   restoration effort targeting historically important Cisco spawning and
   rearing areas in Lakes Huron, Michigan, Erie, Ontario, and Saint Clair.
   Numbers required for basin-wide stocking were considerably greater than
   current or planned coregonine production capacity, thus simultaneous
   stocking in the Great Lakes is likely not feasible. Provided current
   habitat conditions do not preclude Cisco restoration, managers could
   maximize the effectiveness of available production capacity by
   concentrating stocking efforts in historically important spawning and
   rearing areas, similar to the current stocking effort in Saginaw Bay,
   Lake Huron. Other historically important Cisco spawning and rearing
   areas within each lake (listed in no particular order) include 1)
   Thunder Bay in Lake Huron, 2) Green Bay in Lake Michigan, 3) the islands
   near Sandusky, Ohio, in western Lake Erie, and 4) the area near
   Hamilton, Ontario, and Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our study focused
   entirely on Ciscoes but may provide a framework for describing future
   stocking needs for deepwater ciscoes.},

Title = {Evidence Dorsal Spine Removal is Nonlethal and Unharmful for Largemouth
   Bass in Florida},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {190-196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Florida Bass Micropterus
   floridanus, and their intergrade are socially and economically valuable
   sport fish. In the southeastern United States, it is customary for
   fisheries personnel to age black bass Micropterus species using sagittal
   otoliths, which requires killing the fish. Presently, fisheries managers
   and black bass anglers show reluctance to sacrifice large individuals.
   Development of a nonlethal ageing technique would not only allay
   concerns of sacrificing large black bass, but it could offer a pathway
   for new research, management, and conservation. We excised dorsal spines
   III-V from Largemouth Bass in Florida varying from 30 to 57 cm total
   length to evaluate the effects of the procedure on survival over 35 d.
   No mortalities were observed for fish with excised dorsal spines, and
   experiment-wide survival was 0.94 (0.87-1.00; 95\% confidence interval).
   No significant differences in survival, weight change, or incidence of
   external injuries were observed between control and excised fish. The
   areas of spine excision healed with no visible infection or inflammation
   at the conclusion of the experiment. Therefore, dorsal spine removal
   offers managers a nonlethal option for collecting ageing structures of
   adult Largemouth Bass in Florida, including large individuals, and this
   result likely extends to other Micropterus species as well.},

Title = {Using Environmental DNA to Monitor the Spatial Distribution of the
   California Tiger Salamander},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {609-617},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global efforts to conserve declining amphibian populations have
   necessitated the development of rapid, reliable, and targeted survey
   methods. Environmental DNA surveys offer alternative or complementary
   methods to traditional amphibian survey techniques. The California tiger
   salamander Ambystoma californiense (CTS) is endemic to California, where
   it breeds in vernal pools. In the past 25 y, CTS has faced a 21\% loss
   of known occurrences, largely through habitat loss, and it is threatened
   by hybridization with an introduced congener. Protecting and managing
   remaining CTS populations rely on accurately monitoring changes in their
   spatial distribution. Current monitoring practices typically use dip-net
   surveys that are time-consuming and prone to false negative errors. To
   provide a new resource for monitoring and surveying larval CTS, we
   designed an assay and tested it on water samples collected from 29
   vernal pools at two locations in California. We compared environmental
   DNA results to contemporaneous dip-net surveying results and found the
   assay agreed with positive dip-net results in 100\% of cases. In several

Abstract = {We evaluated how three widths of buffer zones on greater than or equal
   to 100-ha wetlands (240, 300, and 390 m) and rivers (10, 20, and 30 m)
   would help meet watershed conservation goals in the Upper Peninsula of
   Michigan, USA, and whether doing so also would protect each of the
   predominant types of terrestrial natural communities across the
   landscape. The use of buffer zones (even the narrowest widths assessed)
   around wetlands and riparian zones met or exceeded conservation targets
   in 75\% of watersheds and greater than or equal to 85\% of subwatersheds
   evaluated. Wetlands and riparian zones with buffers captured each of the
   predominant types of terrestrial natural community in Michigan's Upper
   Peninsula, but not proportionately to their availability across the
   entire landscape. Our work demonstrates that a landscape-conservation
   approach focused on wetlands and riparian zones with buffers can
   conserve terrestrial, wetland, and riparian ecosystems across Michigan's
   Upper Peninsula and may also be applicable in other areas where mapping
   of wetlands and rivers occurs.},

Title = {Northern Bobwhite Occupancy Patterns on Multiple Spatial Scales Across
   Arkansas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {502-512},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus populations have been rapidly
   declining in the eastern, central, and southern United States for
   decades. Land use change and an incompatibility between northern
   bobwhite resource needs and human land use practices have driven
   declines. Here, we applied occupancy analyses on two spatial scales
   (state level and ecoregion level) to more than 5,000 northern bobwhite
   surveys conducted over 6 y across the entire state of Arkansas to
   explore patterns in occupancy and land use variables, and to identify
   priority areas for management and conservation. At the state level,
   northern bobwhite occupied 29\% of sites and northern bobwhite were most
   likely to occur in areas with a high percentage of early successional
   habitat (grassland, pasture, and shrubland). The statewide model
   predicted that northern bobwhite were likely to occur (> 75\% predicted
   occupancy) in , 20\% of the state. Arkansas is comprised of five
   distinct ecoregions, and analyses at the ecoregion spatial scale showed
   that habitat associations of northern bobwhite could vary between
   ecoregions. For example, early successional habitat best predicted
   northern bobwhite occupancy in both the Arkansas River Valley and Ozark
   Mountains ecoregions, and other habitat associations such as the
   proportion of herbaceous habitat and hay-pasture habitat, respectively,
   further refined predictions. Contrastingly, richness of land cover
   classes alone best predicted northern bobwhite occupancy in the Ouachita
   Mountains ecoregion. Ecoregion-level models were thus more discerning
   than the state-level model and should be more helpful to managers in
   identifying priority conservation areas. However, in two of five
   ecoregions, surveys too rarely encountered northern bobwhite to
   accurately predict their occurrence. We found that likely occupied
   northern bobwhite habitat lay primarily on private properties (95\%),
   but that numerous public entities own and manage land identified as
   suitable or likely occupied. We conclude that management of northern
   bobwhite in Arkansas could benefit from cooperation among state,
   federal, and military partners, as well as surrounding private
   landowners and that ecoregion-specific models may be more useful in
   identifying priority areas for management. Our approach incorporates
   multiple landscape scales when using remote sensing technology in
   conjunction with monitoring data and could have important application
   for the management of northern bobwhite and other grassland bird
   species.},

Title = {A Case of Mistaken Identity: Genetic and Morphological Evidence for the

Abstract = {We report genetic and morphological evidence for the presence of Redeye
   Bass Micropterus coosae, in the Verde River of Arizona, previously
   thought to be Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. We performed
   meristic measurements on 15 individuals sampled from the Upper Verde
   River Wildlife Area, Yavapai County, Arizona. Meristic data for lateral
   line scales, scales above lateral line, and scales below lateral line
   were all consistent with Redeye Bass and not Smallmouth Bass. We
   analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data to determine whether one
   of the black bass (Genus Micropterus) species historically introduced to
   the Verde River was Redeye Bass and whether they persist in the system.
   We extracted DNA from fin clips of five individuals for phylogenetic
   analysis of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide thorn hydrogen (NADH)
   dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) mitochondrial gene and for analysis of
   nuclear DNA using a diagnostic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
   panel. Results of the ND2 genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
   indicated that these fish likely originated from native Redeye Bass
   stock from the Coosa River system of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.
   Similarly, nuclear SNP data from the five individuals collected from the
   Verde River aligned with Redeye Bass reference genotypes based on
   STRUCTURE analysis. These results support the hypothesis that at least
   one of the introductions of black bass in Arizona's Verde River founded
   a previously unrecognized population of Redeye Bass. Further work is
   needed to determine the extent of the Redeye Bass presence in Arizona,
   whether Smallmouth Bass are also present in the Verde River system, and
   if hybridization of Redeye Bass and other black basses is occurring.},

Title = {Filling Knowledge Gaps for a Threatened Species: Age and Growth of Green

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Green Sturgeon Acipenser medirostris is an anadromous, long-lived
   species that is distributed along the Pacific coast of North America.
   Green Sturgeon is vulnerable to global change because of its sensitive
   life history (e.g., delayed maturation) and few spawning locations. The
   persistence of Green Sturgeon is threatened by habitat modification,
   altered flows, and rising river temperatures. In 2006, because of
   persistent stressors, the U.S. Endangered Species Act listed the
   southern distinct population segment as threatened. Despite increased
   research efforts on this species after the listing, substantial gaps in
   basic population information for Green Sturgeon remain. We present the
   only published information on age structure and growth of a threatened
   population of Green Sturgeon. By analyzing archived fin rays collected
   from 1984 to 2016, we revealed highly variable growth among individuals.
   We detected several age classes from 0 to 26 y and found similar growth
   rates of southern distinct population segment Green Sturgeon compared
   with northern population Green Sturgeon. Although limited, this analysis
   is an important first step to understanding Green Sturgeon population
   dynamics and highlights critical research needs.},

   first known occurrence of Bigscale Logperch in Arizona. Further, three

   June 21 and September 26, 2017-Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus,
   White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma

Title = {Slow and Steady: Gradual Drawdown of Private Wetlands Supports
   Shorebirds During Northbound Migration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {562-571},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Grasslands Ecological Area is the largest contiguous wetland complex
   in California's Central Valley and is a stronghold for hundreds of
   thousands of waterbirds. Primarily managed for waterfowl habitat and
   forage production, landowners of these privately owned seasonal wetlands
   in the Grassland Ecological Area typically flood the wetlands in the
   fall and dewater them the following spring in February and March. These
   wetlands support large populations of nonbreeding shorebirds and other
   waterbirds in winter. When the number of migratory shorebirds using the
   region peaks in mid-April, landowners have already dewatered most
   wetlands. The mismatch in the timing of available habitat and the
   habitat needs of migrating shorebirds contributes to the observed
   deficit of shorebird habitat in the Central Valley in spring. Working
   with private landowners, we developed and tested a wetland management
   practice designed to increase the amount of shallow-water habitat
   available to shorebirds in April by delaying the drawdown and reducing
   water levels more slowly (gradual drawdown) relative to the traditional
   management practice. On average, we found that wetlands managed with
   gradual drawdown provided over twice as much shorebird habitat,
   contributing up to 26\% of the overall shorebird habitat objective for
   the Central Valley. Wetlands managed with gradual drawdown supported up
   to 21 times more migratory shorebirds during peak migration and a
   greater number of shorebird species than traditionally managed wetlands.
   Our results demonstrate the potential of working with private landowners
   to implement small changes in wetland management that can have a large
   impact in meeting regional conservation objectives for migratory
   shorebirds.},

Abstract = {Shallow areas of drawdown reservoirs are often devoid of adequate fish
   habitat due to degradation associated with unnatural and relatively
   invariable cycles of exposure and flooding. One method of enhancing fish
   habitat in these areas is to sow exposed shorelines with agricultural
   plants to provide structure once flooded. It remains unclear if some
   plants may be more suitable than others to provide effective fish
   habitat. To determine the fish habitat potential of various crops, we
   performed a replicated tank experiment evaluating the selection of
   agricultural plants by prey and predator fishes with and without the
   presence of the other. We submerged diverse treatments of potted plants
   in outdoor mesocosms stocked with prey and/or predator fish and
   monitored selection of plant species, stem density, and stem height over
   0.5-h trials. Prey fish selected the densest vegetation, and selection
   was accentuated when a predator was present. Predators selected the
   second highest stem density and were more active when prey were present.
   Prey schooling was increased by predation risk, suggesting that cover
   was insufficient to outweigh the advantages of increased group size. Our
   data indicate that the perception of cover quality is reciprocally
   context dependent on predator-prey interactions for both predator and
   prey. Applications of the two most selected plant treatments in this
   study could enhance structural habitat for both predator and prey fishes
   in reservoirs, adding to their already reliable functionality as
   supplemental forage crops for terrestrial wildlife.},

Title = {Effect of Discharge on Hatching and Growth of Age-0 Black Bass in Two
   Southeastern US Rivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {434-452},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We examined the influence of variable discharge on hatching and age-0
   growth for fluvial specialist and habitat generalist species of black
   bass Micropterus spp. in two southeastern U.S. rivers, the Flint River,
   Georgia (unregulated), and the Tallapoosa River, Alabama (regulated by
   several hydropower dams). Between 2008 and 2010, we collected 285
   Largemouth Bass M. salmoides (generalist) and 254 Shoal Bass M.
   cataractae (specialist) from two reaches of the Flint River. In
   2010-2011, we collected 309 Alabama Bass M. henshalli (generalist) and
   216 Redeye Bass M. coosae (specialist) from two regulated reaches and
   one unregulated reach of the Tallapoosa River. Successful hatching of
   black bass in both rivers generally occurred from late March to early
   June when water levels were low and stable. Hatching distributions of
   all black bass were generally unimodal with little evidence of spawning
   disruption, except for Alabama Bass in the most-regulated reach of the
   Tallapoosa River, which appeared to be disrupted by large discharge
   events. Mean growth of both species in the Flint River varied from 0.64
   to 0.82 mm/d across reaches and years; Shoal Bass generally grew faster
   than Largemouth Bass in all reach-year combinations. Largemouth Bass
   growth was inversely correlated to discharge variation in one reach, but
   Shoal Bass growth was not correlated to discharge variation in either
   reach. Alabama Bass and Redeye Bass growth rates in the Tallapoosa River
   were similar to rates observed for congeners in the Flint River; Alabama
   Bass grew faster than Redeye Bass. Growth of both species was inversely
   related to discharge variation in five of six reach-species
   combinations; the only exception was for Redeye Bass in the
   lessregulated reach. Results from this study suggest that variable
   discharge has less influence on successful reproduction of black bass
   than was reported for other fishes, but growth may be more affected by
   discharges resulting from anthropogenic sources than those associated
   with the natural regime.},

Abstract = {Shortnose Chasmistes brevirostris and Lost River Suckers Deltistes
   luxatus endemic to the Klamath River Basin on the California-Oregon
   border have experienced dramatic population declines in parallel with
   many other Catostomid species. Captive propagation has become a key
   element of many endangered fish recovery programs, although there is
   little evidence of their success in restoring or recovering fish
   populations. We initiated a novel rearing program for Klamath suckers in
   2016 with the goal of developing a husbandry strategy that better
   balances the ecological, genetic, and demographic risks associated with
   captive propagation. We collected 4,306 wild-spawned Klamath sucker
   larvae from a major spawning tributary May-June 2016 and reared them at
   a geothermal facility established through a partnership with a local
   landowner and aquaculture expert. Mortality during collection was <1\%.
   We reared larvae in glass aquaria for 17-78 d until they reached
   approximately 30 mm total length, upon which we moved them to round
   fiberglass tanks for 14-46 d or until reaching approximately 60 mm total
   length. Overall survival of larvae to ponding for final growout was
   71\%. Larval tank-rearing survival was 98\% for 37 d until an isolated
   fish health incident affected three aquarium populations, reducing
   survival to transfer to 75\%. Survival after transfer to round
   fiberglass tanks for 14-46 d was 94\%. This study outlines the first
   successful collection and early life-history husbandry of wild-spawned
   endangered Klamath suckers that we are aware of.},

Abstract = {Conservation efforts in rural landscapes seek to improve the
   multifunctional nature of land uses for people and the biotic
   communities that support them. In these environments, existing turfgrass
   lawns mowed routinely through the summer present an opportunity where
   changes in management from intensively managed monocultures to diverse
   native perennial vegetation can stack environmental benefits by
   improving soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Conversion
   of lawns to pollinator habitat can help achieve continental goals of
   reversing declines in high-profile species such as the monarch butterfly
   Danaus plexippus and native bees. Here, we examine the financial
   implications for landowners and managers considering conversion of lawns
   to pollinator habitat in rural landscapes. We examined financial factors
   over a 10-y management horizon in three unique scenarios with a range of
   expenses: self-maintenance of lawns, contracted maintenance of lawns,
   and establishment and management of pollinator habitat. Our analyses
   indicate conversion to pollinator habitat was appreciably less expensive
   (\$54-\$167.acre(-1).y(-1)) than continued self-care
   (\$637-\$1,007.acre(-1).y(-1)) or contracted care
   (\$326-\$1,034.acre(-1).y(-1)) of lawns over a 10-y period. These
   results establish the financial benefits for landowners or land managers
   considering an alternative management paradigm of existing lawns. These
   financial benefits complement existing literature, demonstrating
   multiple ecological benefits of diverse native perennial vegetation.},

Title = {Population Trends for Chinook and Summer Chum Salmon in Two Yukon River

Abstract = {An essential management objective of the Yukon Delta and Koyukuk
   National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is to conserve fish and wildlife
   populations and habitats in their natural diversity. In keeping with
   this objective, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service installed weirs in
   two tributaries of the Yukon River, the East Fork Andreafsky and Gisasa
   rivers, in 1994 to collect information on salmon populations that used
   them. The weirs have been in operation for >23 y. Chinook Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha and summer Chum Salmon O. keta were counted and sampled for
   various demographic data each year as they migrated through the weirs to
   upstream spawning areas. Here we examine this record of population data
   to describe and compare long-term variation in run abundance, run
   timing, length and age structure, sex composition, and production for
   these salmon populations. Fishery managers often look to multiple
   monitoring projects in-season seeking corroboration of observed run
   qualities; therefore, we also considered whether Yukon River main-stem
   indicators of abundance were correlated with these tributary
   escapements. Our analyses suggest long-term stability of these
   populations despite large annual variations in most metrics we examined.
   Annual escapements have varied by factors of 3-5 for Chinook Salmon and
   >23 for summer Chum Salmon, yet only the Chinook Salmon population in
   the Gisasa River appears to be declining. Main-stem abundance indicators
   were not correlated with Chinook Salmon escapements but were strongly
   correlated with summer Chum Salmon escapements. Run timing has varied
   annually by as much as a week earlier or later than average for all four
   populations with no trend over time. Mean age of the Chinook Salmon
   populations declined over time but remained stable for the summer Chum
   Salmon populations. Chinook Salmon populations in the East Fork
   Andreafsky and Gisasa rivers averaged 35\% and 28\% female,
   respectively. Both summer Chum Salmon populations averaged close to 50\%
   female. Length at age has been stable or slightly declining for all four
   populations. Production over time was strongly correlated within species
   for populations in the two rivers, and averaged >1 recruit/spawner for
   all populations except Chinook Salmon from the Gisasa River. We discuss
   these findings in the context of major changes in the fishery and the
   environments these populations experience.},

   used to accelerate growth in captivity prior to release in the wild. We
   explored the effect of size at release, among other potential factors,
   on postrelease survival in head-started Mojave desert tortoises Gopherus
   agassizii. Juvenile tortoises were reared for different durations of
   captivity (2-7 y) and under varying husbandry protocols, resulting in a
   wide range of juvenile sizes (68-145 mm midline carapace length) at
   release. We released all animals (n = 78) in the Mojave National
   Preserve, California, United States, on 25 September 2018. Release size
   and surface activity were the only significant predictors of fate during
   the first year postrelease. Larger sized head-starts had higher
   predicted survival rates when compared with smaller individuals. This
   trend was also observed in animals of the same age but reared under
   different protocols, suggesting that accelerating the growth of
   head-started tortoises may increase efficiency of head-starting programs
   without decreasing postrelease success. Excluding five missing animals,
   released head-starts had 82.2\% survival in their first year postrelease
   (September 2018-September 2019), with all mortalities resulting from
   predation. No animals with >90-mm midline carapace length were predated
   by ravens. Our findings suggest the utility of head-starting may be
   substantially improved by incorporating indoor rearing to accelerate
   growth. Target release size for head-started chelonians will vary among
   head-start programs based on release site conditions and
   project-specific constraints.},

Abstract = {In the past two decades, Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge has been
   increasingly recognized as important habitat for both breeding and
   migratory shorebirds. North American snowy plovers Charadrius nivosus in
   particular rely on the nearly 5,000-ha salt flat at Salt Plains National
   Wildlife Refuge, which thousands use as breeding and stopover habitat.
   Elsewhere on the Southern Great Plains, decadal declines up to 75\%
   within snowy plover subpopulations have been documented and attributed
   to vegetation encroachment, increased rates of nest predation, and
   decreased availability of fresh surface water. Despite many attempts to
   estimate this species' abundance across the continent, to date, no known
   attempt at distance sampling of snowy plovers has occurred. To address
   this paucity of data, we assessed feasibility of distance sampling
   methods to accurately estimate snowy plover abundance and detectability.
   Distance sampling surveys (2017-2018) indicated high detection
   probability (P = 0.80) and the population abundance estimate across the
   salt flat extrapolated to 3,307 individuals. The distance-sampling
   population abundance estimate is lower than population abundance
   estimates determined by two previous studies within the past decade but
   far greater than 2,105 estimated for a study in 2006. Overall, distance
   sampling snowy plovers at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge proved to
   be an effective addition to preestablished survey protocols but further
   investigation is needed to compare accuracy and precision of methods
   used in this study, annual surveys conducted by Salt Plains National
   Wildlife Refuge, and other potential snowy plover surveys.},

Title = {Demographic and Evolutionary History of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon
   in the Upper Missouri River},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {124-143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Natural-origin Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus in the upper
   Missouri River are predicted to become extirpated as early as 2024. To
   aid in recovery efforts for this endangered species, we used genetic
   data from 17 microsatellite loci to infer demographic and evolutionary
   history of Pallid Sturgeon and a sympatric Shovelnose Sturgeon S.
   platorynchus. Our data indicated a recent sundering of geneflow between
   these species by overlapping allele size distributions at all loci and
   low level of genetic divergence (F-ST = 0.10). Tests for recent
   bottlenecks by using heterozygosity excess or allele frequency
   mode-shift tests indicated demographic stability for both species, while
   the M ratio identified that historic bottlenecks occurred in both
   species. Estimates of historical effective population size (N-e), based
   on coalescent modeling of allele size distribution, suggested that the
   geographic expansion of these species into the upper Missouri River
   during the late Pleistocene was associated with 10- to 19-fold
   reductions in N-e. By contrast contemporary estimates of N-e based on
   linkage disequilibrium revealed that Shovelnose Sturgeon (N-e = 2,983)
   had approximately 10 times greater N-e than Pallid Sturgeon (N-e = 254).
   Our results are consistent with the recent collapse of Pallid Sturgeon
   being caused by dam construction, which occurred between 1930 and 1965.
   Fortunately, genetic diversity remaining in this long-lived species
   provided an opportunity to conserve predam Pallid Sturgeon genetic
   diversity via a successful captive breeding program. We provide
   recommendations to address key conservation needs, including how to
   incorporate our estimate of N-e/adult census size of 0.26 (95\%
   confidence interval of 0.16-0.47) into setting demographic recovery
   goals for Pallid Sturgeon.},

Title = {Assessment of Cereal Grain Waste Densities to Aid Waterfowl Conservation

Abstract = {Postharvest waste seed from cereal grains is a major dietary component
   of waterfowl in the Klamath Basin in northeastern California and
   southeastern Oregon, a region that plays host to over a million
   waterfowl annually. Understanding food abundance is critical to local
   waterfowl management; therefore, we conducted a study in 2008 to
   investigate waste grain densities in barley, oat, and wheat fields. We
   used hierarchal mixed effect models to assess several factors that may
   affect waste grain densities postharvest. We also compared the effects
   of residue management practices to measure the effect of these
   treatments. To understand the scope of postharvest practices, we
   conducted a weekly road survey to document treatments applied to fields
   in our study area. We found that region best explained the variance of
   postharvest waste grain in barley fields, where the Tule Lake region had
   89\% greater densities than Lower Klamath. Neither harvester age nor
   baling affected waste grain in oats fields. In wheat fields, the model
   containing region and lodging ranked highest, where the Tule Lake region
   had 66\% greater waste densities than Lower Klamath, and lodging
   increased waste grain by 70\%. Burning did not reduce waste grain in
   barley or oat fields. Chisel-disking reduced waste grain by 94\% in
   wheat fields compared with postharvest. Our field treatment survey found
   that 70\% of barley fields were untreated while 18\% were disked and
   13\% were burned and flooded. We estimated that 82\% of oat fields were
   burned postharvest, while 18\% were burned and flooded. In wheat, 61\%
   of fields were left untreated, while 16\% were disked, 8\% were
   chisel-plowed, and 7\% were flooded postharvest. Flooding and burning
   occurred primarily on National Wildlife Refuges, while disking,
   chisel-plowing, and postharvest irrigation occurred solely on private
   properties. Our results indicate that reducing tillage treatments would
   boost accessibility of cereal grain food resources to waterfowl in the
   Klamath Basin, and incentives to flood grain fields on private
   properties should be considered for the same purpose when and where
   possible.},

Abstract = {Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis in southern Appalachian Mountains
   streams of the United States occur at the southernmost portion of their
   native range, and occupy small, isolated, and low-productivity headwater
   streams. The existing standard weight (W-s) equation is applicable only
   to Brook Trout > 120 mm total length (TL), but many individuals in the
   region are smaller than this minimum size threshold due to their habitat
   characteristics. Here, we developed a new W-s equation for Brook Trout
   in southern Appalachian Mountains streams using length-weight data on
   72,502 individuals. The weighted quadratic empirical-percentile method
   minimized length-related bias in relative weight compared to the
   regression-line-percentile and weighted linear empirical-percentile
   methods. The proposed W-s equation was: log(10)W = -3.364 + 1.378 x
   log(10)L + 0.397 x (log(10)L)(2), where W was weight (g) and L was TL
   (mm). The new equation characterized body condition of Brook Trout in
   southern Appalachian Mountains streams more accurately than the existing

Abstract = {Many cave-roosting bats are declining in number throughout their range
   because of multiple threats, including disease, disturbance by humans,
   and habitat loss. Successful conservation of cave-roosting bats requires
   an understanding of the roles of microclimate, cave structure, and the
   surrounding landscape on the distribution and abundance of bats, and in
   particular, the use of winter cave roosts. Cave bats have been well
   studied in temperate climates, but we know little about these bats in
   subtropical climates. From 2015 to 2017, we conducted 399 winter surveys
   of 162 caves in Florida to evaluate factors affecting the presence and
   abundance of bats at cave roosts. We also determined whether
   temperatures at these cave roosts were suitable for Pseudogymnoascus
   destructans, the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome. Across all 3 y,
   we detected three species of bats: tricolored bat Perimyotis subflavus
   in 126 (77.8\%) caves, southeastern myotis Myotis austroriparius in 51
   (31.5\%) caves, and a single Rafinesque's big-eared bat Corynorhinus
   rafinesquii. We analyzed the presence of both tricolored bats and
   southeastern myotis in caves by using mixed-effects models with a
   binomial distribution and the number of tricolored bats by using
   generalized linear mixed-effects models with a Poisson error
   distribution. Tricolored bat presence was significantly and positively
   influenced by a cooler cave surface temperature, larger cave entrance
   size, a single entrance, and the presence of solution holes. Tricolored
   bat abundance increased in longer, cooler caves that had solution holes,
   a single, unobstructed entrance, and had no signs of flooding.
   Southeastern myotis presence was positively associated with longer,
   domed caves. To be most effective, conservation efforts in subtropical
   climates should focus on caves with the identified characteristics. More
   than 90\% of caves surveyed each year had a cave interior surface
   temperature below the upper critical growth limit for P. destructans
   (19.8 degrees C), indicating that most Florida caves are suitable for
   growth of P. destructans. Therefore, regular monitoring of winter bat
   populations in subtropical caves may be important for detecting P.
   destructans and white-nose syndrome.},

Abstract = {Sacramento Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus grandis is a potamodromous species
   endemic to mid- and low-elevation streams and rivers of Central and
   Northern California. Adults are known to undertake substantial
   migrations, typically associated with spawning, though few data exist on
   the extent of these migrations. Six Sacramento Pikeminnow implanted with
   passive integrated transponder tags in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
   were detected in Cottonwood and Mill creeks, tributaries to the
   Sacramento River in Northern California, between April 2018 and late
   February 2020. Total travel distances ranged from 354 to 432 km, the
   maximum of which exceeds the previously known record by at least 30 km.
   These observations add to a limited body of knowledge regarding the
   natural history of Sacramento Pikeminnow and highlight the importance of
   the river-estuary continuum as essential for this migratory species.},

Title = {Effects of Adult Biomass and Environmental Conditions on Bigheaded Carp
   Reproductive Output},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bighead Carp Hypothalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp Hypothalmichthys
   moltrix (hereafter collectively referred to as Bigheaded Carp) have
   spread throughout the majority of the Mississippi River since the 1970s.
   The current northern invasion edge of Bigheaded Carp in the Upper
   Mississippi River (UMR) spans between Pools 14 and 20 because of limited
   passage at Lock and Dam (LD) 19. Mechanisms limiting adult Bigheaded
   Carp abundance above LD19 are unknown but may be due in part to lack of
   reproductive success influenced by adult abundance and environmental
   factors. Our objective was to investigate how relative adult biomass and
   river temperature and discharge affect maximum annual Bigheaded Carp
   larval production in the UMR using a Ricker stock-recruitment model.
   Adult Bigheaded Carp relative biomass (kg/h) was estimated annually with
   boat electrofishing and larvae were collected every 10 d between May and
   August 2014-2017 in Pools 14-20 in the UMR. Adult relative biomass
   ranged from 0.0 to 880.9 kg/h, whereas maximum annual larval densities
   ranged from 0.0 to 2,869.4 larvae/m(3). After accounting for variability
   among pools and years, the most supported linear Ricker
   stock-recruitment model indicated the number of recruits per spawner
   decreased with increasing adult relative biomass and increased with mean
   discharge. Our results highlight the importance of adult biomass and
   river discharge conditions for reproduction of Bigheaded Carp along
   leading edges of invasion. Management strategies that aim to maintain
   low adult abundance where reproduction is not yet occurring could help
   limit population increases via reproduction, whereas reducing high adult
   biomass (e.g., commercial harvest, barriers) may result in greater
   Bigheaded Carp reproductive output in the UMR.},

Title = {Size-Specific Advantage in Shelter Competition Between the Mountain
   Madtom and Crayfishes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-409},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shelter is a crucial component to many species' survival, and when
   shelter becomes limited, resulting competition can have negative effects
   on growth and survival. In Little Chucky Creek, a tributary to the
   Nolichucky River in Tennessee, the severe population decline of Chucky
   Madtoms Noturus crypticus has been partially attributed to an increase
   in the abundance of cavity-dwelling crayfish after the establishment of
   two nonnative species. Although it has been suggested that the crayfish
   exclude the cavity-dwelling fish from shelter, we are not aware of
   studies that have been conducted to demonstrate that crayfish directly
   outcompete madtoms in this regard. Our objective was to experimentally
   test the hypothesis that shelter competition between crayfish and
   Mountain Madtoms Noturus eleutherus, a surrogate species for Chucky
   Madtoms, is a function of relative size. We conducted behavioral trials
   in which shelter was the limited resource for the two potential
   competitors. We recorded the madtoms' success at occupying the provided
   cover object for 5 d as well as health condition at the end of the
   competition phase. Both madtom occupancy and health condition were
   positively correlated with increasing relative size. As the size
   differential increased between madtoms and crayfish, madtoms were more
   successful at occupying the cover object, and overall condition was
   greater at the end of the trial. Conversely, when madtoms were smaller
   than crayfish, individuals were more commonly excluded from the cover
   object or even killed. Juvenile madtoms experienced 100\% mortality. We
   concluded that crayfish exhibit a size-specific competitive advantage
   over Mountain Madtoms when shelter is limited, and that crayfishes may
   catalyze fish population declines at least partially through shelter
   exclusion and predation on juveniles.},

Abstract = {Common eiders Somateria mollissima have been a focus of conservation and
   management efforts in eastern North American for over a century;
   however, the complex population structure and multiple subspecies make
   assessing the status of populations challenging. The coastlines of Nova
   Scotia, Canada, are an important wintering area for common eiders, and
   significant harvests of common eiders occur in the province. We analyzed
   trends in the number of wintering common eiders using the coasts of Nova
   Scotia from dedicated waterfowl surveys flown since 1970, and every year
   since 1992. We used Generalized Additive Models to assess the apparent
   non-linear trends in the counts of common eiders over the past 50 y. We
   found that numbers of common eiders wintering in Nova Scotia increased
   from 1970 to the early 2010s, with strong growth in the 2000s (peaking
   at 7\% growth/y). Since the early 2010s, the growth has stopped, and the
   numbers are now declining. Recent declines in the population wintering
   in Nova Scotia corroborate other evidence that common eiders are
   declining in the region, and may also indicate distributional shifts of
   common eiders in eastern North America.},

Title = {Are Cisco and Lake Whitefish Competitors? An Analysis of Historical
   Fisheries in Michigan Waters of the Upper Laurentian Great Lakes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {524-539},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Historically, Cisco Coregonus artedi and Lake Whitefish Coregonus
   clupeaformis were abundant throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes, but
   overharvest, habitat degradation, and interactions with exotic species
   caused most populations to collapse by the mid-1900s. Strict commercial
   fishery regulations and improved environmental and ecological conditions
   allowed Cisco to partially recover only in Lake Superior, whereas Lake
   Whitefish recovered in all the upper Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan,
   and Huron). The differential responses of Cisco and Lake Whitefish to
   improved environmental and ecological conditions in lakes Michigan and
   Huron have led to questions about potential negative interactions
   between these species. To provide context for fishery managers, we
   tested for positive and negative correlations between historical
   (1929-1970) Cisco and Lake Whitefish commercial gill net catch per
   effort (CPE; kg/km of net) at a variety of spatial scales in Michigan
   waters of the upper Great Lakes. The three best-fit spatial
   models-LAKEWIDE, REGIONAL 10, and SIMPLE-all had similar levels of
   support (scaled second-order Akaike Information Criterion, 3.0), and we
   used these models to determine whether there was a significant
   correlation between Cisco and Lake Whitefish CPE (positive and
   negative). There was either no correlation between Cisco and Lake
   Whitefish CPE or a positive correlation for most (12 of 13) pairwise
   (Cisco-Lake Whitefish) comparisons. We identified no strong positive or
   negative correlations in the lakewide (LAKEWIDE) or reduced (SIMPLE)
   models. In the regional model (REGIONAL 10), we identified strong and
   positive correlations between Cisco and Lake Whitefish CPE in two
   regions (rho = 0.59-0.71) and a weak negative correlation in one region
   (rho = -0.45). Collectively, our findings suggest that Cisco and Lake
   Whitefish CPE were largely independent of each other; thus, these
   species likely did not interact to the detriment of one another in
   Michigan waters of the upper Great Lakes during 1929-1970.},

Abstract = {The Mississippi Flyway supports millions of waterfowl during spring

   locations. Green-winged teal Anas crecca consume natural plant and
   animal foods in shallow wetlands during autumn and winter, but little

   quantified food use and availability to determine selection in the

   dried, and weighed (+/- 0.1 mg) food items by taxa from the upper
   digestive tract (proventriculus and esophagus) of birds and core samples
   for comparison. Additionally, we evaluated retention of common diet
   items between small (\#60; 250 mu m) and medium (\#35; 500 mu m) sieves
   and the effect of processing sieve size on selection coefficients. Seeds
   of moist-soil vegetation occurred in all green-winged teal diets, while
   invertebrates and vegetation material occurred in 67.4\% and 25.8\% of
   diets, respectively. Green-winged teal consumed 85.8\% (CI95 =
   81.2-90.3\%) plant material and 14.2\% (CI95 = 9.6-18.7\%) invertebrates
   based on aggregate dry biomass. We failed to find support for selection
   of either plant or animal foods in general, but green-winged teal
   selected Cyperus spp., Ammannia spp., Leptochloa spp., and Potamogeton
   spp. and avoided Amaranthus spp., Ipomoea spp., Echinochloa spp., and
   Oligochaeta individual taxa. We found no support for a difference in
   selection ratios between sexes, but selection ratios differed among
   years and wetland connectivity regimes with changes in food
   availability. Sieve size had minimal impact on rank and selection
   intensity of most food items, but only small sieves captured Ammannia
   spp., which was an important diet item. We found no evidence that
   green-winged teal selected invertebrates in our midlatitude migration
   study area, as has been speculated for dabbling ducks in general during
   spring migration (i.e., spring diet-shift hypothesis). We encourage
   managers to provide shallowly flooded wetlands with desirable plant taxa
   (e.g., Cyperus spp., Ammannia spp., Leptochloa spp.) for green-winged
   teal by maintaining actively managed moist-soil wetlands that are made
   available during spring migration.},

Title = {Blanding's Turtle Demography and Population Viability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In anticipation of U.S. federal status classification (warranted,
   warranted but precluded, not warranted), scheduled for 2023, we provide
   population viability analysis of the Blanding's turtle Emydoidea
   blandingii, a long-lived, late-maturing, semi-aquatic species of
   conservation concern throughout its range. We present demographic data
   from long-term study of a population in northeastern Illinois and use
   these data as the basis for viability and sensitivity analyses focused
   on parameter uncertainty and geographic parameter variation. We use
   population viability analysis to identify population sizes necessary to
   provide population resiliency to stochastic disturbance events and
   catastrophes, and demonstrate how alternative definitions of
   `foreseeable future' might affect status decisions. Demographic
   parameters within our focal population resulted in optimistic population
   projections (probability of extinction = 0\% over 100 y) but results
   were less optimistic when catastrophes or uncertainty in parameter
   estimates were incorporated (probability of extinction = 3\% and 16\%,
   respectively). Uncertainty in estimates of age-specific mortality had
   the biggest impact on population viability analysis outcomes but
   uncertainty in other parameters (age of first reproduction,
   environmental variation in age-specific mortality, percent of females
   reproducing, clutch size) also contributed. Blanding's turtle demography
   varies geographically and incorporating this variation resulted in both
   mortality- and fecundity-related parameters affecting population
   viability analysis outcomes. Possibly, compensatory variation among
   demographic parameters allows for persistence across a wide range of
   parameter values. We found that extinction risk decreased and retention
   of genetic diversity increased rapidly with increasing initial
   population size. In the absence of catastrophes, demographic
   conservation goals could be met with a smaller initial population size
   than could genetic conservation goals; >= 20-50 adults were necessary
   for extinction risk <5\%, whereas >= 50-110 adults were necessary to
   retain >95\% of existing genetic diversity over 100 y. These thresholds
   shifted upward when catastrophes were included; >= 50-200 adults were
   necessary for extinction risk <5\% and >= 110 to >200 adults were
   necessary to retain >95\% of existing genetic diversity over 100 y.
   Impediments to Blanding's turtle conservation include an incomplete
   understanding of geographic covariation among demographic parameters,
   the large amount of effort necessary to estimate and monitor abundance,
   and uncertainty regarding the impacts of increasingly frequent extreme
   weather events.},

Title = {Lead Contamination Differences in the Muscle of Wild Turkeys Harvested
   with Lead and Copper-Plated Lead Shot},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the known deleterious effects lead exposure can have on humans,
   lead remains the most common type of ammunition used to harvest big game
   and upland game birds. We sampled wild turkey Meleagris gallopavo breast
   muscle shot with standard lead and copper-plated lead pellets to
   quantify lead residue concentrations within the wound channel, and we
   sampled multiple adjacent locations to measure the extent lead
   contamination spreads through tissue of harvested turkeys. We found that
   samples taken from the wound channel contained more lead (mean = 3.76 mu
   g/g dry weight) than both samples taken adjacent to the wound channel
   (mean = 0.20 mu g/g dry weight) and samples taken from >5 cm away (mean
   = 0.15 mu g/g dry weight). Additionally, we found that birds harvested
   with standard lead ammunition did not differ in lead concentrations from
   those shot with copper-plated lead, suggesting that copper plating does
   not aid in reducing lead exposure. Our findings suggest that wild
   turkeys harvested with either lead or copper-plated lead shot have the
   potential to expose consumers, especially children due to their lower
   tolerance, to low levels of lead that could exceed daily consumption
   limits set by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease
   Control. However, elevated lead levels were confined to the wound
   channel, and thus proper preparation of game to remove tissue
   surrounding wound channels may eliminate or substantially reduce lead
   exposure from harvested game birds.},

Title = {Current Knowledge and Conservation Status of the Gray-Headed Chickadee
   in North America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {654-664},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The gray-headed chickadee Poecile cinctus is a Holarctic songbird that
   occurs from northern Europe across Asia and into northwestern North
   America. Historically, the endemic North American subspecies P. c.
   lathami ranged across portions of interior and northern Alaska and
   northwest Canada. Though often described as rare, ornithologists
   considered it locally common in parts of its distribution. Anecdotal
   reports of declines and a lack of recent observations motivated us to
   initiate efforts to better understand the current distribution and
   abundance of this species. We conducted 862 h of field surveys focused
   on detecting gray-headed chickadees between 2010 and 2017 and detected
   only three individuals and no evidence of nesting in locations where the
   species previously occurred. We also compiled a database of 156
   occurrences that likely represents nearly all the available reliable
   records in North America since 1864. Based on a comparison of these data
   before and after the year 2000, it appears the species may no longer
   occur in southwestern or Interior Alaska, or the Northwest Territories
   where scientists previously documented it. Results from a citizen
   science initiative to collect recent observations revealed citizen
   scientists reliably report only a few gray-headed chickadee sightings
   annually. Additionally, the species appears to have recently disappeared
   from two locations where observers previously reported it annually for >
   20 y. Collectively, these data suggest it is likely the species'
   distribution has contracted, its population has declined, and its
   current population size is very small in North America. We emphasize
   that though we base these conclusions on the best available information,
   more information is needed before the status of this rare species can be
   determined with confidence. Despite recognized limitations of the data,
   we failed to find any evidence contrary to our conclusions and suggest
   this little-studied species needs additional focused research and
   conservation in North America.},

Abstract = {The Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative was formed to
   promote restoration of red spruce Picea rubens forests in Central
   Appalachia. One goal of the initiative is to increase availability and
   enhance quality of habitat for wildlife, including the threatened Cheat

   to compare microhabitat characteristics between an occupied Cheat
   Mountain salamander site and early-stage spruce restoration sites, and
   between four occupied sites and proximal nondetection sites. We found
   that soil pH was higher and soil moisture was lower at spruce
   restoration sites compared with the occupied site, and that light
   intensity, subcanopy air temperature, and ground-level air temperature
   were higher in spruce restoration sites with reduced canopy cover. We
   found that soil moisture was higher at occupied sites compared with
   proximal nondetection sites, but soil pH was not significantly
   different. Our study suggests that Cheat Mountain salamanders are
   associated with low soil pH and high soil moisture, and thus spruce
   restoration could enhance habitat quality for this species in the
   long-term.},

Title = {How Effective Is the Birdsbesafe (R) Cat Collar at Reducing Bird
   Mortality by Domestic Cats?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {182-191},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The global decline of songbird populations is a well-recognized
   conservation issue. Domestic cats kill an estimated 2.4 billion birds
   each year in the United States alone-more than most other anthropogenic
   threats combined. As many pet owners are reluctant to keep their cats
   inside, collar-mounted antipredation devices for domestic cats may be an
   important conservation tool. We examined the effectiveness of the
   Birdsbesafe (R) collar cover (BCC), a sleeve of brightly patterned
   fabric worn over a typical breakaway collar. The BBC's designers intend
   for the collar's bright colors to alert potential prey to the cat's
   presence. By combining data from two studies in New York (2014 and 2019)
   and one in Florida (2019), all of which used similar methods, we tested
   the hypothesis that the BCC effectively reduces avian mortality caused
   by cats of different ages and sexes in different hunting environments.
   We tested 94 cats over a 12-wk period in New York in 2014 or 8-wk
   periods in Florida and New York in 2019 during the bird breeding
   seasons; cats alternated 2-wk periods with and without the collar.
   Across studies, we recovered 2.7 times fewer birds per cat with the BCC
   than without (P = 0.006). The BCC was more effective at a temperate
   latitude than a subtropical one (P = 0.047). There was no difference in
   the effectiveness of the BCC for cats of varying ages, sexes, or hunting
   environments. Our results suggest that the BCC could be one tool within
   a larger effort to decrease domestic cat predation of songbirds.},

Title = {Large-Scale Assessment of Rapid Monitoring Methods for Estimating
   Moist-Soil Seed Production},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-154},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Federal, state, and private entities manage seasonal flooded, shallow
   wetlands to provide food and other habitat resources for
   wetland-dependent migratory birds, including migrating and wintering
   waterfowl. Individual National Wildlife Refuges managed by the U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service annually monitor seed production in moist-soil
   wetlands to track performance relative to regional foraging habitat
   objectives and to evaluate local habitat management activities. The
   National Wildlife Refuge System does not currently have a standard
   sampling protocol, and thus seeks a reliable rapid assessment method for
   estimating seed production to achieve standardized estimates and to
   avoid inconsistencies in data collection, metrics used, and usefulness
   of the monitoring efforts. We compared seed yield estimates derived from
   a suite of commonly used seed production assessment methods with those
   from soil core samples across six National Wildlife Refuges in the
   southeastern United States. The most parsimonious model included only
   common plant species and a single visual assessment of overall coverage
   (1-5) and seed quality (1-4) for each moist-soil unit (r(adj)(2) =
   0.71). Generally, models that included only common plant species and a
   visual estimate of seed yield for moist-soil wetlands overall had
   greater support than models that included all plant species and those
   that included data from subplots (n = 10) nested within moist-soil
   wetlands. Experience level of observer had a moderate effect on accuracy
   (r(mar)(2) = 0.20) and geographic range increased variation in overall
   seed yield estimates within moist-soil wetlands. Notably, we found that
   similar indices developed in different geographic regions performed well
   across the Southeast, but a widely used index based on estimates of seed
   yield for individual plant species performed poorly in this study.
   Standardizing the use of a single, efficient, and reliable method to
   estimate seed abundance in moist-soil wetlands will provide wetland
   mangers the ability to consistently estimate performance relative to
   objectives, evaluate management actions, and track trends on National
   Wildlife Refuges in the southeastern United States.},

Title = {Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-Assisted Detection of Rock Outcrops

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The identification of small habitat features embedded within forest
   ecosystems is a challenge for many wildlife inventory and monitoring
   programs, especially for those involving rock outcrop specialist taxa.
   Rock outcrops are often difficult to remotely detect in dense
   Appalachian hardwood forests, as most outcrops remain hidden under the
   forest canopy and therefore invisible when relying on aerial
   orthoimagery to pinpoint habitat features. We investigated the ability
   for light detection and ranging point cloud data to identify small rock
   outcrops during the environmental assessment phase of a proposed
   management project on the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia. We
   specifically compared this approach with the visual identification of
   rock outcrops across the same area using aerial orthoimagery. Our light
   detection and ranging-based approach identified three times as many rock
   outcrop sites as aerial orthoimagery, resulting in the field
   verification of four times as many previously unknown populations of
   green salamanders Aneides aeneus (a rock outcrop specialist amphibian of
   high conservation concern) than would have been possible if relying on
   aerial orthoimagery alone to guide surveys. Our results indicate that
   light detection and rangingbased methods may provide an effective,
   efficient, and low-error approach that can remotely identify
   below-canopy rock outcrops embedded within Appalachian forests,
   especially when researchers lack pre-existing knowledge of local terrain
   and the location of habitat features.},

Title = {Comparison of Specimen- and Image-Based Morphometrics for Cisco},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {208-215},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Morphometric data from fish are typically generated using one of two
   methods: direct measurements made on a specimen or extraction of
   distances from a digital picture. We compared data on 12 morphometrics
   collected with these two methods on the same collection of Cisco
   Coregonus artedi from Lake Ontario, North America, to assess the degree
   of bias in measurements made directly on a specimen- vs. an image-based
   method. We also assessed the degree of reproducibility within the
   image-based method by evaluating the amount of variation between
   different analysts for each morphometric method. Our results indicate
   specific morphometrics may be more prone to bias across the two methods
   and between analysts. Four of 12 morphometrics evaluated showed
   significant deviation from a 1:1 relationship that would be expected if
   the imaged-based method produced accurate specimen-based measurements.
   Pelvic fin length and pelvic-anal fin distance had the highest
   between-analyst variation for image-based landmarks, indicating low
   reproducibility for these metrics, compared with pectoral fin or total
   length, which had lower between-analyst variation. Although some
   morphometric measurements can be accurately obtained with either method,
   and therefore potentially used interchangeably in studies on Cisco
   morphology, our findings highlight the importance of considering method
   bias in morphometric studies that use data collected by different
   methods.},

Title = {Added Value: Gopher Tortoise Surveys Provide Estimates of Gopher Frog
   Abundance in Tortoise Burrows},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The gopher frog Lithobates capito is one of the most terrestrial frogs
   in the southeastern United States and often inhabits gopher tortoise
   burrows Gopherus polyphemus outside of the breeding season. Gopher frog
   populations have declined, and the species is under review for listing
   as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Much
   of our knowledge on the status of gopher frogs is based on detections of
   larvae at breeding wetlands, which can be challenging because of
   environmental variability and provides no information on the terrestrial
   life stages of the species. Therefore, an alternative method is called
   for. We recorded observations of gopher frogs during gopher tortoise
   surveys at four conservation lands in Florida and used line-transect
   distance sampling to estimate frog abundance. We also recorded burrow
   size, incidence of frog co-occupancy with tortoises, and distance from
   frog-occupied burrows to breeding wetlands. We observed 274 gopher frogs
   in 1,097 tortoise burrows at the four sites. The proportion of burrows
   occupied by gopher frogs among sites ranged from 0.17 to 0.25. Gopher
   frog abundance in tortoise burrows was 742 (512-1,076 95\% CL) at
   Etoniah Creek State Forest, 465 (352-615) at Ft. White Wildlife
   Environmental Area, 411 (283-595) at Mike Roess Gold Head Branch State
   Park, and 134 (97-186) at Watermelon Pond Wildlife Environmental Area.
   We observed up to four frogs in a single burrow. The proportion of frogs
   detected in burrows occupied by a gopher tortoise ranged from 0.46 to
   0.79 among sites, and overall, gopher frogs preferred burrows occupied
   by tortoises over unoccupied burrows (chi(2) = 15.875; df = 3; P =
   0.001). Gopher frogs used burrows from 7 to 43 cm in width; mean width
   of frog-occupied burrows did not differ from that of unoccupied burrows
   (F-1,F-3 = 0.049, P = 0.825). Distance from frog-occupied tortoise
   burrows to the nearest breeding wetland ranged from 141 to 3,402 m. Our
   data on gopher frogs collected in conjunction with gopher tortoise
   monitoring efforts using line-transect distance sampling and burrow
   cameras provided novel information on frog abundance in their
   terrestrial habitat and required no additional effort. However, the
   extent to which frogs use tortoise burrows relative to other available
   refuges (small mammal burrows, stumps, or other structures) is unknown;
   thus, our estimates should be considered conservative. We suggest that
   terrestrial abundance estimates for gopher frogs can complement efforts
   to monitor breeding activity to provide a more comprehensive means of
   monitoring population trends in this cryptic species.},

Abstract = {The Missouri River in South Dakota was dammed in the 1950s and 1960s,
   altering the biotic and abiotic factors that potentially affect native
   species in the mainstem reservoirs. Little research has been conducted
   regarding what factors regulate age-0 catch per unit effort (CPUE) of
   native fish species since the damming occurred. Thus, we examined age-0
   CPUE for 13 native fish species in the four Missouri River mainstem
   reservoirs. We analyzed data from 1995 to 2015 in Lake Oahe, 2002 to
   2016 in Lake Sharpe, 1998 to 2008 in Lake Francis Case, and 2000 to 2013
   in Lewis and Clark Lake. Not all species were sampled in all reservoirs.
   We evaluated potential environmental (inflow, gauge height, peak flow,
   precipitation, air temperature) and biological (CPUE of other native
   species, nonnative species, and predators) factors that have documented
   impacts on age-0 native fish. Significant relationships existed between
   age-0 native fish CPUE and both biotic and abiotic factors in all four
   reservoirs, but were species- and reservoir-dependent. Age-0 CPUE was
   either stable or increasing in all species examined in all reservoirs
   except age-0 Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides in Lewis and Clark
   Lake. Age-0 Emerald Shiner CPUE in Lewis and Clark Lake was most
   supported by biological models (e.g., total age-0 nonnative and adult
   White Bass Morone chrysops CPUE), and a positive relationship existed
   between age-0 Emerald Shiner and both factors. We believe our findings
   provide valuable insight into successful management of native fish
   populations.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the distribution of ages of fish within a stock, and
   subsequently individual growth rates, allows managers the ability to
   calculate key metrics (i.e., recruitment, mortality, and stock growth
   rate) that greatly improve stock assessment models. Two remnant stocks
   of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens exist near and within the Niagara
   River, one primarily occupying the headwaters and the other primarily
   occupying the mouth. Though initial efforts in the late 1990s collected
   data on the lower Niagara River stock, a long-term comprehensive
   examination of age and growth is lacking and the age structure of the
   stock found at the headwaters has yet to be formally described to our
   knowledge. To ascertain the current age structure of these two stocks we
   sampled Lake Sturgeon in the lower Niagara River and at the headwaters
   of the Niagara River between 2012 and 2017 and took a portion of the
   leading pectoral fin spine of captured Lake Sturgeon for age estimation.
   Ages ranged between 4 and 42 y, with females generally being older and
   larger than males. The median age appeared to increase from 14 to 18 y
   throughout our study in both stocks. Lengths at age of both stocks were
   larger than those reported in other systems and growth rates appear to
   have increased over the past decade in the lower Niagara River. Despite
   efforts to improve age estimation accuracy, age estimates from fish
   whose ages were partly known (derived from multiple age estimates from
   fish that were captured multiple times) demonstrated that assigned ages
   may have greater error than expected. Additionally, a lack of young
   individuals confounded growth analyses. Although there was uncertainty
   in the assigned ages, this study still provides evidence of consistent
   recruitment in both stocks and, to our knowledge, the first
   characterization of the age structure of the Lake Sturgeon stock
   occupying the headwaters of the Niagara River.},

Title = {Assessing Conservation and Management Actions with Ecosystem Services
   Better Communicates Conservation Value to the Public},

Abstract = {Fish and wildlife populations are under unprecedented threats from
   changes in land use and climate. With increasing threats comes a need
   for an expanded constituency that can contribute to the public support
   and financial capital needed for habitat conservation and management.
   Using an ecosystem services approach can provide a framework for a more
   holistic accounting of conservation benefits. Our objective here is to
   provide a greater understanding of the role that taking an ecosystem
   services approach can have in expanding the public constituency that
   supports the use of financial capital required to conserve and manage
   the nation???s natural capital. To demonstrate a methodology and the
   usefulness of taking an ecosystem services approach when communicating
   the value of conserving and managing fish and wildlife habitats, we
   performed an evaluation of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service-owned
   Waterfowl Production Areas, National Wildlife Refuges, and easement
   lands (both wetland and grassland) in Stutsman County, North Dakota. We
   quantified amphibian habitat, grassland bird habitat, floral resources
   for pollinators, and carbon storage services under various scenarios of
   conservation. While we did not include all possible ecosystem services
   in our model, our case study shows how this process can provide a more
   complete picture of the collateral benefits of conservation directed
   primarily toward waterfowl. Using this ecosystem services approach, we
   documented marked losses in all services modeled if current conservation
   lands were developed for the production of agricultural crops. By having
   access to a more complete picture of benefits provided by conservation
   lands, decision makers can better communicate their value. By garnering
   greater public support through a more accurate accounting of societal
   benefits, conservation and management of dwindling natural capital may
   someday attain the same level of thought and consideration that is put
   into the conservation and management of the nation???s financial
   capital.},

Title = {Distribution, Period of Gravidity, and Host Identification for the
   Narrow Pigtoe Mussel},

Abstract = {The narrow pigtoe Fusconaia escambia is a freshwater mussel found only
   in the Escambia and Yellow river basins in northwest Florida and
   southern Alabama. The U.S. Endangered Species Act lists it as
   threatened. Like other freshwater mussels (Unionidae), its life cycle
   involves a larval stage (i.e., glochidial) in which most species are
   obligate parasites on the gills or fins of fishes. Knowledge of life
   history, population demographics, population genetics, and threats for
   the narrow pigtoe is lacking throughout its range, which impedes
   conservation of this species. Therefore, our objectives were to 1)
   compare historical and current distribution data using a conservation
   status assessment map, 2) determine period of gravidity, and 3) identify
   fish hosts. We used a conservation status assessment map to examine
   spatial and temporal changes in narrow pigtoe distribution and the
   possibility that the species has been extirpated from a subbasin (i.e.,
   Hydrologic Unit Code level 10 watershed boundary; U.S. Geological Survey
   National Hydrography Dataset). We determined period of gravidity for the
   narrow pigtoe by examining the gills of mussels in the field, and
   considered peak gravidity to be the month in which we encountered the
   greatest number of gravid females. We determined fish hosts by infecting
   individuals of 18 fish species with glochidia in a laboratory setting.
   Overall, the narrow pigtoe appears to be maintaining stable populations
   in Florida, but researchers have conducted too few surveys in Alabama
   subbasins for us to fully assess its status throughout its range. Peak
   months of gravidity were May-July, with the greatest percentage of
   gravid females observed in May, although we observed them as early as 9
   March and as late as 25 October. We identified nine fish species from
   five genera as hosts for narrow pigtoe, with Blacktail Shiner Cyprinella
   venusta and Weed Shiner Notropis texanus consistently producing the
   greatest number of viable juvenile mussels. Host and gravidity findings
   from this study will be useful if propagation efforts become necessary
   for conservation of the narrow pigtoe.},

Abstract = {Accurate status assessments of long-lived, widely distributed taxa
   depend on the availability of long-term monitoring data from multiple
   populations. However, monitoring populations across large temporal and
   spatial scales is often beyond the scope of any one researcher or
   research group. Consequently, wildlife managers may be tasked with
   utilizing limited information from different sources to detect
   range-wide evidence of population declines and their causes. When
   assessments need to be made under such constraints, the research and
   management communities must determine how to extrapolate from variable
   population data to species-level inferences. Here, using three different
   approaches, we integrate and analyze data from the peer-reviewed
   literature and government agency reports to inform conservation for
   northwestern pond turtles (NPT) Actinemys marmorata and southwestern
   pond turtles (SPT) Actinemys pallida. Both NPT and SPT are long-lived
   freshwater turtles distributed along the west coast of the United States
   and Mexico. Conservation concerns exist for both species; however, SPT
   may face more severe threats and are thought to exist at lower densities
   throughout their range than NPT. For each species, we ranked the impacts
   of 13 potential threats, estimated population sizes, and modeled
   population viability with and without long-term droughts. Our results
   suggest that predation of hatchlings by invasive predators, such as
   American bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus and Largemouth Bass
   Micropterus salmoides, is a high-ranking threat for NPT and SPT.
   Southwestern pond turtles may also face more severe impacts associated
   with natural disasters (droughts, wildfires, and floods) than do NPT.
   Population size estimates from trapping surveys indicate that SPT have
   smaller population sizes on average than do NPT (P = 0.0003), suggesting
   they may be at greater risk of local extirpation. Population viability
   analysis models revealed that long-term droughts are a key environmental
   parameter; as the frequency of severe droughts increases with climate
   change, the likelihood of population recovery decreases, especially when
   census sizes are low. Given current population trends and vulnerability
   to natural disasters throughout their range, we suggest that
   conservation and recovery actions first focus on SPT to prevent further
   population declines.},

Abstract = {Eastern spotted skunks Spilogale putorius are an understudied species
   that has experienced range-wide declines. Over the past 16 y, camera
   traps have become an increasingly common tool to monitor and understand
   their current distribution. To inform best surveying practices, we
   reviewed 16 camera-trap studies specifically targeting this species. We
   focused on reported latency to initial detection and three main aspects
   of study design: seasonality of detections, baits and lures, and
   camera-trap brands. Latency to initial detection ranged from 1 to 82 d
   with a mean of 17.1 d (SD = 9.1). Attractants varied among projects, but
   most (75\%) used sardines as bait. The percentage of skunk detections
   tended to vary across the year, with the highest percentage of skunk
   detections occurring in March (92\%). We conclude by suggesting best
   practices and directions for future research techniques that will aid in
   developing more efficient methods to address key knowledge gaps for this
   elusive species. Given the long timeframes for latency to initial
   detection, monitoring individual sites for at least 4 wk, with the use
   of bait, is likely the best strategy to detect eastern spotted skunks.
   We encourage further experimental approaches on the effectiveness of
   different baits and lures, and methods to increase latency to initial
   detection. Collectively, we hope this leads to the development of a
   standardized monitoring approach that researchers can implement across
   studies and states within the eastern spotted skunk's range.},

Title = {Importance of Power Pole Selection When Retrofitting for Eagle
   Compensatory Mitigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In the United States, the bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus and golden
   eagle Aquila chrysaetos are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service to ensure the species are stable or increasing while allowing
   for potentially negative effects from anthropogenic sources.
   Compensatory mitigation, through retrofitting high-risk power poles to
   reduce electrocutions, can be used to offset negative effects, enabling
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to achieve their management
   objectives of species stability and persistence. Regulators, permit
   holders, electric utilities, and consultants lack an objective and
   repeatable method for discriminating between high-risk and low-risk
   power poles. To illustrate the importance of accurately identifying and
   retrofitting high-risk poles, we compare conservation benefits among
   three retrofitting project scenarios: 1) high-risk poles only, 2) a
   circuit of both low- and high-risk poles, and 3) low-risk poles only. We
   assert that, in the absence of a common definition of high-risk power
   poles applied uniformly across the landscape, mitigation approved by the
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could fall short of its intended value
   and be unable to meet management objectives. We define high-risk poles
   in the context of compensatory mitigation as poles in high-quality bald
   or golden eagle habitat with a relative risk index > 0.40 based on
   number of phases, number of jumper wires, and presence of pole
   grounding. We estimate that the conservation benefit of retrofitting a
   high-risk pole is at least 5.25 times greater than the benefit of
   retrofitting a low-risk pole. In the long-term, if compensatory
   mitigation intended to achieve management objectives falls short of its
   assumed conservation value, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could be
   forced to limit future permit authorizations until bald or golden eagles
   can recover from incorrectly calculated conservation benefits. To avoid
   that negative outcome, we recommend that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service set consistent and transparent standards for identifying poles
   to count as compensatory mitigation credit using our proposed definition

Title = {Sagebrush Bird Communities Differ with Varying Levels of Crested
   Wheatgrass Invasion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-39},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sagebrush communities, covering millions of hectares in the western
   United States, are among our most imperiled ecosystems. They are
   challenged by various anthropogenic stressors, including invasion by
   nonnative grasses that degrade habitat quality and alter ecosystem
   function. Sagebrush restoration efforts are underway to improve habitat
   conditions to benefit a wide range of sagebrush-dependent species.
   Because birds are good indicators of habitat quality, monitoring avian
   metrics is an effective way to measure progress of sagebrush
   restoration. We compared avian community composition and individual
   species abundance among three sagebrush-steppe habitat types with
   varying degrees of invasion by nonnative crested wheatgrass Agropyron
   cristatum at the Camas National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Idaho,
   USA. Sagebrush-obligate birds, such as sage thrasher Oreoscoptes
   montanus and sagebrush sparrow Artemisiospiza nevadensis, were most
   abundant in sagebrush habitats with an understory of native grass.
   Community composition was similar between sagebrush habitats with native
   and nonnative grasses, but quite different from bird communities
   occupying crested wheatgrass. The Habitats and Populations Strategies
   database, a conservation planning tool, predicts that restoration of
   crested wheatgrass sites to sagebrush in poor or fair condition will
   increase the density of sagebrush-obligate bird species. Taken together,
   these results suggest that restoration of crested wheatgrass
   near-monocultures back to sagebrush will improve habitat value for much
   of the bird community whether or not the understory can be converted to
   primarily native grasses, or a mix of natives and nonnatives. Of the
   sagebrush bird species of concern, Brewer's sparrow Spizella breweri
   occupied sagebrush habitats with native vs. nonnative understory at
   similar abundances, and this species could serve as a metric of
   intermediate restoration success. However, sagebrush sparrow and sage
   thrasher, which were significant indicators of sagebrush with native
   grasses, will likely benefit most from full restoration of a native
   herbaceous understory. Grassland-obligate birds such as horned lark
   Eremophila alpestris and grasshopper sparrow Ammodramus savannarum were
   most abundant at crested wheatgrass-dominated sites and may not benefit
   from restoration back to shrubland; managers should understand potential
   trade-offs.},

Title = {Behavior of Female Adult Pacific Lamprey Exposed to Natural and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Conservation and management of Pacific Lamprey Entosphenus tridentatus
   and other imperiled lamprey species could include the use of
   chemosensory cues to attract or repel migrating adults. For restoration
   programs, using cues to help guide lamprey through fishway entrances
   might improve passage of adult lamprey at dams. In contrast, odors might
   repel unwanted invasive Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Laurentian
   Great Lakes from spawning habitats or improve trapping efficiency. We
   conducted bioassays with Pacific Lamprey in a two-choice maze to
   evaluate the behavioral response of preovulatory adult females to
   introduced chemical cues and changes in flow. During overnight tests,
   for each female we measured the number of entries into each arm of the
   maze and the amount of time spent in each arm after application of
   natural odors from prespawning conspecifics (males and females) in one
   of the arms. Using the same methods, we also tested whether adult
   females were attracted to natural odor from spermiating males, to a
   synthesized (artificially produced) component of a Sea Lamprey sex
   pheromone (3-keto petromyzonol sulfate), or to an attraction flow (12
   L/min as reference). In all tests, the lamprey showed consistent
   nocturnal activity, typically moving from sunset until sunrise and
   remaining inactive during daylight hours. For natural odors, the number
   of entries and the amount of time females spent in the treatment arm
   were not significantly different between control and treatment periods.
   However, females spent significantly less time in the treatment arm with
   the synthesized 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate than when we delivered no
   odor. Females showed strong, positive responses to the attraction flow
   and with our assay, we could identify significant behavioral responses
   when the differences between the control and experimental means were
   greater than 15???20\%. The response of lampreys to sex pheromones may
   be species-specific, with Pacific Lamprey less likely to respond to
   conspecific odors than Sea Lamprey.},

Title = {Population Dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in Henrys Lake, Idaho},

Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {169-181},

Abstract = {Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri is a
   species with significant ecological and recreational value. In many YCT
   fisheries, managers are tasked with balancing angler expectations and
   fish conservation. Henrys Lake supports a popular trophy trout fishery,
   but the increase of nonnative Utah Chub Gila atraria has caused concern
   for YCT. We summarized long-term trends in abundance, length structure,
   body condition, and growth of YCT to evaluate the effect of Utah Chub.
   Additionally, we investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing
   YCT. We examined archived hard structures to provide a comprehensive
   evaluation of changes in age and growth of YCT in the system. We used
   stocking records and catch rates of Utah Chub and trout in Henrys Lake
   as covariates to explain changes in YCT catch rates and growth. Catch
   rates varied from 1.5 to 15.4 YCT per net night during the 2002 to 2020
   sampling period, but we did not identify consistent patterns. Length
   structure was consistently dominated by stock- to quality-length fish,
   and we captured few fish >600 mm in total length. Relative weight of YCT
   was decreased from a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 115.9 +/- 16.5
   in 2004 to 93.2 +/- 8.2 in 2020. The age of YCT varied between 1 and 11
   years; fish that we captured during 2010 to 2020 were the oldest. The
   majority of fish that we sampled were age 4 and younger. Total annual
   mortality of age-2 and older YCT was higher than other Cutthroat Trout
   populations (i.e., 0.70 during 2002 to 2010 and 0.60 during 2011 to
   2020). Based on regression models, we identified positive relationships
   between catch rates of YCT, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and
   Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss x YCT hybrid trout. We observed
   negative relationships between growth of YCT and abundance of Utah Chub
   and Brook Trout. Although we identified negative relationships, YCT
   growth in recent decades is as fast as or faster than earlier time
   periods. Results from this research suggest that major changes in YCT
   population dynamics are not evident over the last 20 years. This study
   provides insight into the factors influencing an adfluvial trout
   population. In particular, results from this research may be useful for
   managers of systems where Utah Chub have been introduced.},

Title = {Slow Recovery of Headwater-Stream Fishes Following a Catastrophic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Accidental spills of chemicals and other pollutants can decimate
   populations of stream-dwelling species. Recovery from such accidents can
   be relatively fast and complete when the affected stream reaches can be
   recolonized from upstream and downstream sources. However, faunal
   recoveries from accidental spills that extirpate populations from entire
   headwater streams have not been extensively documented, and
   understanding resilience of headwater-stream biota is relevant for
   assessing threats to at-risk species. We assessed recovery of fish
   populations in a 5.7-km-long headwater stream in the southeastern United
   States following a complete, or nearly complete, fish-kill caused by a
   chemical spill near the source of the stream. We sampled for fishes at
   five stream locations, two downstream and three upstream from a perched,
   culverted road-crossing located 2.4 km upstream from the stream mouth,
   over a period of 18.5 mo following the poisoning event. We observed 11
   fish species, representing <= 65\% of the fish species expected based on
   occurrences in nearby tributary streams. In postpoisoning sampling, only
   three of these taxa were observed upstream of the culvert; all 11
   species, including the federally threatened Cherokee Darter Etheostoma
   scotti, were found downstream of the culvert but were mostly represented
   by a few, large individuals. In contrast, dead individuals of at least
   eight taxa including the Cherokee Darter were observed upstream of the
   culvert at the time of the fish-kill. These observations provide
   evidence of slow recovery of a headwater fish fauna, and especially
   upstream of a barrier to fish movement, where the recolonization sources
   are primarily downstream. Additional case studies may reveal whether
   this result applies generally to headwater streams. Slow recovery could
   make species that primarily inhabit or maintain greatest abundances in
   headwaters, including multiple at-risk fishes, particularly vulnerable
   to the threat of accidental spills that result in local population
   extirpation.},

Abstract = {Camera traps provide a low-cost approach to collect data and monitor
   wildlife across large scales but hand-labeling images at a rate that
   outpaces accumulation is difficult. Deep learning, a subdiscipline of
   machine learning and computer science, can address the issue of
   automatically classifying camera-trap images with a high degree of
   accuracy. This technique, however, may be less accessible to ecologists
   or small-scale conservation projects, and has serious limitations. In
   this study, we trained a simple deep learning model using a dataset of
   120,000 images to identify the presence of nilgai Boselaphus
   tragocamelus, a regionally specific nonnative game animal, in
   camera-trap images with an overall accuracy of 97\%. We trained a second
   model to identify 20 groups of animals and one group of images without
   any animals present, labeled as ``none,'' with an accuracy of 89\%.
   Lastly, we tested the multigroup model on images collected of similar
   species, but in the southwestern United States, resulting in
   significantly lower precision and recall for each group. This study
   highlights the potential of deep learning for automating camera-trap
   image processing workflows, provides a brief overview of image-based
   deep learning, and discusses the often-understated limitations and
   methodological considerations in the context of wildlife conservation
   and species monitoring.},

Title = {Stable Isotopes Reveal Variation in Consumption of Pacific Salmon by
   Brown Bears, Despite Ready Access in Small Streams},

Abstract = {Brown bears Ursus arctos consume a wide range of organisms, including
   ungulates and plants, but Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are
   especially important to their diet where their ranges overlap. Although
   some brown bears minimize antagonistic encounters with other brown bears
   or infanticide by avoiding streams where salmon spawn, studies generally
   assume that brown bears with ready access to salmon feed heavily on
   them. To test this assumption, and the hypothesis that male brown bears
   would feed more heavily on salmon than females (owing to their sexual
   size dimorphism), we collected hair samples from brown bears by using
   barbed wire placed on six small tributaries of Lake Aleknagik, Alaska,
   USA, where adult Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are readily
   accessible and frequently consumed by brown bears. Analysis of DNA
   distinguished among the different brown bears leaving the hair samples,
   some of which were sampled multiple times within and among years. We
   assessed the contribution of salmon to the diet of individual brown
   bears by using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures. The 77
   samples analyzed from 31 different bears over 4 y showed isotopic ratios
   consistent with reliance on salmon, but the wide range of isotopic
   signatures included values suggesting variable, and in one case
   considerable, use of terrestrial resources. Stable isotope signatures
   did not differ between male and female brown bears, nor did they differ
   between two sides of the lake, despite marked differences in Sockeye
   Salmon density. We collected the hair samples when salmon were present,
   so there was some uncertainty regarding whether they reflected feeding
   during the current or previous season. Notwithstanding this caveat, the
   results are consistent with the hypothesis that salmon were sufficiently
   available to provide food for the brown bears and that the considerable
   isotopic variation among brown bears with access to salmon reflected
   their age, status, and behavior.},

Title = {Rapid Assessment of Habitat Quality for Nonbreeding Ducks in Northeast

Abstract = {The ability to assess habitat quality for wildlife is important for
   evaluating the effectiveness of, or need for, habitat management.
   Habitat assessment methods generally involve a tradeoff between
   usability and explanatory power and finding the optimal balance can be
   challenging. In 2013, Colorado Parks and Wildlife developed a habitat
   quality rapid assessment method for dabbling ducks (Anatidae) that field
   personnel used to evaluate wetland management projects. The assessment
   involves six multiple-choice questions related to vegetation and wetland
   structure and is designed to be used by people with little wetland
   ecology training. I tested the ability of the assessment to predict duck
   density and food availability at 44 sites in northeastern Colorado. I
   found that the procedure explained 10-22\% of the variability in food
   availability and was not a good predictor of duck density. By altering
   the grouping of answers as well as the weight of each question, score
   associated with each answer, and substituting a new question relating to
   percentage of coverage of duck food-producing plants, the ability of the
   assessment to explain food availability increased to 30\%. Overall, the
   assessment may be sufficient for relative indication of habitat quality,
   but if wildlife managers desire precise predictions, further refinement
   is necessary.},

Title = {Ultrasonic Acoustic Surveys of State Endangered Northern Flying
   Squirrels in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Surveying for flying squirrels by using traditional techniques produces
   extremely low detection rates compared with ultrasonic acoustics. Within
   Pennsylvania, the northern flying squirrel subspecies Glaucomys sabrinus
   macrotis is state listed as endangered due to habitat loss and
   parasite-mediated competition by and hybridization with the southern
   flying squirrel Glaucomys volans. This subspecies is isolated from
   adjacent populations in West Virginia and New York and has experienced
   drastic population declines. The discovery and characterization of
   ultrasonic vocalizations of G. s. macrotis and G. volans, as well as
   successful field surveys with ultrasonic acoustic detectors in the
   southern Appalachian Mountains, highlight the potential use of this
   technique for determining the presence of G. s. macrotis. To confirm the
   feasibility of using this technique on declining populations of G. s.
   macrotis sympatric with G. volans, we conducted 108 nights of passive
   ultrasonic acoustic surveys for G. s. macrotis at six survey sites by
   using two detectors per survey site (N = 12 detectors) in June 2017. We
   considered sites high quality ({''}high{''}) or low quality
   ({''}low{''}) based on the number of physical capture records during the
   past 2 decades and the dominance of boreo-montane conifer tree species
   in the overstory. We detected G. s. macrotis at four study sites and G.
   volans at all six study sites. We found higher average probability of
   detection for G. s. macrotis in high vs. low sites (0.28 +/- 0.06
   {[}mean +/- SE] and 0.09 +/- 0.07, respectively), whereas probability of
   detection was similar for G. volans between high and low sites (0.13 +/-
   0.05 and 0.17 +/- 0.05, respectively). We also found G. s. macrotis had
   lower latency of detection at high vs. low sites (2.7 +/- 0.8 and 7.83
   +/- 1.5 nights, respectively) but G. volans did not vary in latency of
   detection between sites (5 +/- 1.6 and 3.8 +/- 1.5 nights,
   respectively). Our study shows acoustics can be successfully used to
   efficiently survey G. s. macrotis in Pennsylvania, where populations are
   small and monitoring these populations more effectively is critical to
   determining changes in persistence due to climate- and disease-induced
   factors.},

Title = {Retention and Dimensional Changes of Evergreen Brush Piles Within a

Abstract = {Brush piles (i.e., trees and large woody debris) are often installed in
   reservoirs to supplement fish habitat. The retention and dimensional
   change of brush piles after installation is important information that
   can be used to maximize the effectiveness of this management action. We
   evaluated the retention and dimensional change of 70 eastern red cedar
   Juniperus virginiana and bald cypress Taxodium distichum brush piles in
   an embayment of a drawdown reservoir up to four annual cycles of
   submergence and exposure. We used satellite imagery to supplement our
   onsite measurements of retention. We also examined spatial patterns of
   brush pile retention and dimensional change. Brush piles were lost at
   10\% per year, and their volume was lost at 14\% per year. We compared
   our rates of brush pile retention and dimensional change with those from
   a holdout data set of 50 brush piles. Estimates between data sets did
   not differ statistically. Spatial patterns of retention and dimensional
   change coincided with morphological features in our study area,
   suggesting that retention and dimensional change is influenced by
   variable physical forces (e.g., wave action and flow) at installation
   locations. Our estimates of brush pile retention and dimensional change
   can be used to generally sustain desirable brush densities. For example,
   to maintain a fixed total volume of brush in our study embayment,
   roughly 23\% of the total brush volume installed would need to be
   replaced annually. Similar research in reservoirs managed for other
   purposes is needed, as length and cycle of inundation could lead to
   variable rates of retention and dimensional change. Additionally,
   advancements into computer-assisted detection and volume estimation
   could reduce the time and effort needed to monitor brush piles.},

Title = {Catch Rates for Sturgeon Chubs and Sicklefin Chubs in the Upper Missouri

Abstract = {A multiweek standardized sampling regime during 2004-2016 in a 60-km
   reach of the Upper Missouri River assessed reproduction and catch rates
   for Sturgeon Chub Macrhybopsis gelida and Sicklefin Chub Macrhybopsis
   meeki. We sampled age-0 Macrhybopsis (primarily Sturgeon Chubs, but
   potentially including Sicklefin Chubs) all years to indicate successful
   reproduction, but noted an inverse correlation of catch per unit area
   (CPUA) with year. There was an inverse correlation for CPUA of age-1+
   Sturgeon Chubs with year. There was no correlation for CPUA of age-1+
   Sicklefin Chubs with year, but we noted a depression in CPUA during 2010
   and 2012. The study reach includes restoration directives for federally
   endangered Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus, with 245,000
   hatchery-origin Pallid Sturgeon (HOPS) stocked since 1998 to supplement
   the declining wild stock. Pallid Sturgeon longer than 350 mm fork length
   transition to piscivory and are known to prey on Sturgeon Chubs and
   Sicklefin Chubs. We examined the hypothesis that mass additions of HOPS
   to the existing predator community could have population-level effects
   on the two chub species. Population modeling for the stocked HOPS
   through time yielded estimates of nearly 1,300 piscivore-sized HOPS in
   2004, an increase to 26,000 HOPS in 2012, and decreasing numbers through
   2016 (14,500). A negative correlation between HOPS abundance and age-0
   Macrhybopsis CPUA had the best support among other candidate variables
   (discharge, water temperature, catch rates of Sauger Sander canadensis).
   We found an inverse correlation for CPUA of age-1+ Sturgeon Chubs and
   estimated HOPS abundance, and there was also evidence of an inverse
   association between age-1+ Sicklefin Chub CPUA and HOPS in the study
   area. Results for a 60-km reach of the Upper Missouri River suggest
   declining CPUA for age-0 Macrhybopsis and Sturgeon Chubs during
   2004-2016 and modest recovery of Sicklefin Chubs after 2012. Although
   causative factors driving CPUA changes through time are not known,
   correlative analyses suggest that large numbers of HOPS added to the
   Missouri River predator community potentially influence CPUA of Sturgeon
   Chubs and Sicklefin Chubs in the study area. Testing this hypothesis
   will require expanded quantification of chub populations and HOPS
   numbers through time.},

Abstract = {Effective management of wildlife populations benefits from an
   understanding of the long-term vulnerability of species to anthropogenic
   stressors. Exposure to potential habitat change is one measure of
   vulnerability that wildlife managers often use to assess and prioritize
   individual species or groups of species for resource allocation or
   direct management actions. We used species distribution models for 15
   species occurring in the coastal plain ecoregion of Georgia to estimate
   the current amount and distribution of potential habitat and then
   predict exposure to changes in habitat due to inundation from sea level
   rise (using the Sea Level Affecting Marshes model) and urban growth
   (using the Slope Land-use Excluded Urban Topology Hillshade Growth
   model) for four future time points. Our results predict that all focal
   species were likely to experience some exposure to habitat change from
   either sea level rise or urbanization, but few species will experience
   high exposure to change from both stressors. Species that use salt marsh
   or beach habitats had the highest predicted exposure from sea level rise
   (25-69\%), while species that use more inland habitats had the highest
   predicted exposure to urban growth (10-20\%). Our models are a resource
   for managers considering tradeoffs between prioritization schemes under
   two future stressors. Results suggest that managers may need to
   prioritize species (or their habitats) based on the predicted magnitude
   of habitat loss, while also contextualizing prioritization with respect
   to the current amount of available protected habitat and species global
   vulnerability.},

Title = {Integrating Multiple Survey Techniques to Document a Shifting Bat
   Community in the Wake of White-Nose Syndrome},

Abstract = {The long-term study of bat communities often depends on a diverse set of
   sampling methodologies that are chosen based on the species or habitat
   management priorities of the research project. Integrating the data from
   a diverse set of methodologies (such as acoustic monitoring and mist net
   sampling) would improve our ability to characterize changes in community
   structure or composition over time, such as one would expect following
   an emergent infectious disease such as white-nose syndrome. We developed
   a Bayesian state-space model to integrate these disparate data into a
   common currency (relative abundance). We collected both acoustic
   monitoring and mist net capture data over an 8-y period (2006-2014) to
   document shifts in the bat community in central New England, USA, in
   response to the onset of white-nose syndrome in 2009. The integrated
   data model shows a significant decline in the abundance of little brown
   bat Myotis lucifugus, northern long-eared bat Myotis septentrionalis,
   and hoary bat Lasiurus cinereus, and an increase in abundance of the
   eastern small-footed bat Myotis leibii and the eastern red bat Lasiurus
   borealis. There was no evidence for a change in abundance in the big
   brown bat Eptesicus fuscus since the onset of white-nose syndrome. The
   consistency of this model with regional estimates of decline over the
   same time period support the validity of our relative abundance
   estimate. This model provides the opportunity to quantify shifts in
   other communities where multiple sampling methodologies were employed,
   and therefore provides natural resource managers with a robust tool to
   integrate existing sampling data to quantify changes in community
   composition that can inform conservation and management recommendations.},

Title = {Survey for Morro Bay Kangaroo Rat: A Rare Mammal of Uncertain Status},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Morro Bay kangaroo rat Dipodomys heermanni morroensis is a small,
   nocturnal, burrowing rodent endemic to the vicinity of Morro Bay in San
   Luis Obispo County, California. It was listed as endangered pursuant to
   the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1973. Despite many searches over
   three decades, the Morro Bay kangaroo rat has not been captured or
   sighted in the wild since 1986. While recognizing that the Morro Bay
   kangaroo rat may be extinct, two of us in a previous paper also
   speculated it may be persisting at extremely low density in isolated
   colonies and recommended surveying with wildlife scent-detection dogs
   and baited camera traps. We searched with a wildlife scent-detection dog
   and baited camera traps in four historically occupied areas and detected
   no Morro Bay kangaroo rats. Unfortunately, our data combined with all
   other existing data do not allow us to conclude whether the Morro Bay
   kangaroo rat is extinct or extant. Essentially, the International Union
   for the Conservation of Nature international standard has not been met
   to make a definitive determination of extinction. That is, a species
   should be considered extinct only when there is no reasonable doubt that
   the last individual has died. We acknowledge that because of resource
   limitation we surveyed only a small sample of the numerous patches of
   habitat in the expansive landscape. Further, we now consider the Morro
   Bay sand spit (total area 4.35 km(2), foredunes 3.75 km(2)), a
   peripheral area, as potentially part of the geographic range with
   suitable habitat, and it has never been searched. Therefore, considering
   all available information, we conclude that the Morro Bay kangaroo rat
   must be considered as possibly extant. We recommend that search efforts
   continue in several specific areas, including the Morro Bay sand spit.
   If the Morro Bay kangaroo rat still exists, it will be challenging and
   difficult to rediscover because of its likely low density and patchy
   distribution in the expansive landscape, combined with its small size,
   nocturnal nature, and secretive lifestyle.},

Abstract = {Nationwide monitoring programs are important tools that quantify the
   status and trends of natural resources, providing important information
   for management and conservation decisions. These programs operate at
   large spatial scales with standardized protocols that require
   wide-spread participation. However, resource limitations can reduce
   participation, which can then compromise the spatial replication needed
   for nationwide inference. The Integrated Waterbird Management and
   Monitoring program is an example of a national monitoring program that
   could benefit from a reduction in sampling effort to facilitate
   increased participation and ultimately broader inference. Therefore, we
   examined various sampling schemes to determine whether it is possible to
   reduce the sampling effort while maintaining the statistical accuracy
   needed to support management. We found that instead of needing to census
   a National Wildlife Refuge, sampling effort could be reduced while
   accurately estimating waterfowl abundance to within 10\% of the census
   count by surveying just two-thirds of all the sample units or
   three-fourths of the total survey area. Not only did this guideline
   apply to our five pilot National Wildlife Refuges, but it was also
   further validated by applying it to four additional National Wildlife
   Refuges. We hope that by applying this finding to other National
   Wildlife Refuges, we can increase participation in the program by
   reducing the logistical and financial burden of sampling.},

Abstract = {Foothold traps are effective tools for the live capture and restraint of
   wildlife for management and research. Successful river otter Lontra
   canadensis restoration programs throughout North America used them
   extensively. Restoration programs used a variety of methods and models
   of foothold traps, but comprehensive efforts to describe and quantify
   injuries associated with river otter captures have been limited. We
   evaluated injuries of river otters caught in three commercially
   available models of foothold traps including the number 11 double
   long-spring with standard jaws, the number 11 double long-spring with
   double jaws, and the number 2 coil-spring trap. Based on examinations of
   70 captured river otters, we classified 78\% of the total injuries
   detected as ``mild{''}(n = 174 injuries) and 17\% were classified as
   ``moderate{''}(n = 37 injuries). We classified less than 3\% of the
   injuries observed as ``moderately severe{''}or ``severe.'' We focused
   only on the animal welfare performance of traps; the three trap types we
   tested met the animal welfare criteria required for inclusion in the
   best management practices for trapping river otter. The criteria based
   on International Standards Organization guidelines used in this
   assessment of trap performance provides a scientific basis for future
   evaluations of river otter welfare when foothold traps are used for
   restoration, research, and population management.},

Abstract = {We analyzed 33 y of fish community data collected from a low-order,
   urban stream in central Illinois, USA, to determine the effects of
   municipal wastewater management projects and urbanization on fish
   communities. From 1985 to 2017, species richness, number of
   pollution-intolerant species, and alternative index of biotic integrity
   significantly increased at sites across this system. Species diversity
   likewise increased, but was mostly significant only at sites downstream
   of the effluent outflow. Ceasing the chlorination of wastewater in 1990
   resulted in significant increases in fish community metrics both
   upstream and downstream of effluent outflow, although effects varied
   from site to site. Completing a combined sewer overflow abatement
   project in 2008 resulted in some significant increases in species
   richness, diversity, and number of pollution-intolerant species at sites
   downstream of effluent outflow. From 2001 to 2016, the change in the
   number of pollution-intolerant species correlated inversely with the
   increased percentage of impervious cover in the study system. There was
   no significant correlation of other metrics with the change in percent
   impervious surfaces. These results suggest that urbanization at upstream
   sites limited to some extent the benefits of water management
   interventions that improved fish community metrics at downstream sites.},

Abstract = {The alligator snapping turtle Macrochelys temminckii is the largest
   freshwater turtle in North America and humans seek it as a food source,
   primarily in Louisiana. Scientists point to decades of intensive
   commercial harvest of alligator snapping turtles as a cause of
   population declines. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
   initiated a head-start program for alligator snapping turtles and
   released 53 head-started juveniles at seven sites along an approximately
   5.7-km stretch of Bundick Creek in southwest Louisiana between November
   2015 and October 2016. Before release, department personnel measured,
   weighed, and marked all alligator snapping turtles with both an internal
   passive integrated transponder tag and a numbered external tag. In 2018,
   the U.S. Geological Survey initiated a turtle trapping survey at those
   seven release sites targeting the head-started alligator snapping
   turtles. In 1 wk of trapping effort at each site, we recorded 69 turtle
   captures comprising seven species, including 15 alligator snapping
   turtles (representing 12 individuals). Of those 12 individuals, 8 were
   head-started juveniles and 4 were native to the creek. A landowner
   captured an additional head-started juvenile alligator snapping turtle
   during our trapping and we took measurements before its release. A
   minimum of 17\% of head-started alligator snapping turtles survived
   since release, and we trapped most captured head-started individuals
   near their release site; the captured individuals exhibited growth
   consistent with other studies, indicating acclimatization to their new
   environment. Three head-started alligator snapping turtles had their
   external tags entangled in the net mesh, and two of these turtles
   drowned. An additional two head-started individuals lost their external
   tags in the natural environment prior to their capture in this study.
   The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries discontinued the use
   of external tags based on our findings, as these tags were detrimental
   to the health of head-started turtles.},

Abstract = {The kit fox Vulpes macrotis is a species of concern to land managers in
   the Great Basin Desert of North America. Once common, kit foxes have
   declined from historical levels. Research on kit foxes in western Utah
   has spanned nearly 70 y and has potential to inform management and
   conservation within the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion of the Great
   Basin Desert. We conducted a systematic literature review on the
   northern kit fox subspecies V. m. nevadensis. We focused on studies
   conducted in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion, which represents the
   majority of the Great Basin Desert, and provided a comprehensive summary
   of their ecology and demographics for resource managers. To guide future
   monitoring, we also reviewed techniques used for kit fox monitoring and
   research, and evaluated the strengths, limitations, and advances of
   these techniques. We identified four key factors that deserve
   consideration when selecting monitoring techniques for kit foxes:
   estimable parameters, reliability, cost, and rate of data return.
   Finally, we identify four primary management recommendations. We
   recommend that managers (1) expand kit fox monitoring and population
   assessments more broadly across the Great Basin Desert. To ensure future
   monitoring meets the needs of resource managers, we recommend (2) the
   application of a structured decision-making process to identify key
   parameters and approaches. To better understand the factors limiting kit
   fox populations we recommend (3) population viability and parameter
   sensitivity analyses to identify drivers of population change. Finally,
   based on evidence that genetic diversity of kit fox populations has been
   maintained by undescribed patterns of gene flow, we recommend (4) a
   broad-scale assessment of population connectivity to identify corridors
   supporting metapopulation dynamics. These recommendations will
   facilitate proactive conservation of kit foxes and management practices
   to reduce future population declines.},

Title = {Missing Release Data in Capture-Mark-Recovery Analyses: Consequences for
   Inference},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Demographic probabilities, such as annual survival and harvest
   probability, are key metrics used in research and for monitoring the
   health of wildlife populations and sustainability of harvest. For
   waterfowl populations, annual estimates of these probabilities come from
   mark-recovery analysis of data from coordinated banding operations. The
   Brownie model is the most commonly used parameterization for analyzing
   mark-recovery data from harvested species. However, if banded waterfowl
   are not released during a year of a multiyear banding operation, then
   estimating annual survival and recovery probabilities from a dead
   recovery model is a challenge. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, many
   wildlife monitoring efforts, including annual waterfowl banding
   programs, were canceled or reduced during 2020 and 2021, highlighting
   the need for wildlife managers to better understand the consequences of
   missing data on analyses and regulatory decisions. We summarized methods
   of model parameterization and use of alternative methods to explore the
   behavior of demographic parameter estimates when a year of release data
   was missing. Comparing constrained fixed-effect models (we set
   parameters during the missing year of data equal to parameters for years
   with release data) with random-effect models, we found that 1) bias of
   estimates during a year of missing release data was smaller when using a
   random-effect model, 2) the direction of the bias was unpredictable, but
   the expected range in bias could be generally known commensurate to the
   underlying variability in survival and recovery probabilities, and 3)
   potential bias was greatest if the missing year of releases occurred
   during the final year of a time series. We conclude that in some
   circumstances, various modeling approaches can provide reasonable
   estimates during a year of missing release data, particularly when
   underlying demographic parameters, or the parameter constrained in a
   model, vary little over time (e.g., adult survival in long-lived
   species), which would result in relatively little bias in the other
   estimated parameter (e.g., annual recovery probability). We also suggest
   that using alternative analytical techniques, such as random-effect
   models, may improve estimates for the demographic parameters of interest
   when release data are missing. Random-effect models also allowed us to
   estimate parameters, such as juvenile recovery probabilities, during the
   year of missing release data, which are not identifiable using standard
   modeling techniques. Where accurate and precise parameter estimation is
   important for making harvest management decisions and regardless of the
   model type or the data used, there is no analytical replacement for
   missing release data. We suggest that practitioners determine the
   potential consequences for missing data through simulation by using
   empirical data and simulated data with known demographic probabilities
   to determine the best actions to take for analyzing their
   capture-recovery data when release data are missing.},

Abstract = {As human populations grow, decisions regarding use of the world's finite
   land base become increasingly complex. We adopted a land use-conflict
   scenario involving renewable energy to illustrate one potential cause of
   these conflicts and resulting tradeoff decisions. Renewable energy
   industries wishing to expand operations in the United States are limited
   by multijurisdictional regulations in finding developable land. Interest
   groups entreat industries to avoid land for various reasons, including
   avoidance of prime wildlife habitat in accordance with an
   ``avoidance-first{''} mitigation strategy. By applying a uniform set of
   rules for renewable energy facilities to the Prairie Pothole Region and
   portions of the Northern Great Plains, we evaluated the effects of
   regulations and avoidance of prime wildlife habitat on the amount of
   land available for development. In our scenario, existing regulations
   excluded 39\% of the project area from potential development, with human
   infrastructure accounting for 30\% (10-66\% among states), whereas
   federally protected species accounted for < 1\% at project area and
   state levels. Unregulated lands accounted for 61\% of the project area,
   with conservation areas predicted as high-quality sites for breeding
   grassland birds and waterfowl and for migrating whooping cranes Grus
   americana accounting for 19\% within the project area (6-27\% among
   states). This model demonstrated a limited land base available for new
   development when accounting for regulations and concerns of a subset of
   societal interest groups. Additional interest groups likely will have
   different and competing concerns, further emphasizing the complexity of
   future land-use decisions as the available land base for development
   diminishes.},

Title = {Blood Lead Declines in Wintering American Black Ducks in New Jersey

Abstract = {Waterfowl managers first recognized the problem of lead poisoning in
   ducks from the ingestion of spent lead shot (pellets) over 100 years
   ago. The phaseout of lead shot for waterfowl hunting began in the
   Atlantic Flyway in the 1970s. Lead shot was subsequently banned
   throughout the United States and Canada prior to 2000. We compared blood
   lead levels in American black ducks Anas rubripes wintering in coastal
   New Jersey in 1978, prior to the lead ban, and in 2017, about 39 years
   after lead shot was first banned for use in Atlantic coastal marshes and
   27 years after it was banned for waterfowl hunting in New Jersey. The
   prevalence of blood lead >0.2 ppm, a level commonly used to indicate
   lead exposure, declined nearly fourfold from 1978 (79\%) to 2017 (20\%).
   We found no significant differences in the prevalence of birds with
   blood lead levels >0.2 ppm between sexes in either year or between age
   classes in 2017. The prevalence of ducks with blood lead levels >1.0
   ppm, considered clinically evident toxicity, declined from 19\% in 1978
   to 1\% in 2017. Our study provides further evidence that the ban on the
   use of lead shot over 20 years ago throughout North America has resulted
   in lower blood lead levels in waterfowl. Notwithstanding, we still found
   evidence of lead exposure in black ducks in 2017, which warrants further
   investigation.},

Title = {Reproductive Characteristics and Performance of the Florida Panther: A
   Retrospective Examination of Long-Term Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {550-561},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Knowledge of reproductive characteristics and performance (RCP) is
   necessary to estimate a species' breeding output and provide indicators
   to evaluate population health. Long-term data are important because they
   provide insight into the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in
   determining RCP and lifetime breeding output of individuals and
   productivity of populations. Here, I examine the RCP of the Florida
   panther Puma concolor coryi by using an extensive data set collected
   from 1981 to 2019. My objective is to establish baseline RCP parameters
   and to determine the factors that affect lifetime breeding output.
   Briefly, the results from a variety of data analyses show the following:
   1) Florida panthers exhibit a spring (March-May) birth pulse; 2) minimum
   age at sexual maturity does not differ between sexes; 3) mean annual
   proportion of females reproducing, litter size, and birth rate
   progressively decrease with increasing maternal age; 4) mean litter sex
   ratio is male biased; 5) mean birth interval differs between successful
   and unsuccessful litters; 6) proportion of kittens that recruited into
   the breeding population is small; and 7) distribution of parentage and
   mating partners among individuals in litters of known mothers and
   fathers is right skewed. The results indicate that breeding output is
   limited both by low birth rate and small proportion of offspring
   recruiting into the breeding population. The decreasing RCP with
   increasing maternal age suggests that costs of reproduction and
   progressive body condition senescence are important factors limiting
   lifetime breeding output. Despite these inhibiting factors, the data
   came from a period of substantial population growth and expansion since
   1995, so the RCP shown is productive for this species. Outcomes from
   this study provide important RCP information for wildlife managers to
   implement measurable criteria to assess trends in Florida panther
   breeding output and population health.},

Abstract = {We assessed long-term retention of passive integrated transponder (PIT)
   tags injected into the subcutaneous musculature between the pelvic fins
   of adult Walleye Sander vitreus via collecting fish from natural lakes
   in northwestern Iowa during April 2015, examining fish for the presence
   of an existing visual implant tag (used as secondary mark), implanting
   PIT tags in a representative subsample of previously marked fish, and
   recapturing fish during subsequent annual surveys. Of the 332 Walleye
   (range = 444-706 mm; mean total length = 544 mm; standard deviation =
   43) PIT tagged in 2015, 87 of 88 (98.9\%) recaptured from 1 to 4 y after
   tagging retained their tag. We captured 23 Walleye more than once (>= 2
   y after tagging) and all Walleye had retained their tag on their second
   or third recapture. This study and others demonstrate that the pelvic
   girdle was an effective PIT-tagging location for long-term studies
   evaluating adult Walleye population dynamics. In addition, the low
   probability of tags being encountered in fish fillets by anglers makes
   this a desirable tag location for Walleye studies where Walleye are
   often targeted for consumption. These studies collectively demonstrate
   that PIT tags inserted into the pelvic girdle of a range of Walleye
   sizes yield retention rates suitable for advanced population modeling or
   stocking evaluations.},

Title = {Can an Avian Electrocution Risk Model From California Guide Retrofitting
   Throughout the Western United States?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A previously published model of avian electrocution risk, the ``2014
   model,{''} compared power poles that electrocuted birds (electrocution
   poles; including 21 golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos electrocutions) with
   poles not known to have electrocuted birds (comparison poles). The 2014
   model produces pole-specific risk index scores between 0 and 1. The
   scores rank relative risk so electric utilities can maximize
   conservation benefits per dollar spent by focusing retrofitting on poles
   with greatest risk. Although the creation of the 2014 model encompassed
   a study population of birds and poles in southern California, the 2014
   model has potential for use in managing a target population of raptors
   including golden eagles throughout the western United States. Use beyond
   southern California is only appropriate if the study population is
   similar enough to the target population for the 2014 model to predict
   risk effectively. To evaluate similarity, we examined five sources of
   evidence: 1) the relative consistency in electrical safety codes for
   power poles; 2) the body sizes of golden eagles in the study and target
   populations; and consistency in structure-specific factors associated
   with 3) golden eagle electrocutions in other studies, 4) other avian
   electrocutions, and 5) previously unreported golden eagle
   electrocutions. We found that although the study population in the 2014
   model included relatively few golden eagles, data were sufficient to
   create a model that is applicable to a target population throughout the
   western United States. The model also can be useful in helping determine
   equivalencies between pole types if utilities seek to compare benefits
   of retrofitting small numbers of high-risk poles with large numbers of
   low-risk poles.},

Title = {Recovery of Freshwater Invertebrates in Alpine Lakes and Streams
   Following Eradication of Nonnative Trout with Rotenone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Nonnative fish eradication via the piscicide rotenone is an effective
   tool for fisheries management and conservation of native species.
   However, the long-term effects on nontarget organisms, including benthic
   invertebrates and zooplankton in alpine lakes, are understudied and are
   poorly understood. As part of a landscape-scale native fish conservation
   project, we assessed the effects of 50 ppb of rotenone on the aquatic
   invertebrate community by comparing pre-and postrotenone treatment
   density and diversity metrics of benthic invertebrates and zooplankton
   in 13 alpine lakes and their outlets in Montana, USA. Across study
   sites, decreases in density and diversity of some invertebrate taxa,
   including Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were observed the
   year following rotenone treatment, and within 3 y, densities and
   diversities were similar to and sometimes higher than pretreatment
   values. These results demonstrate resilience of aquatic invertebrate
   communities following rotenone exposure in alpine lakes and streams and
   informs fisheries managers for planning rotenone projects and monitoring
   recovery of nontarget organisms. Additional studies will be useful to
   evaluate the mechanisms driving invertebrate recovery rates, including
   downstream drift from nontreated areas and terrestrial adult dispersal.},

Title = {Effects of Stocking Transport Duration on Age-0 Walleye},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-82},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fish hatcheries are generally not adjacent to stocking locations. Thus,
   hatchery fish undergo transportation processes for variable durations
   that can result in changes in water quality, fish physiology (e.g.,
   whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol), and reduced survival. Walleye
   Sander vitreus are commonly stocked throughout North America with
   variable stocking success, possibly due to altered physiological
   responses associated with changes in water quality parameters during
   transportation. We hypothesized increased transport duration would be
   associated with increases in water temperature, carbon dioxide, and
   total ammonia nitrogen and decreases in pH and total alkalinity. We also
   hypothesized that increases in carbon dioxide, water temperature,
   un-ionized ammonia, and total ammonia nitrogen would be positively
   related with Walleye whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol
   concentrations. Walleye were transported for either 0, 0.5, 3, or 5 h
   and whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations and mortality
   were evaluated for 48 h posttransport. Total ammonia nitrogen
   concentrations, carbon dioxide, pH, and water temperature increased with
   transportation duration while total alkalinity decreased. Plasma
   cortisol and whole blood glucose concentrations of Walleye transported
   for longer durations took longer to decline relative to those not
   transported. Water quality parameters were not associated with changes
   in Walleye whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations, but
   they were negatively related with time since transport (P < 0.05).
   Despite increases in stress, mortality was low (2.5\%). Overall, we
   found evidence to support our hypotheses regarding reduced water quality
   associated with increasing transport duration. Finally, whole blood
   glucose and plasma cortisol concentration of Walleye that were
   transported were similar to those not transported, suggesting handling
   procedures before transportation could play a significant role in
   physiological responses measured after transportation. Further,
   evaluation of stocking procedures aimed at decreasing handling during
   the loading process could enhance stocking protocols. Elevated
   concentrations of whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol following
   transport could make recently stocked Walleye more susceptible to the
   effects of other environmental factors such as starvation, predation,
   and disease, all of which could result in increased mortality rates
   after stocking.},

Title = {Avian Responses to Vegetation Changes From Post Oak Savanna Restoration
   Efforts in Eastern Texas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-69},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Once covering approximately 46 million hectares of the Midwestern United
   States extending from southern Wisconsin southward into Texas, canopy
   cover of oak savannas ranged from 10\% to 70\%, and were dominated by
   fire-resistant oak species such as bur oak Quercus macrocarpa and post
   oak Quercus stellata, with a well-developed, diverse herbaceous layer
   dominated by fire-adapted grasses and forbs. In response to the loss and
   degradation of oak savannas, associated wildlife populations have
   experienced long-term declines. For example, 70\% of
   disturbance-dependent bird species in the United States have experienced
   declines, with most of these species being associated with grasslands,
   oak savannas, and open forest communities. Few studies have documented
   the success of restoration in post oak savanna systems in regard to
   breeding bird assemblages. Our objective was to quantify avian
   abundance, density, species richness, and assemblage structure under
   three site conditions (reference, restored, and partially restored
   {[}aka unrestored]) within post oak savannas at Gus Engeling Wildlife
   Management Area in eastern Texas. We conducted vegetation and avian
   transect surveys postrestoration (2016-2017) and compared our results
   with prerestoration baseline surveys conducted in 2009. Restoration
   initiated in 2010 was partially successful, with vegetation changes that
   closely resemble presettlement characteristics, with the appearance of
   obligate grassland species. Specifically, prerestoration, one dickcissel
   Spiza americana and no lark sparrows Chondestes grammacus were detected.
   By 2017, dickcissel density in the restored sites was similar to
   densities recorded on tallgrass prairie and other high-quality habitat
   in the southern portion of its range. Lark sparrows were also detected,
   but at low densities. We also observed the persistence and increase of
   several woodland and open woodland species over time. These patterns are
   likely attributed to the creation of a mosaic of microhabitats selected
   by these species, such as the persistence of mottes, as well as their
   increased edge-to-area ratios. Restoration sites that are larger in size
   and in closer proximity to other restored or remnant savannas should
   have a higher priority to increase their likelihood of recolonization by
   target species. Restoration efforts may still be successful in more
   isolated areas, such as Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area, but
   conducting postrestoration monitoring will further elucidate
   site-specific restoration dynamics.},

Title = {Can Landsat Thermal Imagery and Environmental Data Accurately Estimate
   Water Temperatures in Small Streams?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {12-26},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ability to monitor water temperature is important for assessing
   changes in riverine ecosystems resulting from climate warming. Direct in
   situ water temperature collection efforts provide point samples but are
   cost-prohibitive for characterizing stream temperatures across large
   spatial scales, especially for small, remote streams. In contrast,
   satellite thermal infrared imagery may provide a spatially extensive
   means of monitoring riverine water temperatures; however, researchers do
   not have a good understanding of the accuracy of these remotely sensed
   temperatures for small streams. Here, we investigated the utility of
   Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery and both local and regional
   environmental variables to estimate subsurface temperatures in
   high-latitude small streams (2-30 m wetted width) from a test watershed
   in southcentral Alaska. Our results suggested that Landsat-based surface
   temperatures were biased high, and the degree of bias varied with
   hydrological and meteorological factors. However, with limited instream
   validation work, results indicated it is possible to reconstruct average
   in situ water temperatures for small streams at regional scales using a
   regression modelling framework coupled with publicly available Landsat
   or air temperature information. Generalized additive models built from
   stream stage information from a single gage and air temperatures from a
   single weather station in the drainage fit to a limited set of in situ
   temperature recordings could estimate average stream temperatures at the
   watershed level with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error 2.4
   degrees C). Landsat information did track closely with regional air
   temperatures and we could also incorporate it into a regression model as
   a substitute for air temperature to estimate in situ stream temperatures
   at watershed scales. Importantly, however, while average watershed-scale
   stream temperatures may be predictable, site-level estimates did not
   improve with the use of Landsat information or other local covariates,
   indicating that additional information may be necessary to generate
   accurate spatially explicit temperature predictions for small order
   streams.},

Abstract = {Prussian Carp Carassius gibelio, also referred to as Gibel Carp, is a
   destructive aquatic invasive species, recently found in Alberta, Canada.
   Three-pass electrofishing is a potential approach to control some
   aquatic invasive fish species in stream habitats. The objectives of this
   study were to 1) determine the efficacy of this strategy to control
   Prussian Carp in connected streams and 2) assess whether population size
   or the distance to the introduction site would influence removal
   success. We sampled sites by using electrofishing in tributaries of the
   Red Deer River in both the summer and fall and detected Prussian Carp at
   all sites before removal, with >90\% probability of detection of this
   species within the first 120 m of electroshocking efforts. Overall, we
   were not successful at removing Prussian Carp from the sample sites, and
   we found that abundances of Prussian Carp were significantly higher
   postremoval. Removal success related significantly to distance to the
   introduction site, suggesting that removal may be useful in targeted
   situations close to the edge of the invasion front.},

Title = {Effects of Liberalizing Harvest Regulations on Canada Goose Demography
   in Nebraska},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {430-442},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Harvest regulations are used to manage game species. Across their range,
   Canada geese Branta canadensis have recovered from near extirpation and
   are now perceived as overabundant and even a nuisance or a threat to
   human safety in many regions. Like many states, Nebraska has liberalized
   harvest regulations to increase recreation opportunities for consumptive
   users and to control increasing numbers of Canada geese. However, the
   efficacy of harvest regulations to control goose abundance is unclear.
   We used a live capture-recapture and dead recovery data set of more than
   19,000 Canada geese banded in Nebraska 2006-2017 to determine the effect
   of liberalized harvest regulations on goose survival and overall growth
   rate. Our goals were to 1) estimate demographic parameters for Canada
   geese in five different regions in Nebraska; 2) estimate the effect of
   increasing daily bag limits during the early September season and
   regular season on survival of hatch-year, juvenile, and adult Canada
   geese; and 3) relate the effect of estimated changes in survival to
   regional growth rates. We found that survival (0.54-0.87), fidelity
   (0.14-0.99), and productivity (number of young per adult, 0.17-2.08)
   varied substantially among regions within Nebraska. We found that
   increasing early-season bag limits, but not regular-season bag limits,
   reduced survival in Canada geese. However, this effect was greatest when
   comparing years without an early season to years with the highest daily
   bag limits used in Nebraska (eight). Survival of juvenile geese (2-3 y
   posthatch) were unaffected by changes in daily bag limits during any
   season, though the probability of reporting was greatest for this age
   class. The observed reductions in survival probability of hatch-year and
   adult geese due to increased daily bag limits during the early season (<
   10\%) led to a decrease in regional growth rates of similar to 5\%
   between years with the most liberal early-season daily bag limits and
   years without an early season. Our results suggest that increased bag
   limits during the early season may reduce Canada goose survival, but not
   enough to affect regional growth rates in Nebraska.},

Abstract = {We retrospectively evaluated 20 y of using predator-deterrent fences to
   mitigate unusually high nest predation for the critically endangered
   Attwater's prairie-chicken Tympanuchus cupido attwateri at the Attwater
   Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge. Refuge staff constructed
   fences of 0.9-m-high, 032-0.64-cm mesh hardware cloth, with 15.2-m-long
   sides, and staked at the bottom to discourage predators from going under
   the fence. Workers placed fences around nests at a mean of 3.2 d of
   incubation. Eighty-two percent of fenced nests were successful vs. 12\%
   for unfenced nests. Daily survival rate increased from 0.9159 for
   unfenced nests in 1997-2011 to 0.9916 for fenced nests during 2000-2019.
   Fencing did not increase abandonment or reduce the proportion of eggs
   that hatched in successful nests. After 2012, we reduced fence sides
   from 15.2 m to 7.6 m in length. Larger and smaller fences were equally
   effective with respect to daily survival rate and proportion of
   abandoned nests. The median proportion of eggs that hatched from
   successful nests was 6\% higher for larger fences vs. smaller fences,
   but this difference was not statistically significant.
   Predator-deterrent fences substantially increased Attwater's
   prairie-chicken nesting success in this study, and may represent a
   viable management strategy for increasing nesting success for other
   populations of ground-nesting birds with high conservation value.},

Abstract = {We estimated the allowable annual take of great black-backed gulls Larus
   marinus, herring gulls L. argentatus, ring billed gulls L. delawarensis,
   and laughing gulls Leucophaeus atricilla in the U.S. portion of the
   Atlantic Flyway to help meet human safety and resource management goals.
   Gulls can pose a serious threat to aviation, negatively impact other
   colonial-nesting migratory bird species, and conflict with other human
   activities. We estimated an annual take limit using a model that
   incorporated intrinsic population growth rate, minimum population size,
   and a recovery factor for each species. We estimated intrinsic
   population growth by combining allometric with life table approaches. We
   used the recovery factor to restrict the take level of the great
   black-backed gull beyond that of the other species because of poor data
   quality and concern about its population status. The herring gull was
   the only species with comprehensive demographic data. Population sizes
   used in estimating potential take limit varied greatly among the four
   species, but estimates of intrinsic population growth rate were similar
   (range 0.118 to 0.197). The annual potential take limits for the four
   gull species were 7,963 for herring gulls, 2,081 for great black-backed
   gulls, 15,039 for laughing gulls, and 14,826 for ring-billed gulls.
   Comparing average annual take from 2012-2019 to our modeled potential
   take limit, overharvest has not occurred for great black-backed and
   laughing gulls, occurred once every 8 y for ring-billed gulls, and
   occurred over half the time for herring gulls.},

Title = {Mass die-off of African elephants in Botswana: pathogen, poison or a
   perfect storm?},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-156},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Reports of a mass die-off of similar to 350 elephants (Loxo-donta
   africana) in northern Botswana over a period of two months (May-June
   2020), has fuelled speculation and concern regarding the cause. Although
   the area in which these mortalities occurred is not protected and is
   considered a hotspot for human-elephant conflict and poaching, both
   malicious poisoning and poaching are unlikely to have played a role as
   other species were not affected, and elephant carcasses were found with
   tusks intact. In the absence of a confirmed cause we sought to identify
   the lines of enquiry that are most likely to lead to a definitive
   answer. In particular, we consider viral and bacterial agents that could
   precipitate species-specific mortalities on this scale, potential
   environmental sources of poisoning and the samples and tests that would
   assist in excluding/ confirming these candidate causes. Whilst it may be
   argued that these mortalities are unlikely to negatively impact the
   broader elephant population of similar to 130 000 individuals in
   Botswana, the same cannot be said of the many vulnerable population
   pockets in other parts of Africa. For this reason, it is essential that
   the cause of the current die-off is identified as it is the only way to
   prevent similar losses of susceptible elephants elsewhere.},

Title = {Farmer attitudes and regional risk modelling of human-wildlife conflict
   on farmlands bordering the Boland Mountain Complex, South Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict in unprotected areas, especially those bordering
   reserves, has resulted in the global home range and population size
   reduction of naturally occurring wildlife. Simultaneously, rural
   communities and commercial farmlands at the interface of human
   development and natural habitat face severe threats to their livelihoods
   and agricultural security, often resulting in the vast eradication of
   real or perceived damage-causing animals (DCAs). The knowledge of local
   people was relied on to elucidate the dynamic and interwoven social,
   economic and ecological factors giving rise to the largely undocumented
   conflict between landowners and wildlife adjacent to the Boland Mountain
   Complex, South Africa. Subsequently, the spatial location of observed
   and expected zones of species-specific risk on a regional level was
   anticipated and mapped using a maximum entropy algorithm. The highest
   level of tolerance by farmers was shown for primates and ungulates,
   while tolerance for carnivores, avifauna and invasive or feral species
   were comparatively lower. The results presented in this manuscript will
   enable the prioritization of locations and species to create improved
   mitigation and management plans. It will furthermore provide for more
   accurate allocation of conservation resources to minimize conflicts,
   optimize agricultural yield, reduce wildlife off-take, and ultimately
   ameliorate human-wildlife conflict.},

   Botswana},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-40},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolution of the tourism sector has been subjected to massive
   changes in demand and technology, as well as increasing competition
   amongst destinations to such a degree that product diversification is
   now core to development strategies in order to maintain competitiveness
   and remain abreast of contemporary trends. The study sought to determine
   the demand for ecotourism products in view of developing a
   diversification strategy. Self-administered questionnaires were used to
   collect demand-side data at Maun and Kasane airports; these data were
   then analysed quantitatively. Findings revealed a strong preference for
   wildlife/wilderness and nature products, whereas events and hunting were
   least liked. The country attracts mature tourists who prefer soft
   adventure and activities that prioritize conservation, interpretation,
   and environmental education. Factors related to entertainment, the
   construction of entertainment facilities, a post office, and golf
   courses were strongly resented. It was established that related
   diversification, focused on expanding services and enhancing existing
   products, is the most appropriate strategy. Practically, the research
   offers a specific diversification strategy based on ecotourism,
   detailing how and what to diversify. The study makes a valuable
   contribution to demand-side diversification literature as well as
   empirical research, which is lacking in Botswana.},

Title = {Community attitudes and perceptions concerning rhinoceros poaching and

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rhinoceros poaching has been recognized the world over as a conservation
   crisis, the result of the high price of horn and demand in Asian
   markets. The commitment and participation of local people in
   conservation activities, however, are crucial for conservation success.
   Here we assess attitudes and perceptions towards rhino poaching and
   conservation in light of surveys in two local communities adjacent to
   the Hlane Royal National Park in eSwatini where perhaps 100 black
   (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhino occur. Our
   survey of 60 households addressed perceptions and attitudes towards
   rhino conservation and willingness to participate in rhino poaching and
   conservation activities. No efforts have been made to involve local
   people in conservation activities, and the people do not benefit from
   the park's activities. About 20\% of respondents expressed their
   willingness to help rhino poachers provided they are paid for their
   services. Of the remaining 80\%, some mentioned that they would not help
   poachers for fear of being apprehended. Still, some mentioned that they
   would not help poachers because of their concern about poaching and
   believe its prevention is important. Park authorities here and elsewhere
   could invest in building better people-park relationships, and provide
   opportunities for local communities to participate in conservation
   activities. Conservation policies to co-manage the resources could be
   used to deter poaching and to conserve wildlife involving local
   community members in monitoring and enforcement strategies.},

   establishment of 15 native species across 2 years and at five sites was
   the application of the insecticide Bifenthrin to reduce seed predation
   by ants. The polymer film removed after 10 weeks also improved
   germination of a range of shrubby but not tree species. However, these
   early advantages were eroded over time at the first trial site due to
   damage from herbivores and at subsequent sites due to weed competition
   and mortality of seedlings over summer. Caging was beneficial to the
   ongoing persistence of tree and shrub species but also protected weeds.
   Further work on seed testing and timely weed control is needed.},

Title = {Kangaroo management in the South Australian rangelands: Impacts and
   challenges for conservation management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {24-34},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wildlife management on a landscape scale is often complex, particularly
   where different land use practices occur in the same region. This is
   particularly so for the management of overabundant grazing species (both
   domestic and native) in a modified landscape, where anthropogenic
   activities and climatic drivers can influence their distribution and
   abundance beyond sustainable levels. In Australia's arid rangelands,
   macropods benefit from pastoral activities including improved pastures,
   artificial watering points and the removal of apex predators. This paper
   addresses some of the challenges associated with managing Red Kangaroo
   (Osphranter rufus) in a conservation context on the privately managed
   Boolcoomatta Station conservation reserve in the South Australian arid
   rangelands. We reflect on the history of the region and how
   anthropogenic activities, associated with an unpredictable climate, have
   made macropod management so complex. Ecological monitoring at
   Boolcoomatta Station suggests that, along with the influence of
   rainfall, grazing by overabundant Red Kangaroo had a negative impact on
   vegetation and resident avifauna of chenopod plains. Fenced exclosures
   further demonstrate the grazing impact of Red Kangaroo, with perennial
   grasses found only where grazing was excluded. The closure of
   waterpoints (dams) failed to reduce Red Kangaroo impacts on the reserve,
   despite some evidence that persistence of Red Kangaroo near fenced dams
   may be reduced in the long term. Results of monitoring and management
   outcomes at Boolcoomatta highlight the need for an improved framework to
   manage Red Kangaroo. This should include consideration of improved
   regional stock management practices in the face of climate change;
   improving our understanding of the role of apex predators in
   agricultural landscapes; developing and setting grazing impact
   thresholds to instigate macropod management; improving and standardizing
   monitoring methods for assessing impacts; and lastly, consideration of
   the mental health and social well-being of land managers in these areas.},

Abstract = {In fenced protected areas with limited opportunities to disperse,
   resources and constraints vary in space and time, affecting herbivore
   behaviour. The distribution, availability and quality of resources,
   burnt areas, and potential inter-specific competition all play a role in
   sustaining populations of large sympatric African herbivores. We
   investigated the role of resources, constraints and interspecific
   relationships on habitat use by three ruminants - black and blue
   wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou, C. taurinus) and red hartebeest
   (Alcelaphus buselaphus), and a non-ruminant, plains zebra (Equus
   quagga), across seasons and in different landscape types in a South
   African reserve. Black wildebeest, blue wildebeest and red hartebeest
   preferred the open grassland landscape, with homogeneous vegetation,
   while zebra favoured the wooded grassland landscape, with more
   heterogeneous vegetation. Burnt areas and vegetation greenness were
   important for all species, while elevation represented a constraint for
   black wildebeest only. The presence/absence of other species was
   important in shaping landscape use for black and blue wildebeest, and
   this suggests the possibility of competition. Our findings confirm the
   importance of heterogeneity and, in particular, the important role of a
   planned burning regime in maintaining such heterogeneity to sustain
   multi-species herbivore assemblages in small fenced nature reserves,
   where competition might arise between species using similar resources.},

Abstract = {Nationwide aerial animal censuses of Botswana between 1992 and 2012,
   conducted by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, have
   highlighted a 71\% decline in the national springbok (Antidorcas
   marsupialis) population and a contraction of their range. The reasons
   for this decline remain unknown. We investigated possible drivers of
   this decline in the southern Kalahari of Botswana. We assessed springbok
   resource selection levels, movement behaviour and seasonal and spatial
   effects on the juvenile:adult female ratio. Springbok displayed high
   levels of forage and habitat selection. Their dependency on pan habitats
   renders their distribution predictable, which could expose them to high
   levels of predation and poaching. Springbok moved shorter daily
   distances during the hot dry and longer distances during wet seasons.
   High temperatures during the hot dry season could limit movement and
   prevent exploitation of spatially and temporally heterogeneous
   resources. We recorded a ratio of 0.37 juvenile:1 adult female in the
   wet season months followed by a ratio decline to 0.10:1 in the
   subsequent cold dry season, indicating a low recruitment rate that could
   be contributing to the springbok population decline. Environmental
   changes and anthropogenic disturbances, exacerbated by climate change,
   will likely exert a negative influence on selective foragers like
   springbok.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {We provide a comparison of bat activity levels recorded during long-term
   acoustic monitoring through 188 microphones at pre-construction wind
   energy facility (WEF) sites in 12 South African ecoregions, and discuss
   the implications of the results for wind energy development. We summed
   all bat passes and detector hours over microphones, sites and years for
   each month, and fitted a negative binomial regression model with total
   bat passes as the response and ecoregion as the predictor. Overall,
   there was a significant effect of ecoregion on the number of bat passes
   per detector hour recorded near ground level, and in the turbine rotor
   sweep. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the sites in Maputaland
   coastal forests and woodlands, and KwaZulu-Natal-Cape coastal forests,
   were most distinct due to exceptionally high levels of recorded
   activity. As such, we strongly advise against WEF development in these
   ecoregions. In lowland fynbos and renosterveld, Limpopo lowveld, and
   Albany thickets, where intermediate to high bat activity was recorded,
   we recommend that the conditions of WEF-authorizations must include
   rigorous bat impact mitigation measures. For operational WEFs, our
   results provided valuable benchmark information for devising bat
   fatality thresholds that reflect the variation in bat activity across
   South Africa's diverse landscape.},

Abstract = {In contrast to other game species and domestic livestock, there is a
   paucity of evidence concerning yields and thus meat obtained from the
   African savanna buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). The aim of our study
   was to investigate the effects of age (categorized) and sex on buffalo
   carcass yields. Towards this goal, male (n = 17) and female (n = 13),
   and adult (n = 23) and subadult (n = 7) buffaloes were slaughtered, and
   the weight of the carcass and various organs/offal and six major muscles
   {[}(biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), semitendinosus (ST),
   longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL), infraspinatus (IS) and
   supraspinatus (SS)] determined. Buffaloes had a high dressing
   percentage, calculated from the warm carcass weight, and with the
   heaviest muscle weights measured for the BF, SM and LTL muscles. Adults
   had heavier muscle weights than subadults, and all parameters except the
   heart and IS muscle weight differed significantly between these age
   groups. In addition, the skin and head weight differed significantly
   between males and females. In summary, African savanna buffalo yields
   (similar to 58\%) compared favourably to other domestic animals, with
   the heavy weight of valuable muscles suggesting their commercial
   potential as a high-end value-added product.},

Abstract = {An eradication program using rotenone was implemented primarily
   targeting a localised population of the feral Pearl Cichlid (Geophagus
   brasiliensis), and as a secondary objective to also remove the
   widespread Eastern Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in two artificial lakes
   used for irrigation purposes in Byford, Western Australia (WA).
   Rotenone, applied at the approved rate (i.e. 0.25 ppm), failed to
   eradicate all Eastern Gambusia, and possibly all of the Pearl Cichlids
   in the first attempt, but at a higher dose rate (i.e. 1 ppm) it
   eradicated both species on the second attempt. We attributed the initial
   failure partially to the low dose rate of rotenone approved by the
   Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). Pearl
   Cichlids are present in multiple public ponds and lakes, and waterways
   in the greater Perth metropolitan area (), and needs to be more
   aggressively managed by the Department of Primary Industries and
   Regional Development (DPIRD).},

Abstract = {Traditional fire practices in Australia's deserts may have created
   mosaics of post-fire seral stages that benefitted some plants and
   animals. Managing fire to emulate the patterns produced by traditional
   burning practices is a common objective in contemporary conservation
   planning in Australia's deserts. However, the extent to which
   traditional burning in deserts affected fire regimes across space and
   time is contested. We aim to contribute to knowledge about the impacts
   of traditional burning on fire patterns in the Great Sandy Desert,
   northwest Australia. Our study covered the traditional lands of the
   Karajarri people, where some families were living a traditional
   lifestyle on Country until the 1960s. We analysed high-quality aerial
   photographs taken over 18,000 km(2) of Karajarri Country in the 1940s.
   Fire footprints up to several years old were mapped from these images,
   and their spatial characteristics were compared to those of contemporary
   fire regimes over the same area, visualised using high-resolution
   Sentinel satellite imagery. Fires in the 1940s (considered traditional)
   were more numerous but much smaller than contemporary (2016-2020) fires.
   The areal extent of recently burnt areas was smaller and the fire
   frequency was lower in the 1940s. Contemporary fire patterns around
   cultural sites differed little from fire patterns elsewhere in the
   landscape, possibly because people were burning over large areas rather
   than only at localised sites. Our study suggests that Karajarri
   influenced fire patterns at a landscape scale in the Great Sandy Desert,
   at least during periods of average rainfall. The findings are helping
   Karajarri refine fire management goals, for example, by informing the
   size and dispersion of future burns, and supporting community discussion
   about fire and culture. Fire management outcomes for plants and animals
   are being tracked with a biodiversity monitoring program.},

Abstract = {Peri-urban Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) populations can
   reach very high densities in areas with remnant native vegetation and
   adequate pasture. This review summarizes the scientific evidence for the
   impacts of these high-density peri-urban populations, which
   predominantly involve threats to human life and livelihood
   (kangaroo-vehicle collisions), impacts on threatened species and
   ecosystems and declines in the health of individual kangaroos. The
   latter two impacts result from an imbalance between the kangaroo
   population and their food resources. We argue that urban infrastructure
   is a fundamental driver of many of these inter-related impacts through
   population fragmentation, isolation and direct mortality of kangaroos on
   roads. Roads may also act as barriers to movement, isolating populations
   and promoting this localized overabundance. However, not all peri-urban
   kangaroo populations attain high densities. Combined with the impacts of
   climate change on resource availability, peri-urban development has the
   capacity to push local populations towards extinction in actively
   urbanizing areas via the impacts of habitat loss and/or fragmentation
   and road mortality. The successful coexistence of people and kangaroos
   in these peri-urban environments therefore requires a better
   understanding of the impacts of urban infrastructure on kangaroo
   population dynamics, and a better policy framework to promote
   ecologically sensitive development.},

Abstract = {Interspecific competition among terrestrial carnivores can have
   widespread impacts on community structure and can ultimately determine
   which species are able to coexist. Within the carnivore guild,
   coexistence can be achieved through either spatial, temporal or dietary
   partitioning. The most effective method of avoiding competition may be
   spatial partitioning, as it removes the potential for negative
   interactions. The ways in which large carnivore species utilize and
   partition space in small, enclosed reserves in South Africa is currently
   poorly understood. This knowledge gap weakens our understanding of which
   mechanisms structure large carnivore communities in these systems. Thus,
   our aim was to use Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to
   investigate the spatial dynamics of large carnivores {[}four lions (
   Panthera leo), three leopards (Panthera pardus) and three spotted
   hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta)] on a small, enclosed reserve (Selati Game
   Reserve). Regarding home ranges, lions had considerable overlap among
   themselves (especially the females), leopards had minimal overlap, while
   spotted hyaenas had no home range overlap. Although we found no evidence
   for spatial partitioning amongst the collared large carnivores,
   differences in the habitat use patterns of the three large carnivore
   species is evident. The high prey abundance of Selati, carnivore
   predation strategies, behavioural adaptations and ecological separation
   could be facilitating the coexistence of lions, spotted hyaenas and
   leopards in Selati. We encourage future research to be aimed at
   investigating the interactions ofmultiple sympatric carnivores in an
   attempt to bridge the knowledge gap on which mechanisms structure
   carnivore communities.},

Title = {Measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations as an
   indicator of stress in blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In South Africa, blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) are routinely
   captured for relocation purposes. To monitor the stress caused by this
   practise, a non-invasive method assessing adrenocortical function as a
   measure of stress would minimize disturbance during sample collection.
   In our study, an adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge, and a
   mass-capture event were used to examine the suitability of five enzyme
   immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring stress-related physiological
   responses using faeces as a sample matrix. The tested
   11-oxoaetiocholanolone I EIA performed best, showing a 2126\% increase
   above baseline after 22 h for a male, and a 474\% increase for a female
   23 h post-ACTH injection. Baseline faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   (fGCM) concentrations did not differ between animals captured on either
   day 1 or day 2 of the capture event, indicating that the frequent
   presence of a helicopter during the two days did not influence fGCM
   concentrations. However, during capture-related restraint for up to 10
   h, an overall 1.5-fold elevation in (fGCM) concentrations was found.
   Storage of faeces at ambient temperature post-defecation indicated a
   fair stability of fGCMs for up to 8 h. The ability to reliably assess
   adrenocortical function provides a solid basis to examine endocrine
   responses to putative stressful circumstances in blue wildebeest.},

Abstract = {Geographic gradients in plant productivity can present foraging large
   herbivores with varying resource levels across the range of a
   population, to which individuals can demonstrate varying intensity of
   selection. To investigate individually-specific responses of nyala
   antelopes (Tragelaphus angasii) to vegetation greenness, we monitored
   the landscape use of eight telemetry-collared adult females, half at the
   wetter end and half at the drier end of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South
   Africa. We used remotely-sensed greenness as an index for plant
   productivity and data on canopy structure, and we compared the strength
   of selection for greenness between animals having different greenness
   averages within their home ranges. We found a decreasing pattern between
   home-range average greenness and strength of selection, which depended
   on season and presence of tree canopies. Animals in low-greenness home
   ranges tended to have stronger positive selection in closed-canopy
   vegetation in the dry season; those in high-greenness home ranges tended
   to have the stronger negative selection in open-canopy vegetation in the
   wet season. Our study emphasizes the possibility that a spatial resource
   gradient on a landscape might provide a valuable model of temporal
   change in a resource and an indication of potential for foraging animals
   to adapt to those changes.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Rapid population growth of reintroduced lions ( Panthera leo) poses
   several ecological and management challenges in small (<1000 km(2)),
   fenced wildlife reserves. Changes in the natural social-ecological
   conditions of reintroduced lions can lead to a breakdown of natural
   predator-prey relationships and this is undesirable from both a
   biodiversity conservation and wildlife management perspective. Here, we
   present lion population vital rates across 16 small, fenced reserves in
   South Africa to test whether varying social ecological conditions,
   associated with lion population structures, can drive changes in vital
   rates. Study reserves were categorized (A-D) according to the number of
   resident prides and male coalitions. Lion population structure within a
   reserve affected lion vital rates differentially, and lion population
   growth was highest in reserves that contained a single resident pride.
   The presence of more than one pride in a reserve resulted in a younger
   age at first birth and marginally longer birth intervals. The presence
   of extra-pride adult males reduced cub survival, lioness age at first
   birth and birth intervals. These results can inform lion management
   decisions and, in particular, how lion population structure affects
   management outcomes. Our results also inform appropriate management
   protocols for lions depending on the specific social and ecological
   context of an individual reserve.},

Title = {Assessing the performance of oribi antelope populations at multiple
   scales: the limitations of citizen-led oribi conservation},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Effective monitoring programmes are critical to understand and mitigate
   declining wildlife populations. In South Africa, the majority of oribi
   antelope (Ourebia ourebi ourebi) occur on private rangelands as broadly
   distributed and highly-fragmented populations. Thus, to effectively
   manage such a species, conservation organizations rely on citizen
   science-led conservation initiatives, whereby members of the public
   provide data on oribi population demographics and potential threats.
   Using these data, we estimated the total oribi population size and
   assessed the population trend of oribi in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa,
   over a 14-year period (2001-2014). We found that the oribi population
   has declined by 30\% over the 14 years. However, oribi population
   estimates were highly correlated with the number of returned survey
   forms. This relationship makes it difficult to accurately assess
   population trends and almost impossible to determine if any changes in
   conservation management have influenced oribi populations. Thus, issues
   associated with citizen science and data quality (i.e. participation
   levels), may limit the ability of the oribi census to accurately inform
   oribi conservation and management. We discuss the value and limitations
   of citizen science in oribi conservation with the ultimate goal of
   improving citizen-led oribi conservation.},

Volume = {51},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts may be unintended consequences of conservation
   successes and rewilding, and could be exacerbated where baselines around
   biodiversity have shifted. Mediating conflict is a conservation priority
   both due to its socio-economic impacts and due to consequences that
   negative perceptions of wildlife have for conservation outcomes. We
   document locally novel emergent conflict following reintroductions of
   large carnivores to fenced reserves in the Eastern Cape Province, South
   Africa. Interviews with managers of 13 reserves (reintroduction sites)
   and adjacent properties show that reintroduced carnivores escaped from
   eight reserves (61.5\%) and were recorded on 25 neighbouring properties
   (36.7\%). Since large carnivore reintroductions to the Eastern Cape
   Province began in 1996, 75 associated conflict events were reported to
   the authors. This conflict was not evenly distributed, spatially or
   economically. Effective, evidence-based mitigation strategies are needed
   to ensure the continued success of conservation actions. Neighbours and
   policymakers should be primed for such lifted baselines where predator
   numbers and/or densities reflect what was historically observed. These
   conflicts should be anticipated and included in the early planning
   phases of reintroduction adaptive management processes. Conflict
   mitigation strategies for reintroductions should include lifting
   baselines to manage perceptions around recovering wildlife populations
   or face the prospects of re-extirpation associated with
   conflict-motivated retaliation.},

Title = {An online survey of community perceptions of mammalian mesocarnivores

Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Globally, anthropogenic land conversion has resulted in reduced natural
   land available for free-roaming wildlife, and a shift in species
   composition. Certain mesocarnivores exhibit an ability to adapt and
   expand distribution ranges under differing anthropogenic pressures. Our
   study addressed the socio-ecological attitudes and general perspectives
   towards mammalian mesocarnivores across a land-use gradient
   (rural-urban) from the uMgungundlovu to eThekwini municipalities of
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We determined threats, conflicts and
   attitudes towards mammalian mesocarnivores using an online questionnaire
   survey. The public held a range of opinions on mesocarnivores.
   Participants from both land-use types generally regarded mesocarnivores
   as non-threatening and vital for the environment. However, not all
   mesocarnivores were regarded with equal benevolence. Black-backed
   jackals, Canis mesomelas, were consistently singled out as a problematic
   species by rural inhabitants and this intensified reactions when a
   confrontation occurred. Smaller and more behaviourally flexible
   mesocarnivores (mongoose spp. and Cape genets, Genetta tigrina) were the
   most observed species in both land-use types, indicating potential
   population increases. Vehicle collision was the leading cause of

Abstract = {Across southern Africa, many populations of the highly-mobile common
   eland (Tragelaphus oryx) are limited to small, fenced protected areas.
   We studied such a population at Kgaswane Mountain Reserve (KMR), South
   Africa, using radio-collared animals to better understand eland range
   use in a landscape with restricted movement. Placement of home ranges
   within the reserve changed from favouring woodland to dry grassland
   after the beginning of the wet season, while wet grassland was favoured
   all year. Habitat use within home ranges indicated an interaction
   between vegetation types and elevation that changed with season:
   low-elevation selection for dry grassland, open shrubland and woodland
   changed to selection for wet and dry grassland; high-elevation selection
   for open shrubland alone changed to selection for both open shrubland
   and woodland. Despite the fenced nature of KMR, eland appeared to have
   sufficiently flexible behaviour to follow landscape use and seasonal
   home range changes demonstrated by eland in less restrictive
   environments. Management activities that promote fine-scale
   heterogeneity and varying levels of woody cover might compensate for
   lack of mobility where fences limit broad-scale movements.},

Title = {Exploring perceptions of subsistence farmers in northwestern Zimbabwe
   towards the African lion (Panthera leo) in the context of local
   conservation actions},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {We explored the perceptions held by subsistence farmers (living in
   communal lands within the CAMPFIRE programme area in northwestern
   Zimbabwe) towards the African lion (Panthera leo) and related
   conservation interventions undertaken by management authorities.
   Conceptually guided by the cognitive hierarchy, we used a
   semi-structured, face-to-face interview format to collect data across
   three different farming communities bordering Hwange and Zambezi
   National Parks. Ordinal regression models were used to analyse the data.
   Our results illustrate that farmers' perceptions towards lions were
   strongly negative and appeared to be associated with the geographic
   location in which the farmer lived, as well as the farmer's ethnic
   group. We also found that perceptions towards lions were not associated
   with specific livestock losses or to the potential benefits farmers
   received from wildlife conservation, e.g. school classroom blocks or
   road improvements. Instead, we suggest that fear of lions and perceived
   risk to livestock or human wellbeing may play a stronger role in shaping
   farmers' perceptions compared to actual livestock losses. Moreover, we
   suggest that sharing information across farmer social networks within a
   community area, along with the potential for media attention over
   sensational events, may also influence perceptions towards lions. Our
   results contribute a baseline dataset for future applied research in
   this area, and provide insight into developing locally-meaningful
   conservation interventions, including the type of information to be
   shared, channels for communication, and the benefits derived from
   participating in wildlife conservation.},

Abstract = {Left unchecked, macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) can exhibit
   irruptive population dynamics, rising rapidly to a peak, then crashing
   when overwhelmed by inadequate resources. This predictable population
   trajectory frequently leads to overabundance issues, particularly in
   peri-urban parks and nature reserves. Management decisions are usually
   guided by estimates of population density, which can be difficult to
   obtain, sometimes inaccurate and often inadequate because long-term data
   are needed to estimate population growth. Alternatively,
   density-dependent vital rates could be used to predict the growth
   trajectory of a population before management issues become evident. We
   applied a framework of sequential changes in vital rates to examine
   potential indicators of population growth trajectory. We sampled 16
   populations of Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) in
   south-eastern Australia. Using a range of methods, we measured one vital
   rate (female reproductive rate) and one surrogate rate (adult sex
   ratio). As population density increased before irruptive peaks, female
   reproductive rate (90\% breeding) was higher than during post-peak
   declines (66\% breeding). Similarly, sex ratios in increasing
   populations were at parity and then became more female-biased (65\%
   females) after peaks. These variables are readily measured in small
   parks and reserves, and therefore offer promising indicators of
   population growth trajectory, which can be used to forecast management
   issues and initiate timely management actions.},

Abstract = {Serrated Tussock (Nassella trichotoma) is a weed that invades native
   grasslands in southern Australia. It is frequently controlled using
   extensive and costly chemical control. We describe a tool aimed at
   grassland reserve managers that provides guidance about the suitability
   of different chemical control techniques, including knapsack, boom and
   aerial spraying. The tool takes the attributes of any site and predicts
   the suitability of each technique. The tool was built using random
   forests trained on a dataset of practitioner judgements. We discuss the
   applications and limitations of the tool.},

Title = {Managed livestock grazing for conservation outcomes in a Queensland
   fragmented landscape},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {5-9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Protecting native biodiversity is a difficult prospect in extremely
   modified landscapes, especially where high-impact exotic species are
   widespread. Using new data and a review of the literature, this paper
   comments on the use of livestock grazing to manage the invasive and
   highly combustible pasture grass species, Buffel Grass (Cenchrus
   ciliaris) and thereby help conserve fire-sensitive Brigalow (Acacia
   harpophylla) vegetation in reserves in Queensland, Australia. We cite
   evidence that shows that grazing is a potentially useful management tool
   in such cases and its use can be compatible with the protection of both
   fire-sensitive vegetation and other native plant species within the
   understorey. However, there are limitations in implementing grazing
   within conservation reserves including the lack of a clear understanding
   of the influence of grazing on biodiversity and resource condition.
   Importantly, we highlight secondary invasion by the exotic grass Indian
   Couch (Bothriochloa pertusa) as a key emerging threat that may undermine
   the biodiversity benefits gained by grazing in reserves. Grazing can be
   a useful tool for conservation management in particular scenarios, but
   the associated risks demand accompanying monitoring and reporting of
   positive and negative impacts to ensure the fundamental aim of
   biodiversity protection is being achieved.},

Abstract = {Large (>15 kg) carnivores, namely lions (Panthera leo), leopards
   (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dogs
   (Lycaon pictus), spotted (Crocuta crocuta) and brown hyaenas (Parahyaena
   brunnea), have been reintroduced to 16 private- and state-owned reserves
   in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Objectives behind these
   reintroductions ranged fromecotourism, ecological restoration, to
   species conservation. We reassessed the reintroductions' objectives and
   updated their outcomes a decade after the initial assessment. Ecotourism
   and ecological restoration were the most common objectives for the
   reintroduction of top predators to these reserves. With one exception,
   these reintroductions were successful in meeting their specific
   objectives, as only African wild dogs have failed to re-establish in the
   province. Assessments for leopards and brown hyaenas were inconclusive
   due to a lack of monitoring data. Causes of objective- and
   species-specific failures in some reserves included founding same-sex
   populations, lack of breeding events and changes in reserve management
   objectives. Long-term monitoring is essential in managing and assessing
   the success of conservation actions, including reintroductions of
   threatened species. Our review demonstrates this by highlighting changed
   outcomes for populations and identifying new challenges that have arisen
   in the landscape. In the modern parlance of conservation marketing, the
   multi-species reintroductions that occurred within the Eastern Cape
   represent successful rewilding within the province.},

Title = {African large carnivore population changes in response to a drought},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {African lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) play
   key roles in savanna ecosystems. Habitat change, overharvesting and
   retaliatory killing may threaten the persistence of some populations.
   Climate may cause further disturbance that accentuate negative effects.
   Droughts weaken the ability of prey to avoid predators resulting in
   larger carnivore populations. We thus expected populations of African
   lions and spotted hyaenas to increase during a drought in Kruger
   National Park (Kruger). Prey that is easier to hunt during droughts may
   also influence age and sex structures through impacts on survival and
   fecundity schedules. We tested these predictions by collating
   information from previous studies and conducting a field call-up survey
   in Kruger. A severe drought in Kruger during the summer of 2015/2016
   allowed pre- and post-drought comparisons. Before the drought, lion and
   spotted hyaena numbers increased in response to increasing prey biomass.
   During the drought, lions maintained their numbers, while spotted hyaena
   numbers increased further. There were substantially more subadult male
   lions after than before the drought. The abundant subadult males may
   induce higher incidences of human-carnivore conflict through more
   dispersing males in future. Our analyses highlighted immediate and lag
   effects of carnivores in response to droughts.},

Title = {The determinants of mesocarnivore activity patterns in highveld

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {178-192},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the diversity of mesocarnivores and the broad geographic ranges
   of these species, our understanding of their behaviour and ecology at
   multi-species and community levels is limited. Our study was conducted
   between April and mid-July 2015 and used data collected over 105 days
   from 39 camera traps to quantify activity patterns of sympatric
   mesocarnivores in riparian and grassland habitats of Telperion Nature
   Reserve, South Africa. A total of 13 mesocarnivore species were detected
   within this relatively small (similar to 7350 ha) reserve. Sufficient
   records (>= 10 records) were obtained for rusty-spotted genet (Genetta
   maculata), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), otter species (African
   clawless otter, Aonyx capensis, and spotted-necked otter, Hydrictis
   maculicollis), serval (Leptailurus serval), slender mongoose (Galerella
   sanguinea), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and marsh mongoose
   (Atilax paludinosus). Generalized linear models were used to investigate
   whether species ID, temperature, vegetation characteristics or moon
   phase best predicted temporal activity. To assess which species had the
   highest potential for competitive interaction, we also quantified the
   coefficient of activity overlap. Our results show that species ID and
   temperature were the best predictors of mesocarnivore activity. Slender
   and yellow mongooses displayed the highest coefficient of activity
   overlap (0.90), followed by marsh mongoose and rusty-spotted genet
   (0.80), and serval and rusty-spotted genet (0.79). These species are
   likely to have the highest potential for competitive interactions, but
   preferences for different vegetation characteristics and variations in
   the estimated relative abundance may point to coexistence through
   spatial and fine-scale temporal partitioning. The other species
   exhibited lower coefficients of activity overlap with each other,
   suggesting they may coexist through temporal partitioning of resources.},

   Black rhinoceroses ( Diceros bicornis) are cryptic and targeted by
   poachers for their horns. Several interventions aim to curb the effects
   of poaching and achieve black rhino conservation targets in the short to
   medium term. We used black rhinos to evaluate the survey requirements
   that will allow the detection of 1\% annual change in population size
   over a five-year period, a key short-term target for black rhinos in
   Kruger National Park, South Africa. We found that a mark-recapture
   technique provided the most precise estimates, but authorities need to
   mark 94\% of all black rhinos. This is logistically challenging and
   costly. Development of inclusive conservation plans need to consider
   realistic measures to report outcomes and achieve effective conservation

Abstract = {Global COVID-19 responses by governments restricted international
   travel, imposed national lockdowns, reduced economies, and influenced
   people's livelihoods. Travel restrictions and national lockdowns may
   constrain international illegal supply chains of high value wildlife
   products such as rhinoceros (rhino) horn. We evaluated whether the
   COVID-19 lockdown responses by South Africa induced a poaching pause on
   rhinos in Kruger National Park. We collated information on poaching
   incidences from 2017 and made predictions for expected incidences during
   2020 using trends noted between 2017 and 2019. Rangers observed
   substantially fewer incidences of poaching during South Africa's hard
   lockdown. As restrictions eased, poaching incidences increased. Despite
   the COVID-19 poaching pause, both black and white rhinos continued to
   decline in Kruger National Park as recruitment could not offset poaching
   and natural deaths.},

Abstract = {Dramatic population declines of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) led to
   a managed metapopulation approach for wild dog conservation in South
   Africa. Monitoring the survival and habitat use of packs reintroduced
   into protected areas (PAs) is an essential part of adaptive management
   and improving the health and, ultimately, the survival of the
   metapopulation. Our study describes the territoriality and habitat
   selection of a pack of wild dogs reintroduced into Manyoni Private Game
   Reserve (219 km(2)) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Despite
   being introduced into a small PA, the pack only utilized half their
   available space (121 km(2)) and avoided the central areas of the
   reserve. Post hoc analysis of African lion (Panthera leo) localities
   suggested competitive avoidance was a strong factor in shaping the
   habitat usage of the pack; however, further research is required.
   Habitat selection also varied seasonally and with denning. Ultimately,
   we showed that spatio-temporal analyses can help identify high-risk
   areas within wild dog territories, such as hotspots of activity along
   fencelines. These analyses can then be used to increase targeted
   management of these areas, such as improving the maintenance of
   well-used fencelines, which is an important consideration for the
   sustained success of the metapopulation across small PAs.},

Abstract = {The ecological functioning of an environment is influenced by how lions,
   Panthera leo, utilize their prey at various spatial and temporal scales.
   Aspects of the spatial and temporal variation in lion diet were
   investigated in the southwestern Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP)
   between May 2013 and June 2015 using evidence of prey remains identified
   through GPS cluster analysis (n = 278) and lion scat analysis (n = 189).
   Spatial variation in diet was investigated between three regional
   landscape types (north, south and west), based on the different
   vegetation types represented within each area, and two terrain types
   (riverbeds and dunes). Seasonal variations were assessed according to
   the hot-wet season (November to April), and cold-dry season (May to
   October). Lion diet profiles varied between landscape types and terrain
   type, but not seasonally. The most notable spatial differences in lion
   diet profiles were between the dune and riverbed terrains. Blue
   wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, contributed significantly to lion
   diet in the riverbeds (36\%), but not in the dunes (2\%). Gemsbok, Oryx
   gazella, was the primary contributor to lion intake biomass across all
   seasons, landscape types, as well as in the dune terrain (range
   55-82\%). Being largely independent of surface water and the most
   widespread and abundant of the large prey species, gemsbok are expected
   to remain the primary food source for lions and are likely to be a key
   driver of lion population dynamics in the KTP.},

Volume = {51},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Low-cost uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become ubiquitous, and
   advanced UAV systems are affordable for many field ecologists and
   wildlife managers. Many hobbyist UAVs have been applied to ecological
   studies, but proprietary software limits their widespread application
   with little quantification with regards to their accuracy and efficiency
   in the creation of maps through photogrammetry. Our study addressed
   these concerns by evaluating a combination of an entry-level UAV and
   open-source photogrammetry drone mapping software as a low-budget
   mapping solution for ecologists. Geometrically accurate orthophotograph
   maps were created from flights at altitudes below 70 m with and without
   differential global positioning system (d-GPS) ground control points.
   Object measurement errors were constrained below 30 mm for altitudes up
   to 70 m, and errors fell below 10 mm at 30 m altitudes with d-GPS points
   and below 20 mm without the use of d-GPS ground control points. Our
   analyses provide guidelines that parameterize the requirements for the
   mapping of smaller areas. Ecological surveys that do not require <50 mm
   accuracy can benefit from the methods described here, and many
   ecological studies that are presently using costly software and UAV
   platforms could save when adopting this approach.},

Abstract = {The retention of native woodland remnants in agricultural landscapes
   provides a range of benefits, many of which are linked to the
   ameliorative effects of trees on local microclimatic conditions. We
   monitored the reduction in wind speed and extreme temperatures that
   occurred in and around two native eucalypt woodland remnants in the
   Tasmanian Midlands and discuss the role of woodland remnants in
   providing both agricultural and environmental benefits. Monitoring wind
   speed, temperature and relative humidity every 30 min for over a year
   showed that an average wind speed reduction of 50\% occurred within the
   woodland remnants as well as higher minimum temperatures by up to 0.5 C.
   The structural characteristics of the woodland remnants mediated the
   effects observed, with a 50\% reduction in wind speed occurring when
   there was the equivalent of 20 large trees blocking the wind. This
   demonstrates that areas with low numbers of trees per hectare can have
   significant impacts on microclimatic conditions. The microclimatic
   changes observed will likely benefit agricultural productivity, farm
   aesthetics and ecological processes.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of kangaroo-vehicle collisions in Canberra,

Abstract = {Over the last 30 years, there has been a steady increase in the number
   of kangaroo-vehicle collisions in Canberra, in the Australian Capital
   Territory (ACT), especially of the Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus
   giganteus). Motor vehicle collisions with kangaroos are a threat to
   people and kangaroos, causing not only costly vehicle damage but also
   potentially leading to injury or loss of human life as well as animal
   welfare issues. Species, sex, moonlight, season and rainfall have
   previously been noted as potential influences on the number and
   frequency of kangaroo-vehicle collisions. In December 2015, a smartphone
   application using Collector for ESRI ArcGIS was implemented to enable
   ACT rangers to collect accurate information about each call-out or
   carcass attendance in real time. A total of 3346 kangaroo-vehicle
   collision points were collected by rangers over a 15-month period from
   March 2016 to June 2017. The data lend limited support to a
   concentration of kangaroo-vehicle collisions around the full moon,
   although 45\% of collisions were recorded when the moon was less than
   50\% illuminated. Although the highest roadkill numbers were recorded in
   winter (June-August), kangaroo-vehicle collisions were not directly
   correlated with season: there is a complex interaction with other
   variables. This study revealed that the relationship between the
   movement between patches of habitat and roads is dynamic and that
   further research is warranted into potential methods for reducing the
   number of kangaroo-vehicle collisions on Canberra roads, particularly in
   relation to speed limits, seasonality and kangaroo movements proximate
   to roads and areas of core habitat.},

Abstract = {Southern Africa has a diverse large carnivore guild. When this large
   carnivore guild is confined to fenced protected areas, the degree of
   intraguild competition may increase. Dietary overlap is a notable point
   of competition and can have considerable effects on lower trophic
   levels. We considered the prey preferences, dietary overlap, and dietary
   niche breadth of the large carnivore guild in Madikwe Game Reserve
   through direct observations and scat analysis, over one year of
   sampling. These data were analysed using the Jacobs' index for prey
   preference, the Pianka's index for dietary overlap and Levin's index for
   dietary niche breadth. Leopards (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx
   jubatus) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) had a high degree of
   dietary overlap and were specialized in their diet selection. Lions
   (Panthera leo), brown (Parahyaena brunnea) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta
   crocuta) also showed a high degree of dietary overlap and had broad
   diets. Our results show similarities to those of open systems,
   suggesting that large carnivore diet selection may not be negatively
   affected when they are confined by fences. We recommend further
   investigations into the variables which may affect site-specific
   carnivore diet selection.},

Abstract = {Understanding the environmental drivers that influence the spatial
   distribution of wildlife is paramount to the conservation of endangered
   carnivore species. However, presence data on most carnivore species (e.
   g. cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus) are not readily available to assist
   conservation efforts. In this study, we used MaxEnt to tease out the key
   determinants of the spatial distribution of cheetahs using presence-only
   data of cheetah against five environmental variables, i. e. distance to
   water (a proxy for prey density), elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness,
   and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI; a proxy for vegetation quality
   and condition). Our MaxEnt model was successful (AUC = 0.98) in
   predicting the potential distribution of cheetahs in Gonarezhou National
   Park. We observed that amongst the five environmental variables,
   elevation and distance to water contributed most (88\%) to the potential
   distribution of cheetahs. The contribution of SAVI, slope and terrain
   ruggedness (12\%) was negligible. We also estimated that the potential
   predicted habitat of cheetahs was 2572.9 km(2) (51.2\% of Gonarezhou
   National Park). In addition to providing baseline information, these
   findings are both novel and specific to Gonarezhou National Park, and
   provide important insights into cheetah conservation and management.},

Title = {A 20-year review of the status and distribution of African wild dogs

Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {8-19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {South Africa is one of only seven countries with a viable population of
   African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). The national population in 2017 was
   372 adults and yearlings and comprised three subpopulations: 1) Kruger
   National Park (Kruger), 2) an intensively managed metapopulation
   established through reintroductions into isolated, fenced reserves, and
   3) a free-roaming population that occurs naturally outside protected
   areas. We assessed the long-term (four wild dog generations, similar to
   20 years) trends in population size and growth rate within each of these
   three subpopulations. We found that Kruger supports a substantial
   population, which has declined over time. The metapopulation is the only
   subpopulation that has increased significantly over time (both in
   population size and number of packs), likely due to intensive
   conservation efforts and the reintroduction of wild dogs into 15
   additional reserves since 1998. The free-roaming subpopulation has
   remained small but stable, even though the number of packs has declined
   due to anthropogenic threats. The overall national population has
   remained stable even though the number of packs has increased. Kruger
   has consistently supported the highest proportion of the national
   population over the last two decades. However, the contribution of the
   metapopulation has increased significantly over time. It is clear that
   despite differences in survey effort among the three subpopulations,
   South Africa has a small (similar to 500) but stable population of wild
   dogs, with the metapopulation contribution becoming increasingly
   important. The circumstances in the country necessitate, and demonstrate
   the benefit of, intensive, adaptive management for the national
   population of wild dogs. While this assessment provides baseline
   information for the three subpopulations, wild dog conservation in South
   Africa would benefit greatly from equal survey effort and standardized
   methods to accurately assess long-term population trends.},

Title = {How many feral cats can be individually identified from camera trap
   images? Population monitoring, ecological utility and camera trap
   settings},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The feral cat (Felis catus) is a key threat for many Australian native
   critical weight range animals (i.e. species of intermediate body mass
   between 35 and 5,500 g that are particularly susceptible to introduced
   predators) and estimates of cat abundance are required for assessing
   changes in population size. Camera trapping is a much used tool for
   monitoring and estimating population sizes, including with mark-resight
   techniques, for which the more robust estimators require individual
   identification. Many feral cats are individually marked, which
   potentially makes them suitable for such monitoring programmes. We
   sought to determine what proportion of cat images captured during a
   commonly used field deployment of camera traps could be individually
   identified, and whether aspects of camera trap deployment affected the
   rate of individual identification. Camera trap arrays were established
   in four conservation areas in south-west New South Wales, Australia,
   during 2017 (range 39-50 camera traps per site). The unlured camera
   traps were continuously deployed over 26 months, with five or 10 images
   captured per trigger. Where possible, cats were individually identified
   based on phenotypic characteristics. Over the deployment period (95,413
   camera trap nights; CTN), we obtained 2.25 million images, of which
   13,845 contained feral cats. Feral cat events (i.e. a series of images
   taken <5 minutes apart on the same camera trap) ranged from 0.004 to
   0.047 events per CTN across the four conservation areas, with 85
   individual cats identified. Depending on camera settings, few images
   could be assigned to a known individual (12.2-27.4\% of feral cat events
   per site were of identifiable individuals). Minimum number known alive
   were 10-46 feral cats per site, with resultant quarterly densities
   ranging from 0.01 to 0.16 cats/km(2). With our current deployment,
   individual identification of feral cats was insufficient for estimating
   abundance or survival using individual mark-resight methods. Such
   deployment deficits limit the ecological conclusions that can be drawn
   from ours and similar studies.},

Abstract = {Contemporary Indigenous cultural fire management facilitates
   opportunities for Indigenous peoples to connect to and manage their
   Country, as well as providing scope for research. Right-way science is
   defined as collaborative process of bringing Indigenous and Western
   scientific knowledge and methods together to create ethical, productive
   and mutually beneficial research. Five key requirements of right-way
   science emerge from the literature, including: building relationships
   and trust; formal research approval processes; co-development of
   research; acknowledging challenges; and ethical, productive and mutually
   beneficial research. This article explores the question: how can
   right-way science enhance Indigenous cultural fire management? By
   reflecting on research collaborations between Western scientists and
   Indigenous ranger groups of New South Wales (Banbai) and the Northern
   Territory (Yugul Mangi), this paper, firstly, describes the methods we
   used to explore right-way science around cultural fire management.
   Secondly, it synthesises key findings of the research projects,
   including how we addressed the five key requirements of right-way
   science elicited from the literature. Thirdly, we provide insight on how
   right-way science can be applied more broadly to enhance Indigenous
   cultural fire management. We found that increasing opportunities for
   Indigenous peoples to care for their Country, supported by right-way
   science, places them in a unique position to contribute to solving some
   of the ongoing challenges and research questions associated with fire
   management. Western scientists have an important role to play, as
   supporters and followers of Indigenous research partners, and advocates
   of right-way science.},

Abstract = {The conservation significance of the Tasmanian Midlands, an agricultural
   region that is largely privately owned and has suffered significant land
   degradation and loss of biodiversity, has been recognised since the
   1980s. Four decades of conservation planning and implementation has seen
   the evolution of biodiversity protection, revegetation, bush
   rehabilitation and climate-ready habitat restoration. Relationships and
   trust have been built enabling the development of capacity in the
   farming community and conservation sector. This paper presents for the
   first time the chronology of four decades of landscape conservation
   planning and implementation in the Tasmanian Midlands. Remnant
   protection, restoration and revegetation efforts have evolved from the
   site level to landscape scale, leading to a conservation approach
   incorporating ecological restoration in its broadest sense. Successive
   iterations saw key initiatives including Midlands Bushweb,
   Midlandscapes, the Midlands Conservation Fund and the Tasmanian Island
   Ark project. Spatial tools and models have grown from simple maps and
   aerial photos to early GIS products including farm plans (revolutionary
   in their day) and asset maps, to increasingly complex spatial models of
   corridors using least-cost path analysis and fine-scale multi-species
   models of functional connectivity. However, critical to success in these
   challenging agricultural landscapes has been the relationships of trust
   and collaboration built between local farmers and conservation planners.},

Abstract = {To identify patterns in the temporal dynamics and spatial organization
   of kangaroo subpopulations that are commercially harvested, we fitted
   multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models to time series of
   kangaroo abundance from the main harvest zones of eastern Australia
   (1990-2019 for New South Wales and 1984-2019 for Queensland). We found
   that the responses of most populations to process variation, that is
   variation due to environmental or demographic stochasticity were
   correlated and that populations responded synchronously to environmental
   changes. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the covariates lagged
   rainfall, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and harvest rate on kangaroo
   abundance. We found that lagged rainfall had a positive influence, SOI
   and harvest rate had negative influences but the influence of covariates
   was not consistent across species or between subpopulations. In terms of
   population spatial structure, the analysis identified two subpopulations
   of Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) in New South Wales and four
   subpopulations of grey kangaroos (a combination of Eastern Grey Kangaroo
   (Macropus giganteus) and Western Grey Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus)),
   which appeared to be associated with a rainfall gradient from east-west.
   In Queensland, separate subpopulations were identified in each of the
   three main harvest management zones for both Red Kangaroo and Eastern
   Grey Kangaroo. The implications of these results for the management of
   commercially harvested kangaroos are discussed.},

Abstract = {Translocations to closed systems such as fenced reserves are commonly
   used for conservation of threatened fauna species worldwide; however,
   resources are limited in these areas, and natural processes that
   regulate populations in response to resource availability are unable to
   occur. This can result in overabundance followed by overuse of
   resources, potentially resulting in extreme declines or local
   extinctions. Resource exhaustion can negatively impact other fauna in
   the closed environment that exploit similar resources, through
   inter-specific competition. This paper discusses the reintroduction of
   Boodie (Bettongia lesueur) and Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) to a fenced
   reserve on the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area, Western Australia, and
   raises the concern of potential competition between the two threatened
   species.},

Abstract = {Effective biosecurity and pest management are fundamental to sustainable
   development. Invasive ants pose significant risks to the environment and
   economy, which are well-managed by biosecurity agencies in developed
   countries. However, a comprehensive view of the potential impacts of
   invasive ants in developing Pacific Island Countries and Territories
   (PICTs) is lacking. We quantified the potential costs of the Red
   Imported Fire Ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) across multiple sectors
   using an extrapolation analysis. Overall, we estimated that the impacts
   of Red Imported Fire Ant on developing PICTs could amount to over USD
   329 million annually, corresponding to approximately 0.7\% of combined
   GDP. Over half of the costs were predicted to result from impacts on the
   agriculture sector, a major source of employment and subsistence. We
   found that over 350 highly threatened species could be at risk from Red
   Imported Fire Ant. We would expect countries with Least Developed
   Country status and relatively low GDP to be least able to respond to an
   incursion of these ants, and as a result the costs could be higher than
   we have extrapolated. Red Imported Fire Ant could therefore potentially
   have considerable impact on the on-going development of the region.},

   as the Tasmania Island Ark project stems from their experience of living
   in the landscape, their observations of changes in that landscape and
   their thirst for knowledge to underpin management decisions. Being open
   to other opinions has led to interactions with `catalysts', usually
   researchers and extension officers, who have provided farmers with
   specific information on the natural values of their landscapes. These
   interactions-time- and context-specific-have resulted in a working
   lifetime of involvement in conservation and restoration activities
   shared between landowners, land-managers, researchers and the broader
   community. In this article, we present information shared in interviews
   with five farming families in the Northern Midlands of Tasmania that
   explored why and how they have continued to engage with conservation and
   restoration projects over several decades.},

Abstract = {Native herbivores can affect the structure and function of plant
   communities. Most studies of overabundant native herbivore effects on
   native plant communities in south-eastern Australia are observational or
   compare, at most, two levels of herbivory (ambient vs. none), and
   typically do not separate out the impacts of multiple herbivores.
   Several studies show that high densities of herbivores had mostly
   negative effects on plant regeneration and growth. These effects were
   usually attributed to palatability differences amongst plant species.
   Surprisingly, few studies have quantified vegetation responses across a
   gradient of herbivore density, and impacts on plant communities (i.e.
   species richness, composition, beta diversity) have not been well
   studied. Hence, there remains a need to better understand how native
   herbivores impact plant communities at different densities.},

Abstract = {Kangaroo populations have increased significantly across Australia's
   arid rangelands where the Dingo (Canis dingo) is excluded, with some of
   the highest concentrations in western New South Wales. Novel adaptive
   management tools are needed to conserve kangaroo (Macropus and
   Osphranter spp.) populations and avoid negative impacts to biodiversity,
   agricultural production and animal welfare associated with their
   overabundance. Kangaroo densities within the Wild Deserts ecosystem
   restoration project within Sturt National Park in western New South
   Wales exceeded 100/km(2) in mid-2016, during an 18-year regional
   population high. Following mass population declines attributed to
   emigration, an estimated 7,700 (+/- 2,100 SE) kangaroos died within the
   350-km(2) Wild Deserts site over an 8-month period during drought
   (December 2017-August 2018). Population trends recorded at Wild Deserts
   were similar to population declines recorded during annual aerial survey
   counts across western New South Wales over the same period. With New
   South Wales (NSW) National Parks and Wildlife Service, Wild Deserts
   developed a kangaroo management plan to avoid future catastrophic
   mortality from starvation and mitigate associated ecosystem impacts.
   Conservation management centred upon a 104-km(2) Adaptive Management
   Zone, fenced to trial adaptive management of sustainable kangaroo
   populations and restore habitats for the reintroduction of locally
   extinct mammals. Kangaroos were removed from two 20-km(2) exclosures,
   adjacent to the Adaptive Management Zone, to provide baselines against
   which kangaroo populations could be assessed under variable
   environmental conditions. To effect this management, we assessed the
   effectiveness of one-way weldmesh spear and flap gates to provide
   passive unidirectional movement through fences. Of 171 approaches by
   adult Red Kangaroos to spear gates, 57 resulted in successful exits,
   while none of 51 approaches resulted in return movements, supporting the
   utility of spear gates as a practical and effective tool for directional
   exits of kangaroos through fences.},

Abstract = {Exotic perennial grasses (EPGs) pose a significant risk to native
   communities globally. With over 2,200 species in Australia,
   understanding which characteristics enable high threat invasions, and
   comparing between functionally similar EPGs, can help prioritise species
   management. We developed a framework of risk and used the literature to
   rank 21 EPGs considered a threat to plant communities in New South
   Wales, while also evaluating the reliability of information currently
   available. Characteristics were scored within five broad categories that
   distinguish invasiveness: Arrival, Establishment, Persistence, Impact
   and Distribution. These included aspects of reproductive biology,
   competitive ability and environmental tolerance. The risk assessment was
   effective in assessing key characteristics of invasion. EPGs with an
   economic benefit (trade-off species) were more likely to have reliable
   research and frequently ranked as high-risk invaders in natural habitats
   due to the overlap of characteristics important in invasion with those
   considered important in agriculture. Lack of formal scientific research
   hindered assessment for some species, and some traits had been poorly
   assessed in the literature. High uncertainty was associated with key
   characteristics for Establishment, Persistence and Impact. Uncertainty
   in key characteristics revealed a need for improved integration of less
   formal research validated by more formal scientific research. This may
   lead to more informed decisions in the management of EPGs in native
   habitats and assist in early control of EPGs not yet assessed.},

Abstract = {Habitat restoration is an integral feature of wildlife conservation.
   However, funding and opportunities for habitat restoration are limited,
   and therefore, it is useful for targeted restoration to provide positive
   outcomes for non-target species. Here, we investigate the possibility of
   habitat creation and management benefitting two threatened wetland
   specialists: the Green and Golden Bell Frog (Litoria aurea) and the
   Large-footed Myotis (Myotis macropus). This study involved two
   components: (i) assessing co-occurrence patterns of these species in a
   wetland complex created for the Green and Golden Bell Frog (n = 9) using
   counts, and (ii) comparing foraging activity of Large-footed Myotis in
   wetlands with low and high aquatic vegetation (n = 6 and 7,
   respectively) using echolocation metres. Since Large-footed Myotis
   possesses a unique foraging behaviour of trawling for aquatic prey, we
   hypothesised that foraging activity of this species would be higher in
   wetlands with low aquatic vegetation coverage. Additionally, we provide
   observations of its potential prey items. We identified one created
   wetland where both species were found in relatively high numbers, and
   this wetland had a permanent hydrology, was free of the introduced fish
   Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) and had low aquatic vegetation coverage.
   We also found that Myotis feeding activity was significantly higher in
   low aquatic vegetation coverage wetlands (xx305; = 65.72 +/- 27.56 SE)
   compared to high (x305; = 0.33 +/- 0.33 SE, P = 0.0000). Although this
   is a preliminary study, it seems likely that Green and Golden Bell Frog
   and Large-footed Myotis would gain mutual benefit from wetlands that are
   constructed to be permanent, that are Gambusia free, low in aquatic
   vegetation coverage, and are located in close to suitable roosting
   habitat for Large-footed Myotis. We encourage adaptive aquatic
   vegetation removal for Green and Golden Bell frog as this may have
   benefits for Large-footed Myotis. The evidence suggests that the former
   may be a suitable umbrella species for the latter.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-9},

Abstract = {Ecological field researchers mostly work on other people's lands.
   Agreements to do this work are standard practice, but the way that
   researchers must approach and determine agreements is changing rapidly.
   The rise in agency of Indigenous peoples and the massive increase in
   Indigenous-owned and managed lands, coupled with the rise in other
   private- and corporate-owned conservation lands, have had direct impacts
   on researchers. Most of these impacts are beneficial to researchers, and
   benefit sharing has now become the norm wherein Indigenous people and
   private conservation landholders expect equitable beneficial returns
   from the research. Likewise, research questions are more frequently
   driven by landholders. New rules about engaging with Indigenous people
   and other private landholders need to be understood by researchers,
   because these rules can determine the outcomes of applications to work
   on other people's lands and the research conducted. This article
   presents some experience and observations from Indigenous landholders
   who have worked with research protocols and other people who have worked
   on Indigenous lands. Some learned principles that can benefit
   researchers are presented. Implications for managers Research protocols
   determine if and how research is to be conducted, how landholders are to
   be engaged and acknowledged and what and how research outcomes are to be
   published and reported Agreements must be reached between researchers
   and landholders before research is conducted Agreements are becoming
   more legally binding Joint authorship is becoming more common, and this
   may influence how the scientific methods and process are understood
   Cultural and social matters are core to research protocol negotiation in
   many instances and may require researchers to think differently from the
   ways in which they have been educated.},

   average, 61\% of plants per site (all species combined) survived and
   77\% of the species planted persisted after the first summer
   post-planting. Rates of survival varied considerably among plant
   species, with differences in outcomes evident across bioregions.
   Overall, the survival of plantings (all species combined) was greater at
   sites with higher mean annual rainfall and where plants were protected
   by guards. Widespread adoption of monitoring will assist project
   managers to better understand how plants survive and grow, and to
   adaptively manage revegetation programmes under a changing climate. A
   co-ordinated monitoring effort will require resources for on-ground
   monitoring, as well as an online database for data storage, collation,
   analysis and reporting.},

Abstract = {A promising approach in dealing with the detrimental effects of climate
   change on vegetation is to introduce pre-adapted genotypes into
   restoration programmes. Bush Heritage's Victorian reserves have
   experienced eucalypt dieback probably due to intense drought and heat
   shock linked to climate change. Planned revegetation on the Nardoo Hills
   reserve provided an opportunity to establish and test the potential for
   new climate-matched genotypes to expand the adaptive capacity of the
   plantings. As NRM practitioners, here we document our experiences in
   implementing this approach. Using the Climate Analogues tool and the
   Australasian Virtual Herbarium, we selected provenances from four
   climate analogue regions where remnants of our focal species, Grey Box
   (Eucalyptus microcarpa) and Yellow Box (E. melliodora), were located.
   Replicated plots were established covering five provenances for Grey Box
   and 5 provenances for Yellow Box with up to 10 `families' (mother trees)
   per provenance. Numerous challenges were encountered including locating
   suitable provenances, the design and scientific compromises associated
   with the experimental layout, sourcing of adequate seed from remote
   regions (especially drought affected) and high mortality during seedling
   establishment. Monitoring nine months after planting revealed not only
   high overall mortality (around 70\%, probably due to drought conditions
   during establishment) but also significant differences in height between
   provenances and in mortality and height among families in both species.
   Despite the initial mortality, the nested design and level of
   replication applied in these plots appear adequate to test hypotheses
   about the value of climate matching and will continue to be monitored in
   the future.},

Abstract = {Cross-cultural collaboration between Yawuru Country Managers (Rangers)
   and WWF-Australia ecologists led to new detections of the Spectacled
   Hare-wallaby (SHW), (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) in the west Kimberley
   region of Western Australia where it was presumed to be locally
   extirpated. This collaboration relied on the expertise of the Yawuru
   Country Managers to select specific locations for targeted field surveys
   and resulted in the confirmation of SHW on the Yawuru IPA for the first
   time in a decade. Subsequent remote camera trap surveys over a larger
   area included collaboration with two additional neighbouring Indigenous
   ranger groups, Karrajarri and Nyikina Mangala. These surveys
   investigated the spatial and temporal relationship between SHW and other
   mammals which may threaten (e.g., feral Cat {[}Felis catus], Dingo
   {[}Canis familiaris dingo]) or compete (e.g., Agile Wallaby {[}Macropus
   agilis]; Cattle {[}Bos taurus]) with them. We found a negative
   relationship between SHW and cat activity, suggesting that cats may
   limit the activity or abundance of SHW. Temporal portioning was evident
   between SHW and both Cattle and Agile Wallaby suggesting that SHW may
   avoid times when these species are most active. Further, we found a
   negative relationship between SHW occurrence and distance to fire scar
   edge burnt in current or previous fire season. This edge habitat is
   likely important to SHW because they may require recently burnt areas to
   forage and dense unburnt areas to shelter. This project highlights the
   benefits of cross-cultural research and monitoring partnerships with
   Indigenous rangers as active observers and managers of their traditional
   lands.},

Abstract = {Temperate woodlands are amongst the most threatened ecosystems in
   Australia because the land on which they occur is highly suited to
   agriculture. Two hundred years of habitat loss and fragmentation in the
   Midlands agricultural region in Tasmania have led to widespread declines
   in native vertebrates and landscapes with populations of predators
   including feral Cat (Felis catus) and the native-invasive Noisy Miner
   (Manorina melanocephala). Ecologists at the University of Tasmania
   co-designed mechanistic animal-centric research on mammals and birds in
   the Midlands to inform vegetation restoration carried out by Greening
   Australia that would support the recovery of wildlife species. We used
   species-appropriate technologies to assess the decisions made by
   individual animals to find food and shelter and to disperse across this
   fragmented landscape, and linked these, together with patterns of
   occupancy, across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We focussed on a
   native (Spotted-tailed Quoll, Dasyurus maculatus) and an invasive (feral
   Cat, Felis catus) carnivore, a woodland-specialist herbivore (Eastern
   Bettong, Bettongia gaimardi) and woodland birds including the
   native-invasive Noisy Miner. Our results, which show intense predatory
   and competitive pressure of cats and populations of Noisy Miner on
   native fauna, highlight how grounding restoration in the context of
   ecological interactions is essential to success in managing the impacts
   of invasive species in restored landscapes. Successful restoration will
   require innovative approaches in plantings and field experimentation
   with artificial refuges, to reduce habitat suitability for the Noisy
   Miner and cats and provide refuges for native mammals and birds to live
   in the landscape where cats also occur. Our results emphasise the
   significance of structural complexity of restoration plantings for
   supporting the recolonisation and persistence of native fauna. At large
   landscape-scale, we demonstrate the importance of retaining small
   habitat elements, including ancient paddock trees, pivot irrigation
   corners and small, degraded remnants, in facilitating occupancy and
   dispersal and, therefore, persistence of wild animals across this
   agricultural region.},

Abstract = {Indigenous people are the custodians of knowledge systems that hold
   detailed awareness of the environment, including applications for
   monitoring and management to improve biodiversity and cultural outcomes.
   Indigenous communities are increasingly participating in programs to
   monitor populations of wildlife. There is a need for frameworks to guide
   how Indigenous priorities, aspirations and culture can be respected
   within monitoring programs, as well as case studies that demonstrate how
   Indigenous knowledge and practice can provide opportunities together
   with Western science practice to improve the rigour and outcomes of
   wildlife monitoring. Here, we describe the process of developing a
   monitoring program that was tailored to be carried out by Kanyirninpa
   Jukurrpa Indigenous ranger teams to assess the status, trend and
   response to the management of a threatened and culturally significant
   species Mankarr (Greater Bilby; Macrotis lagotis). We applied a
   collaborative two-way approach, using iterative consultations,
   elicitations and field trials involving Indigenous and non-Indigenous
   project partners to define monitoring objectives, record biocultural
   knowledge and tailor a sampling methodology to fit the requirements of
   Martu Traditional Owners. Our project focused on creating a method that
   would be engaging, accessible and useful for rangers who would carry out
   the program, and prioritized collection of relevant data for community
   decision-making regarding management. We outline our key learnings for
   co-design of wildlife monitoring programs on Indigenous lands. Our
   approach provides insights that will assist in designing other
   cross-cultural or participatory monitoring programs.},

Title = {Fire, herbivores and the management of temperate Eucalyptus savanna in

Abstract = {The temperate Eucalyptus savannas in the Midlands of Tasmania are
   ancient ecosystems where fire and grazing are intrinsic ecological
   disturbances. The arrival of Aboriginal people into Tasmania some 40,000
   years ago altered natural fire regimes, and since the end of the last
   ice age, their skilful patch burning increased the grass cover and the
   abundance of large grazers in the Midlands savannas. This ancient
   socio-ecological tradition abruptly ended following European invasion in
   the early 19th century, which resulted in the rapid establishment of
   pastoralism, causing profound adverse changes to the ecological
   integrity of the temperate savannas. These changes include widespread
   tree clearing, extinction of native biota, establishment of domestic and
   feral mammalian herbivores, the introduction of exotic plants,
   broadscale application of chemical fertilisers and more recently
   irrigation. The Midlands retains a small fraction of the original
   vegetation, which typically occurs in small fragments on private land.
   These have been colonised by non-native plants and animals, and
   experience altered fire regimes. There is a growing awareness that to
   effectively manage temperate savanna fragments may require the
   intentional coupling of fire and herbivory. We describe the
   establishment of a field experiment designed to test four broad
   hypotheses: a) herbivore off-take increases after fire; b) smaller
   burned areas experience more intense herbivory than larger ones; c)
   non-native herbaceous plants are more tolerant of herbivory, whereas
   native herbaceous species are more tolerant of fire; and d) Eucalyptus
   seedlings are most likely to reach maturity in areas which are both
   burned and protected from herbivores. A novel aspect of the
   fire-herbivore experiment was that the Tasmanian Aboriginal community
   were engaged with and were contracted to conduct the burning. The
   findings of this landscape ecology experiment will inform the management
   of remnant temperate Eucalyptus savannas.},

Title = {Species composition, herbage mass and grass productivity influence
   pasture responses to kangaroo grazing in a temperate environment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Understanding the complexities of pasture responses (the overall
   seasonal gains or losses in herbage mass) under different environmental
   conditions is critical to the effective management of total grazing
   pressure, whether to achieve agricultural, cultural or biodiversity
   conservation outcomes. Whilst large-scale management programmes for
   kangaroos (Macropus spp. and Osphranter spp.) occur across much of
   south-eastern Australia, there is limited understanding of how such
   programmes influence the overall pasture response across different
   environmental contexts in the temperate environment. This study
   investigates the effects of potential grass productivity (measured as
   the growth of pasture protected from large herbivore grazing), initial
   herbage mass (measured as the attached, above-ground component of grass
   tussocks), kangaroo density (measured at the site scale) and season on
   the overall pasture response in plots dominated by six common grass
   types from south-eastern Australia. Using generalised additive mixed
   modelling, we demonstrate potential grass productivity (related to but
   not synonymous with grass palatability) to be the major predictor
   variable for pasture responses across all six grass types. Kangaroo
   density, either directly or via an interaction with initial herbage
   mass, was related to overall pasture responses for most grasses in
   spring and remained an important variable in favoured areas dominated by
   preferred Kangaroo Grass (Themeda triandra) and Redleg Grass
   (Bothriochloa macra) throughout the autumn survey period. Plots
   dominated by grazing-tolerant species, including wallaby grasses
   (Rytidosperma spp.) and Phalaris (Phalaris aquatica; an introduced
   pasture grass), showed marginally positive pasture responses under
   higher kangaroo densities, whilst plots with Wild Oats (Avena fatua; an
   introduced annual grass) and less preferred native spear grasses
   (Austrostipa spp.) showed no significant effect of kangaroo density on
   pasture response. Results support a context-specific mix of `bottom-up'
   (resource-driven) and `top-down' (consumer-driven) processes in
   temperate grassy ecosystems, highlighting the importance of considering
   landscape productivity, existing herbage mass and grass species
   composition when informing kangaroo management decisions.},

Title = {Climate change and the suitability of local and non-local species for
   ecosystem restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {75-91},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Restoring damaged, degraded and destroyed forest ecosystems to a target
   state often follows a local-is-best approach. However, rapidly changing
   climates may result in the local species no longer being the best now or
   into the future. This raises questions about whether there is a need to
   consider emerging ecosystems that bring together local and non-local
   species that have not historically co-occurred to ensure
   climate-resilience of restored forest ecosystems; or whether
   non-regional species may be needed to support ecosystem functionality in
   some areas. In this study, I present an experimental framework to assist
   decision-making by evaluating the suitability of local and non-local
   native species for ecosystem restoration under current and predicted
   climates. I applied this framework using the Tasmanian Midlands,
   Australia, as a case study, focusing of the diverse eucalypt flora of
   the island. Three key findings emerged. Firstly, the climate of the
   Midlandsz has rapidly changed across this biodiversity hotspot over the
   last century, and current mean annual maximum temperatures are already
   tracking worse case climate change scenarios. Secondly, using a
   combination of climate envelope modelling and habitat suitability
   modelling, I identified the degree to which the Midlands region provides
   suitable climate habitat for a range of local and non-local Eucalyptus
   species now and into the future. Thirdly, although the Midlands is
   predicted to support suitable climate habitat for 82\% of the regionally
   local eucalypt species now and into the future, it is predicted that the
   local populations of these least vulnerable species may be at risk of
   climate maladaptation, particularly in the northern regions of the
   Midlands. Models suggests that mixing local seed with non-local seed
   sources currently occupying habitat with a climate that is predicted for
   the Midlands will be required. The study provides a basis for managers
   to consider the suitability of regionally local species and identify
   potential areas where local seed may need to be supplemented with
   non-local seed for ecosystem restoration in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {The benefits of using remote sensing technologies for informing and
   monitoring ecological restoration of forests from the community to the
   individual are presented. At the community level, we link remotely
   sensed measures of structural complexity with animal behaviour. At the
   plot level, we monitor the return of vegetation structure and ecosystem
   services (e.g. carbon sequestration) using data-rich three-dimensional
   point clouds. At the individual-level, we use high-resolution images to
   accurately classify plants to species and provenance and show
   genetic-based variation in canopy structural traits. To facilitate the
   wider use of remote sensing in restoration, we discuss the challenges
   that remain to be resolved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes advances made to aerial surveys of macropods in New
   South Wales and Queensland. Regular aerial surveys of macropods across
   large areas of Australia's arid and semi-arid rangelands were
   established as a response to concerns for the species' conservation.
   They became integral to the harvest management of the four macropod
   species - Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), Western Grey
   Kangaroo (M. fuliginosus), Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) and Common
   Wallaroo (O. robustus). Harvest quotas are set as a proportion of
   population size, requiring absolute estimates of abundance. Counts were
   made in strip transects from fixed-wing aircraft, but required
   correction for animals that are missed. In New South Wales and
   Queensland, counts are now made using line transect sampling, providing
   survey-specific correction. Helicopters are used in more rugged and
   timbered areas and where Common Wallaroo can be more frequently found
   and harvested. Mark-recapture distance sampling is used in more open
   country that can be surveyed using fixed-wing aircraft and improves the
   accuracy of density estimates by accounting for animals missed on the
   transect line. Macropod populations are likely to be surveyed in the
   future by airborne imagery and by drones, but the technology needs
   further development. Spatial models could usefully provide small-scale
   density estimates and address non-random sampling.},

Title = {Options and rationale for regional property-based kangaroo production},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {176-185},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The larger kangaroos (Macropus giganteus, M. fuliginosus and Osphranter
   rufus) are widely distributed and have a national population which
   fluctuates in response to changes in grass growth and trends to 40
   million. Most are outside parks and reserves and, on pastoral
   properties, particularly on the rangelands of southern Australia. High
   numbers compromise regenerative agriculture, pasture conservation,
   revegetation and stewardship programmes, and can have significant
   financial impacts on landholders by lowering livestock production and
   damaging sustainability. Some smaller macropods, wallabies and
   pademelons, also have a similar effect, especially in Tasmania and on
   other smaller Australian Islands where foxes are absent. Paradoxically,
   kangaroos have a wide range of potentially valuable production
   attributes and are unique, which should be a global comparative
   advantage. The kangaroo industry is established with a small domestic
   and international market, although demand has been falling in recent
   years. Non-commercial culling is rising, which results in millions of
   carcasses being wasted and left to decompose in the field. Indigenous
   communities abhor such waste and its cultural implications. A stronger
   kangaroo industry would be a better solution to managing overabundant
   kangaroos than pest culling and exclusion fences. Because kangaroos move
   from property to property, populations need to be managed on a regional
   basis through `regional property-based kangaroo production'. A form of
   proprietorship over this mobile resource would encourage landholders to
   play a role in creating greater demand for kangaroo products. They would
   have an incentive to raise the value of kangaroos. Through innovative
   harvesting, they could deliver high-quality, environmentally branded,
   accurately described, gourmet, differentiated products integrated with
   other livestock industries. They could establish cooperatives and embark
   on promoting regional kangaroo products. Policy improvements are needed
   to achieve these production systems. Doing so would diversify their
   enterprises, convert a liability already on their properties into an
   asset, create employment, enhance rural economic resilience, and improve
   animal welfare and conservation outcomes while earning them carbon
   credits. These opportunities become even more profound as climate change
   progresses.},

Title = {Biosecurity risks related to recycling of mollusc shell waste for
   shellfish reef restoration in Australia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A risk analysis was undertaken to assess the biosecurity risks involved
   with recycling mollusc shell waste for restoration of shellfish reefs in
   Australia. The hazard identification stage identified 20 diseases and 14
   groups of marine pests upon which detailed risk assessment was
   undertaken. The qualitative risk assessment process involved release,
   exposure and consequence assessment, to arrive at an unmitigated risk
   estimation as well as risk estimates for several shell treatments,
   including 3, 4 or 6 months desiccation in sunlight, exposure to hot
   water at 55 degrees C for 10 min or 80 degrees C for 5 min, bathing in
   freshwater for > 24 h or in vinegar (4\% acetic acid) for 30 min. The
   effectiveness of these treatments as risk management options were then
   compared to inform development of protocols for biosecure treatment of
   mollusc shells. The appropriate level of protection (ALOP) was expressed
   in qualitative terms as `very low', representing an annual probability
   between 1 in 20 and 1 in 100 years. The outcomes from the risk analysis
   indicated that heating recycled mollusc shells in water at 80 degrees C
   for > 5 min would meet the ALOP for all pests and diseases of concern.
   This method has limited throughput, however, and thus may be useful only
   for pilot scale restoration projects. Desiccation of mollusc shells in
   sunlight for 4 months at > 20 degrees C was also within the ALOP for all
   hazards examined. However, if ambient weather conditions at the
   recycling facility prevent the shell pile drying out or exceeding 20
   degrees C for several months of the year, extending the desiccation
   period to 6 months with at least one shell turnover is recommended to
   provide sufficient safety margin to ensure the ALOP is met. Desiccation
   of mollusc shells can be undertaken at vast scales at minimal cost, and
   thus appears suitable for shellfish restoration at environmentally
   meaningful scales.},

   management. Nevertheless, there are hardly any data on deadwood volume

   Range. The objective was to determine the amount, variability and
   quality of deadwood and to compare it with data from managed as well as
   natural forests. Data were collected on 30 randomly distributed circular
   plots of 0.1 ha. The results showed that the average deadwood amount
   (13.46 m(3) ha(-1)) was much lower compared to that recorded in other
   European forests and they highlighted the absence of large dead standing
   trees due to the management regime. The deadwood quality showed great
   variation in stages of decay.},

Abstract = {Ornamental plantations in cities and particularly botanical gardens and
   arboreta are rich sources of alien flora. Mlynany Arboretum, established
   in 1892, cultivates 1049 non-native woody plant species on the area of
   67 ha. In this work we answered following questions: 1. How many taxa
   are spontaneously spreading in the arboretum and how is the spreading
   intensity related to their ecological demands and reproduction traits?
   2. How many taxa appear behind the fence? 3. How far from the arboretum
   they can get? 4. Do private gardens and historical aristocratic park in
   the studied village cluster contribute to species escapes from culture?
   5. Which from the widely spread taxa can represent future risk of
   invasiveness on the national level? We found that about one tenth of
   taxa spread across the arboretum (particularly Cotoneaster spp., Prunus
   laurocerasus, P. serotina and Quercus rubra) and number of their
   seedlings corresponded only with the mother plant number. Almost one
   third of these species left the arboretum and their seedlings were
   observed in distance up to 500 m from the village (mainly Mahonia
   aquifolium, P. serotina). Private gardens were a large source of Juglans
   regia seedlings, frequency of which decreased with the distance from
   villages (no species escaped from the historical park). Weed risk
   assessment revealed potential invasion danger only for Amorpha
   fruticosa.},

Abstract = {Indigenous Australians are Australia's first ecologists and stewards of
   land, sea and freshwater Country. Indigenous biocultural knowledge, as
   coded in story, song, art, dance and other cultural practices, has
   accumulated and been refined through thousands of generations of
   Indigenous tribal groups who have distinct cultural responsibilities for
   their ancestral estates. European colonisation of Australia had and is
   still having severe impacts on Indigenous cultural practice, knowledge,
   people and Country. In contemporary ecology and environmental
   management, re-recognition of the unique values of Indigenous
   biocultural knowledge and practice is occurring and increasingly being
   deployed alongside Western approaches in what has been described as
   cross-cultural, two-way or right-way work. This article describes the
   development of cross-cultural ecology and environmental approaches in
   Australia. We then provide an overview of 10 years of conference
   presentations associated with the annual Indigenous Ecological Knowledge
   symposiums of the Ecological Society of Australia (ESA). From 2010 to
   2020, 173 people participated in the symposia from around Australia and
   Aotearoa (New Zealand), of which 62\% were Indigenous Australians and
   3\% Maori. Most participants were from Indigenous Ranger groups followed
   by University staff, with a roughly even split of men and women. A total
   of 100 presentations were given and a word frequency analysis of the
   presentation titles revealed the dominant words (themes) were:
   Indigenous, management, Country, fire, working, knowledge and cultural.
   The increasing Indigenous participation in the ESA conferences was
   coincident with increasing Indigenous-led projects across Australia,
   although we recognise that much more work needs to be done to increase
   Indigenous participation and control in Australian ecology and
   environmental management to move from cross-cultural to Indigenous-led
   approaches.},

   to conserve an endangered rainforest ecosystem in the Kimberley region,

Abstract = {Australia's diverse plants and animals evolved for tens of thousands of
   years with Aboriginal biocultural knowledge, land management and
   cultural practice. The interdependency of this biocultural knowledge and
   land management practice is still ecologically relevant today but is
   only recently being acknowledged in mainstream scientific conservation
   management processes and research. We present an example of
   cross-cultural collaborative management of the endangered monsoon vine
   thickets of the Dampier Peninsula, West Kimberley, northern Australia.
   These vine thickets occur as a network of over 80 patches in the lee of
   coastal dunes on the Peninsula, and are ecologically rich (containing
   25\% of Peninsula plant species) and culturally important for Peninsula
   Aboriginal groups for food, medicine, camping, cultural ceremonies and
   law. Adversely affected by land-clearing, weeds and wildfires, the vine
   thickets were listed as nationally endangered in 2013. The overlapping
   significance of the vine thickets by scientific and Aboriginal knowledge
   systems resulted in the formation of the Monsoon Vine Thicket Project in
   2008 that aimed to document and conserve the ecosystem and its
   associated culture. The project has grown successfully over 13 years and
   has been guided by cross-cultural collaboration principles of respect
   for: cultural knowledge, practices and priorities; cultural knowledge
   holders; and long-term partnerships. The project has resulted in
   considerable outcomes in weed and fire management; seed collection,
   propagation and revegetation; community education; and the
   documentation, transfer and practice of Aboriginal biocultural
   knowledge. The greatest challenge for the project has been to better
   prioritise cultural activities, with examples provided of how this can
   increase benefits to both ecological conservation and cultural
   maintenance. The project's strength was its cross-cultural approach and
   resultant respectful and trusting relationships that allowed for project
   flexibility and adaptation and for the collaborative partners to learn
   and develop capacity. The integration of cultural and scientific
   knowledge and practice resulted in greater conservation outcomes for
   monsoon vine thickets of the Dampier Peninsula, and we believe is an
   important cross-cultural model for ecosystem management elsewhere in
   Australia.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing search for cost-effective, practical and successful
   methods for landscape-scale restoration required to meet the challenges
   posed by the United Nations Decade on Restoration 2021-2013. Mechanised
   cultivation techniques (rip mounding and Wilco spot cultivation), a
   range of revegetation strategies (dense reafforestation, riparian
   corridors, vegetation islets and scattered tree plantings) and best
   horticultural practice were employed to successfully establish extensive
   areas of local native trees and shrubs in highly altered agricultural
   landscapes within the Midlands of Tasmania, Australia. This region has
   been intensely farmed for the last 200 years and is characterised by
   past failures in native tree plantings. Between 2009 and 2018, 1800 ha
   were revegetated with a suite of hardy local native species to enhance,
   buffer and connect native vegetation remnants. These techniques were
   applied at a landscape scale to create biodiversity corridors that
   crossed the Midlands. Riparian corridors 100-200 m wide were created
   along 21 km of riverbank at an average density of 440 stems/ha. Fenced
   vegetation islets and individually caged scattered trees were
   established within and surrounding native vegetation remnants, at an
   average density of 143 stems/ha. Whole paddocks were densely
   reafforested at up to 800 stems/ha. Despite this, re-establishing
   structurally complex and species diverse native vegetation, which can
   provide habitat for local native animals, proved challenging. In areas
   highly altered by a long history of farming, repeated interventions and
   long-term relationships with landholders will be needed to achieve
   restoration objectives.},

Abstract = {This article examines the financial and governance dimensions of the
   Tasmanian Island Ark project, in the Tasmanian Midlands. It focuses on
   the intervention costs, funding sources and the legal context to
   financing, including property tenure, negotiated agreements and
   regulatory requirements. The case study shows that it is not easy to
   extrapolate financial data from one restoration project to another;
   however, the types of costs, their relative significance and timing, and
   legal context can be relevant considerations across diverse projects.
   The Tasmanian case study helps fill a gap in the literature about the
   financial side of ecological restoration projects and how planners can
   prepare for large landscape-scale interventions. The paper discusses the
   overarching constraints on environmental restoration practices and then
   presents the specific costs of restoration activities.},

Abstract = {The intentional movement of species outside their indigenous range -

   outline the process developed to identify and assess candidate sites for
   assisted colonisation of the critically endangered Northern Corroboree
   Frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi), a range-restricted species highly
   threatened by chytrid fungus. We first investigated the mechanisms
   associated with the persistence of Northern Corroboree Frog populations
   with chytrid fungus and then used a combination of desktop and field
   surveys to identify and assess sites based on habitat suitability,
   capacity to allow coexistence with chytrid fungus and hydrological
   properties. Candidate sites were further assessed by comparing
   environmental and climatic conditions to historical and persisting
   sites. Together, these methods allowed us to identify a site that
   appears to be highly suitable for the species. The process outlined here
   provides a template for assessing assisted colonisation sites for
   species where ongoing threats rule out recipient sites within their
   indigenous range.},

Abstract = {Increasingly scientists and policy makers are acknowledging the
   importance of Indigenous participation in effective biodiversity
   conservation. In Australia, the recognised Indigenous estate is vast,
   accounting for up to 57\% of the continent and comprising some of the
   highest priority conservation lands, including 46\% of the formal
   National Reserve System. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity
   Conservation Act 1999 (the Act) is Commonwealth legislation designed to
   protect and manage nationally and internationally important species and
   ecological communities, which entails specific objectives to recognise
   Indigenous people. However, to date the involvement of Indigenous people
   in implementation of the Act has been inconsistent and inadequate,
   particularly in the protection of the Indigenous estate, understanding
   and supporting Indigenous people's aspirations for Country and
   culturally significant species, and respecting the traditional
   management of species and landscapes. In this article, we will explore
   the key barriers and opportunities for improving Indigenous
   participation in biodiversity conservation under the Act. We structure
   our exploration using the three connected themes: (1) meaningful
   Indigenous engagement and participation, (2) recognition of the
   Indigenous Estate and (3) strengthening Indigenous-led governance. We
   find that there is a pressing need and an immediate opportunity to
   reform and strengthen the Act to protect Indigenous Knowledge, to
   recognise and report on the role of Indigenous Estate, and to realise
   the aspirations of Indigenous peoples for improved land and sea
   management that strengthens people, culture and Country.},

Title = {Recruitment and demographic structure of floodplain tree species in the

Abstract = {Globally, floodplain and riparian forests are rapidly declining
   ecosystems due to anthropogenic influences coupled with a changing
   climate. In the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, little is known about
   the demographic structural status and recruitment of floodplain and
   riparian tree species. The aim of this study is to provide a baseline
   assessment of the current demographic structure of the
   ecosystem-defining tree species: River Red Gum (Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis), Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah), Black Box (Eucalyptus
   largiflorens) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) within the basin in
   Queensland. Tree size data were collected from 131 plots of 0.25 ha
   located along major waterways and the abundance of individuals at the
   seedling, young tree, mature and senescent life cycle stages was
   determined. The diameter size distribution for the four species
   approximated a negative exponential distribution (reverse J-curve). Low
   tree abundance in the < 10-cm diameter class in all the species relative
   to the reverse J-curve suggested low recruitment and possible early
   evidence of a decline in the sustainability of the populations according
   to the Law of de Liocourt. This low abundance of young trees was more
   pronounced in Black Box and extended to the < 20-cm diameter class, but
   this species was not well replicated, and more data are required. In
   addition, the low abundance of recruitment trees occurred concurrently
   with the observed below average rainfall and erratic rainfall
   distribution in the last two decades relative to long-term totals. These
   results suggest a need for management interventions to foster seedling
   recruitment such as grazing management and tree planting programmes to
   ensure species establishment and survival along basin waterways.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Herbivory can threaten the persistence of palatable plant species and
   the fauna communities dependent upon diverse and structurally complex
   post-fire regeneration. This study compared the introduction success of
   the nationally Endangered Chalky Wattle (Acacia cretacea) in the South
   Australian mallee under different fire and browsing treatments.
   Recruitment from both seed and seedlings was enhanced by fire and was
   absolutely conditional on protection from herbivory, even though
   domestic stock were excluded and numbers of kangaroos, goats and rabbits
   were lower than regional averages. Several other fire-responsive plant
   species, including the ecologically important Porcupine Grass or
   spinifex (Triodia irritans), which provides habitat for threatened
   fauna, also benefited from herbivore exclusion. Conservation of wild
   populations of Chalky Wattle and other palatable fire-responsive plants,
   and the ecosystem processes they enable, is likely to be conditional on
   significant and sustained reduction in herbivore populations, especially
   kangaroos, following wildfires or control burns in the mallee.},

Title = {Native fish losses due to water extraction in Australian rivers:
   Evidence, impacts and a solution in modern fish- and farm-friendly
   screens},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},

Abstract = {The diversion of water from rivers removes millions of fish from
   Australian waterways each year. Modern diversion screens are available
   that can reduce fish losses by 90\% and stop debris entering irrigation
   systems. Uptake of this technology in the United States has protected
   fish and infrastructure. However, application in Australia has been poor
   and both the problem and its solution continue to be overlooked. To
   address this, we summarise multiple lines of evidence of fish losses in
   Australia and propose a way forward. Large losses of fish at diversions
   have been reported for close to a century, providing compelling evidence
   of population-scale impacts on native fish. We discuss the solution,
   outlining the progress being made to bring modern screening technology
   to Australia, including a social learning framework to improve how water
   is diverted and focussing on collaboration between the fisheries,
   agriculture and engineering sectors, and underpinned by science. We
   conclude that uptake of modern screens will rely on dialogue moving past
   whether a problem or solution exists, to the following: how screening
   can be better integrated with water and environmental management; where
   investment should be prioritised; and how screening could be funded. If
   Australia gets this right, substantial benefits can be realised, saving
   millions of native fish every year, bolstering native fish recovery
   programmes, reducing ongoing costs for water users and enhancing the
   economic and social value in regional areas by boosting manufacturing,
   service industries, tourism and recreational fisheries.},

Title = {Low-intensity kangaroo grazing has largely benign effects on soil health},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {58-63},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Kangaroos (Macropus spp., Osphranter sp.) are the most ubiquitous
   free-ranging herbivores in Australia. Much has been written on their
   impacts on plant community composition and how they interact with
   livestock, particularly in extensive rangelands. Little is known,
   however, about how kangaroos affect soil function and their relationship
   with healthy soils, nor the impact of peri-urban populations of
   kangaroos where they might come into conflict with humans. To address
   this, we used exclosures to examine the impacts of low densities of
   kangaroos on the morphology of the soil surface in a peri-urban
   environment on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We found that
   kangaroo grazing was associated with reduced herbaceous biomass and
   cover, and biocrust cover, and surfaces were generally more stable, had
   a greater cover and incorporation of litter and had greater plant
   species richness. There were no differences in indices of nutrient
   cycling nor stability. Overall, our study supports the notion that
   kangaroo grazing, at the current low densities experienced in this
   peri-urban reserve, has had no significant deleterious effect on soil
   surface health, as measured by the morphology of the surface. We
   conclude that grazing at the current low levels (similar to 70 km(-2))
   is unlikely to have major long-term negative effects on soil surface
   condition.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Management of feral animals can be complicated by conflicting economic,
   social, cultural and political values of stakeholders. To visually
   demonstrate the ecological impacts of feral ungulates, natural resource
   managers often construct exclusion fences; however, lessons are not
   often widely shared in the scientific literature and Indigenous insights
   are rarely recorded. Here, we report on long-term (7-11 years) feral
   buffalo and pig exclusion fences that were constructed by the Yirralka
   Rangers in ephemeral coastal wetlands of the Laynhapuy Indigenous
   Protected Area, northern Australia. Elevation transects across fence
   boundaries suggested that feral ungulates may be eroding floodplains and
   therefore reducing elevation. Comparisons of intermittent photos and
   contemporary inside-outside fence floristic assessments suggested that
   feral ungulates have an obvious and significant effect on vegetation
   cover and composition which may also inhibit natural soil accretion.
   Interviews with senior Indigenous knowledge holders revealed that feral
   ungulate culling was broadly supported due to impacts on cultural and
   spiritual values. Synthesis of the results suggested that feral
   ungulates are having substantial impacts on the cultural use, flora and
   soil stabilisation of coastal wetlands. Further research on soil erosion
   and accretion in places with and without ungulates will elucidate the
   effects of ungulates on potential sea-level rise resilience of coastal
   wetlands. This paper highlights the benefits of cross-cultural and
   collaborative multi-disciplinary research such as producing holistic
   outcomes relevant to stakeholders that can inform management decisions.},

   complex using `traditional morphometrics', demonstrating that the
   species is represented in Algeria by both Q. faginea and Q. canariensis
   Wild. Significant variations of the leaf form were also discernible
   among both species. In this study, the landmark-based geometric
   morphometrics analysis was used to assess the shape variation of the
   leaves found on oak stands. 2,600 leaves per 13 stands were collected
   and scanned, and then using Tps range and MorphoJ software, 11
   landmarks-that represent the leaf morphological features-were recorded
   on leaf images. Shape components and non-forms variations were obtained
   through a full Procrustes fit followed by creating a leaf-superimposed
   configuration. Principal component analysis, canonical variate analysis,
   and discriminate analysis were used to statistically evaluate the leaf
   shape variability. The results revealed no clear distinction between the
   two species based on leaf shape. Climate change and environmental
   factors also appear to have possibly caused a divergent morphological
   evolution; a reduced leaf size with enduring indumentum-among other Q.
   faginea traits-could be an efficient mean of adapting to Mediterranean
   xeric conditions.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the current state and productivity of
   black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) stands and determine the
   optimal conditions for the emergence and further growth of its natural
   regeneration in Ukrainian Polissya. The area of black alder stands in
   Ukrainian Polissya (Ukrainian forest mire) is 162,348 ha, reaching 8.4\%
   of the total forest area. Volyn Region has the largest area of alder
   stands within Ukrainian Polissya (61,271 ha covering 37.7\% of the total
   area). In the forests of this region, a more detailed study of the
   current condition, productivity, growth and regeneration of alder stands
   was performed. The natural regeneration under the alder canopy was
   characterized as poor. The largest numbers of alder seedlings
   (1,600-1,800 stems per ha) were recorded under the canopy of
   76-78-year-old stands with a relative density of stocking of 0.63-0.70
   and 80-100\% of alder in their composition. Naturally regenerating alder
   seedlings had mainly group distribution on the area (occurrence is up to
   40\%). These specificities should be taken into account to promote
   natural seed regeneration of alder stands.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates leaf morphology variation of the strawberry tree
   (Arbutus unedo) within and between two natural contrasting populations
   of significant latitudinal difference (Kassandreia, Chalkidiki and

   shape parameters, recorded by image processing and analyzing software.
   The results showed that in the measurements of central tendency
   (parameter means) the northern population of Kassandreia presented the
   highest values, while in contrast the highest values in the measurements
   of spread were found in the southern population of Ancient Olympia.
   Moreover, statistically significant differences between populations were
   detected in leaf size, but not in leaf shape parameters. Results are
   discussed in the context of their value in studying quantitative
   population differentiation and laying the basis of more advanced

Abstract = {A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the problems caused by
   invasive alien species (IAS) in Hungarian protected areas (PAs). Results
   from 144 PAs were evaluated and compared with a previous study of 21
   European countries. In the European survey, the most important threats
   were habitat loss and fragmentation, Hungarian respondents put IAS in
   first place. Eradication, control and prevention were mentioned among
   the best strategies against invasive species in both surveys, but
   Hungarian PA managers emphasized the efficiency of habitat restoration
   and regulatory as well. Comparing the harmful animals and plants
   occurring in most Hungarian and European PAs, we found nearly 30\%
   similarity. In most Hungarian PAs domestic cat (Felis catus Linnaeus,
   1758) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) were indicated as most
   harmful species. The results of our study draw the attention to the
   species, which are highly invasive in Hungary, but are missing from the
   European PAs list, therefore may pose a potential threat to other
   protected areas of Europe.},

Abstract = {A recent review of the management of hyperabundant macropods in
   Australia proposed that expanded professional shooting is likely to lead
   to better biodiversity and animal welfare outcomes. While the tenets of
   this general argument are sound, it overlooks one important issue for
   biodiversity and animal health and welfare: reliance on toxic lead-based
   ammunition. Lead poisoning poses a major threat to Australia's wildlife
   scavengers. Current proposals to expand professional macropod shooting
   would see tonnes of an extremely toxic and persistent heavy metal
   continue to be introduced into Australian environments. This contrasts
   with trends in many other countries, where lead ammunition is, through
   legislation or voluntary programs, being phased out. Fortunately, there
   are alternatives to lead ammunition that could be investigated and
   adopted for improved macropod management. A transition to lead-free
   ammunition would allow the broad environmental and animal welfare goals
   desired from macropod management to be pursued without secondarily and
   unintentionally poisoning scavengers. Through this article, we hope to
   increase awareness of this issue and encourage discussion of this
   potential change.},

Abstract = {Collaborations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous scientific
   researchers are increasingly mandated by global to local conservation
   policy and research ethics guidelines. Breakdowns occur due to
   misunderstandings around expected protocols of engagement and
   cooperation, which are compounded by lack of broader awareness of
   differences in cultural values, priorities and knowledge systems. Using
   first-hand experiences, we outline eight key protocols and guidelines
   that researchers should consider when undertaking research with
   Indigenous peoples, or on Indigenous Country, through exploration of
   biocultural protocols and guidelines within Australian and Indigenous
   customary laws. We use the onion as a metaphor to highlight the layers
   of protocols and guidelines that researchers can peel back to guide
   their research from international to local scales, with ethics around
   the research question at the core. This paper draws on the perspectives
   and experiences of an Indigenous researcher (as `insider'/'outsider')
   and non-Indigenous researcher ('outsider'), working on a cross-cultural
   and multidisciplinary investigation of past Aboriginal dispersal of
   rainforest trees on the Australian east coast. This paper is part of the
   special issue `Indigenous and cross-cultural ecology - perspectives from
   Australia' published in Ecological Management \& Restoration.},

Title = {Recreational fishers contribute to path formation in subalpine

Abstract = {The role of recreational fishers forming paths (routes of concentrated
   passage characterised by short vegetation or ground indentation) as they
   gain access to wilderness waterbodies has not been well documented in
   Australia. Recreational use for trout and tournament fly fishing has
   increased in the Central Plateau of Tasmania; therefore, it is important
   to determine the human contribution to path formation and its potential
   consequences for biodiversity conservation in this area of high
   conservation value. We predicted that paths parallel to waterbodies
   experienced more human traffic than orthogonal paths. Across 36 sites at
   different distances from roads, a parallel and orthogonal path to
   lakeshore were sampled using eight, 1 x 1 m quadrats randomly located
   along each path within a 10 x 10-m plot. Recorded for each quadrat were
   the path widths, height difference between centre of paths and adjacent
   vegetation (path depth), vegetation types on and adjacent to paths,
   Bennetts Wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus) and Wombat (Vombatus
   ursinus) faecal numbers. General linear models indicated that path width
   was greater on parallel than orthogonal paths and declined with distance
   from roads. Path depth, however, was not affected by distance from roads
   but was shallower than orthogonal paths. Separate models used to test
   the potential effects of edge vegetation type, or the covariates Wallaby
   and Wombat scats did not have significant effects on-path variables.
   Paths encircling or orthogonal to Central Plateau lakes appear different
   floristically to adjacent vegetation communities, nonetheless. Heath and
   tussock grassland were largely absent from paths, whereas grassland and
   herbfield communities were infrequently observed off paths. Herbfield
   and grassland are rarer communities than heath and tussock grassland,
   which, in the context of a lack of exposure to erosion, suggests a
   conservation benefit of paths at present usage levels. The human
   contribution to parallel path conditions is likely to be high, given the
   results from the study, so monitoring of change is desirable, especially
   if predicted increasing human activity eventuates in this area.},

Abstract = {Coincident with a decade of introduced predator suppression, there was
   an increase in populations of a range of native mammals at the Royal
   Botanic Gardens Victoria (Cranbourne). A small, regionally significant
   population of the Black Wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) grew exponentially
   from an estimated 0.6 individuals km(-2) in 2001 to more than 70 km(-2)
   in 2013. The measured mean annual instantaneous rate of increase derived
   from a regular spotlight survey was similar to 0.37 and extrapolates to
   a doubling of the population approximately every 2 years. There was
   little indication that growth was abating as the population increased.
   Modelling predicted that in the absence of a decline in fertility or
   natural increase in mortality one third of the population would need to
   be shed annually to moderate or reverse growth and allow vegetation
   communities and small mammal habitats to recover.},

Abstract = {Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 may change C and N dynamics in
   pasture ecosystems. The present study was conducted to examine the
   impact of four years of CO2 enrichment on soil and root composition and
   soil N transformation in natural pastureland. Plots of open-top growth
   chambers were continuously injected with ambient CO2 (350 mu L L-1) and
   elevated CO2 (625 mu L L-1). Soil cores exposed to ambient and elevated
   CO2 treatment were incubated and collected each year. Net
   N-mineralization rates in soil (NH4+- N plus NO3--N), in addition to
   total C and N content (\%) of soil and root tissues were measured.
   Results revealed that elevated CO2 caused a significant reduction in
   soil NO3 (P < 0.05), however, no significant CO2 effect was found on
   total soil C and N content (\%). Roots of plants grown under elevated
   CO2 treatment had higher C/N ratios. Changes in root C/N ratios were
   driven by changes in root N concentrations as total root N content (\%)
   was significantly reduced by 30\% (P < 0.05). Overall, findings suggest
   that the effects of CO2 enrichment was more noticeable on N content (\%)
   than C content (\%) of soil and roots; elevated CO2 significantly
   affected soil N-mineralization and total N content (\%) in roots,
   however, no substantial change was found in C inputs in CO2-enriched
   soil.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted in the landscapes of south-eastern Ukraine
   during the nesting seasons 1988-2018. Within the landscape system

   vegetated strips, meadows, islands and spits, reedbeds, urban areas,
   salt marshes, steppe, cliffs, artificial forests. Bird species responded
   to temperature and precipitation gradients. The patterns of responses
   were presented using Huisman, Olff and Fresco expanded by the
   Jansen-Oksanen hierarchical models. The nature of species response in
   the gradient of temperature or precipitation conditions depends on the
   type of particular ecosystem and is not uniform for all populations
   inhabiting the different landscape types. The bird communities were
   revealed to demonstrate an abrupt dynamic over time. The continuous
   changes in community structure initiated by the external environmental
   factors are combined with modifications of internal biotic interactions,
   which may lead to abrupt reorganization of the community.},

Abstract = {To identify restoration strategies over degraded semi-natural plant
   communities, successional pathways and their local controls should be
   identified. The objective of this work is to quantify the changes in the
   physiognomy and functional groups of plant communities in the Sierras
   Chicas of Cordoba along seven years. Lyapunov coefficients were
   calculated and arranged in two-phase diagrams, identifying different
   successional pathways over two soil categories and six plant
   communities. Du Rietz's life forms were identified defining several
   plant functional groups. Results showed two successional pathways in the
   field of azonal soils and three in the field of intrazonal soils.
   Rainfall, extent of human-caused disturbances, and plant interactions
   are the leading causes explaining the changes in the structure of the
   plant communities. Fire and overgrazing retract the successions by
   altering the cover of plant communities and their functional groups.},

   Agreement 2013 with the State of Victoria. Dhelkunya Dja Land Management
   Board (DDLMB) developed a Joint Management Plan (JMP) for these parks,
   which was approved under Victorian legislation and launched in October
   2018. Here, we show how and why Djaara used their cultural authority to
   ensure their knowledge, and culture was incorporated into the JMP.
   Djaara's cultural authority produced significant innovations. First, the
   unique Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes implemented by
   the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation (DDWCAC) for the DDLMB
   ensured that shared governance and decision-making underpinned joint
   management. Second, the participatory Healthy Country Planning approach
   enabled greater equity, including a unique 3-day `Map-a-Thon' that
   integrated cultural and natural spatial data. Third, the challenge of
   achieving power-shifting from the government to the Djaara was addressed
   through a relationship-based approach, supported by systematic,
   evidence-based planning. The DDLMB and DDWCAC ensured development of the
   final JMP was innovative, equitable, culturally appropriate and
   culturally informed. Future processes would be improved by legislative
   change to mandate FPIC, with substantially greater resources to support
   the FPIC processes, and the inclusion of a `planning to plan' stage to
   allow all participants to gain the capacities needed. Supporting the
   cultural authority of Traditional Owners provides a new direction that
   has much to offer planning for other joint-managed parks in Victoria and
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Scientific, tourism and non-government organisations collaborated to
   design and undertake a small-scale coral outplanting intervention at
   Fitzroy Island, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Cairns, Australia.
   Activities were implemented to assist recovery of a reef showing signs
   of reduced coral cover after recent coral bleaching and to trial
   potential for implementation of work of this kind by community members.
   In December 2017, 240 coral fragments were collected and deployed on
   mid-water coral nursery infrastructure. Ten months later, 96 corals
   (similar to 15 cm) were outplanted onto bare sections of the surrounding
   reef rock at depths of 2-8 m. Monitoring was undertaken to measure
   changes in coral cover at treatment and control locations to determine
   the potential of using coral outplanting intervention to assist the
   recovery of degraded reefs. We found no significant difference in live
   coral cover between controls and treatment over a 12-month period.
   Although statistically insignificant, we observed an increase in live
   coral cover in treatment plots (9.8\%) and control plots (2.2\%),
   indicating natural recovery processes occurring across the reef. Total
   number of fish species and abundance increased significantly over time.
   Although the outplanting may not have been needed in this case, as a
   pilot project and the first coral nursery and active reef restoration
   project in the GBR Marine Park, the research provided valuable lessons
   associated with project collaboration and planning, site selection,
   monitoring and natural recovery vs restoration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use an autoethnographic approach to explore
   relationships between landholders and government agencies and natural
   resource management projects. We use this exploration to argue for a
   holistic, collaborative approach to decision making around the
   implementation of biodiversity conservation on private and public land.
   This approach aligns with principles underpinning reconciliation
   ecology, which emphasises the inclusion of grass-roots communities for
   promoting biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes where
   approaches to the management of natural resources may be contested. We
   present three projects (Environmental Champions; Fencing Incentive
   programmes; Plains-wanderer programme) and other research from the
   Mid-Murray Valley region of southern New South Wales to highlight the
   positive and negative aspects of relationships between landholders and
   others in natural resource management. We argue that for a more
   collaborative approach; we need to build relationships based on
   understanding, trust, respect, ownership and partnerships between rural
   communities, landholders, education and research institutions and
   government agencies as recognised in reconciliation ecology.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a critical resource for some rainforest
   reptiles but is slow to develop in restoration sites. In four
   restoration plantings in north Queensland, Australia, salvaged log and
   fence post piles were added to facilitate the return of reptiles,
   particularly the log-specialist Prickly Skink (Gnypetoscincus
   queenslandiae). Between one year and six and a half years after
   supplemental CWD installation, the reporting rate of Prickly Skink
   individuals in CWD piles had increased from 6.7 and 0\% to 12.5 and
   37.5\% for log and post piles, respectively. This coincided with
   substantial increases in the level of decay of CWD piles, particularly
   logs that had mostly decayed to particulate matter rendering them
   unsuitable for the Prickly Skink. CWD addition can be a useful tool to
   accelerate the development of rainforest reptile communities in young
   restoration sites. However, the persistence of supplementary CWD in a
   rainforest environment can be modest due to the high rates of CWD decay.
   As such, we recommend using high-density salvaged logs where possible
   and to make allowances for future replenishment of supplementary CWD if
   the volume of natural CWD in a restoration site remains low.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In 2021, as part of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the world's
   nations will meet to determine biodiversity targets for this decade,
   including area-based protection targets. Conservation tenders (a form of
   market-based instrument) have been used in several countries for the
   protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services within
   a defined area, mostly on private land. Conservation tenders are
   promoted as delivering cost-effective and targeted investment/outcomes
   in the context of limited funding for conservation. Despite the
   significant investment in the approach, the resultant biodiversity
   conservation outcomes from these tenders have received relatively little
   research attention. Key questions on the efficacy of conservation
   tenders for achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes are discussed,
   to inform policy makers, programme managers and researchers. Questions
   include the following: (i) What are the conservation objectives that
   conservation tenders seek to address that other mechanisms cannot?, (ii)
   What have been the biodiversity outcomes realised as they relate to
   ecosystem/habitat representation or ecosystem services?, (iii) How do
   policy makers plan to realise biodiversity values beyond the term of the
   agreement given no publicly stated strategy on securing long-term
   outcomes?, (iv) Is reporting of activities and results sufficient to
   judge changed biodiversity condition or delivery of expected outcomes at
   the end of the agreement, and are there efforts/plans/aims to follow up
   on outcomes post the agreement term?, (v) What proportion of successful
   tenderers have a protective conservation covenant in place prior to
   signing a tender or as a result of signing a tender agreement?, (vi)
   What do we know about the intentions and capacity of landholders beyond
   the term of the agreement and what has been the fate of agreements (and
   conservation outcomes) if they have changed hands during the course of
   the agreement?, (vii) Is the confidential nature of bidding in many
   conservation tenders missing the opportunity for collective or
   collaborative conservation efforts that can sustain learning and
   enthusiasm post-tender?, and (viii) Is the information on ecological
   values (ecosystem type, quality, landscape context etc) presented or
   made available in a way to landholders that maximises likely bidding to
   ensure a large pool and thus programme efficiency?},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of bushfire on populations of wild koalas

Abstract = {The impact of bushfire events on wild Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)
   populations is poorly understood. Following the 2019/2020 bushfire
   season in eastern Australia, we resurveyed 123 field sites for which
   contemporaneous (current koala generation) pre-fire survey data were
   available. Field sites were distributed across six fire grounds between
   Foster and Ballina on the north coast of New South Wales. At these
   sites, pre-fire naive occupancy levels by koalas ranged from 25\% to
   71\% of the sampled habitat, while post-fire naive occupancy levels
   ranged from 0\% to 47\%. The median reduction in the naive occupancy
   rate by koalas when considered across all six fire grounds was 71\% when
   standardized against pre-fire occupancy levels. Field data provided
   strong corroboration between site-based, post-fire foliage canopy cover
   estimates and modelled Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Map (GEEBAM)
   fire-severity categories. In terms of GEEBAM fire-severity categories,
   koala survival was five times more likely in areas where forest canopies
   were modelled as Unburnt or Partially burnt, compared to areas where
   forest canopies were Fully burnt. The capacity of bushfire-affected
   koala populations to recover from the 2019/20 fire season will be
   conditional upon size of the original population in each fire-affected
   area, the enactment and implementation of supportive, recovery-themed
   management regimes, future inter-fire intervals and associated
   intensities. Management actions necessary to assist recovery actions are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Global climate change and, specifically, rising temperatures, may
   increase the number of generations of necrophagous insects. The common
   green bottle fly Lucilia sericata (Meigen, 1826) (Diptera,
   Calliphoridae) ranks among the most important cosmopolitan necrophagous
   insects that utilize corpses and cause myiasis in farm animals and
   humans. Based on the data simulations, the use of accumulated
   degree-hours enables to calculate the number of generations of this
   forensically important species of blowfly with a greater accuracy than
   before, considering short-term increases of temperature at the boundary
   of the cold and warm seasons. The number of generations of L. sericata
   has increased from 7.65 to 8.46 in the Ukrainian steppe zone over the
   last 15 years, while the active developmental period of this species has
   increased by 25 days due to earlier start in spring. The average
   temperature increase of 1 degrees C increased the number of generations
   of L. sericata by 0.85. With a global climate change following the
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario (average
   temperature increase of 2.4 degrees C), adopted by the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change, by 2100 the number of generations of L.
   sericata in a simulated ecosystem will increase by 2.0 to 9.0
   generations per year.},

Abstract = {Barandabhar Corridor Forest (BCF), the biologically functional corridor,
   is surrounded by the large human settlements that exploit the corridor
   where large mammals such as tigers, leopards and their prey such as
   ungulates, primates, and rhinoceros occur. This study aimed to evaluate
   major determinants that affect the distribution of large mammals in BCF,
   Chitwan, Nepal that connects the biologically significant Chitwan
   National Park with the Mahabharat range. The status and distribution of
   large mammals along the habitat and disturbance gradients were
   determined by using 29 line transects (mean length = 4.59 +/- 0.38 km)
   that covered a linear distance of 133.13 km. The chital were the most
   abundant mammals (density per km(2) (D) = 8.9095 +/- 1.4570 and
   encounter rate per km (ER) = 1.49) followed by rhesus monkey (D = 38.896
   +/- 16.013, ER = 0.28), wild boar (D = 14.814 +/- 3.57, ER = 0.62),
   northern red muntjac (D = 9.6566 +/- 2.9514, ER = 0.62) and sambar (D =
   5.392 +/- 2.319, ER = 0.38). Similarly, the sign encounter rate of tiger
   and leopard was 0.435 and 0.503 respectively. Habitat types, human
   disturbances, and coverage of invasive and alien plant species (IAPs)
   played a key role in the distribution of large mammals. The occurrence
   of mammals was low nearer to the settlements and roads and coverage of
   IAPs and more nearer to the water resources. However, degradation of
   foraging grounds such as grasslands by succession and invasion of alien
   plant species added more threats to the survival of large mammals.
   Therefore, such a situation can be improved through the scientific
   management of forests and grasslands.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Numerous published studies have shown that soil formation, including
   primary pedogenesis, is closely connected functionally, energetically
   and operationally with ecogenesis as a key biogenic exploration
   mechanism of the Earth's surface by living organisms. The ontogenetic
   stage of soil evolution, especially in the initial phases, is determined
   by geogenic conditions and the intensity and trends of
   biogenic-accumulative processes in the developing ecosystem. Primary
   soils are considered critical in the rapid development of the initial
   ancient biosphere, supporting multiple environmental possibilities for
   ecosystems in that stage of their formation. Currently, similar models
   of correlated soil formation and ecogenesis are actualised when new
   substrates appear suitable for biogenic-abiogenic interactions, which
   occur in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes. Biotic factors
   during primary pedogenesis have accumulative and transformative effects
   on the edaphic component complex. At this stage, the initial pedon is a
   key functional stage in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems
   (biogeocenosis). When restoration of natural ecosystems occurs during
   the independent growth of exposed substrates, the natural regeneration
   mechanisms normally occur. These processes are based on the biogenic
   development of the substrate through the accumulation and transformation
   of organic matter.},

Abstract = {The distribution and cycling of nickel (Ni) in forests is greatly
   affected by their proximity to emission sources of the metal. The
   throughfall deposition is always richer in Ni than the bulk deposition.
   It can be inferred that some dry deposition enriches the throughfall. In
   remote forested areas, the hydrological fluxes of Ni do not differ a lot
   from those in litterfall. In addition, the current year needles in
   conifers have higher concentrations than the older needles, a sign of
   absorption and mobility of the metal. In contrast, near an industrial Ni
   source the older needles accumulate much more of the metal. The Ni
   content in bark tissue can be used to map the deposition distribution of
   the metal around an area (rural or urban). The concentrations of Ni in
   forest soils is also dependent on their distances from the Ni emission
   sources and the nature of the soil parent material. The Ni
   concentrations increase with soil depth due to the geogenic origin of
   the metal. Low pH greatly enhances the mobility of the metal in soils,
   much more than the leachability of organic matter.},

Abstract = {The present study was based on the idea of a pheromone trap barrier with
   alternating dispensers releasing different pheromone mixtures that
   affect males and females differently. We tested the possibility of
   increasing the catch efficacy of pheromone trap barriers by altering the
   pheromone mixture with low levels of cis-Verbenol (cV, targeting males,
   BM), the mixture with high levels of cV (targeting females, BF) and the
   pheromone mixture with intermediate levels of cV (SL). In addition, we
   were interested in lowering the dispersion of attracted bark beetles,
   especially males, which reduces the risk of attack on trees in the
   surroundings. Significant highest absolute and relative catch was found
   in the catch of the combination BM-BF, which was 2.2-fold higher than
   the catch of the control barrier treated with commercial IT Ecolure
   baits (Fytofarm, Slovakia). At the same time, the lowest dispersal in
   the surroundings of the barrier with the combination BM-BF was found,
   which was 2.5-fold lower than in the control barrier. The performance of
   the BM-BF combination of mixtures was proved in a field trial experiment
   where the total season catch of the part of the barrier treated with
   BM-BF dispensers caught 1.5-fold more beetles during the season than the
   control part treated with IT Ecolure dispensers. Furthermore, the
   results confirm that the performance of the combination of low levels of
   cV (targeting males) and high levels of cV (targeting females) is
   complemented by the desired reduced dispersion around the barrier, which
   reduces the risk of attack on trees in the surroundings.},

   in the Rhodope Mountains by describing its calling activity at four
   sites over a period of 3-6 months, and to examine possible correlation
   with natural and climatic parameters. Based on 24,937 calls, we report a
   significant increase in the number of calls per night (18:00 pm to 9:00
   am) as the length of the night increased, as well as a negative relation
   with wind speed. We did not observe a relationship between calling

Abstract = {Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. is found on all five crop-growing
   continents. In hot and dry seasons, this fungus is capable of causing
   considerable damage. In this study, mycelial compatibility of M.
   phaseolina isolates was investigated. In total the 30 samples collected
   were tested to examine their compatibility. The sunflower samples
   examined were collected in 2019 and 2020 in different regions of Hungary
   (29 isolates) and Slovakia (1 isolate). A total of 465 pairing tests
   were made with 30 isolates. The results of our examination showed
   incompatibility in 12 pairings. In our studies, we also measured the
   size of the microsclerotia of the isolates in order to determine which
   group they belong to. The diameter of the microsclerotia ranged from 74
   to 182 mu m. Based on this, microsclerotia belong to group `C', as well
   as the data of previous studies in Hungary.},

Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.), which is considered an important cereal everywhere,
   is widely cultivated in different agroecological conditions. Throughout
   their phenological stages, maize crops are attacked by pests and
   diseases, and in Ecuador these phytosanitary problems are usually
   counteracted with applications of pesticides. I Iowever, knowledge of
   beneficial entomofauna is fundamental to guide pest management programs.
   As part of this objective, the Coccinellidae species present in maize
   fields in localities (Santa Ana, Colon, and Danzarin) in Manabi province
   were identified. In each zone, maize plants were sampled from 2018-2019.
   A total of 2,654 specimens belonging to 14 taxa were collected in this
   study, of which Cheilomenes sexmaculata, Cycloneda sanguinea, Hippodamia
   convergens, Hyperaspis arida, and Psyllobora confluens were found in all
   the studied areas. Hyperaspis arida and Diomus apollonia are reported
   for the first time in Ecuador.},

Abstract = {Degraded vegetation is the result of a process that affects structural
   and functional characteristics. Tree species from the Acacia genus are
   very important to the ecosystem in semi-arid lands due to their
   participation in the recovery of highly degraded areas. One of the most
   important species among this genus is A. schafflieri. The status of a
   forest stand is determined according to its structure, including height,
   stratum and density. Remote sensing is a valuable method for estimating
   volumetric stocks and associated changes in forest populations over
   established periods of time. The objective of this research was to
   estimate wood volume of A. schafilieri using remote sensing, and to
   complement that information with the results obtained from an estimation
   method based on forest measurements. The results obtained showed that
   the crown area was the dendrometric variable that can be used in a wood
   volume prediction model. In the exploratory analysis between
   dendrometric variables and remote sensing showed low and negative
   associations were observed in the four stations analyzed. There are
   conservation problems due to anthropogenic activities, among which
   stands out the intensive grazing that results in a decrease of the
   natural regeneration capacity of Acacia schaffizeri.},

Title = {Distribution of invasive plants and their association with wild

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Invasive and alien plant species (IAPS) are considered as major threats
   to native biodiversity because TAPS alter ecosystem structure and their
   functions. We assessed the association of four major IAPS(A likania
   micrantha, Chtomolaena odorata, Lantana camara, and Parthenium
   hysterophorus) and the abundance of wild ungulates in Barandabhar
   Corridor Forest (BCF), Chitwan, Nepal. We collected data on the presence
   of wild ungulates in IAPS invaded habitats through direct observation
   and sign surveys. Our study showed that the cover of Al. micrantha was
   significantly high in Sal forest (Prominence value PV = 73.23) followed
   by riverine forest (PV = 40.5) and grassland (PV = 37.7) whereas P.
   hysterophorus was high in grasslands (PV = 22.9). Similarly, C. odorata
   was significantly high in Sal forest (PV =141.6\%), and L. camara was
   high in mixed forest (PV = 22.6). It was found that there was a
   significant negative association of IAPS (p = 0.002) with wild
   ungulates. The abundances of deer and wild pigs were more in the buffer
   zone than in the non-buffer zone. The abundance of deer decreased with
   increasing cover of C. odorata, M. micrantha, and P hysterophorus (p =
   0.002). Similarly, the abundance of wild pigs decreased with increasing
   cover of M. micrantha and L. camara. IAPS were not uniformly distributed
   in different habitats and abundances of wild ungulates were less in IAPS
   invaded habitats. Hence, it is important to initiate management plans to
   control IAPS spread to avoid their negative impacts on wild ungulate
   population such as deer and wild pigs.},

Abstract = {The Karajarri Indigenous Protected Area, in the south-west Kimberley, is
   home to vast intertidal rock platforms that form a culturally and
   ecologically important environment for Karajarri Traditional Owners and
   wider Bidyadanga community. Karajarri Rangers initiated a collaborative
   partnership with researchers to devise an intertidal invertebrate
   monitoring protocol to meet the requirements of their Healthy Country
   Plan and sustainably manage their cultural harvesting. The project aimed
   to design and trial a monitoring protocol that blended Indigenous
   ecological knowledge and values with western scientific rigour. To
   investigate and document the community's ecological knowledge of marine
   resources, a series of Ranger interviews, focus groups and collaborative
   fieldwork was conducted. Data collected from these qualitative methods
   provided valuable insights into knowledge of the intertidal environment
   and fauna and the community's management aspirations and priorities.
   Informed by these data, a monitoring protocol was cross-culturally
   designed to combine Indigenous knowledge and values within a western
   scientific framework. Two methodologies were piloted, focusing on a
   small subset of culturally significant target species. Although both
   were successful, the trial indicated that Rangers preferred
   abundance-focused methods for ecological monitoring. Further refinement
   of the monitoring protocol is required to build western science
   knowledge of the ecosystem and meet Ranger management goals. However,
   this study provided the basis of future monitoring strategies for
   Karajarri Rangers, formed a lasting collaborative partnership and is a
   useful exploration of Indigenous preferred approaches to western
   scientific monitoring of intertidal rock platforms.},

Abstract = {Macropods play an important ecological role in the Australian
   environment; however, at high population densities can adversely affect
   biodiversity and primary production and result in human-wildlife
   conflicts. While shooting is recognised as the most humane and
   species-specific method for controlling macropod populations, in
   peri-urban situations fertility control provides an attractive option to
   replace or reduce lethal interventions. An appropriate fertility control
   agent for managing overabundant macropods needs to provide long-lasting
   infertility following a single treatment, be species-specific in its
   action or administration method, and be safe, humane, and
   cost-effective. Several contraceptive methods that induce infertility
   for multiple years have been tested on macropods. These include surgical
   techniques; hormonal implants containing deslorelin, a
   gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, or levonorgestrel, a
   progestin; and immunocontraceptive vaccines (zona pellucida vaccine and
   the GnRH-based vaccine, GonaCon). These methods vary in the complexity
   of delivery and therefore their potential for adverse welfare impacts.
   Minimal side effects on behaviour and health have been observed. Despite
   some recent progress with remote dart delivery of deslorelin implants
   and GonaCon, efficient deployment of all existing methods is currently
   restricted to either captive or small, wild populations where
   individuals can be approached closely enough for safe capture and
   treatment. Of the currently available methods, levonorgestrel and
   GonaCon are the most suited to population-scale management. To date,
   studies addressing the effect of fertility control on the growth rate of
   macropod populations have been limited but are essential to enable full
   evaluation of the efficacy and cost/benefit analysis of the different
   approaches. Mathematical modelling to identify the level of infertility
   required to meet population management goals, as well as comparing
   integrated management strategies, will support planning of large-scale
   field trials. Improving dart delivery of existing contraceptive agents
   and developing new methods, such as an oral contraceptive, would
   increase the cost-effectiveness of applying fertility control to
   free-ranging macropods and may make treating larger populations
   feasible.},

Title = {Understanding Indigenous values and priorities for wetlands to guide

Abstract = {Many wetlands around the world are vulnerable to invasive species and
   are also culturally important for Indigenous peoples. Yet, translating
   the complex values Indigenous peoples hold for wetlands into management
   actions to mitigate the impacts of invasive species can be difficult to
   put into practice. In this paper, we draw on an Indigenous-led project
   on the Nardab wetland in Kakadu National Park to show how understanding
   the local nuance of Indigenous values and priorities in different
   wetland places can guide more effective and inclusive weed management
   activities. At Nardab, Indigenous values and priorities guided the
   choice of three priority sites to manage the impacts of Para grass
   (Urochloa mutica) weed. Specific values and priorities were identified
   across the sites, including significant bush tucker populations, and
   harvesting sites, the ability for the site to support Indigenous
   knowledge sharing and ceremonial activities and the opportunity for
   visitors to enjoy a healthy wetland in this World Heritage Area. The
   values and priorities varied across the sites, so the actions needed to
   improve the health of these places were also place specific. The results
   showed that relationships between Indigenous people and places varied
   from site to site within a given wetland and could not be easily
   generalized when deciding on effective management activities. The paper
   highlights the benefits of supporting ecological, cultural and
   human-focused actions that Indigenous people wish to prioritize at
   selected sites to ensure the management of weed impacts on wetlands
   adequately reflect the diverse cultural landscapes that are embedded
   within Indigenous peoples' Country.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {3-10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {At the dawn of the Anthropocene, with the imminent threat of climate
   change delivering 3-4 degrees C rise in temperature by the end of the
   century and biodiversity loss across the globe, restoration projects
   need to focus on re-establishing connectivity in vegetation structure at
   a landscape scale to facilitate the movement of wildlife. To achieve
   this requires long-term commitment, robust partnerships and planning and
   excellent planting technology underpinned by research. In this Special
   Issue, consisting of 15 papers, we present a multidisciplinary,
   multi-institutional, science-based approach to environmental
   restoration, focused on a single geographic region, the Midlands of
   Tasmania. This introductory paper describes the breadth of the material
   covered in the series and sets the scene for following papers by
   describing the Midlands, its geography, climate and history, its
   extraordinary natural values as a biodiversity hotspot, the degree of
   degradation that has resulted from 200 years of intensive farming and
   the objectives of the Midlands restoration project. The Midlands also
   offers opportunities as a model system for landscape scale restoration
   given it is a circumscribed region, heterogeneous in land forms and land
   uses. Furthermore, in land management, there is a high level of
   cooperation between land owners, government departments, environmental
   agencies and university researchers. We describe how the contributions
   from a wide range of disciplines can be focused to meet the challenges
   of ecological restoration in highly altered agricultural landscapes.},

Title = {Improving Kangaroo Management: A Joint Statement},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {186-192},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This Statement on improving kangaroo management originates from the
   shared experience of many peak bodies and stakeholders that existing
   policy and practices related to kangaroo management cause perverse
   outcomes for animal welfare, conservation, productivity, waste, drought
   resilience, climate, and the health, culture and wellbeing of
   Australians. The Statement was developed in consultation with delegates
   from two kangaroo symposia in 2019, and broadened through contributions
   from other ecological, Aboriginal, animal welfare and conservation
   stakeholders who believe reform is necessary. Positive change across all
   these domains requires an empathetic, science-based collaborative and
   coordinated approach to improve management of kangaroos in Australia,
   which in turn requires building a broad social mandate for reform. This
   manuscript presents the drivers and definitions for the Statement and
   key references documenting the causes and recommended solutions for
   improving kangaroo management, including many of the papers in this
   volume. An extensive inventory of conservation, agricultural, animal
   welfare, indigenous and scientific organisations that have endorsed the
   Statement is provided. We aim to inform public opinions and drive
   necessary change to policy, attitude and actions to appropriately value,
   conserve and utilise kangaroos where there is a tendency for
   overpopulation. Recommendations include development of a National
   Kangaroo Strategy that includes discussion on whether overabundant
   kangaroos are a legitimate sustainable resource that should be managed
   as such rather than being largely wasted as the by-product of pest
   control to protect other industries or conservation landuses.},

Abstract = {Overabundant deer populations can cause severe ecological impacts. To
   inform management decisions and assess the effectiveness of mitigation
   strategies, land managers require a rapid and cost-effective method for
   collecting data on both deer density and impacts. Here, we describe a
   field method for rapidly and concurrently assessing indices of deer
   density and impacts in forested habitats, and using field data collected
   in 2019-2020, we demonstrate its performance. The method combines
   commonly used protocols for surveying deer faecal pellets, vegetation
   impact and floristic attributes, without relying on indicator species.
   The survey involves assessment of 150-m transects in forested habitats
   along which 30 plots are surveyed for faecal pellets of deer and
   sympatric herbivores (here, Swamp Wallaby, Wallabia bicolor), and
   impacts on woody trees and shrubs at different heights. In total, we
   surveyed 154 transects comprising 15,941 plant impact assessments and
   assessed the methods performance using basic and comparative statistics,
   and power analyses. Almost all plant species were similarly impacted at
   the local (transect) level. Indices of deer and Swamp Wallaby density
   explained similar amounts of variance in impacts <1 m, while the deer
   index explained much more of the variance in impacts >1 m. We detected
   differences in vegetation impact and other floristic attributes between
   four locations surveyed in 2020 from a modest sample size (23-24
   transects). The method is simple to implement and can be applied in a
   wide range of forest types. In comparison to alternatives (e.g. fenced
   exclosures), this method presents a rapid and cost-effective means of
   collecting information on deer density and impacts, and detecting large
   differences in impact. We suggest that the proposed method enables rapid
   landscape-scale assessments of deer impacts suitable for evaluating
   management interventions.},

Abstract = {Collaborations between researchers and practitioners are vital to ensure
   mutual learning to inform scientific and on-ground outcomes and
   government policy. Communicating outcomes from these collaborations
   benefit land management and restoration projects. The Ecological Society
   of Australia (ESA) Practitioner Engagement Working Group (PEWG)
   showcases and communicates applied ecological research projects, driven
   by partnerships between researchers and practitioners, and promotes the
   value of these links to on-ground action. In December 2019, the PEWG ran
   the Practitioner Engagement for On-ground Outcomes symposium at the ESA
   annual conference in Launceston, Tasmania, to highlight key factors that
   enable and limit effective collaboration in ecological projects.
   Overall, 17 speakers from a range of government, Indigenous and
   non-government organisations delivered presentations on ecological
   issues. Here, we focus on six presentations that revealed eight key
   enablers of effective science-practice partnerships. Of these, six
   related to principles underpinning translational ecology (collaboration,
   commitment, communication, decision-framing context, engagement and
   process buy-in). Two additional enablers were highlighted - innovation
   and robust science, and longevity and flexible timelines. This symposium
   provided a stream-lined approach to communicate the factors which enable
   successful projects to a broad audience. To enhance effective
   researcher-practitioner collaborations, improved practice and greater
   innovations in future ecosystem management projects, as well as both new
   and long-term funding streams, will be required.},

   endangered grassy ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT \& RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Critically endangered grasslands and grassy woodlands were once
   widespread across south-eastern Australia. However, more than 200 years
   of European land use means less than 1\% of their pre-European extent
   remains today. Conservation and restoration of these ecosystems involves
   reintroducing fire to periodically reduce competition and allow smaller
   species to establish. Furthermore, seeds of native species are sown -
   but often fail to establish as many forbs and grasses are
   hard-to-germinate. Therefore, data on how these species respond to
   fire-related germination cues, such as smoke and heat, can benefit our
   understanding of both how species respond to fire and identify
   treatments which can be used to increase germination. We conducted a
   germination trial to determine if smoke and heat cues increase percent
   germination and germination speed of 55 common grassy ecosystem species.
   Fire cues increased germination speed and/or percent germination of 44
   of the 55 study species. These results have three implications for
   grassy ecosystem conservation and restoration: (i) fire may aid
   conservation by maximizing germination of native species; (ii)
   pre-treating seed with smoke and/or heat prior to sowing may increase
   germination when restoring these ecosystems via direct seeding; and
   (iii) smoke and heat can be used to increase germination when growing
   seedlings for plantings.},

Abstract = {Grasslands are globally threatened ecosystems and provide habitat for
   multiple threatened species. For this reason, grassland management must
   employ strategies which can protect multiple species of conservation
   significance. We reviewed surveillance monitoring data collected on a
   private conservation reserve in Tasmania between 2014 and 2021 for the
   endangered Ptunarra Brown Butterfly (Oreixenica ptunarra) to identify
   the landscape scale predictors of abundance. The data suggested that
   elevation (lower), time since fire (longer) and highland grassy
   sedgeland and subalpine Diplarrena latifolia rushland habitats were
   preferred. These data provide information on how to target future
   monitoring of this species more effectively. Conservation management on
   this reserve needs to develop strategies that account for the ecological
   requirements of other threatened species in the reserve, which may have
   different and possibly conflicting management requirements.},

Abstract = {The challenge of maintaining biodiversity by managing overabundant
   native fauna is often a contentious issue. This study demonstrates a
   means of improving animal welfare in the culling of overabundant
   kangaroos. We studied five populations of Eastern Grey Kangaroo
   (Macropus giganteus) in the Australian Capital Territory and established
   the percentage of juveniles throughout the year. We focused on juveniles
   aged 8-12 months old, as these are identified at greatest risk of poor
   welfare outcomes if orphaned. Our findings support the timing of culls
   when the fewest vulnerable juveniles are present in the population. This
   paper provides a scientific basis for land managers to adjust the timing
   of kangaroo management activities to best balance animal welfare, land
   management and conservation objectives.},

Abstract = {Large-scale deforestation and forest fragmentation in the tropical area
   of the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland, Australia, have
   placed extensive strains on populations of many endemic species of this
   area, such as the Lumholtz's Tree-Kangaroo (LTK). Despite LTKs
   predominantly arboreal life and their ability to quickly colonize and
   adapt to restored forested habitats, little is known about their
   terrestrial activity patterns within these habitats which put them at
   risk to predation by canines and to roadkill when crossing nearby roads.
   Using motion-sensing cameras, forest floor-related activities of LTKs
   were recorded in a restored riparian rainforest habitat in relation to
   seasons and moon phases. The results show that LTKs exhibit a cathemeral
   activity pattern of forest floor-related movements with a tendency
   towards crepuscular activity at dawn. While there was a significant
   association between the daytime recordings and the seasons with more
   activity during the days of the wet season, there was no association
   between the nighttime recordings and the seasons, as well as the moon
   phases. These results suggest that seasonal changes in temperature and
   precipitation, but potentially also in food quality, are likely to
   affect the frequency at which LTKs access the forest floor. Mitigating
   threats to LTKs in restored habitats should focus on facilitating
   terrestrial movements of LTKs, the control of feral dogs, enlarging and
   connecting available habitat, and educating drivers about peak times of
   LTK movements on the ground.},

   non-target species at Taunton. The techniques trialled included poison
   fresh meat baits and several types of traps presented in different ways
   and with various lures. Thirty-one percent of fresh meat baits was taken
   during bait uptake trials; corvids removed 40\% of these and dogs
   removed 16\%. Cats were not detected, on camera traps, taking a bait.
   The elevated soft-jaw traps (81 trap nights/cat) and single-entry cage
   traps (98 trap nights/cat) were found to be the most successful of all
   the trap types trialled and had low amounts of by-catch. Other trap
   types trialled took more than 166 trap nights to catch a cat. The
   elevated soft-jaw trap configurations had the lowest amount of by-catch
   (avg. 0.33\%), and the log trap had the highest amount of by-catch
   (1\%). Ground-set traps successfully trapped cats (305 trap nights/cat)
   but caught more by-catch (0.9\%) compared to the elevated soft-jaw trap
   types and most wallabies caught in these traps had to be euthanised.},

Abstract = {Estimates of dry biomass and carbon sequestration were made for
   environmental plantings established in the harsh, dry agricultural
   landscapes of the Midlands of Tasmania. Plantings were designed to
   provide habitat connectivity for native wildlife. The dry biomass for
   6-year-old woodland and riparian plantings was estimated to be 4.7 and
   9.0 tonnes/ha, respectively. The carbon component of this biomass was
   estimated to be 2.4 and 4.5 tonnes/ha carbon, equivalent to 8.7 and 16.5
   tonnes/ha carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered, respectively. These are
   lower than previous estimates for plantings of the same age in the same
   landscape. This is largely due to lower planting densities of 200
   stems/ha, and 883 stems/ha respectively, for woodland and riparian
   plantings, relative to comparable plantings ((similar to)1,000
   stems/ha). Further, a combination of extreme climatic events during
   early establishment and high heterogeneity in soil type and landscape
   position reduced performance in riparian plantings.},

Abstract = {Assessing distribution patterns of valuable taxa plays an important role
   in the biodiversity conservation of these taxa. The genus Crocus L.
   (Iridaceae) comprises about 100 species that are distributed mainly in
   the Mediterranean region and western Asia. The present study purposed to
   assess the distribution patterns of Iranian Crocus species (including C.
   sativus L. and 8 wild species) and their conservation status in Iran as
   one of diversity centers of Crocus in the Middle East. A set of
   geographic distribution data was compiled through field studies, and
   reviews of herbarium specimens, iNaturalist, and various Flora.
   Localities were marked on geo-referenced maps (1/106) of Iran using
   ArcView version 3.2 (E-SRI, 2000). The distribution patterns of the taxa
   were mapped per 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees universal transverse
   Mercator grid cells (25 km(2) with the exception of boundary area).
   Based on the species distribution (SDI) (33\%) and species
   specialization (SSI) (44\%) indices, those Iranian Crocus species that
   are threatened are mainly distributed in Irano-Turanian region. The
   mountainous ecosystems of Almeh and Western Alborz are important
   distribution centers of these taxa. Iranian Crocus species with SSI <
   0.5 (C. almehensis, C. gilanicus, C. michelsonii, and C. caspius) have
   the highest conservation value.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {168-174},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Understanding cases in restoration and in agriculture in which species
   diversity improves productivity and ecosystem functioning is crucial due
   the need to restore degraded habitat and improve crop productivity for a
   growing human population. Reaching these diversity benefits is likely
   influenced by the dynamic of less negative interspecific than
   intraspecific interactions that promote diversity. But further testing
   is needed to understand the relationship of intraspecific- relative to
   interspecific interactions. Here I used seedlings from three native and
   one introduced species used in restoration in the western United States
   in pairwise interaction combinations and found that the study species
   varied in shoot biomass in response to interaction treatments of the
   control, intraspecific, and interspecific interactions (R-2 = 0.7, p <
   0.001), and that intraspecific interactions were more negative than
   interspecific interactions for four of five of the pairings. Overall, as
   shoot mass size differences increased between interspecific neighbors,
   interactions became more positive (R-2 = 0.6, p < 0.001). These findings
   point to variability in species responses in whether the focal species
   compete more intensely with conspecific or heterospecific neighbors and
   indicates the need for more careful selection of interacting species for
   meeting both agricultural and restoration goals.},

   low-resolution regional-extent (similar to 100,000 hectares) vegetation
   maps. These maps might not capture resource variability at planning
   extents (0.1-300 ha), or at resolutions where Koala ecology processes
   operate (5-50 ha). Consequently, potentially high-quality habitat may
   not be considered in planning decisions. Whether low-resolution habitat
   mapping adequately captures food resource variability is therefore
   relevant to map users at non-regional extents. We examined four
   different broad-scale low-resolution habitat maps within a small area
   (150 ha) in southeast Queensland and compared the classifications of
   each. Map units were generally ranked in the same hierarchical order;
   however, differences in methodologies meant that, between maps, some
   units varied widely in assigned habitat quality. Two maps were assessed
   using quantitative Queensland Herbarium data, and field data we
   collected. Assessment using overstorey species emphasised habitat
   quality differences between habitat map units better than the
   alternative whole-of-canopy method. Maps relying on interpretation of
   vegetation descriptions for habitat class definition sometimes
   overestimated food tree cover proportions and stakeholders need to be
   cognisant of these limitations. One method assigned Very Low Suitability
   to a 60-ha focal study site containing evidence of Koala use, and we
   strongly recommend that field validation should be an integral part of
   habitat management at these scales. We conclude that, rather than
   mapping approaches encompassing several habitat attributes within a
   single map, layered datasets, each with specific attributes, would
   provide greater utility for stakeholders by allowing them to use layers
   individually or in combination as required.},

Abstract = {Urban expansion is a major cause of land use change and presents a
   significant threat to biodiversity worldwide. Agricultural land is often
   acquired by local councils and developers to expand urban growth
   boundaries and establish new housing estates. However, many agricultural
   landscapes support high biodiversity values, especially farmlands that
   feature mosaics of native vegetation and keystone habitat such as
   hollow-bearing trees. In south-eastern Australia, many arboreal
   marsupials including the threatened Squirrel Glider (Petaurus
   norfolcensis) have populations within peri-urban zones of expanding
   rural cities. A key challenge to planners, developers and conservation
   organisations is the need to maintain habitat for locally rare and
   threatened species as land undergoes changes in management. Critical to
   the sustainable development of peri-urban landscapes is a thorough
   understanding of the distribution, habitat requirements and resources
   available to maintain and improve habitat for species dependent on
   limited resources such as tree cavities. In this management report, we
   present background information on an integrated research programme
   designed to evaluate potential impacts of urban development on fauna in
   the Albury Local Government Area, NSW. We mapped hollow-bearing trees,
   erected nest boxes and monitored arboreal marsupials. Information
   presented in this report provides a blueprint for monitoring arboreal
   marsupials, including threatened species in other developing regions,
   and will assist the Albury-Wodonga local governments in future planning
   of sustainable living environments.},

Abstract = {Some obstacles are associated with in vitro propagation of date palm,
   such as explant tissue browning, slow callus growth and development, low
   organogenesis and multiplication efficiency, and frequent tissue
   vitrification. This investigation studied the effect of five types of
   gelling agents (Danish Agar, Cero Agar Type 8952, Chile Agar, Gerlite
   Food Grade, and Agar-Agar.) on in vitro regeneration and bud
   multiplication of Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Showathy. The results
   showed that the highest percentages of callus producing buds and average
   bud formation (77.78\%, 11.5 buds, and 72.23\%, 10.9 buds) were obtained
   in response to 7 g l(-1) Danish Agar and Cero Agar Type 8952,
   respectively. A decrease in browning percentage was observed in tissues
   cultured in the medium gelled with Danish Agar. Observations showed that
   Danish Agar and Cero Agar Type 8952 eliminated also shoot vitrification.
   Compared with other treatments, the total amount of phenolic compounds
   was significantly reduced to 0.79 and 0.82 mg GAE/g in buds cultured in
   the media gelled with Danish Agar and Cero Agar Type 8952, respectively.
   The macronutrient phosphor, calcium, sodium, and micronutrient boron and
   copper significantly increased in the in vitro shoots regenerated on the
   media gelled with Danish Agar and Cero Agar Type 8952.},

   scientific literature and some illustrative examples developed in the
   framework of the FP7 enviroGRIDS project. The study is aimed to increase
   the knowledge of the ITPS and, specifically, to contribute to the
   geographical understanding of the role played by the driving factors in
   their distribution and spread in various habitats and ecosystems. The

Abstract = {YY European riparian forests are in general susceptible to plant

   vegetation overviews with phytosociological affiliation contain detail
   insight into species composition patterns at various geographical
   scales, but quantitative assessment of the relationship between
   non-native plant richness and measured environmental variables is still
   scarce. We used two vegetation datasets of alder-dominated forests to
   analyse plant invasion patterns in the Pannonian and the Carpathian
   region of Slovakia. A large dataset of 918 vegetation plots was used at
   the regional scale, whereas 40 vegetation plots completed by ecological
   (mainly soil, climatic) predictors were used at the local scale in order
   to determine how they shape non-native species richness. We found
   significant differences (P < 0.05) between the Pannonian and the
   Carpathian region in the number of non-native vascular plants at both
   scales, with altitude being the most important predictor. Generalized
   Linear Models accounted for 56.6\% and 59.6\% of alien species richness
   data in the Pannonian and Carpathian region, respectively. Alien
   richness was affected by altitude and soil pH in the Pannonian region,
   but only by altitude in the Carpathian region.},

Abstract = {Translocation of threatened terrestrial orchids is increasingly seen as
   a viable ameliorative conservation option when habitat is destroyed or
   modified through changing land use. Most orchid translocations reported
   in the literature detail nursery-raised seedlings planted into intact
   and suitable habitat, and few involve translocation of entire plants and
   their mycorrhizal fungal associates. As part of a larger translocation
   study, soil cores containing 46 individuals of the threatened Painted
   Diuris (Diuris tricolor) were translocated into herbivore-proof plots on
   restored and rehabilitated post-mining lands in the Hunter Valley of New
   South Wales. After 3 years of annual flowering and fruiting, new
   recruits (mature flowering plants) were observed within translocation
   plots but outside of original soil cores, and at 6 years following
   translocation 29 new individuals were observed. Two of these individuals
   germinated outside of fenced plots. At peak flowering in 2020, a search
   of rehabilitated lands outside of translocation plots failed to locate
   any orchids, discounting the unlikely possibility that orchid tubers may
   have survived the process of topsoil stockpiling and respreading.
   Successful recruitment of Painted Diuris into mining rehabilitation has
   the potential to significantly offset any losses of this species
   resulting from mining operations within the region.},

Abstract = {Splash erosion, as the first step of soil erosion, causes the movement
   of the soil particles and lumps and is considered an important process
   in soil erosion. Given the complexity of this process in nature, one way
   of identifying and modeling the process is to use a rainfall simulator
   and to study it under laboratory circumstances. For this purpose,
   transported material was measured with various rainfall intensities and
   different amounts of poly-acryl-amide. In the next step, artificial
   neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and
   support vector machine (SVM) were used to model the transported
   materials. The results showed that among the three methods, the best
   values of evaluation criteria were related to SVM, and ANFIS
   respectively. Among the three studied durations, the experiment with a
   duration of 30 minutes received the best results. The results based on
   available data showed by increasing the number of membership functions,
   over-fitting happens in the ANFIS method. To reduce the complexity of
   the model and the likelihood of over-fitting, some rules were
   eliminated. The results showed that the performance of the model
   improved by eliminating some rules.},

Abstract = {The inputs of As in forest ecosystems have declined since the eighties
   when the higher concentrations of that metalloid were observed due to
   industrial activities. The As inputs to the forest floor include
   throughfall and litterfall where dry deposition is an appreciable
   percentage. This is manifested by the higher As concentration in older
   needles of conifers and the enrichment of throughfall relative to the
   bulk deposition. The throughfall and the forest floor convert the
   inorganic As into methylated organic As and in this way reduce its
   toxicity. In unpolluted forests the vast percentage of As is retained in
   soils because the oxides of Fe and Al are very efficient holders. In
   polluted forested soils the As can become mobile and enrich the surface
   runoff waters approaching even the threshold value set by the World
   Health Organization. For this reason forest soils with high
   concentration of As due to former high loads should be monitored.},

Title = {Y Golden jackal, a natural disperser or an invasive alien species in
   Slovakia? A summary within European context},

Abstract = {This summary provides an overview of the golden jackal (Canis aureus)
   categorization in Europe with particular focus on its presence in
   Slovakia. The distribution range of this species in Europe has been
   expanding in recent decades. Currently, European population is in
   constant and fast increase, widening their ranges towards Central and
   Eastern Europe and more recently in some western countries. All over
   Europe, the categorization of the golden jackal status is discussed with
   some controversial. A recent genetic study helped to determine that
   golden jackals do not meet the established three criteria, which
   categorize a species as an invasive alien species. In Slovakia, golden
   jackals' numbers grown considerably in the last decade and with an
   increasing of their distribution through the country it became a
   permanent species of the Slovak fauna. The only internal status is the
   hunting Act no. 274/2009, which classifies it as, game species. The fast
   adaptation and dispersion through Slovakia can be considered similar to
   the behaviour of an invasive species, as suggested in previous studies
   in Hungary. Based on widely accepted definitions, agreed under
   international legal instruments, it is quite clear that the term
   `Invasive Alien Species' only encompasses non-native species
   specifically introduced by humans (intentionally or accidentally).
   Following this Invasive Alien Species terminology, golden jackals cannot
   be categorized as such in Slovakia. The natural expansion, the growing
   ranges, and the increase in numbers of the golden jackal in Slovakia in
   the last decades points to a need to improve the knowledge of the
   species.},

Abstract = {Every macropod population is unique in terms of the combination of

   examine the separate components of survey methods: the survey platform,
   mode of detection and form of sampling. We also review the range of
   current methods available and highlight new developments, including
   their assumptions and limitations. To guide managers in choosing a
   method for their management context, we provide a decision matrix based
   on the behavioural ecology of the target species, the structure of
   habitat at the site and the porosity of the site boundary. To promote
   current best practice, we describe in detail four standard counting
   methods: direct count, sweep count, faecal accumulation rate and

Abstract = {In the past, the European ground squirrel represented a common part of
   Slovakian fauna. During the 20th century, there was a substantial
   decrease in its number, mainly due to the intensification of
   agriculture. Currently, several programs focused on the recovery and
   preservation of ground squirrel colonies have been implemented. The aim
   in supporting the population of the European ground squirrel is to
   increase the number of birds of prey and to ensure a food base for them.
   In this paper, we focus on evaluating the success rate of European
   ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) management measures. The
   research was realized at two localities in the Protected Bird Area
   Slovensky kras (Hrhov and Gemerska Horka) in the years 2015-2018.
   Activities were focused on the management of grassland and supplemental
   feeding during the breeding period. As a result of the management
   measures and the supplemental feeding, we managed to maintain a positive
   trend in the populations' development, as there was an increase observed
   in all the monitored seasons.},

Abstract = {Foliar fertilization is one of the crucial ways for continued

   it faces some challenges, including low soil availability for nutrients,
   dryness of the soil surface, low root activity in the breeding period,
   soil alkalinity, as well as water scarcity in areas of cultivation, and
   symptoms of deficiency of some elements. This review attempts to shed
   light on the importance of using leaf fertilization, demonstrating the
   successful technique and positive results, and proving the ability of
   date palm cells to absorb nutrients, similar to other trees, and
   interact with chemical and biological fertilizers. Besides, the
   leaflet's possibility of absorbing various nutrients, chelated iron,
   biostimulants, antioxidants, and nano-fertilization, are presented.},

Abstract = {The difficulty of locating and measuring the over-bark tree bole
   diameters at heights that are far from the ground, is a serious problem
   in ground-truth data measurements in the field. This problem could be
   addressed through the application of intelligent systems methods. The
   paper explores the possibility of applying the Random Forest regression
   method (RFr) in order to assess, as accurately as possible, the size of
   the tree bole diameters at any height above the ground, considering data
   that can be easily measured in the field. For this purpose, diameter
   measurements of pine trees (Pinus brutia Ten.) from the Seich-Sou urban
   forest of Thessaloniki, Greece, were used. The effectiveness of the
   Random Forest regression technique is compared with the results of
   non-linear regression models that fitted to the available data and
   evaluated. This research has shown that the RFr method can be a reliable
   alternative methodology in order to receive accurate information
   provided by the model, saving time and effort in field.},

Abstract = {The relationships between shoot and root traits can inform plant
   selection for restoration, forestry, and agriculture and help to
   identify relationships that inform plant productivity and enhance their
   performance. But the strength of coordination between above- and
   belowground morphological and physiological traits varies due to
   differences in edaphic properties and population variation. More
   assessments are needed to determine what conditions influence these
   relationships. So, we tested whether plant population and soil texture
   affect the relationship between shoot and root traits which have
   important ecological ramifications for competition and resource capture:
   shoot height and root tip production. We grew seedlings of two
   populations of Bromus tectorum due to is fast growing nature in a growth
   chamber in loam soil, sand, and clay. We found variation in height by
   plant population and the substrate used (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.0001), and
   variation in root tip production by the substrate used (R-2 = 0.33, p <
   0.0001). Importantly, we found that relationships between shoot height
   and root tip production varied by soil texture and population (R-2 =
   0.54, p < 0.0001), and growth in sand produced the strongest
   relationship and was the most water deficient substrate (R-2 = 0.32).
   This shows that screening populations under several environments
   influences appropriate plant selection.},

Abstract = {Understanding of habitat favourability has wide relevance to the
   invasion biology of alien species. We studied the seasonal dynamics of
   the alien ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in
   monoculture Scots pine forest stands in south-west Slovakia, Central
   Europe, from April 2013 to March 2015. Adult H. axyridis were collected
   monthly across seven randomly selected pine stands of different ages and
   canopy closure, from the lower branches of pine trees, and larvae were
   recorded qualitatively. Adults were recorded all year round, most
   abundantly in November and least abundantly in February. The
   relationship between the abundance of H. axyridis and selected forest
   stand characteristics was modelled using the negative binomial
   Generalized Additive Model with penalized spline component in month
   (seasonality) effect, year, canopy closure and age effects and the
   random effect of forest stand (sample area effect). The abundance of H.
   axyridis was significantly influenced by the age of stand and
   seasonality (with month granularity) for both closed and open canopy
   stands, whereas the effects of canopy closure and sample area were not
   significant. The bimodal pattern of seasonal dynamics of H. axyridis on
   Scots pine was common for closed and open canopy stands, with two peaks
   reflecting the cyclic movement of the species from and to overwintering
   sites. Harmonia axyridis utilized certain pine stands preferably for
   foraging during the growing season and certain stands for refuge during
   winter. The ladybirds were found in highest numbers in the 15 year old
   closed canopy stand (overwintering site). The occurrence of both adults
   and larvae in most stands indicated a suitability of Scots pine forest
   for ladybird breeding. The model of year-round dynamics of H. axyridis
   has been presented for the first time within the invaded range of the
   ladybird in Europe.},

Abstract = {Globally, the role of women in conservation is gaining attention with
   increasing initiatives to support gender equity in environmental
   management and decision-making. In Australia, the role of Aboriginal
   women in natural and cultural resource management employed as rangers is
   also gaining recognition; however, female employment in this field
   remains underrepresented. This paper reflects on a cross-cultural
   partnership aimed at empowering young Aboriginal women in natural and
   cultural resource management, locally known as caring for Country, in
   Arnhem Land, a remote Aboriginal owned region of northern Australia. The
   project was led by local Ngukurr community Ngandi Elder and lead author,
   Mrs Daniels, and Macquarie University researchers who co-designed and
   co-delivered activities according to five project aims: (i) Community
   involvement; (ii) Biocultural research / learning on Country; (iii)
   Leadership and confidence building; (iv) Knowledge maintenance; and (v)
   Capacity building. Over three years of the project, over 60 youth
   participated in a range of on-Country and cultural learning, leadership
   and capacity building activities including cross-cultural biodiversity
   surveys, wetland monitoring, traditional language and knowledge
   recording and culture camps. Participant feedback and a biocultural
   learning assessment task noted growth in confidence, biocultural
   knowledge and desire for continuation of youth empowerment programs in
   conservation. To facilitate gender equity in Aboriginal natural and
   cultural resource management, structural and sustained support of
   women's empowerment and leadership, driven by local women with support
   of local communities, is required.},

Abstract = {Nature conservation in both theory and practice is increasingly looking
   to understand different knowledge systems, including Indigenous
   worldviews, to achieve complementary conservation and socio-cultural
   goals. Here, we share stories from one of the longest running Indigenous
   Protected Areas (IPAs), Walalkara IPA, by Langaliki Robin, daughter of
   the founders of the IPA, who reflected on her parents' lessons about how
   Tjukurpa (Dreaming Law) is essential for conservation. Grounded theory
   analysis of her interview identified the importance of Tjukurpa and the
   role of Langaliki's parents, particularly her father Tjilpi Robin
   Kankapankatja in the establishment of the IPA. Tjukurpa was asserted as
   a core cultural knowledge system that provides Indigenous people with
   motivation, strength and well-being, allowing them to maintain access to
   Country and work cross-culturally. Tjukurpa influenced the initial
   declaration, roads and physical layout of the protected area and
   continues to guide the daily work activities of IPA rangers. According
   to Langaliki, the key to maintaining strong people and Country is to
   pass on cultural knowledge and Tjukurpa from generation to generation,
   especially to younger people. This research suggested that by knowing
   who the key knowledge holders are, respecting that Tjukurpa exists
   without being privy to the details, and continuing multi-generational
   access to Country, conservation programmes that embrace Indigenous ways
   of knowing and doing can achieve successful outcomes for nature
   conservation and Indigenous well-being.},

Abstract = {Direct seeding is increasingly being used as a cost-effective
   revegetation technique. Successful outcomes from direct seeding rely on
   effective weed control, particularly during the vulnerable seedling
   establishment phase. Post-sowing weed control options are constrained by
   the need to protect seedlings from damage and few studies have compared
   the effectiveness of different weed control techniques. We evaluated the
   effect of preliminary hand weeding (with subsequent spraying), spraying
   monthly or spraying quarterly with glyphosate, on woody seedling
   emergence, survival and growth in trials sown either in spring or autumn
   at a riparian site in Victoria, southeastern Australia. Seedling numbers
   were recorded monthly for 6 months and at 12 months after sowing, with
   seedling survival and heights assessed at 12 months. Total seedling
   numbers were higher in subplots initially hand weeded than in subplots
   sprayed on either a monthly or quarterly basis, regardless of when
   direct seeding occurred, but weed control treatment had no effect on
   seedling survival. These results indicate that post-sowing spraying
   limited rates of seedling emergence, either directly or indirectly. For
   direct seeding, hand weeding in the first few months after sowing may

Abstract = {Three different nonlinear regression models were tested for their
   ability to predict stem volume for economically important native tree
   species in Greece..he models were evaluated using adjusted R square
   (A(dj) R-sqr) root mean square error (RMSE) and Akaike information
   criterion (AICc), where necessary. In general, the quadratic polynomial
   and cubic polynomial models and the two-parameter power models fit the
   data well. Although the two-parameter power function fit best for fir,
   oak, and beech trees, the cubic polynomial model produced the best fit
   statistics for black pine. Making forest inventory estimates often
   involves predicting tree volumes from only the diameter at breast height
   (DBH) and merchantable height. This study covers important gaps in fast
   and cost-effective methods for calculating the volume of tree species at
   national level. However, the increasing need for reliable estimates of
   inventory components and volume changes requires more accurate volume
   estimation techniques. Especially when those estimates concern the
   national inventory, those models must be validated using an entire range
   of age/diameter and site classes of each species before their extended
   use across the country to promote the sustainable use of forest
   resources.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-62},

Abstract = {The date palm can grow in desert areas using high salinity groundwater
   by increasing the number of irrigation cycles. A field experiment was
   carried out on date palm cv. Sayer offshoots grown in sandy saline soil
   during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. The outcomes demonstrated that
   the application of saline (10 dS m(-1)) groundwater every four days
   increased plant height, number of new leaves, total chlorophyll, and
   relative water content. In turn, the hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde,
   and electrolyte leakage were reduced. Also, the effect of this treatment
   improved the growth of the plants, thus reduced the absorption of
   sodium, chloride, and increased potassium, then decreased the Na/K
   ratio. Cluster analysis showed two distinct cluster groups. In the first
   group, the dissimilarity between the treatments is illustrated by the
   influence of freshwater. While the second group showed the similarity
   between the treatments of four days and every week in the subgroup.
   Whereas treatment of two weeks duration shows the most detrimental
   effect on growth indices and chemical properties of offshoots. The
   utilization of saline groundwater in the water system of the date palm
   is the best option among the solutions possible in the current
   conditions of drought and thermal retention.},

Abstract = {Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) is a disease of pine needles. It causes
   significant defoliation of affected trees; intensive attacks lead to
   damages of the whole stand. The relationship of trends in disease
   severity and intensity with climatic variables were studied in three
   Austrian pine plantations (Jahodna, Kalnica, Litava) during 2014-2018.
   During the monitoring period, the greatest variability in disease
   severity was observed in the top third of the crowns, which showed the
   highest correlation with the variants of the most important climatic
   conditions (temperature and relative humidity) tested. For the spread of
   DNB, based on statistical assessment, a higher number of intervals of
   environmentally favourable climatic conditions is crucial. Both
   Dothistroma species (D. septosporum and D. pini), which are causal
   agents of the disease, were identified in Jahodna. In Kalnica and
   Litava, only D. septosporum was present.},

Abstract = {Monitoring is critical for conservation, to track the status of
   threatened species, assess the relative impacts of threats, inform
   management responses and prioritise them according to their efficacy.
   Globally, freshwater fish are impacted by a range of threats including
   deterioration in water quality, climate change, habitat loss and
   degradation, introduced predators and herbivores, and wildfire.
   Monitoring of freshwater fish can be challenging because aquatic
   conditions can make detecting and identifying population trends
   difficult for many species. Galaxiidae is the most speciose family of
   Gondwanan-distributed freshwater fishes, and over 75\% of species
   assessed by the IUCN Red List have been classified as threatened. Many
   Australian galaxiids are highly imperilled and monitoring effort and
   adequacy is low. We prepared a detailed monitoring plan for the Stocky
   Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara) that is representative of the
   conservation status and level of threat facing many congeneric and other
   similar species. Our protocol provides details of species biology,
   pertinent threats, and management options with sampling methods to
   gather these data, and options to link with management actions for
   maximum benefit. Improved monitoring linked with threat management
   should improve the conservation status of Stocky Galaxias. By providing
   this example, we have sought to improve monitoring for range-restricted
   freshwater fishes more generally.},

Abstract = {Quantifying ecological interactions can inform restoration practitioners
   of the recovery of ecosystem function in restored areas. Plant-animal
   interactions that move seeds are critical for plant recruitment, animal
   food sources and ecosystem function, but seed movement immediately after
   sowing can affect calculations of seedling emergence in restored areas.
   We set up seed cafeterias in undisturbed, native vegetation and restored
   areas to quantify and compare the removal of seeds of eight native plant
   species of banded ironstone ranges to determine the recovery of this
   ecological interaction and the potential effect on monitoring protocols.
   Overall, the average amounts of seeds removed from cafeterias over two
   days were between 17 and 23\%, but this varied considerably between
   replicates. Seeds with or without a food body (i.e. elaiosome) were both
   removed from cafeterias by invertebrates. Seeds removed by invertebrates
   (most likely ants) after surface sowing for restoration are expected to
   negatively affect calculations of seedling emergence because the known
   quantity of sown seeds has been reduced, deflating emergence
   calculations. Restoration protocols should consider the potential
   negative effect of seed movement on seedling emergence. Encouragingly,
   these restoration areas have maintained ecological interactions that
   move seeds in the landscape at comparable levels to undisturbed
   vegetation.},

Abstract = {Fire is a major type of ecological disturbance shaping plant communities
   and species distributions. Fires in the spring and summer of 2019/2020
   in Australia burnt large areas where this type of disturbance was rare
   in the past, including in the South-East Queensland region. To assess
   the potential impacts of these fires, online GIS data layers were used
   to map where the fires occurred and which protected areas, plant
   communities and threatened plants were likely burnt. Based on clustering
   of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor fire points, 3\%
   (240,000 ha) of the region may have burnt including 107,606 ha of
   National Parks, sections of 18 Broad Vegetation Groups and 74 Regional
   Ecosystems and potential habitat of 74 threatened plant species. This
   included 16\% of wet open forests and 13\% of rainforests. The results
   provide preliminary insights into the potential scale of the fires and
   impact on biodiversity from mapping based on online data, but we also
   that more detailed mapping including of fire intensity and perimeter
   combined with ground truthing and ongoing monitoring would be required
   to better understand changes in fire regimes in the region.},

Title = {Taking the bait: The influence of attractants and microhabitat on
   detections of fauna by remote-sensing cameras},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Autonomously triggered cameras are a common wildlife survey technique.
   The use of attractants and surrounding microhabitats is likely to
   influence detection probabilities and survey outcomes; however, few
   studies consider these factors. We compared three attractants (peanut
   butter-based, tuna-based and a control) in a Latin square design through
   a coastal shrubland with high microhabitat variability at Cape Otway,
   Victoria, Australia (38o50MODIFIER LETTER PRIMES, 143o30MODIFIER LETTER
   PRIMEE). Deployments involved 36 cameras for four days in each of five
   years. The percentage cover of each vegetation structural type (low
   {[}no or sparse cover], moderate {[}grass] or high {[}shrubs]) within 20
   m of each camera was calculated and reduced to a single variable using
   PCA. Dynamic occupancy modelling, with lure type and vegetation
   structure as covariates of detection probability, found that peanut
   butter attracted the greatest diversity of species (24 of 35 species,
   69\%) and yielded the greatest number of detections (50\% of 319) when
   compared with tuna oil (66\% and 24\%, respectively) and the control
   (43\% and 26\%, respectively). Peanut butter attracted more Macropodidae
   (wallabies) and Muridae (rats and mice); however, vegetation structural
   variables were the greatest influence on Corvidae/Artamidae
   (raven/currawong) detections with higher detectability in more open
   areas. Vegetation structure also influenced Muridae detections. This
   study reinforces the critical choice of appropriate attractants and
   camera placement when investigating vertebrate groups and highlights the
   role of microhabitat in the detection of small mammals and birds. We
   suggest future large-scale camera surveys consider different bait types
   and microhabitats in their designs, to control for any biases and enable
   future advice on `optimal' methods.},

Abstract = {The cytogenetic analysis of the Pinus sylvestris L. seed progeny in the
   forests of the northern taiga in the Far North of Russia conditions was
   carried out. Two Pinus sylvestris populations growing in Ambarnskoy and
   Pyaozerskoy forest divisions of Loukhsky district of Karelia Republic
   were studied. The number of chromosomes, the frequency and types of
   mitosis disturbances at the metaphase, anaphase and telophase (as a
   percentage of the total number of dividing cells at the same stages),
   and the frequency of micronuclei occurrence, as well as the laboratory
   seed germination, were studied. As a result of the study, it was found
   that 50-56\% of the studied sprouts were mixoploid. Analysis of mitosis
   showed that the root meristem of the studied samples contained cells
   with various pathologies; simultaneously, the frequency of mitosis
   pathologies in the Ambarnskoy population was significantly higher than
   in the Pyaozerskoy one. It amounted to 6.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.9 +/- 0.4\%,
   respectively. Nine types of abnormalities were identified; chromosome
   overrun and bridges prevailed. Micronuclei were registered in 35-38\% of
   the studied Pinus sylvestris sprouts. At the same time, the proportion
   of cells with micronuclei in the Ambarnskoy population was 2-fold higher
   than in the Pyaozerskoy one and averaged 0.12 +/- 0.03\% and 0.07 +/-
   0.02\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {During the spring of 2020, Choristoneum murinana (Hubner) otherwise
   European Fir Budworm (EFB) was recorded on Abies cephalonica near the
   villages of Kaloskopi and Agoriani in Central Greece at the mountains

   the particular pest on the specific mountains has not been described
   yet. We found that EFB mostly prefers Abies cephalonica and less
   .Ittniperus oxycedrous in sunny areas and/or near the country roads.
   Across the study area, local severe infestations of scale 2,3 and 5,
   were observed. In many cases the infestation was observed in adult fir
   individuals. Defoliations and severe outbreaks, which are presumably
   incurred by EFB were also observed by local people (beekeepers,
   foresters, herb collectors) in the past. Our laboratories field
   measurements and the analysis of the Singular Spectrum analysis
   trendlines revealed growth decline, not connected with climatic
   parameters but probably associated with observed defoliations by the
   EFB.},

Abstract = {Sideritis incana, Stachys ocymastrum, and Thymus fontariesil are
   medicinal plants belonging to the Lamiaceae family and occurring in
   semi-arid lands in northern Algeria and in many other countries along
   the Mediterranean coastline. Despite the ecological and economic
   interests and also the questionable future these species may meet in
   their natural habitats, various aspects of their seed biology have not
   been recognised to this date. This study was intended for in situ
   conservation of these plants. The problem investigated was the
   germination response of seeds to different water potential levels
   attained with using different amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG(6000))
   (0, -0.03, -0.07, -0.2, -0.5, -1 and -1.6 MPa). In this way, the
   appropriate conditions and the threshold tolerance of seed germination
   against water stress were assessed. Seeds of the three species lacked
   primary/innate dormancy and they geminated abundant and fast in
   distilled water (S. incana - 65\%; S. ocymastrum - 60\% and 7:
   fontanseii - 90\%). Small seeds of 7: fontanesii tolerated more water
   stress and germinated under up to -1 MPa (-10 bars). Large seeds of S.
   incana and S. ocymastrum, however, were more sensitive to the drought
   stress and germinated only under -0.5 MPa (-5 bars). Moreover, more
   studied parameters were found developing negative reponse under rising
   drought stress, such as postponed triggering of seed germination,
   decreased germination velocity and prolonged germination duration, as
   well as the average time of germination. Therefore, these three plants
   appear to postpone their establishment until arrival of conditions
   promising for germination, including sufficient rainfall.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the current state and evaluate the
   productivity of white poplar stands by natural zones within Ukraine and
   to define the prospects for their use for plantation forest cultivation.
   The objects of the study were white poplar stands in Ukrainian forests
   grown on the area of more than 7,600 hectares in various natural zones,
   namely Polissya (forest zone in Ukraine), Forest-Steppe, and Steppe. The
   study was carried out based on the analysis of forest inventory data
   (Ukrainian forest fund database) containing given stand characteristics
   such as origin, age, diameter, height, type of forest site conditions,
   etc. The characteristics were estimated by grouping the plots by age.
   The growth specificities (dynamics of the main mensuration
   characteristics) and the productive capacity of the white poplar stands
   were analyzed based on the developed tables. It was found that white
   poplar stands are mainly concentrated in Steppe and Forest-Steppe in
   Ukraine. The stands are of coppice or artificial origin; they grow in
   moist fairly fertile, fresh fairly fertile and moist fertile sites. The
   age distribution of the white poplar stands is severely imbalanced due
   to a significant predominance of stands aged over 40 years in all
   natural zones within Ukraine. More productive are the white poplar
   stands growing within Polissya and Forest-Steppe. The developed growth
   and productivity tables should be used when planning and prioritizing
   the relevant forestry interventions in white poplar stands.},

Abstract = {In connection with the increasing negative impact of invasive alien
   species on biodiversity and the environment in general, their research,
   as well as throughout the world, is relevant. The distribution of the
   Heracleum sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum of the secondary range on the
   example of the Kyiv agglomeration is investigated in the work. In our
   study we aimed to evaluate the possibility of spontaneous spread of
   giant hogweeds in the secondary range, adaptation of the species to the
   new conditions of the environment that favor to control of these
   species' expansion and reduce the threat to the urban ecosystems and
   citizens' health. We hypothesise that in the secondary range H.
   sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum settle sites with relatively high
   temperature (Tr), lightening (Lc), and soil moisture conditions similar
   to that in their natural range. 17 populations and four localities
   (sites) of H. sosnowskyi and H. mantegazzianum were studied. They were
   found within forest, meadow, riverine and ruderal plant communities. It
   is indicated that the advent species fully adapted to the conditions of
   the environment. The difference by ecological indicators Lc2 and Tm1 is
   pointed out. According to the results of our research, for the area of
   Kyiv urban agglomeration the growth of H. sosnowskyi and H.
   mantegazzianum is indicated in the plants communities of six classes.
   They spread most in ruderal plant communities of the: Robinietea,
   Artemisietea, Epilobietea classes. The studied species belong to
   invasive plant species in Ukraine and are characterized by extremely
   high effect on the environment and high invasive potential.},

Abstract = {Cities intensely modify natural environments and impose pressures on
   biodiversity. In this sense, carnivorous mammals are one of the groups
   most affected due to their food and space requirements. The feeding and
   spatial behavior of the chilla fox (Lycalopex griseus, G., 1837) and
   dogs were studied in the vicinity of a peri-urban protected area in
   south-central Chile. The diet of both canids was compared seasonally,
   for which feces were collected along trails in three habitats: native
   forest, exotic plantations and scrublands. Dog feces were collected at
   the same site to establish whether they were avoided by foxes. Chilla
   fox has been highlighted for consuming a high proportion of hares
   followed by rodents of the Muridae family, both being exotic mammals in
   Chile, whereas dogs showed a predominant consumption of anthropogenic
   food. Significant differences were observed for chilla fox in dietary
   diversity, mainly in summer and fall. No spatial segregation was
   observed with the domestic dog, which was evidenced in a high overlap in
   the use of all habitats. This scenario, together with continuous human
   presence, are elements that must be considered in the medium-term to
   evaluate the effects of anthropogenic pressures on native carnivores in
   the study area.},

Journal = {FOLIA OECOLOGICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {The genetic potentials of eight species of Achillea (A. millefolium, A.
   filhpendulla, A. biebersteinii, A. nobilis , A. eriophora), Matricaria
   (M. ricotita), and Anthemis (An. haussknechtii and An. tinctoria) under
   drought conditions during the seedling stage were measured. Non-ionic
   water-soluble polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 6000)
   was used to simulate water stress at five osmotic potential levels (0,
   -0.3, -0.6, -0.9, and -1.2 MPa). An acceptable threshold value for
   germination was osmotic potential -0.6 MPa, and the modest osmotic
   potential was -1.2 MPa for studied taxa. Seedlings of germinated at two
   control and osmotic. potential -0.6 MPa (as an acceptable threshold
   value for germination) treatments were sowed in a field under rainfed
   conditions. Genetic differentiation of control plants (CP) versus early
   selected plants (ESP, germinated at osmotic potential -0.6 MPa) was
   studied using morphological, physiological, and molecular (ISSR)
   markers. No significant differences were observed between morphological
   traits of CP and ESP in all species, however, days to full flowering
   shortened in ESP. The physiological results demonstrate that under
   rainfed conditions, the ESP, in a quick response, collect osmolytes and
   amplify the activity of antioxidative enzymes to survive drought. The
   genetic relationship in the group of genotypes, that ISSR marker set it
   out, is affiliated to taxon even though AMOVA showed a partial
   differentiation between CP and ESP groups (21\%). It was concluded that
   the selection of tolerating individuals at the seedling stage represents
   a likely positive strategy to have higher drought tolerance feature in
   plants under rainfed conditions.},

Abstract = {Oak lace bug (Corythucha arcuata) has caused increasing damage
   throughout Europe since its appearance in 2000. In Hungary, it has
   become a dangerous pest of Quercus species in recent years. They
   frequently appear on ornamental and fruit trees, either, but this type
   of damage is not significant. Castanea species are known as their common
   host plants in their native area, but in Europe, it was detected only in
   Bulgaria. In this paper, we provide the first record of oak lace bug on
   sweet chestnut (C. sativa) in Hungary, which represents only the second
   European data on Castanea species. The pest was found in Debrecen, East
   Hungary.},

Abstract = {The capability of a non-native species to withstand adverse weather is
   indicative of its establishment in a novel area. An unusually cold
   winter of 2016/2017 that occurred in the West Carpathians of Slovakia
   and other regions within Europe provided an opportunity to indirectly
   assess survival of the invasive ambrosia beetle Xylosandrus germanus
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae). We compared trap captures of
   this species in the year preceding and succeeding the respective cold
   winter. Ethanol-baited traps were deployed in 24 oak dominated forest
   stands within the southern and central area from April to August 2016,
   and again from April to August 2017 to encompass the seasonal flight
   activity of X. germanus and to get acquainted with temporal changes in
   the abundance of this species in these two distant areas. Dispersing X.
   germanus were recorded in all surveyed stands before and after the
   aforementioned cold winter. Their total seasonal trap captures were
   lower in the southern area following low winter temperatures, but
   remained similar in the central area. Our results suggest that X.
   germanus can withstand adverse winter weather in oak dominated forests
   of the West Carpathians within altitudes of 171 and 450 m asl. It is
   likely that minimum winter temperatures will not reduce the
   establishment or further spread of this successful invader in forests in
   Central Europe.},

   plant height, leaf area, and leaf numbers decreased under the salinity
   conditions. The antioxidant applications increased the plant height,
   leaf area, carbohydrates, and relative water content compared with the
   control. Citric acid at 1,000 ppm decreased electrolyte leakage and
   malondialdehyde. Indoleacetic acid decreased, whereas abscisic acid
   increased under salinity. The antioxidant application increased
   indolcacetic, whereas abscisic acid decreased. Proline, protein content,
   and peroxidase activity increased under antioxidants. Also, the
   potassium and K/Na ratio increased under antioxidant applications.
   Citric acid improved the characteristics more than salicylic acid,
   encouraging farmers to use it for its low cost as an antioxidant to
   reduce environmental stress damage.},

Abstract = {The frequently used term ecology is currently interpreted in various
   ways. This scientific discipline has undergone relatively dynamic
   development since its inception, and its character is still widening and
   changing. Therefore, in this contribution we attempt to briefly
   summarize the subject and contents of current ecology, as well as to
   propose its more systemic and comprehensive definition. We try to
   enhance its present definitions especially by putting emphasis on the
   dynamics of nature (the dynamics of natural processes). We define
   current ecology as the science dealing with the structure, dynamics and
   functions of nature including evolution, where structure involves the
   distribution and abundance of individual organisms, habitats and
   ecosystems; dynamics include all the aspects of their life trajectories
   and cycles, including growth, development, reproduction or renewal,
   interactions and their changes, the cycling of matter, flows of energy
   and information and their transformations; and functions involve the
   properties, traits and niches of individual organisms and species in an
   ecosystem, as well as the properties and niches of ecosystems in the
   landscape, ecoregion or in the whole Earth system.},

Abstract = {Peculiarities of alien macrophytes invasions into aquatic ecosystems
   located at urban landscapes were investigated on an example of water
   bodies, rivers and streams located within the Kyiv City (Ukraine). There
   have been recognised seven species of alien aquatic macrophytes
   established at the territory of Kyiv City, representing 11\% of the
   hydrophilic flora of the city. The representatives of the recent
   invasions Egeria densa, Elodea nuttallii and Pistia stratiotes in
   comparison with Elodea canadensis were characterized by a wider
   ecological valence concerning the contents of nitrogen compounds in
   water. Significant variability of morphometric parameters of
   coenopopulations of alien species formed in different environmental
   conditions was recognised. There was observed that the individuals of
   Pistia stratiotes from eutrophic water bodies formed significantly
   larger surface organs, and the individuals from meso-eutrophic reservoir
   had a larger number of leaves in the rosette, and more numerous and
   longer roots. The alien macrophytes species dwelling in the water bodies
   of the city were characterized by wide ecological amplitudes, high
   stress tolerance, high reproduction rate, high naturalization degree,
   allowing these species to use the resources of their new environment
   inaccessible for the local species and significantly affecting the
   ecosystem homeostasis and transformation.},

Title = {Allelopathic potential and cytostatic activity of Antarctic moss
   Sanionia georgicouncinata (Amblystegiaceae)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {264-268},
Abstract = {From the first half of the XX century, the maritime Antarctic was a
   region with high regional warming rates. At the beginning of the XXI
   century, regional warming strongly slowed down, but during the next
   twenty years the near-surface temperatures and mean annual precipitation
   at the Antarctic Peninsula will most probably increase. Higher
   temperatures and precipitation make the conditions in the maritime
   Antarctic more favourable for plants, including invasive species.
   Moreover, the increasing number of Antarctic tourists unintentionally
   transport thousands of seeds to the Antarctic on their clothes and
   equipment. In such circumstances, it is important to evaluate possible
   defensive mechanisms of native plant species, including their
   allelopathic potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   allelopathic potential and cytostatic activity of Sanionia
   georgicouncinata. This species is widespread in the maritime Antarctic
   and is one of the most abundant moss species on the Argentine Islands
   (Wilhelm Archipelago). Seeds of cucumber Cucumis sativus, radish
   Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, wheat Triticum vulgare, and
   amaranth Amaranthus paniculatus were used as bioassay species. Fresh
   green biomass of S. georgicouncinata was used to prepare aqueous
   extracts with 1 : 10, 1 : 50, and 1 : 100 plant to water ratios. The
   average root length of wheat sprouts and cucumber sprouts in distilled
   water did not differ significantly from those in plant extracts. The
   root length of radish sprouts in 1 : 50 plant extract was significantly
   shorter than in distilled water. Meanwhile, in 1 : 50 and 1 : 100 water
   extracts, roots of amaranth plants were significantly longer than in
   water. The number of lateral roots of cucumber sprouts in water and
   studied aqueous extracts varied from 1 to 6 with medians from 3 to 4.
   The medians of control (distilled water) and sample groups (aqueous
   extracts) did not differ significantly, but only 38.1 +/- 6.1\% of
   cucumber sprouts developed lateral roots in the 1 : 10 aqueous extract
   of S. georgicouncinata, and even less - 28.3 +/- 7.5\% in the 1 : 50
   aqueous extract. The results of this study show that the allelopathic
   potential of S. georgicouncinata is low. However, a significant
   cytostatic activity of the studied extracts shows that this species may
   still affect other plants and animals. Further research is needed to
   evaluate the impact of the studied extracts on root growth and
   germination of the invasive plants, particularly Poa annua.},

Abstract = {Soil arthropods respond sensitively to land management practices and
   correlate with beneficial soil functions. The aim of this research was
   to determine soil quality using the QBS index in different types of
   crops and influence of soil variables (pH soil, soil moisture,
   potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen) on soil arthropods. Between the
   years 2018 and 2020, we studied different types of crops (Brassica
   napus, Pisum sativum, Triticum aestivum, T. spelta, Zea mays, Grass
   mixture and Hordeum vulgare) and recorded 14 taxa. Our results suggest a
   higher QBS index value in crops grass mixture, Pisum sativum, Triticum
   aestivum, T. spelta. The EMI value grew with increasing values of soil
   moisture, soil pH, phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen; indicating the
   presence of soil arthropods occurring in higher quality soil. Our
   results suggest that agricultural intensification affects soil
   arthropods, which are important for the production of biomass, which
   also affects crop yields.},

Title = {Features of the exogenic development of Passalurus ambiguus (Nematoda,

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-79},
Abstract = {Passalurosis is a prevalent disease among helminthiases of domestic
   rabbits. This invasion is caused by the nematode Passalurus ambiguus
   (Nematoda, Oxyuroidae), which is cosmopolitan and localized in the cecum
   and colon of rabbits. Passalurosis is highly contagious and capable of
   unlimited spread, due to the biological characteristics of its pathogen,
   such as the conditions that ensure maximum preservation of parasites at
   exogenous stages of their development. Experimental research in the
   laboratory established the timing of development of P. ambiguus: eggs
   isolated from the gonads of female helminths, depending on temperature
   regimes and features of their growth and development According to the
   morphological features of Passalurus: eggs, four stages were
   distinguished in their exogenous development zygote, cleavage and
   formation of blastomeres, formation of larvae and motile larvae.
   Depending on the cultivation temperature, the duration of embryogenesis
   ranged from 4 to 9 days, and egg viability ranged from 59.3\% to 72.7\%.
   The most favourable temperature regime for the development of P.
   ambiguus eggs was the temperature of 35 degrees C, at which 72.7\% of
   eggs with motile larvae were formed within 4 days. At this temperature,
   the zygote stage lasted for 1 day of cultivation, the stage of cleaving
   and formation of blastometes occurred on days 1-2, the stage of larval
   formation on days 1-3, and the stage of formation of motile larva on
   days 3-4. At lower temperatures, the term of development of Passalurus
   eggs increased, and the number of viable eggs decreased. At temperatures
   of 30 degrees C and 25 degrees C, the development of Passalurus eggs
   took place during 5 and 7 days, respectively, and the viability was
   66.7\% and 62.7\%. At these temperatures, the zygote stage lasted 1-2
   and 1-3 days, the stage of cleaving and formation of blastomeres
   occurred on days 1-3 and 1-4, the stage of larval formation lasted from
   days 2-4 and 2-6, and the stage of formation of motile larvae took place
   on days 3-5 and 4-7, respectively. The least favourable temperature for
   the development ofP. ambiguus: eggs was the temperature of 20 degrees C,
   at which the formation of motile larvae occurred in 9 days, and their
   viability was only 59.3\%. At this temperature, the zygote stage lasted
   1-4 days, the stage of cleaving and blastomere formation occurred on
   days 2-6, and the larval formation stage on days 3-8, and the motile
   larval stage happened on days 5-9. The growth and development ofP.
   ambiguus eggs was accompanied by significant changes in morphometric
   parameters, such as the increase in egg width and thinning of egg shell
   at the egg shell plug. The obtained data will allow preventive measures
   to be effectively implemented on rabbit farms that are susceptible to
   pinworms, taking into account the terms of exogenous development of
   pathogens in different seasons.},

Title = {Endoparasitoses of the Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) on
   the northern Black Sea coast of Ukraine},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {One of the main tasks of ecological parasitology at the present stage is
   to determine patterns of spread of invasive diseases of poultry in the
   environment through a thorough epidemiological examination, as well as
   to determine the main directions and factors of spread of parasites in
   Ukraine. Some pigeon health problems can affect their populations, but
   parasitic infections play an important role. Our research found that
   83.3\% of Eurasian collared doves examined (Streptopelia decaocto) were
   affected by endoparasites. The commonest helminths were Raillietina spp.
   with the average invasion intensity of 4.9 +/- 1.3 specimens/ind.,
   Baruscapillaria spp. and Ascaridia columbae with an invasion intensity
   of 4.6 +/- 1.5 and 3.7 +/- 2.1 specimens/ind., respectively. The
   commonest cestodes were Raillietina spp. with the extent of invasion of
   52.2\% and Davainea proglottina - 6.7\%. The Amoebotaenia cuneata
   cestodes were recorded in 3 (3.3\%) doves, and Echinolepis carioca -
   only in 2 (2.2\%) doves. Six doves (6.7\%) were infected with the
   nematode Ascaridia columbae and 5 (5.6\%) - Baruscapillaria spp.
   Eimerian oocysts were found in 9 (10\%) collared doves, and Trichomonas
   gallinae was recorded in 15 (16.7\%) birds. According to the results of
   helminthological autopsy and identification of the isolated pathogens, 8
   varieties of mixinvasions were identified. In association with the
   Rayetins, there were the protozoa Eimeria spp. and Trichomonas gallinae
   and the nematode Ascaridia columbae. Two-component invasions were
   registered in 78.6\% of doves, three-component infestations in 14.3\%
   and four-component infestations in 7.1\% of birds. Mixed infection with
   Raillietina spp. + Ascaridia columbae was found in the small intestine
   of Streptopelia decaocto, which was also pathomorphologically observed
   to have catarrhal-hemorrhagic enteritis, which was accompanied by the
   formation of a large number of spotted hemorrhages on the mucous
   membrane, and in the places of attachment of cestodes - necrotic-caseous
   areas. Temperature and other weather conditions such as humidity,
   precipitation, etc. of the northern Black Sea coast affect the
   population size of intermediate host cestodes. Continuous monitoring of
   invasive diseases of pigeons of different species will help to take the
   necessary preventive measures against endoparasitoses of birds.},

Abstract = {The study of the spatiotemporal distribution of fish is an important and
   poorly studied aspect of the ecology of aquatic organisms. The research
   work was performed using the modern hydroacoustic method and geographic
   information systems. A section in the lower reaches of the Irtysh, a
   large transboundary Siberian river (in Western Siberia, Russian
   Federation), was studied. It has a strong development of meandering. The
   merging (i.e., reshaping of closely spaced meanders and
   erosion-accumulating channel processes) results in development of
   wintering riverbed depression, which is a critical ``temporal
   bottleneck{''} during the winter period of the fish life cycle. The
   average density of fish in the study area in summer and autumn was 8,031
   and 9,194 individuals per ha, respectively. Analysis of the distribution
   of fish showed that the distribution in the horizontal aspect had a more
   aggregated character in the autumn. In the vertical aspect, it had a
   more surface (pelagic) character. The ichthyofauna in the water area of
   the riverbed depression is mainly represented by cyprinids. The
   loop-shaped evolution of the channel formed a section of the river with
   multidirectional, circulating, and counter-current flows. It also
   created zones with depths exceeding 20 m and aggregations of fish. These
   features characterize the studied water area as a wintering riverbed
   depression of the fish of the Lower Irtysh. This section of the river
   should be included in the list of protected wintering biotopes of fish
   in the West Siberian fishery basin, which will ensure the conservation
   of fish at the critical stage of the life cycle.},

Title = {Impact of recreational transformation of soil physical properties on
   micromolluscs in an urban park},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {78-87},
Abstract = {The paper assesses the effect of transformation of soil physical
   properties on the abundance of micromolluscs in the conditions of an
   urban park. The studies were carried out in Novooleksandrivskiy Park
   (Melitopol, Ukraine). An experimental polygon was represented by 7
   transects with 18 sampling points in each. The interval between the
   points in the transect, as well as the interval between transects, was 3
   meters. The total area of the polygon was 1,134 m(2). The tree species
   growing within the polygon were Quercus robur, Sophora japonica, and
   Acer campestre. Shrubs were represented by Ulmus laevis, Tilia cordata,
   Celtis occidentalis, and Morus nigra. The locations of the trees and
   shrubs were mapped. The crowns of tree and shrub plants formed a dense
   canopy and a shady light regime. The grass cover was practically absent.
   The soil mechanical resistance, soil aggregate-size distribution,
   electrical conductivity of soil, soil moisture and bulk density were
   measured. We recorded 618 individuals of Vallonia pulchella, 120
   individuals of Cochlicopa lubrica, and 58 individuals of Acanthinula
   aculeata within the surveyed polygon. We extracted three principal
   components, which could explain 60.9\% of the variation in the feature
   space of the soil properties. The principal component 1 explained 42.0\%
   of the variation of the feature space and depended on the soil
   penetration resistance throughout the whole profile, aggregate
   composition, density, electric conductivity and moisture content of
   soil. This component reflected a tendency for soil penetration
   resistance and soil density to increase near recreational trails. The
   principal component 1 was used to indicate the gradient of recreational
   transformation of the soil. The principal component 2 was able to
   explain 10.6\% of the variation in the feature space. It negatively
   correlated with the distance from the recreational trail, soil
   penetration resistance at the depth of 35 cm or more, soil electrical
   conductivity, and the proportion of aggregates greater than 3 mm in
   size. This component positively correlated with soil penetration
   resistance at 0-5 cm depth and the proportion of aggregates less than
   0.5 mm in size. This component can be interpreted as a ``halo{''} from
   the recreational trail, or a gradient of indirect soil transformations
   adjacent to the zone of intense recreational load. The principal
   component 3 was able to explain 8.3\% of the variation in the feature
   space. It positively correlated with soil penetration resistance at the
   depth of 20-40 cm, the proportion of 0.5-7.0 mm aggregates, and soil
   moisture. It negatively correlated with the proportion of aggregates
   larger than 7 mm and smaller than 0.25 mm. This component indicated a
   variation in soil properties that was induced by causes independent of
   recreational exposure. The extracted gradients of soil properties
   significantly influenced the abundance of micromollusc populations. The
   abundance of all species decreased after increase in recreational load.
   Micromollusc species responded to direct recreational exposure as
   plateau (C. lubrica) and asymmetric unimodal responses (V. pulchella and
   A. aculeata).},

Title = {Phytoindication approach to assessing factors determining the habitat
   preferences of red deer (Cervus elaphus)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-206},
Abstract = {The study examined the possibility of using the phytoindication
   technique to describe habitat preferences of red deer in a relatively
   homogeneous area. Two alternative hypotheses were tested. Hypothesis 1
   suggests that the relationship between red deer and vegetation is due to
   a trophic factor, so preferences for individual plant species cause
   vegetation to influence the distribution of animal numbers. Hypothesis 2
   suggests that environmental factors influence vegetation, structuring
   and determining the productive level of the community as a whole.
   Therefore, environmental factors, rather than individual plant species,
   cause vegetation-animal interactions. The research was conducted on
   Biryuchiy Island Spit, where the Azov-Sivash National Nature Park is
   located. The geobotanical surveys were performed in three types of
   ecosystems: sandy steppe (vegetation class Festucetea vaginatae), saline
   meadows (vegetation class Festuco-Puccinellietea), and artificial forest
   plantation (vegetation class Robinietea). 250 releves were recorded
   according to the Brown-Blanquet approach. The number of fecal pellets
   and the number of groups of pellets of red deer was recorded together
   with geobotanical surveys in the same sample plots. The pellet groups
   counted in the field were converted to deer densities in specific
   vegetation classes taking into account the number of pellet groups on
   the site and the decay rate of the fecal pellets. The vegetation types
   were distinguished by the number of deer fecal pellets per unit area.
   The highest number of fecal pellets was found for the plant class
   Festucetea vaginatae, somewhat fewer fecal pellets were in the plant
   class Robinietea, and the lowest number was in the plant class
   Festuco-Puccinellietea. A geometric distribution model is adequate for
   explaining the experimental data on the number of fecal pellets. A total
   of 59 species of flowering plants were found. Based on the species
   composition and projective cover of species, the ecological regimes of
   ecotopes were identified by phytoindication. The correspondence analysis
   of the vegetation revealed two ordination axes. The ordination axis 1
   (CA1) was able to explain 11.3\% of community inertia, and the
   ordination axis 2 (CA2) was able to explain 5.2\% of community inertia.
   The maximum excretory activity of animals was recorded for the central
   part of the ordination space, indicating the presence of an optimum zone
   in the gradient of environmental factors that structure plant
   communities. The forward selection procedure allowed the Nutrients
   Availability variable to be selected as the most important variable to
   explain variation in the plant community structure. The number of deer
   fecal pellets exhibited different patterns of response in the Nutrients
   Availability gradient. The response within the plant class Festucetea
   vaginatae could best be explained by Model III from the list of
   HOF-models. The response of the excretory activity of deer within the
   class Festuco-Puccinellietea could best be fitted by the model IV, which
   represents a symmetric Gaussian curve. The response of excretory
   activity in the Robinietea vegetation class was asymmetrical bimodal.
   The ecological properties of the red deer ecological niche in both the
   drier and less mineralized part of the range of ecological conditions
   and the wetter and more mineralized part should be assessed in the
   context of the prospects for future studies.},

Title = {Variability of the structure of winter microbial communities in
   Chelyabinsk lakes},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {311-318},
Abstract = {Microorganisms form complex and dynamic communities that play a key role
   in the biogeochemical cycles of lakes. A high level of urbanization is
   currently a serious threat to bacterial communities and the ecosystem of
   freshwater bodies. To assess the contribution of anthropogenic load to
   variations in the structure of winter microbial communities in lakes,
   microorganisms of four water bodies of Chelyabinsk region were studied
   for the first time. We used cultural, chromatography-mass spectrometric,
   and modern methods of statistical data processing (particularly,
   multivariate exploratory analysis and canonical analysis of
   correspondences). The research showed that the composition of winter
   microbial communities in lakes Chebarkul', Smolino, Pervoye, and
   Shershenevskoye Reservoir did not differ significantly between the main
   phyla of microorganisms. The dominant microorganisms were found to be of
   the Firmicutes phylum and Actinobacteria phylum. The structure of
   bacterial communities had special features depending on the
   characteristics of the water body and the sampling depths. Thus, in the
   lakes Smolino, Pervoye, and Shershenevskoye Reservoir, an important role
   was played by associations between microorganisms - indicators of fecal
   contamination: coliform bacteria and Enterococcus. On the contrary, in
   Chebarkul' Lake, members of the genus Bacillus, which are natural
   bioremediators, formed stable winter associations. However, the
   differences between water bodies and sampling depths reflected 28.1\%
   and 9.8\% of the variability of the winter microbial communities,
   respectively. The largest contribution (about 60\%) to the variability
   of the structure was made by intra-water processes, which determined the
   high heterogeneity of samples from different water areas. We assume that
   an important role in this variability was played by the high
   anthropogenic impact in a large industrial metropolis. In our opinion,
   this line of research is very promising for addressing key environmental
   issues.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Essential oils are secondary plant metabolites and have many therapeutic
   properties. The aim of our study is to determine the antibacterial
   effect of the essential oils of two plants cultivated in a semi-arid
   region located in the Northeast of Algeria (Tebessa), Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis (Myrtaceae) and Artemisia herba alba (Asteraceae). The
   yield of essential oils of the two plants were 1.45 +/- 0.026 and 1.21
   +/- 0.061 g/100 g of the dry matter of the aerial part respectively. The
   test of the antibacterial effect is based on the diffusion method on
   solid medium (sensitivity), this method allows us to determine the
   susceptibility or resistance of an organism vis-a-vis the sample
   studied. Our study reveals that E. camaldulensis essential oil had very
   strong activity on all bacterial strains tested, except on Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis for which there was no inhibitory
   effect. However, A. herba alba essential oil had very strong activity on
   all bacterial strains tested except on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC
   of Artemisia essential oil ranged between 0.08 and 1.57 mu L/mL, with
   the lowest activity for S. aureus and P. mirabilis (1.57 mu L/mL) and
   the highest activity was observed against E. feacalis, E. coli, and K.
   pneumonia (0.09 mu L/mL). The MIC of the second plant EO ranged between
   0.08 and 0.36 mu L/mL, with the lowest activity for P. mirabilis (0.36
   mu L/mL) and the highest one was observed against S. saprophyticus and
   E. coli (0.08 mu L/mL). Statistical analysis shows that the two plants
   have the same efficacy against S. saprophyticus while E. faecalis, K.
   pneumoniae and P. mirabilis species are affected more by the essential
   oil of A. herba alba. While, E. camaldulensis has a higher efficiency
   than that of A. herba alba on the species: S. aureus and E. coli.
   Therefore, the essential oils of E. camaldulensis and A. herba alba
   suggests avenues for further non clinical and clinical studies.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Study and analysis of hydrophilic flora diversity are important parts of
   environmental research due to various functions of vascular macrophytes
   in freshwater ecosystems, which deteriorate under the influence of
   anthropogenic activity and climate change. The aim of this study is to
   analyze the hydrophilic flora diversity (taxa, biology, ecology, and
   conservation status of species) and current population trends in the
   Sluch River basin, the largest tributary of the Horyn River (the Pripyat
   River basin), within the Polissya Lowland in the northern-west region of
   Ukraine. The list of hydrophilic flora is based on materials of the
   authors' field researches in 2014-2020 within the upper and middle parts
   of the river basin, herbarium materials, and archive data. The study
   shows that the natural flora consists at least of 105 species of
   vascular plants belonging to 66 genera, 36 families, and 22 orders.
   Structural analysis shows the predominance of a few families in the
   systematic structure of the flora (Cyperaceae, Potamogetonaceae,
   Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Plantaginaceae, and Typhaceae) and genera
   (Potamogeton, Carex); the dominant categories are hemicryptophytes and
   geophytes, entomophiles and anemophiles, heliophytes and
   hygrohelophytes. C- and S-strategists are dominant. This is the
   generally typical taxonomic and ecological structure of the hydrophilic
   flora of water bodies in the Pripyat River basin. The list of rare
   species includes 20 species from 15 genera and 12 families, for
   instance, species listed as vulnerable in The Red Book of Ukraine
   (Juncus bulbosus, Utricularia intermedia, Nymphoides peltata). Even rare
   and vulnerable species can form numerous populations in some localities,
   for example, Nymphoides peltata and Calla palustris. Five alien species
   were identified (Acorus calamus, Elodea canadensis, Zizania latifolia,
   Bidens frondosa, and Echinocystis lobata), some of which tend to expand
   and displace aboriginal species. In the future, it will be important to
   further study the structure and changes in the hydrophilic flora of the
   region under conditions of anthropogenic impact, to monitor the dynamics
   of populations of alien species, and to develop conservation measures
   for rare species and communities.},

Abstract = {Plants of the genus Chaenomeles Lindl. (Rosaceae) naturally grow in
   Southeast Asia and represent the richest resource of biologically active
   compounds with beneficial properties for humans. Plants of C. japonica
   (Thunb.) Lindl. and C. speciosa (Sweet) Nakai species, and interspecific
   hybrid C. x superba (Frahm) Rehder (C. japonica x C. speciosa, Superba
   group) have been successfully introduced in the steppe zone of Ukraine
   and bear fruits. In this study, we evaluated chemical composition of
   fruit cuticular waxes and antimicrobial activity of fruit extracts. The
   soluble waxes were characterized using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS), and 26-36 compounds, representing 91.7-96.6\% of
   the total soluble cuticular waxes, were identified. Waxes of Chaenomeles
   fruits belonged to six classes, namely fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes,
   esters, ethers and alkanes. Aldehydes 7-hexadecenal and heptacosanal,
   and alkanes hexatriacontane and tetrapentacontane were the main
   constituents in the soluble cuticular waxes of C. speciosa and C. x
   superba fruits, accounting for more than half of the total contents.
   However, alkane tetrapentacontane, alcohol 8,10-hexadecadien-1-ol and
   heptacosanal prevailed in C. japonica fruit waxes. Isopropanolic fruit
   extracts exhibited dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against four
   Gramnegative bacteria, five Gram-positive bacteria and one fungal strain
   in the disc diffusion assay. In general, extracts from the Chaenomeles
   fruits demonstrated higher activity against Gram+ bacteria than Gram-
   strains. The strongest inhibiting activity was shown against
   Staphylococcus epidermidis (by the fruit extracts of C. x superba and C.
   speciosa), Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Candida albicans (both by C. x
   superba fruit extract). Results of the study confirmed accumulation of
   the bioactive compounds in the fruit waxes of different Chaenomeles
   species and antimicrobial ability of Chaenomeles fruits as well. These
   findings revealed the bioactive compounds in fruit cuticular waxes and
   suggested health-promoting properties of introduced Chaenomeles species.},

Abstract = {This work is the first attempt to make up an inventory of the fauna of
   rove beetles in the Hutsulshchyna National Natural Park (Ukraine,
   Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast), which was created in 2002 and has an area of
   32,271 hectares. The modern territory of the park has never been the
   object of special scientific research on the fauna of rove beetles of
   the Aleocharinae subfamily. As a result, information about the finds of
   representatives of the Aleocharinae subfamily has been obtained from the
   study of the largest collection of rove beetles in Ukraine, which
   contains both modern collections and collections of the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries. The collection was formed by Marian-Aloiz
   Lomnitski and was further developed and replenished with collections
   from different parts of Ukraine and the world by several generations of
   Ukrainian and European entomologists. For the moment, the collection is
   kept in the funds of the State Museum of Natural History of the National
   Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and contains more than 1,500 specimens,
   which belong to more than 300 species and are of great historical and
   scientific value. As a result of the conducted studies, 30 species
   belonging to 18 genera are reported for the first time for the fauna of
   the Hutsulshchyna National Nature Park, of which 4 species (Atheta
   corvina (Thomson, 1856), Schistoglossa viduata (Erichson, 1837), Leptusa
   puellaris puellaris (C. Hampe, 1863), Silusa rubra (Erichson, 1839)) are
   reported for the first time for the territory of Ukraine. The species
   and specimens (with references, data of their distribution in Europe, as
   well as substrate and biotope preferences of adults) are listed. The
   obtained data will later on provide an opportunity to expand the
   understanding of the distribution of species - specifically for faunal
   research, as well as for biogeographic modelling.},

Abstract = {The subgenus Boophthora is a typical Palearctic taxon, which includes
   only 6 species, among them. Simonton etythrocephahon has a
   transpaleamtic distribution. In Europe, Adler notes only the species S.
   erythrocephalum, and Yankovsky - two species S. (Boophthora)
   erythrocephalum and S. (Boophthora) chelevini. According to
   morphological characteristics, these species differ in their life
   stages. We have studied the development of S. elythrocephahon and S.
   chelevini from three rivers of Volyn region, Ukraine (Styr, Chomoguzka,
   Putylivka) from 2017 to 2019. We used the EPPO PM7 / 129 standard.
   Collected samples, 615-bp fragments of the COI gene were sequenced from
   five individuals of S. elythrocephalum and five individuals of S.
   chelevini and compared with four samples of S. elythrocephahon from the
   GenBank. We obtained the nucleotide sequence of S. chelevini. All of the
   S. erythrocephalum samples from Ukraine had 692 bases, the S.
   elythrocephahon samples from Armenia had 673 bases. S. elythrocephahon
   and S. chelevini did not have any intraspecific variations. These
   intraspecific variations were not larger than the interspecific
   variations. It has been proved that the populations of S.
   erythrocephalum and S. chelevini from medium and small rivers of Volyn
   do not differ in biological, behavioural and genetic characteristics.
   Comparison of S. elythrocephahon and S. chekvini life stages showed
   clear differences in 20 morphological features, which are probably
   manifestations of phenotypic variability. Comparison of species with
   data from the GenBank from Spain and Armenia on the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene confirmed the opinion that S.
   erythrocephalum and S. chekvini are one species. On the phylogenetic
   tree, the data are not grouped, there is no clear separation of the
   clades. Bootstrap values are 95-100\%, which may indicate a significant
   similarity of all studied samples and the lack of isolation of
   individual morphotypes from Volyn, Spain and Armenia. To finally confirm
   the taxonomic position ofthese two species, additional research is
   needed covering more individuals from different parts of Europe and
   analysis of more genes.},

Abstract = {Biological pollution of natural phytocenoses by adventive plant species
   poses is a serious threat to endemic species and species with narrower
   ecological amplitude in ecosystems around the world. This study presents
   the results of a study of the composition and distribution of adventive
   plant species in natural, semi-natural and anthropogenic transformed
   phytocenoses of Volyn' Polissya, Ukraine. To clarify the effect of
   drainage melioration on non-native flora species distribution, a
   botanical study was carried out during the 2003-2019 vegetation seasons
   on the territory of four drainage systems. The adventive flora of this
   unique region of Europe was studied in detail for the first time. In
   total, 279 non-native plant species were found. They belong to 110
   genera and 32 families. The results of studying the systematic,
   bioecological, range-distributional and phytogenetic structure of
   adventive species found within agricultural lands and adjacent
   territories are presented. It was found that 161 species are associated
   with agricultural production. Of these, 90 species were found directly
   within the agricultural land, another 71 species were found growing in
   the adjacent territories. It was found that a significant increase in
   the number of adventive species on the territory of Volyn' Polissya is
   associated with drainage melioration carried out in the 1960-1990s,
   significant changes in the structure and forms of agro-industrial
   production, and climatic changes in recent decades. The expansion of
   agricultural land in this area over the past 50-60 years has led to an
   increase in the number of adventive species by more than 60\%. On the
   territory of drainage systems used for agricultural activities, more
   than 40\% of the total species composition of the adventive flora of
   Volyn' Polissya is represented. The majority of these species originate
   from arid and sub arid regions of the planet. The transformer plants,
   Solidago canadensis L. and Phalacroloma annuum (L.) Dumort pose a
   potential threat to phytocenoses of the described region, as well as the
   whole of Europe. Of particular interest are the species that in the
   future may pose a serious threat to natural phyto-diversity and have
   negative practical consequences for the structure of agricultural
   landscapes. These are Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. and Heracleum
   sosnowskyi Manden. In general, modern agro ecosystems are characterized
   by instability and low ability to resist non-native species. The
   strongly weedy character of cultivated fields and the presence of
   abandoned uncultivated lands have caused the rapid spread of adventive
   vegetation. In order to further optimize the structure of
   agrolandscapes, it is advisable to monitor and regulate not only
   expansionary invasive species, which is especially important for
   preventing biological pollution, but also species whose status has not
   yet been determined.},

Abstract = {Soil microorganisms are an important component of agrocenoses, which due
   to physiological and genetic features respond quickly to changes in the
   quality of the soil environment. Each plant in the rhizosphere forms a
   specific composition of the microflora which depends on the phase of
   plant development and soil-climatic conditions. The objective of our
   study was the quantitative composition of ecological and trophic groups
   of rhizosphere soil micromycetes of different crops in chernozem soils
   in the Left-Bank Forest Steppe of Ukraine. According to the results of
   research, it was determined that the rhizosphere soil under different
   crops - winter wheat, rye and oats in Chernihiv region - is
   characterized by the largest number of pedotrophic micromycetes. This
   indicates that the soil contains a sufficient amount of organic matter.
   The rhizosphere soils under winter wheat and spring barley in Kiev
   region were characterized by a larger number of pathogenic micromycetes
   and amylolytic and cellulolytic ecological-trophic groups. This
   indicates the intensive use of plant protection products. The
   rhizosphere soil under onions in experimental fields in Kharkiv region
   was characterized by a high number of the cellulolytic group. This
   indicates the presence of cellulose-destroying microorganisms. According
   to the results of statistical analysis, it was found that the number of
   micromycetes in the rhizosphere soil of the studied varieties of crops
   was in direct correlation with the value of the hydrothermal coefficient
   (HTC) in the vegetation period. Weather conditions during the research
   vegetation period differed by agrometeorological indicators. The
   characteristic feature was a contrast of differences in air temperature
   and unequal distribution of rainfall, which affected the composition of
   the soil mycobiocenosis. The vegetation period of 2021 in Kyiv region
   was characterized by a sufficiently moist hydrothermal coefficient which
   increased to 1.81 while in Chernihiv, Kharkiv regions drought prevailed,
   but in some months the HTC increased to 1.32-1.54. It has been shown
   that the higher the HTC, the greater the number of micromycetes in all
   study regions.},

Title = {Ecological assemblages of corticulous myxomycetes in forest communities
   of the North-East Ukraine},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {94-101},
Abstract = {Corticulous myxomycetes remain one of the least surveyed ecological
   groups of terrestrial protists. These organisms develop on the bark of
   trees, mostly feeding on bacteria and microalgae. Their microscopic size
   and fast developmental cycle (3-5 days) complicate the study of these
   organisms, and therefore data their on ecological relationships and
   patterns of biodiversity corticulous myxomycetes remain controversial.
   On the territory of the southwest spurs of the Central Russian Upland
   (Northeast Ukraine), no special studies on these organisms have been
   conducted. During 2017-2020, in nine forest sites located in this
   territory, we collected samples of bark of 16 species of tree plants, on
   which sporulating myxomycetes were then identified using the moist
   chamber technique in laboratory conditions. A total of 434 moist
   chambers was prepared, and 267 (61.5\%) of which were found to contain
   myxomycete fruiting bodies. In total, we made 535 observations, finding
   20,211 sporocarps. As a result, in the surveyed territory, we found 38
   species of corticulous myxomycetes, belonging to 18 genera, 10 families,
   7 orders, and 2 subclasses of Myxomycetes. Among the species of
   corticulous myxomycetes, the most abundant were Echinostelium minutum,
   Arcyria pomiformis, Macbrideola cornea, Perichaena chrysosperma, Licea
   kleistobolus, Paradiacheopsis fimbriata, Cribraria violacea, Enerthenema
   papillatum, A. cinerea, and L. operculata. The greatest species richness
   in the examined biota was observed for genera Comatricha, Licea,
   Paradiacheopsis and Perichaena, families Amaurochaetaceae and
   Trichiaceae, orders Stemonitidales, Trichiales and Physarales. By
   species diversity, dark-spored myxomycetes (Collumellomycetidae)
   somewhat exceeded bright-spored myxomycetes (Lucisporomycetidae).
   Badhamia versicolor, Didymium dubium, D. sturgisii, Macbrideola
   decapillata, and Perichaena luteola are new species for the surveyed
   area. Four species of myxomycetes were collected in Ukraine for the
   first time: Hemitrichia pardina, Licea floriformis, L. pygmea, and
   Macbrideola argentea. Quantitative and qualitative structure of
   myxomycete consortia developing on different species of
   substrate-forming plants demonstrated significant differences. The
   highest level of similarity was demonstrated by Fraxinus excelsior and
   Acer platanoides, and a relatively strong relationship was seen between
   Pinus sylvestris and Tilia cordata. The central cluster comprised F.
   excelsior, A. platanoides and P. sylvestris. By the sum of values of
   Bray-Curtis coefficient, Quercus robur appeared to be most distinctive
   plant species by quantitative composition of myxomycete consortia. F.
   excelsior and T. cordata are the most favourable for the development of
   corticulous myxomycetes. In all the analyzed consortia, the dominant
   species belonged to the Stemonitidales and Trichiales orders, while the
   remaining orders were represented by notably fewer species. Relative
   species richness of Stemonitidales was the highest in consortia of P.
   sylvestris, the contribution of Liceales was the greatest in A.
   platanoides and P. sylvestris, the percentage of Echinosteliales and
   Physarales was the highest on F. excelsior, the share of Cribrariales
   was especially large on A. platanoides. Trichiales were represented on
   all the analyzed substrates to almost the same extent. Representatives
   of Cribrariales and Physarales were completely absent on P. sylvestris,
   the species of Clastodermatales - on all species of plants, except Q.
   robur.
   Prevalence of bright-spored myxomycetes was determined for consortia of
   Acer platanoides, the dominance of dark-spored myxomycetes - for F.
   excelsior, P. sylvestris and Q. robur. The obtained data indicate the
   presence of stable complexes of corticulous myxomycetes, associated with
   different species of trees in the forest ecosystems of Northeast
   Ukraine. This encourages further study of the structure of myxomycete
   consortia with tree species that were not included in this study and
   determining the influence of physical-chemical properties of the bark of
   different plant species on the discovered peculiarities of myxomycete
   communities.},

Title = {A systematic review of flukes (Trematoda) of domestic goose (Anser anser
   dom.)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {294-302},
Abstract = {Trematodes are one of the most numerous and widespread groups of
   parasitic invertebrates among helminths, characterized by a complex life
   cycle. As the final host, digenetic flukes parasitize vertebrates,
   including domestic waterfowl. Infection of hosts with parasitic
   digenetic worms causes huge economic damage to poultry. But trematode
   fauna of domestic geese are presented mainly only for individual
   regions. Despite the fact that there is already a systematic review of
   tapeworms and acanthocephala of domestic birds - geese and ducks, there
   are, unfortunately, no review articles on the taxonomy of digenetic
   flukes for geese (Anser anser dom.). Taking into account the relevance
   of the topic, based on our own and extensive literature data, we set the
   task to determine the general species composition of digenetic flukes
   (Trematoda), parasitizing in domestic geese which have been recorded in
   the world until 2020. Each Trematoda species is provided with the
   following data: scientific name, authority and year, first, second
   intermediate, auxiliary and final hosts, site in the host body,
   collecting localities and geographic distribution, and literature
   sources. Currently it is established that there are 149 species of
   helminths parasitising domestic geese. The taxonomic composition of the
   class Trematoda registered in domestic geese consists of 2 classes, 14
   families, 30 genera and 65 species. Of all the species of trematodes
   parasitizing in domestic geese, 44 species have been recorded in Europe,
   26 species in Asia, 6 species in North America, 1 species in South
   America, 1 species in Africa and 2 species in Oceania. Three species are
   registered in domestic geese (Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Echinostoma
   revolutum, Prosthogonimus ovatus) are cosmopolitan parasites. The
   biggest species diversity is characterized by the families
   Echinostomatidae (17 species) and Notocotylidae (12 species). There are
   11 species of digenetic flukes recorded in domestic geese Cyclocoelum
   mutabile, Echinostoma grande, E. paraulum, E. revolutum, E. robustum,
   Hypoderaeum conoideum, Paryphostomum novum, P. pentalobum, Catatropis
   verrucosa, Notocotylus attenuatus, N. parviovatus) on the territory of
   Azerbaijan. Four of them (Echinostoma revolutum, Hypoderaeum conoideum,
   Paryphostomum novum, Notocotylus attenuatus) were also noted in the
   course of our helminthological studies. The trematode Cyclocoelum
   mutabile was recorded in domestic ducks only in Azerbaijan. Most species
   of trematodes were found in the north-eastern part (total 9 species) and
   southern part (total 5 species) of Azerbaijan. This is due to the
   widespread distribution of molluscs - intermediate hosts of digenetic
   flukes, in these regions. Eighteen species of digenetic flukes
   parasitize both birds and mammals (Rodentia, Carnivora, Lagomorpha,
   Artiodactyla). And eleven species of trematodes are of medical
   importance, registered in humans.},

Abstract = {A distinctive feature of legumes is the ability to combine two most
   important processes: photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. However, the
   course of those processes, and therefore seed potential of those crops
   depend on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, the commonest being
   drought. Therefore, interest in physical-biochemical resistance of the
   plant organism to abiotic stress factors is increasing, as well as
   search for optimum ways to increase its adaptability. Success of
   adaptation of a plant's organism to unfavourable environmental factors
   is known to largely depend on optimal functioning of assimilative
   apparatus. Some indicators of the condition of the apparatus are the
   content and ratio of photosynthesis pigments. Therefore, we aimed at
   determining the reaction of the pigment complex of Glycine max (L.) Men.
   plants, grown against the background of optimal and insufficient
   watering, to inoculation of seeds with rhizobia bacteria Bradyrhizobium
   japonicum, cultivated using nanocarboxylates of chromium, cobalt, iron,
   copper and germanium. Research has shown that utilization of germanium
   nanocarboxylate as a component of inoculative suspension led to the
   highest content of chlorophylls in leaves of soybean of the studied
   variants in the blossoming phase during optimal watering, as well as
   significant increase in the content of carotenoids compared with the
   control plants regardless of the level of watering. At the same time,
   this element caused no significant effect on the chlorophyll content in
   plants grown in drought. It was confirmed that among soybean plants that
   were in stress conditions (blossoming phase) for two weeks, the highest
   content of chlorophylls was in leaves of plants grown from seeds
   inoculated with rhizobial suspension with addition of chromium and
   copper nanocarboxylates, which caused 25.3\% and 22.8\% increase in
   chlorophyll a, 29.4\% and 32.3\% in chlorophyll b and 26.4\%\% and
   23.8\% in them respectively, compared with the control. Furthermore,
   chromium and copper nanocarboxylates stimulated the content of
   carotenoids in the same plants, though it was less expressed than after
   adding germanium nanocarboxylate. The highest content of photosynthetic
   pigments in plants after the watering was resumed (phase of bean
   formation) was in cases of applying chromium and germanium
   nanocarboxylates. It was confirmed that the most efficient way to
   protect the pigment complex of soybean plants during drought was using
   chromium and germanium nanocarboxylates as components of inoculation
   suspension. The results we obtained indicate the possibility of applying
   chromium nanocarboxylate in the technology of cultivating soybean in the
   conditions of water deficiency as an effective way to improve
   biosynthesis of chlorophylls, as well as using germanium
   nanocarboxyllate as a component that provides a high level of activity
   of protective mechanisms of the pigment system of soybean, associated
   with resisting stress caused by water deficiency.},

Title = {Seasonal dynamics of Diptera in individual biotopes in the center of the

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {374-379},
Abstract = {In a changing climate, phenological observations are gaining new
   importance. They can tell what changes are taking place in certain
   environmental conditions. The studies were conducted in 2019 within the
   territory of the Republic of Mordovia (the center of the European part
   of Russia). Beer traps (beer as a bait) were used to collect Diptera.
   The material was collected in the period from April to October in
   different forest biotopes (pine forest, lime forest, aspen forest, birch
   forest and oak forest) and the air temperature was recorded at the same
   time. In total, more than 14.000 specimens of Diptera were recorded.
   Overall, 29 families were recorded. The largest number of families was
   observed for birch (23 families) and pine (24 families) forests, the
   smallest number - in aspen forest (16 families). The families Muscidae,
   Drosophilidae, Calliphoridae had the largest number of captured
   individuals (44.5\%, 35.2\%, 7.6\% of the total number of individuals
   respectively). The highest number of individuals was captured in oak
   forest. The dynamics of abundance in all biotopes were similar and were
   characterized by the same number of declines and rises. The first small
   significant peak in the number of Diptera occurred in the first half of
   summer. A slight increase in the number of specimen. occurred in
   mid-June. In the second half of September, there was a gradual increase
   in the number and the maximum peak was recorded in mid-October, then
   there was a decline. The autumn increase in the number of Diptera in all
   five biotopes exceeded the summer peak by several times. This dynamic
   was typical for most families. However, species from the family
   Lonchaeidae had the peak in July. For our better understanding of the
   changes in the seasonal dynamics of the number of Diptera, long-term
   observations in different climatic zones are needed.},

   For example, Asian countries are the largest producers of Alliwn

   indicator of changes in the environment - has been noted as useful in
   recording the age condition of plants. The study focused on the
   ontogenetic structure of five cenopopulations of A. pskemense, revealing
   that the examined cenopopulations growing in different
   ecological-coenotic environmental conditions are normal, and mainly
   incomplete, i.e. do not include all age groups. Their ontogenetic
   spectrum was left-sidod and only the coenotic populations 2, 4, 5
   coincided with the characteristic spectrum. Depending on
   ecological-phytocoenotic living conditions, density of individuals in
   the studied communities ranged 1.75 to 4.50 ind./m(2), whereas the
   ecological density was within 2.(1) to 5.29 ind./m(2). The research
   determined that the ontogenetic spectrum shifted to the centered type
   temporarily due to the uneven processes of the development Similarities
   of biological features (long mature generative condition, prevalence of
   mode of reproduction by seeds, low viability of young individuals) of

Abstract = {Biological systems are subject to a dramatic increase in invading
   species in the 21st century due to increasing globalization around the
   world. In the near future, these species will cause more extensive

   total loss, particularly degradation of natural habitats - especially
   Natura 200) habitats. This study aims to understand the processes of
   spread of invasive plant species, their way of life, adaptation to
   environmental changes and displacement of native species. Without the
   local level, it is not possible to understand these processes on the

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {345-353},
Abstract = {Fungi are the most active biodeteriorators of natural and man-made
   materials. The article presents generalizations of the studies
   (20012019) of communities of microscopic fungi within biofilms on
   various substrates: shells of live Mytilus (Mytilus galloprovincialis,
   670 specimens) and Ostreidae (Crassostrea gigas, 90 specimens),
   fragments of driftwood (over 7,000), stones (40), concrete of
   hydrotechnical constructions along the shoreline (80) and wood between
   concrete blocks in constructions on the shores (80). The studies were
   carried out in Odessa Oblast, the coastal zone of Sevastopol and open
   area of the Black Sea. There were identified 123 species of
   micromycetes, belonging to 65 genera, 33 families, 21 orders, 10
   classes, 4 divisions, 2 kingdoms: Fungi and Chromista (fungi-like
   organisms). The Chromista kingdom was represented by 1 species -
   Ostracoblabe implexa, on shells of C. gigas. The number of species of
   micromycetes on various substrates varied 23 (wood between concrete
   blocks of hydrotechnical constructions) to 74 (shells of M.
   galloprovincialis at the depths of 3 and 6 m). On all the substrates,
   the following species were found; Alternaria alternata, Botryotrichum
   murorum. The communities were found to contain pathogenic fungi
   Aspergillus fumigatus (shells of mollusks, stones, concrete), A. terreus
   (concrete), Fusarium oxysporum, Pseudallescheria boydii (shells of
   mollusks). The best representation was seen for the Pleosporales order -
   from 12.9\% (shells of M. galloprovincialis, 0.3 m depth) to 33.3\%
   (shells of C. gigas) of the species composition. Toxin-producing species
   of Microascales in mycological communities accounted for 1.6\%
   (driftwood) to 40.0\% (concrete), and were also observed on shells of
   Bivalvia - 11.1-32.3\%. Similarity of species composition of mycological
   communities according to Bray-Curtis coefficient varied 21.1\%
   (driftwood and concrete, 10 shared species) to 72.7\% (shells of M.
   galloprovincialis, the depths of 3 and 7 m and shells of C. gigas, 45
   shared species). Using graphs of indices of mean taxonomic distinctness
   (AvTD, Delta+) and variation (Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness index,
   VarTD, Delta+), we determined deviations of taxonomic structure of the
   studied mycological communities from the level of mean expected values,
   calculated based on the list of species, taking into account their
   systematic positions. The lowest values of index Delta+ were determined
   for communities on shells of M. galloprovincialis, 0.3 m depth,
   driftwood, stones and concrete. These communities had uneven
   distribution of species according to higher taxonomic ranks and minimum
   number of the highest taxa: 4-6 classes, 1-2 divisions, Fungi kingdom.
   Disproportion in species composition with decrease in the number of the
   highest taxa occurred in extreme environmental conditions. Using
   index.+, we found that the most complex taxonomic structure of fungi
   communities has developed on concrete and shells of C. gigas. In
   mycological communities on those substrates, the number of species was
   low (25 and 46), but they belonged to 4-7 classes, 2-3 divisions, 1-2
   kingdoms. To compare the structures of mycological communities that have
   developed in such substrates in biotopes sea, sea-land-air, land-air, we
   compiled a list of fungi based on the literature data, which, taking
   into account our data, comprised 445 species of 240 genera, 103
   families, 51 orders, 15 classes, 5 divisions, 2 kingdoms.
   The analysis revealed that on substrates with similar chemical
   composition, in all the biotopes, the species of the same divisions
   dominated (genus and family may vary). Therefore, in the biotope
   land-air - Hypocreales, Pleosporales, Eurotiales (genera Acremonium,
   Fusarium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium); sea - Pleosporales,
   Eurotiales, Microascales (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium,
   Corollospora); sea-land-air - Pleosporales, Microascales (Alternaria,
   Leptosphaeria, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Corollospora, Halosarpheia).
   Monitoring of species composition of myxomycetes is needed in farms that
   cultivate industrial objects, recreation sites, various buildings for
   prevention of mycotoxin intoxication and infestation by mycodermatoses
   and other diseases caused by opportunistic and pathogenic fungi.},

Title = {Prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths in ruminants in Ukraine: a
   5-year meta-analysis},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-257},
Abstract = {The production of environmentally friendly livestock products is
   currently receiving much attention, especially in the European Union.
   The problem of monitoring the quality and safety of meat and milk in
   modern conditions is relevant not only for Ukraine but also for the
   world community. The scientific substantiation of the methods of
   research on meat for sale subject to invasive diseases is especially
   important, as the product may pose risks to the consumer. One of the
   criteria for assessing the welfare of a herd is the prevalence of
   helminthiases in cattle. Ruminant parasitoses in Ukraine have always
   been and remain a separate, often significant, problem for veterinary
   specialists. Helminths have evolved to use a wide range of ecological
   niches. In this study, we tried to quantify the prevalence of
   helminthiases among ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) in Ukraine. The
   relevant studies were searched for in the online databases. The
   meta-analysis included 15 publications from January 2015 to December
   2020 which reported the spread of parasites in Ukraine. The research
   results show that the infestation of ruminants with gastrointestinal
   helminths on the territory of Ukraine is 56.7\%. Egger's regression test
   revealed no significant publication bias. During the period of pastured
   farming, stable parasitocenoses are formed in the body of ruminants. The
   parasitoses are caused by helminths (gastrointestinal strongyles, liver
   flukes, paramphistomas, dicrocelia). They are recorded in monoinvasions
   or mixed invasions. Ruminants, according to helminthological examination
   in different climatic zones, are constantly infested with trematodes. In
   Ukraine, the presence of three species of flukes has been confirmed in
   ruminants: Fasciola hepatica, Dicrocoelium dendriticum and
   Paramphistomum cervi. Parasitization by those species negatively affects
   the profitability of dairy farming. Trematodes cause significant
   economic losses: reduced milk productivity of cows, reduced live weight
   gain of young animals, negative impact on reproduction. At the same
   time, fascioliasis is socially significant and dangerous to humans.
   According to the analyzed literature sources, two types of cestodes have
   been registered in Ukraine: Moniezia benedeni and M. expansa. The
   epizootic situation regarding nematodes is just as fraught. That is the
   most numerous group of helminths, their fauna is represented by the
   following species: Strongyloides papillosus, Nematodirus spathiger,
   Bunostomum spp., Oesophagostomum radiatum, Haemonchus contortus,
   Toxocara vitulorum, Trichuris skrjabini, T. ovis and T. globulosa. It is
   proven that in cattle parasitocenoses are recorded more often than
   monoinvasions. The highest rates of prevalence of infection were
   observed when polyinvasion included gastrointestinal strongyles, namely
   from the order Strongylida. Strongyloides papillosus is the most common
   taxonomic representative, while Fasciola hepatica has the lowest
   prevalence of infection, especially in sheep. Updated data on
   helminthiasis will expand the screening strategy to maintain the health
   of farm ruminants and reduce economic losses.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {411-418},
Abstract = {The key to high productivity of plants, especially cereals, is to
   control lodging of cereals. Among the derivatives of acylcyclohexadiones
   (ACHD), highly effective retardants have been invented, which are widely
   used in modern crop production to control the lodging of cereals, mainly
   winter wheat, spring and winter wheat, winter, spring and hybrids of
   barley. The mechanisms of influence of ACHD derivatives -
   trinexapac-ethyl and prohexadione-Ca on plants and features of their
   application in technologies of cultivation of cultivated plants are
   considered. By using a composition of ACHD derivatives with a number of
   agrochemicals, enhancement of retardant activity is achieved. Given the
   identified varietal variability of the effectiveness of the use of ACHD
   derivatives in cereals, it is advisable to conduct registration and
   post-registration studies primarily on varieties that occupy the largest
   sown areas in the country. The peculiarities of ACHD derivatives'
   influence on stem components as the main one, along with the flag leaf,
   carbon pool for grain filling in the ear and possible reasons for the
   lack of productivity increase of grain crops due to ACHD derivatives are
   also considered. This class of substances continues to be widely studied
   in the world and remains among the most promising for the development of
   new agrochemicals and drugs.},

Title = {Depositing capacity of winter wheat stem segments under natural drought
   during grain filling in Ukrainian forest steppe conditions},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-172},
Abstract = {Drought is a major abiotic factor adversely affecting wheat
   productivity. Water deficit reduces significantly photosynthesis and
   hence the remobilization of stored assimilate reserves from the stem
   becomes important sources for grain filling We assessed the ability of
   different stem internodes and leaf sheaths to deposit and remobilize
   reserve assimilates as well as their role in grain yield formation in 6
   winter wheat varieties under drought conditions during the period of
   grain filling. The dry weight and content of water-soluble carbohydrates
   in the dry matter of stem internodes and leaf sheaths of the main shoot
   was determined at anthesis, the beginning of milk ripeness and full
   grain ripeness. The total amount of water-soluble carbohydrates in stem
   segments was calculated as the product of their specific content in the
   dry matter of the stem segment and its mass. The amount of remobilized
   dry matter and water-soluble carbohydrates for each segment was
   estimated as the difference between the appropriate values at anthesis
   or milk ripeness and full ripeness. The maximum accumulation of
   water-soluble carbohydrates in the stem was reached at early milk
   ripeness. The most productive varieties Kyivska 17 and Horodnytsia had
   the largest amount of remobilized water-soluble carbohydrates in all
   internodes. Depositing capacity of the second and third (counting from
   the top) internodes was higher compared to others and has a significant
   effect on the grain productivity of wheat varieties studied. Despite
   significant variability and strong genotype x year interaction of the
   relationships between depositing capacity traits of different stem
   segments and grain productivity, mainly tight correlations were found
   for dry matter and total water-soluble carbohydrates accumulation and
   remobilization in second and third internodes with yield and grain
   weight per spike. The obtained data suggests that the remobilization of
   deposited water-soluble carbohydrates is an important factor
   contributing to the filling of winter wheat grain in arid conditions and
   more detailed studies of relationships of depositing capacity of
   individual stem segments with yield can be useful for development of
   breeding tools for further genetic yield improvement.},

Title = {The longhorn beetles (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) of Ukraine: Results of
   two centuries of research},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-73},
Abstract = {The study of the longhorn beetles fauna in Ukraine has been going on for
   two centuries. During this time, huge collections of materials have been
   accumulated. These enabled a comprehensive view of the fauna of the
   longhorn beetles in Ukraine to be formed. However, despite this, the
   first complete list of the longhorn beetles of the fauna of Ukraine was
   compiled by Zahajkevych only in the late twentieth century. He listed
   275 species. Decades later, Bartenev supplemented Zahajkevych's list
   with five more species, suggesting that there are 280 species in
   Ukraine. In 2009, Bartenev expanded his previous list to 284 species.
   Recently, however, the fauna of the longhorn beetles in Ukraine has been
   fluctuating due to climate change. The southern species are actively
   expanding their range to the north, and seven new species of longhorn
   beetles have been identified in Ukraine over the past decade. In
   addition, the new synonymy is also the reason for changes in the list of
   the longhorn beetles in Ukraine. In particular, from Bartenev's latest
   list, I removed 14 synonymous species and 5 species that have never been
   registered in Ukraine. In total, the list of the longhorn beetles I have
   revised includes 279 species from 114 genera, 44 tribes and 6
   subfamilies. One of them, Batocera lineolata Chevrolat, 1852, is not
   naturalized in Ukraine and is known from the only record of a female
   reared from wooden packaging materials. The degree of study of the
   longhorn beetle fauna of the physiographic regions of Ukraine is rely
   uneven. The fauna of the western, northern, eastern and extreme southern
   regions of Ukraine is the most fully studied. At the same time, the
   fauna of the central regions of Ukraine is still very poorly known.
   Further research on the longhorn beetles in Ukraine should be conducted
   in two directions: 1) completing the lists for physiogiaphic regions and
   2) monitoring fauna changes under the influence of climate change.},

Abstract = {The distribution of virioplankton, abundance and production, frequency
   of visibly infected cells of heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic
   picocyanobacteria and their virus-induced mortality have been studied in
   mesotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs of the Upper and Middle Volga
   (Ivankovo, Uglich, Rybinsk, Gorky, Cheboksary, and Sheksna reservoirs).
   The abundance of planktonic viruses (VA) is on average by 4.6 +/- 1.2
   times greater than the abundance of bacterioplankton (BA). The
   distribution of VA in the Volga reservoirs was largely determined by the
   distribution of BA and heterotrophic bacterioplankton production (PB).
   There was a positive correlation between VA and BA and between VA and
   PB. In addition, BA and VA were both positively correlated with primary
   production of phytoplankton. Viral particles of 60 to 100 mu m in size
   dominated in the phytoplankton composition. A large number of bacteria
   and picocyanobacteria with viruses attached to the surface of their
   cells were found in the reservoirs. Viruses as the most numerous
   component of plankton make a significant contribution to the formation
   of the planktonic microbial community biomass. The number of phages
   inside infected cells of bacteria and picocyanobacteria reached 74.109
   phages/cell. Easily digestible organic matter, which entered the aquatic
   environment as a result of viral lysis of bacteria and
   picocyanobacteria, could be an additional source of carbon for living
   bacteria. The results of long-term studies indicate a significant role
   of viruses in functioning of planktonic microbial communities in the
   Volga reservoirs.},

Title = {Soluble curcumin ameliorates motility, adhesiveness and abrogate
   parthanatos in cadmium-exposed retinal pigment epithelial cells},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {235-243},
Abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential transition metal and one of the most
   toxic environmental pollutants. Industrial, agricultural and urban
   activities are the main sources of Cd environmental contamination.
   Multiple deleterious effects of Cd exposure were reported for different
   cell types and living organisms in a great number of research papers. Cd
   bioaccumulation hazard is mediated by the relatively long half-life of
   this metal in an organism. For example, in mammals its half-life lasts
   for about 10-30 years. Cd exposure affects many tissues. However, some
   of them, including the central nervous system and sensory organs, are
   most susceptible to its toxicity. The harmful effects of Cd could be
   linked to oxidative stress generation and consequently intracellular
   signalling disruption. Since Cd induces redox imbalance the antioxidants
   could be a prospective tool to ameliorate Cd cytotoxicity. In present
   work, we have studied the protective efficacy of soluble curcumin on
   Cd-caused retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells viability, reactive
   oxygen species production, adhesive and extracellular matrix proteins
   expression, cell migration and parthanatos level. Low dose (5 mu M) of
   soluble curcumin ameliorated all aforementioned indices of Cd-induced
   cytotoxicity. Curcumin has restored the RPE cells motility as well as
   fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. Therefore, the modulation of RPE
   adhesiveness could be regarded as a cytoprotective effect of curcumin.
   Furthermore, Cd-caused poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)
   suppression and cleaved PARP-1 upregulation were ameliorated by curcumin
   exposure. Therefore, the protective effect of soluble curcumin could be
   related, at least partially, to the modulation of PARP activity and
   inhibition of parthanatos flux. The observed results have demonstrated
   that low doses of soluble curcumin are a promising tool to protect RPE
   cells against Cd-caused retinal injury.},

Title = {Impact of lead on the amount of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the
   leaves of Triticum durum and T. aestivum, Hordeum vulgare and Avena
   sativa},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {207-210},
Abstract = {Lead is one of the most dangerous pollutants to both the environment and
   humans. It causes structural changes in photosynthetic apparatus and
   reduced biosynthesis of chlorophyll pigments inhibits carbon metabolism.
   The aim of our study was to determine the dynamics of photosynthetic
   pigments in leaves of wheat (Triticum durum and T. aestivum), barley
   (Hordeum vulgare) and oats (Avena sativa) at different lead acetate,
   Pb(CH3COO)(2) levels: 0, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.60 g/L. The results of this
   research indicate that these concentrations significantly affected
   chlorophyll content of H. vulgare and A. sativa as compared to T. durum
   and T. aestivum. Analysis of variance showed that lead concentration and
   interaction between cereal species had a significant effect on all
   chlorophyll characteristics at 0.1\% probability and on carotenoids
   contents at 1\% significance. Lead acetate in 0.3 and 0.6 g/L
   concentrations had a highly significant effect on chlorophyll a, b and
   carotenoids in H. vulgare seedlings, its carotenoid contents increased
   from 0.002 mg/g FW at 0 g/L to 0.107 mg/g FW at 0.6 g/L, whereas its
   chlorophyll content decreased under heavy metal stress, corresponding to
   the concentration of the metal ion. Carotenoids of A. sativa were not
   affected compared to Chl a and Chl b, while higher concentrations
   significantly increased chlorophyll contents of the seedlings from 1.384
   mg/g FW of total chlorophyll at 0 g/L to 1.883 mg/g FW at 0.6 g/L. The
   increased amount of carotenoids was indicative of the formation of free
   radicals in plants under heavy metal stress, while decreased levels of
   chlorophyll content were an indication of reduction in the growth of the
   plants leading to decrease in the yield. It is suggested that
   chlorophyll content can be adopted as a very useful in vivo indicator of
   heavy metal toxicity.},

Title = {Taxonomic and ecological composition of the native groupings of the
   birds of the dry steppe zone of Ukraine},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {225-234},
Abstract = {The classifications of the grouping of the birds reflect the faunistic
   or the ecological position of the species in certain habitats and
   landscapes. Most of them consider the species diversity of the birds of
   the studied regions in general, including synanthropic, invasive and
   widespread species. This approach prevents singling out the habitats
   which are important for supporting the existence of native (or
   autochtonous) species and their groupings. Native groupings of the birds
   in the dry steppe zone of Ukraine are almost not studied despite the
   rapid contraction in the range and population of most component species,
   especially Anthropoides virgo, Otis tarda, Tetrax tetrax and Burhinus
   oedicnemus. The definition of the taxonomic and the ecological
   composition of these grouping will help in understanding the strategy of
   the reproduction and the protection of native avifauna. In connection
   with this, the faunistic-topomorphic classification of native birds in
   the dry steppes zone of Ukraine according to the following scheme is
   proposed: ornithofaunistic complex (by priority landscapes and habitats)
   the place of the feeding (by priority substrate on/in which a species'
   diet is extracted) - the nesting place (by the priority substrate of the
   location of the nest for nesting individuals) - the place of rest (the
   priority substrate where non-nesting individuals rest). The
   classification is aimed at the definition of the general requirements of
   native birds and their groupings in terms of the landscapes and the
   habitats which provide the conditions for their preservation and the
   protection in the researched region. It has been determined that in the
   south of Ukraine 33 nesting species are dry-steppe autochthons (18.3\%
   of nesting species of the region), of which 18 species form the
   ornithofaunistic complex of dry steppes (Buteo rufinus, Perdix perdix,
   Anthropoides virgo, Otis tarda, Tetrax tetrax, Burhinus oedicnemus,
   Glareola nordmanni, Galerida cristata, Calandrella cinerea, C.
   rufescens, Melanocorypha calandra, Anthus campestris, Motacilla feldegg,
   Saxicola rubetra, S. torquata, Oenanthe oenanthe, Oe. isabellina,
   Emberiza melanocephala), and 15 species form the complex of the sea
   coast (Phalacrocora. aristotelis, Phoenicopterus roseus, Tadorna
   ferruginea, T. tadorna, Mergus serrator, Charadrius alexandrinus,
   Recurvirostra avosetta, Larus ichthyaetus, L. melanocephalus, L. genei,
   L. cachinnans, L. michahellis, Gelochelidon nilotica, Hydroprogne
   caspia, Thalasseus sandvicensis). The above-mentioned species are mainly
   xerophiles (54.6\% of species) and hygrophils (24.2\% of species), and
   they are in the most threatened position because they feed, nest and
   rest mainly or exclusively on the soil surface. According to the
   proposed classification, native birds of dry steppes require: for
   xerophiles - areas of soil without vegetation or with rarefied low
   grass, which does not prevent birds from moving freely, searching and
   obtaining food, leading their chicks, looking over their territories;
   for hygrophiles - shallow water bodies with islands, surface vegetation,
   shallows, adjacent meadows and salt-marshes; for dendrophiles - single
   shrubs and trees or small groves; for most xerophiles and dendrophiles -
   fresh or slightly saline water bodies for drinking. Unfortunately, in
   the protected natural territories of the researched region, most native
   birds do not have this combination of the above-mentioned habitats,
   which are simultaneously suitable for feeding, nesting and resting.},

Abstract = {Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are one of the major biological components in
   all kinds of aquatic ecosystems both in freshwater and marine ones. The
   nature reserve fund of Ukraine includes 52 national parks, in the vast
   majority of which Bacillariophyta have not been studied. This
   investigation presents first data on the diatoms in Yavorivsky National
   Park located in Lviv region. The material consists of the epiphytic
   samples of microalgae that were collected from different substrates in
   aquatic ecosystems of the Yavorivsky National Park in 2014. In the
   hydrotopes of the park 180 diatom species from 56 genera were found,

   and Sellaphora bacilloides (Hustedt) Levkov, Krstic \& Nakov also were
   new findings in the country from the Broadleaf Forest Zone of Ukraine.
   Many species rare in the world flora and in Ukraine were found. A new
   diatom species.aloneis albus-columba Bukhtiyarova, sp. nov., was
   described from the pond in stationary recreation area Kozulka. This new
   species possesses strongly three-undulate valves with three rhombic
   segments, which in morphology is most similar to Caloneis lamella
   Zakrzewski, however it differs from it by having rhombic distal valve
   segments instead of oval ones as well as noticeably smaller width of the
   central valve segment. The morphology of other similar species is
   discussed. For proper description of the new species new definitions for
   the raphe system morphology were grounded on functional morphology of
   the diatom frustule. New combinations Iconella alaskaensis (Foged)
   Bukhtiyarova, comb. et stat. nov., Iconella baltica (Schumann)

Abstract = {The ground vegetation layer is the most diverse plant community in
   forest ecosystems. We have shown the role of spatial variables, soil
   properties and overstorey structure in spatial variation of the
   herb-layer community in a riparian mixed forest. The research was
   conducted in the ``Dnipro-Orils'kiy{''} Nature Reserve (Ukraine). The
   research polygon was located in the forest in the floodplain of the
   River Protich, which is a left tributary of the River Dnipro. Plant
   abundance was quantified by measuring cover within an experimental
   polygon. The experimental polygon consisted of 7 transects, each
   comprising 15 test points. The distance between the rows in the site was
   3 m. At the site we established a plot of 45 x 21 m, with 105 subplots
   of 3 x 3 m organized in a regular grid. A list of vascular plant species
   was composed for each 3 x 3 m subplot along with visual estimates of
   species cover projection. The plant community was represented by 43
   species, of which 18.6\% were phanerophytes, 39.5\% were
   hemicryptophytes, 9.3\% were therophytes, 7.0\% were geophytes. An
   overall test of random labelling revealed the total nonrandom
   distribution of the tree stems within the site. The species-specific
   test of random labelling showed the nonrandom segregated distribution of
   Acer tataricum, Pyrus communis, Quercus robur, and Ulmus laevis.
   Crataegus monogyna and Euonymus europaeus were distributed randomly. The
   nearest neighbour of Acer tataricum was less likely to be Ulmus laevis.
   There was no direct spatial connection between Acer tataricum and other
   trees. Crataegus monogyna, Pyrus communis, Quercus robur and Euonymus
   europaeus were not segregated from all other species. The nearest
   neighbour of Ulmus laevis was less likely to be Acer tataricum.
   Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied as ordination
   approach. The forward selection procedure allowed us to select 6 soil
   variables which explain 28.3\% of the herb-layer community variability.
   The list of the important soil variables includes soil mechanical
   impedance (at the depth 0-5, 30-35, 75-80, and 95-10 cm), soil moisture,
   and soil bulk density. The variation explained by pure spatial variables
   accounted for 11.0 \%. The majority of the tree-distance structured
   variation in plant community composition was broad-scaled. The spatial
   scalograms were left-skewed asymmetric. Significant relationship was
   found between the pure spatial component of the community variation and
   a number of phytoindicator estimations, most important of which were the
   variability of damping and humidity. Tree stand was obseerved to be a
   considerable factor structuring both the herb-layer community and
   spatial variation of the physical properties of soil.},

Abstract = {Findings of naked amoebae in various habitats of Ukraine and other
   territories are presented. Saccamoeba sp., Thecamoeba similis (Greeff,
   1891) Lepsi, 1960, Vexillifera bacillipedes Page, 1969, Vannella lata
   Page, 1988, Acanthamoeba sp., Willaertia magna De Jonckheere, Dive,
   Pussard \& Vickerman, 1984 were identified based on morphological data
   and molecular genetic research methods. All these species of amoebae are
   characterized according to our own observations and measurements and the
   published data. The amoebae we found belong to three classes (Tubulinea,
   Discosea, Heterolobosea), six orders (Euamoebida, Thecamoebida,
   Dactylopodida, Vannellida, Centramoebida, Schizopyrenida), six families
   (Hartmannellidae, Thecamoebidae, Vexilliferidae, Vannellidae,
   Acanthamoebidae, Vahlkampfiidae) and six genera
   (Saccainoeba,Thecamoeba,Vexillifera,Vainella,Acanthamoeba,Willaertia). W
   magna was the least common in water bodies of different regions of
   Ukraine; Saccamoeba sp., V bacillipedes in the studied water bodies are
   either uncommon species or occupy the middle position in terms of
   frequency of occurrence In the water bodies of Ukraine T similis, V
   lata, Acanthamoeba sp. are both the least common and the most common
   species, or occupy the middle position in terms of frequency of
   occurrence. The following ecological groups of naked amoebae have been
   identified in relation to temperature: eurythermal, psychrophilic
   stenothermal, thermophilic stenothermal. In relation to the
   concentration of dissolved oxygen in water: euryoxidic and stenooxidic.
   Three species of amoebae can withstand either a wide range of values of
   organic substances dissolved in water, or belong to stenobiont species.
   The recorded amoebae belong to monotactic (Saccamoeba sp.), striate (T.
   dactylopodial (V. bacillipedes), fan-shaped (V. lata), acanthopodial
   (Acanthamoeba sp.) and emptive (W. magna) morphotypes.},

Title = {Morphogenesis, pigment content, phytohormones and yield of tomatoes
   under the action of gibberellin and tebuconazole},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-156},
Abstract = {One of the main tasks of contemporary plant physiology is regulation of
   growth and development of cultivated plants in order to optimize the
   productive process. The scientific community focuses its attention on
   the use of natural activators and growth inhibitors. We investigated the
   effect of foliar treatment with 0.005\% solution of gibberellic acid and
   0.025\% solution of the anti-gibberellic preparation tebuconazole on
   morphogenesis, leaf mesostructure, content of photosynthetic pigments,
   balance of endogenous phytobrybrides and lymphocyte B and productivity
   of tomatoes. The vegetation experiment was carried out in the conditions
   of soil-sand culture in vessels with a 10-liter volume. The treatment
   was carried out in the budding phase. Morphometric parameters were
   measured every 10 days. The mesostructure of the middle tier leaves was
   studied in the fruit formation phase, and the chlorophyll content was
   determined in the raw material by spectrophotometric method. Analytical
   determination of endogenous phytohormones - indolyl-3-acetic (IAA),
   gibberellic acid and abscisic (ABA) acids and cytokinins - zeatin (Z),
   zeatin-O-glucoside (ZG), zeatinribozide (Znila) and isopentenyladenosine
   (iPA) was performed by high performance liquid chromatography - mass
   spectrometry (HPLC-MS). With gibberellic acid treatment plant height
   increased significantly, while with tebuconazole it decreased.
   Gibberellic acid increased the number of leaves per plant, and
   tebuconazole did not change it The preparations increased the number of
   leaf blades per leaf the total number of leaf blades per plant, the
   weight of the raw material of leaves, the area of leaf blades and the
   area of the leaves at the end of the study period. The dry matter weight
   of stems and roots under the action of gibberellic acid increased, and
   during the treatment of tebuconazole decreased. Gibberellic acid
   increased the dry matter of the whole plant, and tebuconazole did not
   change it. Under the action of tebuconazole the content of chlorophyll
   in the leaves increased, while under the action of gibberellic acid it
   decreased. Both regulators increased the volume of columnar parenchyma
   cells. Gibberellic acid increased the size of spongy parenchyma cells,
   while tebuconazole did not change them. It is revealed that the action
   of exogenous gibberellic acid in stems and leaves increased the content
   of endogenous IAA and gibberellic acid, and tebuconazole decreased their
   content. The ABA content in stems and leaves increased with tebuconazole
   treatments and decreased with exogenous gibberellic acid. The total
   cytokinin content in the leaves was higher than in the stems in both the
   control and the experiment samples. Growth regulators induced an
   increase in the cytokinin pool in leaves and a decrease in stems.
   Gibberellic acid increased the content of all five forms of cytokinins
   in the leaves, and tebuconazole increased only two isoforms. In the
   stems under the action of both growth regulators the content of Z
   decreased and iP increased. The content of ZR and iPA in stems increased
   after the application of the retardant and decreased under the action of
   growth stimulant.
   The ZG content exceeded the control after gibberellic acid treatment and
   was in trace concentrations under the action of tebuconazole. Growth
   regulators optimized the productivity of tomato plants: under the action
   of gibberellic acid there was a considerable increase in the number of
   fruits per plant, and after the use of tebuconazole the average weight
   of one fruit significantly increased. The obtained results demonstrated
   that anatomical-morphological and structural-firectional rearrangements
   in tomato plants under the action of exogenous gibberellic acid and
   tebuconazole occurred against the background of changes in the balance
   and distribution of endogenous hormones. Increased photosynthetic
   activity, stimulation of growth processes of some plant organs and
   inhibition of others increased the biological crop capacity.},

Title = {The phenomenon of the shrinking size of bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in
   an anthropogenic environment (experience of 50 years of observations)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-216},
Abstract = {Fifty years of continuous monitoring of the bank vole population (Myodes
   glareolus Schreber, 1780) revealed the phenomenon of shrinking body size
   of individuals, manifesting in significant reduction in their regular
   size and mass parameters. Field observations were carried out in the
   Kaniv Nature Reserve (Cherkasy region, Ukraine) during the first half of
   summer every year. In the forest biotopes of the reserve, this species
   is dominant in the group of rodents. The research period covered various
   stages of the existence of the protected ecosystem. Its small area,
   location ina densely populated region of Ukraine and interaction with
   neighboring territories which are involved in economic activities have
   always caused anthropogenic pressure on the protected area. Its nature
   and intensity determined the changes in the protection regime and the
   loss of reserve status in 1951-1968. Later, the territory of the reserve
   experienced increasing technogenic pressure accompanied by radioactive
   contamination. In this work, to compare their characteristics, four
   complete cycles of the density dynamics of the bank vole population
   (from depression to depression) were selected, the duration of which was
   4-5 years. The first three cycles correspond to qualitatively different
   periods in the existence of the ecosystem and the population of the
   studied species, and the last one corresponds to the relatively current
   situation. Over the recent 30 years, the size and mass parameters of
   individuals of bank voles have decreased, - this phenomenon was called
   shrinking. The process was also observed to tend towards consistent
   increase in scale. Differentiated analysis shows that in different sex
   and functional groups of animals, the decrease in exterior parameters
   can reach 30.3\%. Shrinking is especially notable in the group of adult
   females that are actively involved in reproduction (compared to the
   second cycle, considered as the control, the decrease in parameters
   among these is 33.2\%). Juveniles of this sex lost 31.8\% of their
   fatness. Besides, in the population of voles, the proportion of
   large-size individuals was significantly reduced. The group of animals
   that overwintered significantly reduced its representation, and its
   existing representatives had much smaller exterior parameters. The
   studies found that the shrinking process is stable over time, which does
   not allow it to be considered a random phenomenon or an artifact of
   research. This phenomenon has no correlation with the amount or
   availability of food. It occurs against the background of numerous
   changes in various aspects of population dynamics, which gives grounds
   to associate it with anthropogenic changes in the environment. Shrinking
   is believed to be realized through various mechanisms. Firstly, as a
   result of mortality, the largest individuals and reproducing females
   with the greatest energy needs disappear from the population, and
   secondly, the growth and weight gain of young animals is slower. As a
   result, decrease in the size and mass parameters of individuals reduces
   their specific energy needs and allows the population to bring their
   requirements in correspondance with the capability of the environment to
   support a certain number of resource consumers. An analogy was drawn
   with the Dehnel's phenomenon, described for shrews of the Sorex genus,
   whose body size and weight decrease is an element of preparation for
   experiencing adverse winter conditions.
   Based on similar concepts, the shrinking of its elements can be
   considered as a specific population strategy to maintain the ecological
   balance.},

Title = {The biology of Simulium noelleri and Simulium dolini: morphological,

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {180-184},
Abstract = {Molecular genetic research has revolutionized the taxonomy and
   systematics of the Simuliidae family. Simulium noelleri Friederichs,
   1920 is a species of blackfly, common in the Holarctic, reported for 33
   countries. In 1954, Topchiev recorded it in Ukraine for the first time.
   Simulium dolini Usova et Sukhomlin, 1989 has been recorded at the
   borders of Ukraine and Belarus. It was described for the first time by
   Usova and Sukhomlin in 1989 from the collection from the territory of
   Volyn region in 1985. Usova and Sukhomlin, Yankovsky, Adler state that
   S. noelleri and S. dolini are different species by the morphological
   characteristics that differ in all phases of development. Adults differ
   in the structure of the genital appendages, palps, the margin and shape
   of the face and forehead, the colour of the legs; the larva - in the
   pattern on the frontal capsule, the number of rays in the fans,
   mandibular teeth and the hypostoma, the structure of the hind organ of
   attachment; pupae - in the branching way of gills. Molecular data are
   becoming an increasingly important tool in insect taxonomy. Therefore,
   we had to check that these two closely related species also have genetic
   difference. The development of S. noelleri and S. dolini was studied in
   four small rivers of Volyn region, Ukraine (Chornohuzka, Konopelka,
   Putylivka, Omelyanivka) in the period from 2017 to 2019. During initial
   processing of insect samples, we used the standard protocols EPPO
   PM7/129. We obtained the nucleotide sequence of S. dolini. It was proved
   that the populations of S. noelleri and S. dolini from medium and small
   rivers of Volyn differ in biological, morphological, behavioural and
   genetic characteristics. Comparison of the species S. noelleri with the
   data of the GenBank confirms the identification of three distinct
   morphotypes from Volyn, Great Britain and Canada. As a result of the
   conducted researches, it was confirmed that two close species of S.
   dolini and S. noelleri from the noelleri species group differ in the
   structure of mitochondrial DNA, which confirms their independent
   taxonomic status. Additional studies comprising more individuals from
   larger areas of Europe are required to verify the taxonomic position of
   these two species.},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {357-363},
Abstract = {Successions in old fields were studied on the example of the Starobilski
   steppes within Luhansk Oblast (Ukraine), region located in the basin of
   the left tributaries of the Siversky Donets, in the southern spurs of
   the Central Russian Upland. Stationary surveys were conducted in the
   Striltsivsky Steppe affiliate of the Luhansk Nature Reserve, with 269 ha
   of old fields (26\% of the area) in its territory. Geobotanical releves
   were performed in 26 plots of abandoned fields, constant monitoring
   surveys were carried out in 15-27 year-old abandoned fields in the
   territory of the Reserve and 5-15 year-old abandoned fields in the
   territory of its buffer zone. In total, the itinerary and detailed
   surveys were conducted for about 50 plots of abandoned fields. The
   restoration of the steppe communities was seen only in the plots where
   grazing and/or mowing took place, which prevented the formation of dense
   litter and distribution of woody species. The long domination of rhizome
   grasses (Elytrigia repens) were characteristic in conditions of
   moderate-level disturbance (in the reserve), transition to the
   domination of bunchgrasses (Festuca valesiaca) was seen at the age of
   around 25 years, during the transitional period (20-25 years)
   communities with unstable structure formed, comprising E. repens, F.
   valesiaca and forbs (Achillea pannonica and Fragaria viridis). Duration
   of the stage of segetal and ruderal species in the sites under low
   effect was 10 years, the communities of unstable structure formed at the
   age of 5-10 years. In the conditions of stable moderate and high effect
   of grazing (high disturbance), we observed formation of bunchgrass
   communities at the age of 15 years. In the unused plots, we saw
   formation of phytocoenoses of shrubs at different stages of succession,
   starting from 10 years. The most abundant group of such kind comprised
   thickets of Ulmus pumila (with E. repens and Poa angustifolia in the
   herbaceous layer) and Prunus stepposa. The peculiarity of contemporary
   processes in the abandoned fields related to exacerbation of the
   vegetation's anthropogenic transformation is distribution of alien tree
   species from plantations, the most aggressive of which are Ulmus pumila,
   Fraxinus lanceolata, Acer negundo, Elaeagnus angustifolia. The
   peculiarity of the succession processes in the region of studies was the

Abstract = {At present, climate change significantly affects living organisms on the
   planet, leading to transformations in their niches, ranges and
   abundance. The aim of our work was to forecast the range of the
   representative of the large family Carabidae, famous for its indicative
   characters, richness and importance in soil communities. We used 19
   bioclimatic variables of Bioclim according to our own data and the data
   of GBIF with the help of the MaxEnt program. We used 550 coordinates of
   ground beetle Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger, 1798) records. We
   distinguished the potential range the species studied and drew
   prognostic maps of the species distribution related to climate change
   according to four scenarios. Mean annual temperatures and the mean
   temperature in the warmest and the coldest quarters of the year were the
   major factors affecting spatial distribution of P. melanarius.
   Visualization of potential range according to RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP
   6.0 scenarios predicted range reduction by 2050 but its recovery by
   2070. According to RCP 8.5 scenario, the range of the species studied
   will be significantly transformed: by 2070 the range will shift towards
   the north-west in the continental European states but to the northeast -
   in the coastal states. By 2070 almost all southern territories of Europe
   will become unsuitable for P. melanarius survival. The most visible
   changes will be the shift in range to the north in the eastern part of
   the European plain. The comfort conditions for P. melanarius decrease in
   mountain regions including the Alps, Carpathians, Caucasus and Urals. By
   2070, the cenotic optimum significantly decreases on the Balkan
   Peninsula. Thus, a sharp reduction in Southern European and
   Mediterranean populations is predicted.},

Title = {Features of Trifolium rubens (Leguminosae) ontomorphogenesis in
   conditions of Ukraine},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {244-250},
Abstract = {The necessary basis for studying the structure and dynamics of
   populations is an investigation of ontomophogenetic peculiarities and
   establishment of ontogenetic stages of individuals. Information about
   ontomorphogenesis is especially important for protected species of
   plants. The minimal amount of data on morphology of plants in the
   different periods of ontogenesis complicates plant identification and
   evaluation of population state conditions in nature and culture.
   Trifolium rubens L. is a perennial Central European plant listed in the
   Red Book of Ukraine as a rare species. The objective of this research is
   to analyze the peculiarities of ontomorphogenesis of T. rubens, to
   establish diagnostic signs of age stages and the sequence of their
   passage for identification of the multivariance of development. The
   results of the study on T. rubens ontomorphogeny at the M. M. Gryshko
   National Botanical Garden.f the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine
   and in the natural population in Zakarpattya are represented in this
   article. The terms ``age stage{''} and ``age period{''} are used to
   describe the degree of ontogenetic development of individuals.
   Diagnostic features of the age periods: latent, pregenerative,
   generative and senile are established. Detailed morphological
   descriptions of plants in different stages of ontogenesis are presented.
   The study shows a multivariate development that reveals different
   sequences of passing ontogenesis stages by individuals and, accordingly,
   the rate of their aging and life expectancy. It was found that during
   the first year of vegetation the plants undergo two periods (latent and
   pregenerative) and 5 stages of ontogeny (latent, seedlings, juvenile,
   immature and virginile). The first bloom in plants appears mainly in the
   second year of vegetation. The research showed the change of the leaf
   blade shape in ontogeny from simple to compound. There is a difference
   in the pubescence of leaf parts, and leaf shape indicates that these
   features are age-old. It was concluded that the aboveground part of the
   immature, virginile, generative individuals during the flowering period
   of plants differ from subsenile and senile in shape and number of
   leaves. In the generative period of ontogeny in dense plantings or in
   the natural population, it is difficult to reliably determine the
   boundaries of an individual by the aboveground part. The correlation
   between vegetative shoots of different type and generative shoots in the
   individual or group of plants can be used as an indicator to estimate
   the ontogenetic status of a particular locus or population. Successful
   growth of T. rubens in culture outside the natural range indicates good
   prospects for its ex situ protection and the implementation of measures
   for repatriation and restoration of populations in nature. The data of
   the research may be used for evaluation of the age structure of T.
   rubens populations.},

Title = {Breeding of black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus in muddy sites of a

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {286-293},
Abstract = {A stable group of birds has been formed at water treatment facilities.
   Sewage treatment sites are a well-known nesting place for long-legged
   waders. Black-winged stilts are included in the Bonn (Appendix II) and
   Berne (Appendix II) conventions, the AEWA agreement. Listed in the Red
   Book of Ukraine (1994, 2009) (status - vulnerable). In Ukraine, it is
   under protection on the territory of the natural reserve fund. The
   arrival of black-winged stilts waders at the nesting sites was recorded
   in the second-third decade of April (April 23, 2020; April 17, 2021).
   Immediately after returning to the nesting areas, the birds begin to
   build nests and lay eggs. The first eggs in this population were seen on
   01.05.2020, 07.05.2021. The process of laying eggs lasted until the end
   of the first decade of July (08.07.2020). The average clutch size in the
   nests of Himantopus himantopus decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 (2020) to 3.5
   +/- 0.1 (2021). The average egg sizes and their limits have been
   determined for long-legged waders. The chicks hatched from late May
   (30.05.2020), throughout June to the first decade of July (02.07.2020).
   The chicks were able to fly in a month - 29.06.2020. The muddy site of
   the wastewater treatment ponds of Kharkiv supported Black-winged Stilts
   until early August. Later, the birds started post-breeding movements.
   The last adults with juvenile birds were observed on 13.08.2020. Stilts
   in some years may stay until early October. The reproductive success of
   the black-winged stilt increased from 35.6\% (2020) to 38.8\% (2021). On
   average, 1.3 +/- 0.2 (2020) and 1.4 +/- 0.3 (2021) chicks fledged from
   the nests. In 2021, the number of nesting stilts increased, which is
   apparently due to rainy weather at the beginning of the reproductive
   period. For the purpose of more effective protection, the nesting
   settlements of the stilt should be protected and the appearance of
   people in the nesting places should be prohibited.},

Title = {Summer coastal rookeries and perspectives of the Baikal seal (Pusa

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {387-392},
Abstract = {Based on the secondary literature, a retrospective characterization of
   the climate in the Baikal region, starting from the end of the
   Pleistocene, is given. According to satellite monitoring data, the
   characteristics of the ice regime of the Lake Baikal in the conditions
   of climate warming are presented. Moreover, we briefly discuss the
   impact of climate change on the ecology and biology of the Baikal seal
   (Pusa sibirica Gm.). Using video materials obtained online at one of the
   main island coastal rookeries of seals (on the island of Tonkyi, the
   archipelago of the Ushkany Islands, Lake Baikal) in 2011-2017, the
   dependence of the number of seals hauled out on the lake level and the
   peculiarities of the fishing regime was determined (the survey was
   conducted from May-June to October). A direct relationship was
   determined between the relative number of animals that had a moulting
   delay and the ice regime of a given year: the longer the floating ice in
   the northern part of Lake Baikal remained, the more numerous were the
   first approaches of seals to the studied rookery and the greater was the
   proportion of moulting individuals. It is reasonable to assume that the
   main reason for the Baikal seal to come ashore is not prolongued
   moulting time, but a physiological need for sunlight, which has a
   healing effect on the body of animals that lack solar radiation in
   winter. In general, climate warming has a negative impact on the state
   of the Baikal seal population. The available paleoclimatic
   reconstructions of the Holocene indicate that the population of the
   Baikal seal has experienced a lot of climate changes in its history.
   Nevertheless, if the current trends of climatic changes persist until
   the end of the 21st century, the ecology and biology of the seal will
   drastically change (up to the beginning of terrestrial reproduction),
   and the population will significantly decrease. However, the Baikal seal
   as a species would remain.},

Title = {Biodiversity of Sciaridae (Diptera) in Ukraine},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {12-21},
Abstract = {Sciarids (Diptera, Sciaridae) or black fungus gnats are small, mainly
   dark coloured insects whose larvae usually develop in rotting plant
   remains permeated by fungal hyphae. Typical habitats for sciarids are
   shaded forests and wet meadows, but some species can migrate from
   natural biotopes to anthropogenic ecosystems and live as synanthropes.
   We have investigated ecological and chorological features of sciarids in
   Ukraine since 2012. Within this work, we collected imagoes during
   expeditions and excursions in different biotopes using the Malaise trap,
   by the method of sweeping and with exhauster directly from substrate.
   Collected imagoes were placed into 5 mL vials with 70\% ethanol. In the
   lab fixed material was dehydrated in absolute ethanol and mounted on the
   slides in Euparal. Previous registrations are based on 6 field
   collections, two of them were carried out in the XIX century, 4
   observations of ``army worms{''} and two pest records. From published
   material of these collections 78 sciarid species were known from 17
   genera in 8 more or less specified localities of Ukraine. Our sciarid
   study in the country expanded the data on registered sciarids by adding
   18 new species and enriched information about the distribution of
   sciarids by 86 new findings of previously known species in 12 regions
   (Volyn, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytsk, Kyiv,
   Lviv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne and Ternopil) of Ukraine. The current
   checklist of Sciaridae of Ukraine contains 96 species from 17 genera in
   168 localities. Through comparison with Germany, whose sciarid fauna is
   studied much better, for Ukraine we can predict the presence
   approximately 400 sciarid species, so the species diversity of Sciaridae
   in Ukraine still poorly known for the known species does not exceed 25
   percent of presumed existing species here. The majority of sciarid
   findings are registered in different types of broadleaf forest biotopes,
   only a few species have been found also in grassland habitats. Some
   sciarid species show synanthropic attraction and have been registered in
   anthropogenic habitats, for example Bradysia fenestralis (pest of
   cultivated plants in greenhouses), Corynoptera dentiforceps,
   Scatopsciara atomaria and Corynoptera tridentata. Larvae of Bradysia
   placida develop in rotten wood, also development of Corynoptera
   membranigera preimaginal phases possibly takes place in the fruit bodies
   of fungi (Neoboletus luridiformis, Russula sp.) and Mycetozoa (Fuligo
   septica).},

Abstract = {One of the main tasks of ecological parasitology at the present stage is
   to establish patterns of spread of invasive diseases of animals in the
   environment through a thorough epidemiological examination, as well as
   to determine the main directions and factors of spread of parasites in
   Ukraine. Among the many pathogens, endoparasites play a major role in a
   number of diseases in rabbits with increased morbidity and mortality. In
   the body of both wild and domestic rabbits several species of parasites
   that form a parasitocenosis can be localized. The latter have a
   pathogenic effect on organs and tissues, leading to reduced weight gain,
   premature slaughter and even mortality. The prevalence of
   endoparasitoses was studied in weaned rabbits 60 days of age, 120 days
   of age at fattening, 180 days of age - mating age and adults of 320 days
   of age to determine the extensiveness and intensity of the dominant
   invasion. A total of 720 head was studied, 180 animals from each age
   group. Three species of nematodes were recorded in the rabbits:
   Trichostrongylus retortaeformis (Zeder, 1800), Nematodirus leporis
   (Ransom, 1907) and Passalurus ambiguus (Rudolphi, 1819); the cestode
   Taenia pisiformis (Bloch, 1780); three species of Emeria: Eimeria
   stiedae (Lindermann, 1865), which parasitizes in the bile ducts of the
   liver and gallbladder, E. magna (Perard, 1925) and E. media (Kessel,
   1929) - in the epithelial cells of the intestine. The prevalence of the
   infestation depends on the age of the animals. According to the data
   obtained, eimeriosis was one of the main parasitic diseases of the
   rabbits. Dominant invasions of Eimeria in the intestines of 60-day-old
   rabbits were found in the studied animals, their extensiveness reached
   19.4\%, while the spread of hepatic Eimeria was registered in 13.3\% of
   the examined rabbits. The total infestation of weaned rabbits with
   helminths was 22.2\%, in rabbits for fattening - 26.7\%, and in rabbits
   of mating age and adults - 20.0\% and 20.6\%, respectively. Global
   climate change will change the distribution and dynamics of soil-borne
   helminthiases, but host immunity may also affect host-parasite
   interactions. Subsequent studies will be aimed at elucidating the effect
   of mono and mixed invasions on the body of rabbits. Updated data on
   helminthiasis will expand the screening strategy to maintain rabbit
   health and reduce economic losses.},

Abstract = {One of the most important livestock industries in the world is poultry
   breeding, which meets human needs for high-quality protein products
   (poultry meat, eggs) and is characterized by rapid return on investment.
   Bacterial infectious diseases of pout Ely are a major problem for the
   poultry industry and its strategic future. Given the relevance of
   bacterial diseases of poultry in the world and in Ukraine in particular,
   the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of the spread of these
   diseases in Ukraine for the period 2012-2020 by analyzing and
   systematizing the results of bacteriological investigations. In order to
   analyze the spread of bacterial diseases of poultry in terms of regions
   in Ukraine, we analyzed data on 20 diseases of poultry, namely:
   hemophilosis, infectious enterotoxemia, yersiniosis, campylobacteriosis,
   colibacteriosis, coligranulomatosis, klebsiella, listeriosis,
   mycoplasmosis, neisseriosis, pasteurellosis, pathogenic proteus,
   pneumococcosis, pseudomonosis, pullorosis, erysipelas septicemia,
   salmonellosis, staphylococcosis, streptococcosis and tuberculosis.
   According to the results of research, it is found that bacterial
   diseases of poultry are significantly common in Ukraine, the average
   infection of poultry with bacterial diseases for the period from 2012 to
   2020 was 0.8\%. The leading role in the etiological structure of
   pathogens of bacterial diseases of poultry was played by colibacillosis
   - 56.9\% of the total number of all positive samples. Also, the dominant
   bacterial diseases of poultry in Ukraine during the analyzed period are:
   salmonellosis (13.5\%), staphylococcosis (7.8\%), pasteurellosis
   (7.0\%), pseudomonosis (6.8\%), pullorosis (3.6\%) and streptococcus
   (2.6\%). Significantly fewer positive samples were registered in the
   bacteriological investigations of other diseases: pneumococcosis 0.5\%,
   tuberculosis 0.4\%, infectious enterotoxemia 0.3\%, pathogenic proteus
   02\%, erysipelas septicemia 0.1\%, klebsiellosis 0.1\%, listeriosis
   0.1\%, neisseriosis 0.08\%, coligranulomatosis 0.05\% and hemophilosis
   0.02\%. According to the results of bacteriological research of poultry
   for such diseases as yersiniosis, campylobacteriosis and mycoplasmosis -
   no positive test was found for the entire analyzed period. According to
   the results of ecological and geographical analysis, the heterogeneity
   of the nosological profile of bacterial diseases of poultry in different
   regions of Ukraine was established.},

Title = {Polyphyly of the genus Stenurella (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae): Consensus
   of morphological and molecular data},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {119-136},
Abstract = {Stenurella genus is represented by nine small-sized and widely
   distributed Palaearctic species. Representatives of the genus play a key
   role in the pollination of wild angiosperms, accelerate the detritus
   cycle and make a significant contribution to the forest food web. A
   number of species with heterogeneous morphological features found within
   the single Stenurella genus indicate the need for revision of the
   taxonomy this genus. The previous attempt to resolve the intrageneric
   composition of Stenurella was rather artificial because it did not take
   into an account evolutionary relationships. In this study we tested the
   existing model of Stenurella intrageneric subdivision using both
   morphological and molecular approaches. Our results showed that the
   genus Stenurella is polyphyletic and consists of two unrelated clades.
   The first Glade comprises six species (S. jaegeri, S. novercalis, S.
   bifasciata, S. melanura, S. hybridula and S. approximans) and the second
   includes three species (S. septemptoctata, S. vaucheri and S. nigra).
   Moreover, we found that the second Glade is closely related to Rutpela
   due to both morphological and molecular phylogeny. Based on our
   findings, we revised the present structure of the genus Stenurella and
   transferred three species of the second Glade to the genus Rutpela,
   sensu novo. The genus Rutpela was redescribed in the light of our
   results. Furthemrore, we subdivided the genus Stenurella, sensu nov.
   into two subgenera, Stenurella, subgen. sensu nov. and Priscostenurella,
   subgen. sensu nov., respectively. Also, the genus Rutpela, sensu nov.
   was subdivided into four subgenera including Nigrastenurella, Rupela,
   Eduardvivesia, subgen. nov. and Nigromacularia, subgen. nov. The
   assessment of the place of Stenurella, sensu novo and Rutpela, sensu
   novo within Lepturini based on molecular phylogeny, showed that
   Stentaylla, sensu novo belongs to the Anoploderabranch and Rutpela,
   sensu novo nested within the Leptura-branch. These together with
   morphological features confirmed our idea of the evolutionary
   distinctiveness of Stenurella, sensu novo and Rutpela, sensu novo. We
   assumed that the general external morphological similarity of
   Stenurella, sensu novo and Rutpela, sensu novo was the result of
   convergent evolution, driven by mimetic selection toward imitation of
   ants or wasps. Finally, our study establishes a natural phylogenetic
   taxonomy of Stenurella.},

Abstract = {In modern animal husbandry of Ukraine, there are still some unresolved
   issues related to the high number of zoophilic flies in the territories
   of facilities and the spread of animal infectious and parasitic
   diseases. A detailed study of bioecological peculiarities of the
   dominant zoophilic fly species contributes to improving the
   effectiveness of measures to control ectoparasites. 27 zoophilic fly
   species have been found in animal breeding complexes. The maximum number
   of parasitic Diptera species was recorded on cattle-keeping premises.
   The biological properties of Neomyia cornicina (Fabricius, 1781) (size,
   shape, colour, duration of preimaginal phase development) were studied.
   Also, we studied the dynamics of the number and daily activity of
   dominant fly species (Musca domestica Linnaeus, 1758, M. autumnalis De
   Geer, 1776, Stomoxys calcitrans (Linnaeus, 1758)). When studying the
   intraspecies competition, a high-degree survival of M. domestica and M.
   autumnalis was determined in the conditions of critical nutritional
   deficiency (0.5 g of nutrient medium per larva) and increased density of
   individuals (the imago emergence was 38.6\% and 34.0\%, respectively).
   In similar maintenance conditions, the emergence of N. cornicina imago
   was low (14.6\%). With a twofold increase in the insectarium volume and
   in the amount of nutrient medium (1 g per larva), the imago emergence of
   M. domestica, M. autumnalis and N. cornicina increased to 64.0\%,
   39.2\%, and 24.0\%, respectively. With an even greater increase in the
   amount of nutrient medium (2 g per larva), the maximum emergence of
   imagoes of all the studied fly species was observed (M. domestica, M.
   autumnalis, and N. cornicina: 96.6\%, 91.2\% and 72.6\%, respectively).
   In the conditions of interspecific competition, M. autumnalis suppressed
   N. cornicina even in conditions of a sufficient amount of nutrient
   substrate. In the competition between M. domestica and M. autumnalis,
   house fly dominated. Increasing the nutrient medium volume narrowed the
   gap between the competing species.},

Title = {Change in the state of an exploited fish population: From individual
   indicators to integral assessment},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-410},
Abstract = {We adapted the approach used for the integral assessment of the status
   of ecosystems in order to assess population status. Classic theoretical
   concepts of fish population dynamics are the basis of this approach. The
   convolution of information about changes in several structural and
   functional characteristics into one integral index was performed using
   the analytical function of desirability. The index varied 0 to 1 and
   quantitatively characterizes the state of the population. This approach
   was tested on the example of the European grayling Thymallus thymallus
   (Linnaeus, 1758), inhabiting the Vym River (basin of the Northern Dvina
   River, North of the European part of Russia). The materials were
   collected during the environmental monitoring carried out by the
   Institute of Biology of Komi Science Centre of the Ural Branch of the
   Russian Academy of Sciences (IB FRC Komi SC UB RAS) in 2002, 2005-2019.
   The population parameters used in the calculations (relative abundance;
   average and maximum age of fish; the proportion of matured individuals
   in the 4+ age group; average specific growth rate of fish at the age of
   6+; body weight of fish in the age group 6+) were characterized on the
   basis of the control net catches. Compared with the period 2005-2006,
   the value of the integral index in 20152018 decreased by almost two
   times. This indicates deterioration in the condition of the grayling
   group in the study area. There were no serious disturbances in the fish
   habitat in this area. The main hydrochemical and hydrobiological
   indicators have not changed significantly. The main reason for the
   observed changes is likely the significant increase in the impact of
   recreational anglers. The proposed integral index may be useful both for
   assessing the state of fish populations and for developing measures for
   the rational management of fish stocks.},

Title = {An overview of helminths of the European fire-bellied toad Bombina
   bombina (Amphibia, Anura) in the Volga River Basin},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {407-414},
Abstract = {The helminthofauna of Bombina bombina (Linnaeus, 1761) has been studied
   to an unequal degree in different parts of the habitat. Thus, it has
   been studied in more detail in the west of its range (in the countries
   of central and eastern Europe) and in less detail in the center (in
   Belarus and Ukraine). There were few data on helminths of this host in
   the east of its range (in Russia). For the first time, an inventory of
   the helminthofauna in B. bombina was carried out for populations in the
   Volga River Basin. The results of our own research are presented and
   supplemented with information from other authors. We summarized
   scattered data on helminths from 390 specimens of amphibians collected
   over more than 40 years in the territory of five regions: Kaluga and
   Samara regions, the Republics of Mordovia, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan.
   The helminthofauna includes 21 species from three classes: Trematoda
   (15), Chromadorea (5) and Clitellata (1). For each species, we give the
   systematic position, localization, places of detection, geographical
   distribution and characteristics of the life cycle. The leech Helobdella
   stagnalis (Linnaeus, 1758) was first recorded in the European
   fire-bellied toad in Europe. Four species of trematodes are new to this
   amphibian species in Russia: Haematoloechus abbreviatus (Bychowsky,
   1932), Paralepoderma cloacicola (Luhe, 1909), larvae, Tylodelphys
   excavata (Rudolphi, 1803), larvae and Astiotrema monticelli (Stossich,
   1904), larvae. Another species of trematode - Strigea strigis (Schrank,
   1788), larvae - was first recorded in this host within the boundaries of
   the Volga Basin. A specific parasite is the trematode Haematoloechus
   abbreviatus (Bychowsky, 1932). The number and composition of the species
   of helminths of the European fire-bellied toad vary in different
   regions; the structure of the helminth fauna is generally stable and
   includes three groups of species: adult and larval stages of trematodes,
   adult nematodes-geohelminths. The results of the study create a database
   for further population studies and contribute to the development of
   ideas about the distribution and formation of the amphibian helminth
   fauna in Europe, Russia and the Volga Basin.},

Title = {Changes in the structure and dominance of the zooplankton community of
   the Kremenchuk Reservoir under the effect of climate changes},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},

Abstract = {Zooplankton plays an important role in aquatic food webs and changes in
   its abundance and diversity under changing climatic conditions can
   significantly affect the abundance and diversity of other aquatic
   organisms. The aim of the study was to assess quantitative and
   qualitative parameters of zooplankton development, dynamics of
   development of its dominant groups and the effect of water temperature.
   Species composition and abundance of zooplankton of the Kremenchuk
   Reservoir were studied in 2006, 2010-2012 and 2020 in relation to water
   temperature and pollution. Zooplankton species diversity fluctuated
   significantly over the years of the study. A total of 46 taxa were
   recorded in the reservoir during the study period. The number of
   recorded zooplankton taxa ranged 26 to 32 depending on the year. The
   most abundant zooplankters were Chydorus sphaericus, Copepoda nauplii,
   Brachionus diversicornis. The abundance of zooplankters in the reservoir
   during the study period ranged 23.10(3) to 256.10(3) ind./m(3), and
   biomass 0.14 to 0.89 g/m(3). A significant positive relationship was
   observed between the abundance of cladocerans, including some individual
   species (Ch. sphaericus and Ceriodaphnia sp.), and water temperature.
   Indicator species of water pollution in different years and in different
   parts of the Kremenchuk Reservoir differed significantly, which probably
   depended on the presence or absence (in a certain period of time) of
   polluting discharges. The total saprobity index in different years in
   different parts of the reservoir was in the range of 1.5-1.9. Structural
   indicators of zooplankton and its dominant complexes characterize the
   water in the Kremenchuk Reservoir as beta-mesosaprobic. It is probably
   too early to assess the impact of climate change zooplankton as these
   changes are still unstable and short in time, but it is necessary to
   constantly monitor the biota of aquatic ecosystems to further study and
   summarize the data, which could later allow an identification of such
   changes.},

Title = {Application of remote sensing data for monitoring eutrophication of
   floodplain water bodies},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-190},
Abstract = {The aim of this article was to investigate the influence of structural
   features of the floodplain water network on the spatial and temporal
   dynamics of chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of
   eutrophication. The research was conducted in the waters of the
   ``Dnipro-Orilskiy{''} Nature Reserve. The geographic information base
   with polygonal objects which represented water bodies of the reserve was
   created on the basis of detailed geographical maps and the high
   resolution space images. The water bodies were characterized using such
   parameters as the distance of the water body centroid from the nearest
   shore of the Dnipro River, the area of the water body, the order of the
   water body and the connectivity of the water body. Chlorophyll-a
   concentration was estimated based on the surface algal bloom index The
   information was obtained about 148 water bodies, 141 of which are water
   bodies in the floodplain of the Dnipro River. The area of floodplain
   water bodies within the reserve was 328 million m(2). The area of
   floodplain water bodies ranged from 300-232,500 m(2). Trophic State
   Index allows us to estimate the trophic level of Dnipro River waters as
   mesotrophic, water bodies of first and second order as eutrophic, and
   water bodies of third and fourth order as hypereutrophic. The dynamics
   of chlorophyll-a content in water followed the seasonal course of
   temperatures. The concentration was lowest in the cold period of the
   year and reached its maximum in the second half of summer. The autumn
   decrease occurred at the end of September. The seasonal course of air
   temperature was superimposed on the peculiarities of the temperature
   regime of a particular water body, which depended on its depth and flow
   rate. The time, water body area, distance from the Dnipro River channel,
   connectivity and order of water bodies were the statistically
   significant predictors of chlorophyll concentration in water and were
   able to explain 85\% of the variation of this indicator. The increase in
   chlorophyll-a concentration with increasing order of a water body is due
   to a decrease in the intensity of water exchange and a decrease in the
   depth of water bodies of higher order. An increase in the order of a
   water body is accompanied by a branching network of water bodies, the
   ability of water bodies to clear sediments decreases. Sediment
   accumulation leads to a decrease in their depth. Warming of shallow
   ponds and accumulation of organic matter in them are factors of
   intensive growth of blue-green algae. The evacuation of surplus organic
   matter, which results from mass vegetation development with excessive
   nutrient inputs, is a key driver of the eutrophic regime of water
   bodies. The increasing importance of regulatory processes develops in
   agreement with an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in a water
   body. The importance of the considered factors reaches the highest level
   in summer time, when simultaneous maximum warming of water bodies and
   minimum water level in them take place. Accordingly, the differences
   between deep and relatively cool water bodies and shallow water bodies
   that warm up quickly, which significantly stimulates the growth of
   organic mass, reach the greatest contrast.
   The spatial patterns of variation in chlorophylla concentration have a
   complex multiscale structure, indicating the multiple nature of the
   acting factors. The spatial variability was represented as a composition
   of broad-scale and medium-scale spatial processes. The broad-scale
   process is most dependent on connectivity, whereas for the medium-scale
   process the leading one is the effect of water body order.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {354-366},
Abstract = {Juncales is an order of vascular plants with cosmopolitan distribution.
   Two families of Juncales are present in flora of Ukraine: Juncaceae and
   Cyperaceae. Through 1985-2021, we conducted comprehensive revision of
   Juncales in Ukraine. The aim of this research was to compile a checklist
   of Juncales species in the flora of Ukraine. Our research is based on
   herbarium materials, literature data and field trips. We collected data
   in many herbariums of Ukraine and other countries. Our understanding of
   the taxa was further supplemented by field observations in mountainous
   (Carpathians and Crimea) and plain territories of Ukraine. Also, we
   collected information about Juncales species from numerous literature
   sources. For each taxon, we provided nomenclatural citation and basic
   synonyms. According to our data, the order Juncales in the flora of
   Ukraine contains 188 species, belonging to 19 genera. Lists of Juncales
   species can be found in many thorough publications. For a long time,
   Checklist of Mosyakin \& Fedoronchuk (1999) was the main list in the
   nomenclature of vascular plants in Ukraine. To date, many nomenclature
   and taxonomic changes have been accumulated. For example, we accept
   genera Schoenoplectiella and Oreojuncus here. Researchers have found
   many new species for the territory of Ukraine. This information can be
   found in numerous publications, but is fragmented. Therefore, we have
   compiled an updated summary of the Juncales species. In Ukrainian
   territory, Juncales species are considered both widespread and rare. We
   refer to the rarest species Carex alba, C. bicolor, C. bohemica, C.
   brunnescens, C. buxbaumii, C. depauperata, C. fuliginosa, C. globularis,

Abstract = {Contamination of soils with heavy metals leads to reduction of soil
   fertility, destruction of natural ecosystems and detrimental effects on
   the health of society by increasing content of metals in the food chains
   from microorganisms to plants, animals and humans. Bioremediation is one
   of the most promising and cost-effective methods of cleaning soils
   polluted with toxic metals. According to current researchers,
   microorganisms and plants have the genetic potential to remove toxic
   metals from contaminated sites. The method of thermodynamic prediction
   was used to theoretically substantiate the mechanisms of interaction of
   soil microorganisms and plants with heavy metals. According to the our
   prediction, exometabolite chelators of anaerobic microorganisms may
   increase the mobility of metals and thereby contribute to the active
   transport of metals and their accumulation in plants. Plants of
   Nicotiana tabacum L. of Djubek cultivar were used as plant material for
   the current investigation. The examined toxicants were heavy metals,
   namely cobalt (II), nickel (II), chromium (VI), copper (II) and cadmium
   (II). The aqueous solutions of metal salts were added to the boxes after
   two months of plants growing to the final super-high concentration - 500
   mg/kg of absolutely dry weight of soil. Quantitative assessments of
   copper and chromium-resistant microorganisms were made by cultivation on
   agar nutrient medium NA with a gradient of Cu(II) and Cr(VI). The
   concentration of metals in soil and plant material (leaves, stems and
   roots) was determined by atomic absorption method. The study revealed
   that heavy metals inhibited the growth of the examined tobacco plants.
   This was expressed by the necrosis of plant tissues and, ultimately,
   their complete death. Despite this, all investigated heavy metals were
   accumulated in plant tissues during 3-7 days before death of plants. The
   uptake of metals was observed in all parts of plants - leaves, stems and
   roots. The highest concentrations of Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), Cr(VI) were
   found in the leaves, Cu(II) - in the roots. The results show that the
   bioremoval efficiency of the investigated metals ranged 0.60-3.65\%.
   Given the super-high initial concentration of each of the metals (500
   mg/kg), the determined removal efficiency was also high. Cadmium was the
   most toxic to plants. Thus, the basic points of the thermodynamic
   prognosis of the possibility of accumulation of heavy metals by
   phytomicrobial consortium were experimentally confirmed on the example
   of N. tabacum plants and metal-resistant microorganisms. The study
   demonstrated that despite the high initial metals concentration, rate of
   damage and death of plants, metals are accumulated inplant tissues in
   extremely hight concentrations. Soil microorganisms were observed to
   have high adaptation potencial to Cu(II) and Cr(VI). In anaerobic
   conditions, microorganisms presumably mobilize heavy metals, which later
   are absorbed by plants. The obtained results are the basis for the
   development of environmental biotechnologies for cleaning contaminated
   soils from heavy metal compounds.},

Abstract = {The problem of criteria for distinguishing colonies from similar
   socio-demographic structures (mainly in terms of nesting density) is
   highly relevant and has remained in the focus of attention of
   ornithologists for a long time. The synchronization of reproduction in a
   colony is one of the criteria which require special development. Based
   on particular works (1972-2005), I present synchronization of the
   reproduction of gulls in colonies of different sizes. In contrast to
   previous studies, this paper uses a specially developed Index of
   Synchronization of Bird Breeding (I-sr) to study this phenomenon, making
   it relatively easy to determine its level. The index distinguishes
   between different species of birds of this group: 75.7\% (white-winged
   black tern) and 97.6\% (black-headed gull) of the total variability of
   synchronization of breeding birds in colonies. Frequent failure of
   nesting attempts often causes repeated (compensatory) reproduction,
   which in the case of a mass manifestation significantly reduces the
   synchronization of the nesting period in colonies and thus significantly
   reduces this indicator. It is proved that a higher synchronization of
   reproduction characterizes small colonies (up to 50 nests). In all
   species of gulls, the beginning of reproduction in different colonies
   differs in terms of the appearance of the first eggs by 1-10 days and at
   the beginning of mass egg-laying - by 1-18 days. To the same extent,
   they differ in the timing of the hatching of eggs. In small colonies,
   the total egglaying period is shorter by 34.9-49.7\% compared to larger
   colonies. My observations show that large colonies are formed by the
   nesting of several small colonies on one plot. This phenomenon is
   noticeable during periods of mass re-nesting of birds after a high loss
   of nests (up to 69.5\% or more) because of severe flooding. Differences
   in the breeding periods of colonies that differ in size appear when
   several small colonies with different breeding periods of birds are
   combined into one larger colony. This phenomenon is well detected in the
   formation of several sub-colonies and in the differences in the timing
   of reproduction of different parts of a large colony.},

Title = {Features of exogenous development of Trichuris globulosa (Nematoda,
   Trichuridae)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {337-342},
Abstract = {Parasitic nematodes of the genus Trichuris Roderer, 1761 are
   hematophagous helminths, capable of parasitizing many different hosts
   including humans. The domestic and wild ruminants are hosts of several
   Trichuris species, with Trichuris globulosa (Linstow, 1901) one of the
   most prevalent parasites found in cattle. The exogenous stages of the
   helminth's life cycle develop in the outer environment, and their
   activity and survival depend on the abiotic factors. Thus the aim of the
   work was to determine the influence of temperature on the rate and
   success of development of infectious eggs of T. globulosa in laboratory
   culture considering their morphological and metric changes. The results
   of experimental studies showed that the embryogenesis of T. globulosa
   eggs, cultured in laboratory conditions and obtained from gonads of
   female nematodes, occurs in six stages regardless of the temperature
   regime. At the same time, the rate of transition from one stage to
   another, the term for the formation of infectious eggs and their
   viability directly depends on the temperature of the external
   environment. At the optimal temperature for the development of T.
   globulosa eggs, 25 degrees C, 76.3\% of eggs reached the mobile larva
   stage. A decrease in temperature to 20 degrees C and an increase to 30
   degrees C led to an increase in the egg mortality of up to 26\% and
   32\%, respectively, and the viability of eggs decreased. Under such
   temperature conditions, 74\% and 68\% of eggs of Trichuris reached the
   mobile larva stage. With an increase in the culture temperature, the
   time of embryogenesis decreased and amounted to 56 days at 20 degrees C,
   48 days at 25 degrees C, and 32 days at 30 degrees C. Depending on the
   temperature regime, the zygote stage lasted from the release of eggs
   from the gonads of female nematodes to 12 days, the stage of blastomere
   formation from 4 to 12 days, the stage of the bean-shaped embryo from 8
   to 24 days, the stage of the tadpole embryo from 16 to 36 days, the
   stage of larval formation lasted from 16 to 48 days, the stage of mobile
   larva from days 20 to 56. The formation of the infectious T. globulosa
   egg from a noninfectious one is shown in an experiment to include the
   metric changes confirmed by metric indicators. Mature eggs with a mobile
   larva are shorter and wider, with shorter and narrower plugs and a
   thinner shell than eggs at the zygote stage. The obtained research
   results on the influence of temperature on the exogenous development of
   Trichuris globulosa will make it possible to predict the epizootic
   situation of trichurosis in animal husbandry, as well as take timely
   measures to arrest the embryonic stages of nematode development in the
   external environment.},

Abstract = {Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley, 1956) (Acari, Mesostigmata, I
   aelapidae) is a predatory soil mite massively produced in laboratories
   in many countries of the world. The existing spheres of S. scuritus
   application vary in many parameters, especially temperature and relative
   humidity. In this article, we analyzed temperature and humidity
   appropriate for fastest spread of soil predatory mite S. scuritus. Mites
   should be released to a new environment in such a way that they would
   distribute in a greenhouse, garden or field as fast as they can (i.e.
   providing maximum migration activity of S. scimitus), on the one hand,
   and provide maximum efficient control of number of target phytophage
   species (i.e. providing maximum trophic activity), on the other hand. In
   our experiment at 14 degrees C temperature, most specimens of S.
   scimitus did not leave the migratory circle for 10 seconds. In 15-19
   degrees C range, only 14.7\% of mites left the migratory elide, and
   their examined activity in 10 s was only 5-10 mm. In 20-24 degrees C
   range, 27.5\% of mites left the migratory elide, their migratory
   activity increased to 15-23 nun. In 25-33 degrees C range, the moving
   activity increased even more, the mites left the migratory circle at the
   first opportunity that had (some even jumped off the circle to the
   experimental field), 95.8\% of the mites left the elide in 10 s, their
   examined activity reached 25-60 nun in 10 seconds. Study of themro- and
   hygro-preferences for various groups of invertebrates helps to better
   describe their ecological niche in multidimensional space of ecologic

Title = {Asymmetric hybridization of roach Rutilus rutilus and common bream
   Abramis brama in controlled backcrosses: Genetic and morphological
   patterns},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {In most cases in natural environments, hybrids of roach Rutilus rutilus
   L. and bream Abramis brama L. possess mitochondrial DNA of bream.
   Presumably, the genetic basis for unidirectional hybridization of roach
   and bream is the high level of divergence in the genes of the
   mitochondrial electron transport chain (cytochrome b and cytochrome c
   oxidase subunits I, III). Disruption of the interaction of the products
   of these genes leads to nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility of alien
   genomes, what is shown in a decrease of viability and developmental
   abnormalities in hybrids. In the present work we studied the viability
   and morphology of hybrid underyearlings obtained by crossing of hybrid
   females of first generation (RA and AR) with males of roach R. rutilus
   and bream A. brama. The method of genotyping (ITS1 ribosomal DNA,
   cytochrome b mtDNA) and comparative analysis of the complex of 23
   plastic and meristic characteristics of backcrossed hybrids are used.
   All progenies showed an increase in morphological variability compared
   to parental species and F1 hybrids. In progenies with introgression of
   mtDNA, a violation of associations between traits and the formation of
   transgressive phenotypes that go beyond the parental populations were
   found. In RAA backcrosses (combining mtDNA of R. rutilus and nuclear
   genome of A. brama) a decrease in viability with impaired recovery of
   external traits of bream was found. Conversely, ARR backcrosses
   (combining mtDNA of A. brama and the nuclear genome of R. rutilus) have
   a high viability and completely restore the morphotype of roach, which
   indicates the stable development of hybrids when they include alien
   genetic material. The differences in viability and morphology between
   backcrossed hybrids with the mtDNA of R. rutilus and A. brama evidence
   varying degrees of nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility of the genomes of
   roach and bream. The complete interaction between mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA from different species (wild-type-like) happens in direction
   of introgression mtDNA of A. brama, the less polymorphic of the two
   parental genomes. In the direction of introgression of highly
   polymorphic mtDNA of R. rutilus the formation of a reproductive barrier
   occurs. Our results show that the main reason for the asymmetry of
   hybridization of R. rutilus and A. brama is unequal rates of
   mitochondrial evolution and the priority of the introgression of mtDNA
   belongs a species with a lower rate of changes in mtDNA.},

Abstract = {Morphometric data are widely used in biology to assess intraspecific and
   inter-population variability and for bioindication and environmental
   condition assessment. The following hypotheses have been experimentally
   tested in the paper: 1) the vegetation type affects the change in the
   shell shape of Chondrula tridens martynovi Gural-Sverlova \& Gural,
   2010; 2) the change in the shell shape of this species is influenced by
   the biotope moisture regime; 3) the shell shape changes depending on the
   anthropogenic load level. The material in the form of empty, fully
   formed Ch. tridens shells was collected in 2019 in the north-western
   Azov region within the basin of the Molochna River. The collection
   points were located in settlements and outside them and differed in
   vegetation, moisture regime and level of anthropogenic load. The
   vegetation has been expertly attributed to two alternative types:
   herbaceous vegetation and tree plantations. By moisture level, the
   locations have been assessed as xerophytic and mesoxerophytic. The
   anthropogenic load levels have been assessed as low, medium and high.
   The study revealed that the morphological characteristics of Ch. tridens
   demonstrate a significant component of variability, which is due to the
   shell size. The shell size depends on the anthropogenic impact level.
   Under conditions of high anthropogenic impact, the shell size increases.
   Mollusks from locations with low and medium anthropogenic impact levels
   did not differ in shell size. After extraction of the size component,
   morphological properties develop three main trends of variability. The
   mouth apparatus development of mollusks does not depend on the
   vegetation type, but depends on the biotope moisture level and the
   anthropogenic transformation level. The mollusk shell elongation was
   observed to have the opposite dynamics of the height parameters in
   relation to the width and depended on the level of anthropogenic load.
   Rearrangement in the mouth apparatus depended on the biotope moisture
   level and the anthropogenic load level. There were distinguished four
   clusters, the quantitative morphological features of which allowed us to
   identify them as morphotypes. Each location was characterized by a
   combination of different morphotypes, according to which the sampling
   points may be classified. Morphotype 1 corresponds to biotopes with low
   level of anthropogenic load, morphotype 4 corresponded to biotopes with
   high anthropogenic load. Morphotypes 2 and 3 corresponded to moderate
   level of anthropogenic load. Vegetation type is not an important factor
   in determining the morphotypic diversity of populations. Under
   xerophytic conditions, morphotypes 2 and 3 are more common, and under
   mesoxerophytic conditions, morphotypes 1 and 4 are more common. The
   range of molluscs in different habitats needs to be expanded in the
   future to clarify climatic and other patterns.},

Title = {Co-infection of Trichuris vulpis and Toxocara canis in different aged
   dogs: Influence on the haematological indices},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {129-134},
Abstract = {Trichuris vulpis and Toxocara canis are worldwide parasitic nematodes
   affecting dogs and mammals of the Canine family. Due to the special
   structure of the shells, the eggs of these geohelminths can maintain
   their viability in soil, sand, water and the environment for a long
   time. The study involved young (6-12 months old) and adult (1.5-8.0
   years old) dogs affected by co-infection of T. vulpis + T. canis; the
   control group consisted of dewormed healthy animals of the same age.
   Parasitological examination of dogs' faeces was performed using a
   ``Counting Chamber for Ovoscopic Researches{''}; morphological
   parameters, indicators of nutrient metabolism, mineral metabolism and
   activity of enzymatic systems were determined in blood and serum.
   According to the results of parasitological research on the dogs, it was
   found that young animals are more prone to toxocarosis, and adults -
   trichurosis. The co-infection of nematodes T. vulpis + T. canis in dogs
   develops several changes in haematological parameters: a significant
   decrease in erythrocytes, haemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and haematocrit,
   leukocytosis with basophils and eosinophilia in young infected animals;
   and eosinophilia and basophilia (15.9 times) in adults, compared with
   healthy dogs of the same age. Among the changes in serum biochemical
   parameters, young infected dogs showed a decrease in the concentration
   of total protein and albumin content, an increase in the content of
   ``acute phase{''} proteins (alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-globulins), an
   increase in cholesterol and total bilirubin; in adult infected dogs, a
   decrease in albumin content, an increase in the content of alpha-1,
   alpha-2, and beta-globulins, an increase in the concentration of
   cholesterol and total bilirubin, a decrease in the concentration of urea
   in comparison with healthy animals were determined. Also, among the
   indicators of mineral metabolism, a decrease in the concentration of
   calcium and magnesium in the serum was found in young infected dogs.
   Among the changes in the enzyme metabolism in the serum of infected
   dogs, there was an increase in the activity of all studied enzymes in
   animals of both research groups: ALT, AST, alpha-amylase, GGT and ALP.
   Thus, co-infection with nematodes T. vulpis + T. canis has a complex
   pathogenic effect on the body of dogs of all ages, which manifested
   itself in multiple changes in haematological parameters. In the future,
   the authors' team plan to develop comprehensive measures to combat
   nematode infections in different living conditions of dogs, taking into
   account the results of the current research.},

   parasite of semi-aquatic birds in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},

Pages = {137-142},
Abstract = {Schistosomatidae are an actively studied ecological group of trematodes.
   Their ability to cause various parasitic diseases in animals and humans
   makes them an interesting object of study for a number of research
   centres worldwide. One of the commonest species in this group is Bill
   razz/el/a polonica (Kowalewsky, 1895), whose mature stages have been
   recorded in aquatic and semiaquatic birds in Uzbekistan. Our research
   team established that the following birds were infected with mature
   trematodes B. polonica: Anas platyrhynchos (23\%), A crecca (18\%),
   Podiceps ruficolks (11\%), Ardea cinema (14\%) and one individual of
   acyura leucocephala. The highest infection late was shown by the mallard
   A. plan,rhynchos (23\%) and common teal A. crecca (18\%). The infection
   intensity ranged between 2 and 27 individuals. Research into various
   types of water bodies in Karakalpakstin identified 10 mollusc species -
   Lymnaeidae (4 species), Planorbidae (4 species) and Physidae (2
   species). Cercariae morphologically similar to larvae of B. polonica
   were found in two species, Planorbis planorbis and P. tangitarensis. 6
   chicks of domestic ducks were experimentally infected with those
   cereariae to track the life cycle of B. polonica in the organism of a
   definitive host. Helmintholological dissections showed that every duck
   was infected with B. polonica, which became mature 23-27 days after the
   infection. Eggs of B. polonica were recorded in the excrement of one of
   the birds 33-35 days after the infection. Based on field and
   experimental research, we identify the mollusc P. tangitarensis as anew
   intermediate host for B. polonica in Uzbekistan.},

Abstract = {Because of developed symbiotic connections of the root system of trees,
   mycorrhiza-forming fungi and the orchid family Orchidaceae in forest
   ecosystems of the northeast Polissia Region - cultivated Pinar
   sylvestris, which are now 100-120 years old, recovery of cenopopulations
   of Epipactis helleborine has been observed in locations of mixed and
   broad-leaved forests. In natural plant cover of mature pines of the
   region, indigenous vegetation is gradually recovering - there occur
   young Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Acer platanoides of various ages,
   crown density of understory formed by Coryllus avellana has reached 0.6,
   above-ground organic leaf foliage that is able to sustain moisture and
   increase fertility of soil accumulates, creating sufficient conditions
   of shading for seedlings and juvenile individuals of forest orchids.
   Special studies revealed a relationship between density of E.
   helleborine specimens and crown density of the tree stand, shrub strata,
   structure of soil cover, expressed in cenoses under various degrees of
   recreational pressure. Density of individuals of forest orchids in the
   studied populations ranges 10.0 to 0.1 ind./10 m(2). Dynamics were seen
   in groupings of Betukto-Pineta corylasa,Querceta (roboris) corylosa,
   Querceto-Pineta corylosa, Acereto (platanoidis) -Tilieto (cordatae) -
   Quercetum (roboris) aegopodiosum in the territory of the nature-reserve
   fund and structurally similar anthropogenically pressurized cenoses. We
   determined that all examined cenopopulations in old indigenous zonal
   cenoses in the territory of the nature reserve fund are normal, they may
   be considered relatively stable, ontogenetic spectra are incomplete,
   mostly with right-sided age spectrum - maximum numbers of virgin and
   generative individuals of various stages. Low density of individuals and
   incomplete spectra of cenopopulations in light oak forests are natural,
   and now the largest share of generative and virgin individuals is
   concentrated in this area. Impact of recreation, unavoidable due to
   proximity to a road, is a negative factor directly decreasing their
   density. Ontogenetic spectra of all cenopopulations are incomplete - no
   seedlings were found in the natural conditions due to underground type
   of germination. Much more interesting data may be obtained by monitoring
   studies of age and morphometric dynamic changes during several years.},

Abstract = {Plants of two species of Actinidia genus grown in an adverse steppe
   climate were examined in terms of secondary metabolites' accumulation,
   antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial ability. The aim of the work
   was to reveal whether the introduced plants A. arguta and A. polygama
   retain their well-known health benefits. Total content of polyphenols
   (549.2 and 428.1 mg GAE/100 g FW, respectively), flavonoids, and
   phenolic acids as well as total antioxidant activity and reducing power
   of the fruit isopropanol extracts were found to be equal or even higher
   than the reported data on kiwifruit varieties cultivated in China and
   other regions. Antioxidant potential and phenolic compounds' content in
   the fruit peel of both species were higher when compared to pulp, while
   corresponding indices of leaves exceeded those of the fruit.
   Disc-diffusion assays showed low to moderate antibacterial activity of
   A. arguta and A. polygama fruit and leaf extracts against collection
   Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains. Clinical strains of P.
   aeruginosa and E. coli resistant to the action of ofloxacin were notably
   inhibited by A. arguta and A. polygama fruit and leaf crude extracts.
   Inhibiting effects of plant extracts on clinical strains of K.
   pneumoniae and A. baumannii were comparable with the effect of
   ofloxacin. GC-MS assays identified 23 and 36 chemical constituents,
   respectively in A. arguta and A. polygama fruit isopropanol extracts.
   The main compounds in both extracts were 2-propenoic acid, pentadecyl
   ester followed by squalene,
   7,9-di-tert-butyl-1-oxaspiro(4,5)deca-6,9-dien-2,8-dione, octadecanoic
   acid, 2-oxo-methyl ester, ethyl-isoallocholate, and phytol having known
   bioactivities. Our findings confirmed the preservation of useful
   properties by the introduced plants and also indicated the rich
   health-promoting abilities and expedience of cultivating A. arguta and
   A. polygama in a steppe climate.},

Abstract = {Taxonomic spectra, i.e. relations between supraspecific taxa by the
   number of included species, remain poorly understood in aspect of the
   mathematical properties. We studied taxonomic spectra of plants
   (Magnoliophyta, Bryophyta), animals (Coleoptera, Aves), fungi
   (Agaricomycetes) and terrestrial protists (Myxomycetes), found in the
   Homilsha Forests National Nature Park (NorthEast of Ukraine), and
   concluded that they correspond to the hollow-curve distribution at the
   level of genera, families and orders. The spectra of most taxa, as shown
   by the Akaike information criterion, are closely approximated by the
   log-series distribution model at all taxonomic levels. This type of
   distribution is typical for the species abundance curves, based on
   collections made from small areas. At the same time, in the
   genera-families-orders row the similarity to the lognormal distribution
   increases. The central values and variability vary considerably between
   different taxonomic groups and ranks, however, without affecting the
   type of distribution. The number of orders in all taxa except Bryophyta
   has reached the saturation and coincides with the curve of the estimated
   number of orders according to the Chao1 coefficient. For families and
   especially genera the correspondence with estimated number of species is
   much lower. Our results do not confirm the assumption that hollow-curve
   distributions of taxonomic spectra result from the artificial
   fragmentation of taxa. These distributions neither depend on the
   insufficient knowledge about the species composition at the locality,
   nor reflect the size of the studied area. The presence of such
   distributions in both local and global biota of different groups may be
   explained by the common features of their evolution, especially by the
   existence of relict orphan groups. The fact that in Homilsha Forests the
   kurtosis and skewness of distributions decreases in the
   genera-families-orders row can therefore be explained by the relatively
   low percentage of the high-rank orphan taxa in the local biota. This may
   be a common feature of communities studied at small geographical scale,
   since orphan taxa often demonstrate a high level of endemism.
   Comparative studies of local communities from different climate zones
   may help to understand how universal are the patterns, described herein.},

Abstract = {The study concerns a monitoring survey of Cordulegaster bidentata Selys,
   1843 (Odonata, Cordulegastridae), which is considered near threatened in
   the European Red List of Dragonflies, in order to show its habitat
   preferences and clarify the influence of slope and orientation of slopes
   on the occurrence of the species. Investigations of water habitats were
   carried out during the period from 2019 to 2020 in the Kysuce Region in
   northwest Slovakia. The protocol consists of looking for larvae and
   characterizing larval micro-habitat of C. bidentata so as to show their
   habitat preferences and clarify the influence of slope and orientation
   of slopes on the occurrence of the species. We sampled 32 watercourses
   (epicrenal, hypocrenal, rheocren, heleocren, epirhithral, metarhithral)
   at altitudes 420-950 m above sea level. A total of 79 larvae and 10
   imagines (7 male 3 female) of C. bidentata were found at 12 streams. In
   the present study, C. bidentata clearly preferred first-order stream
   sections, the slopes were steep and the proportion of small sediment
   grain sizes was high. The results show that the number of C. bidentata
   larvae grew with the increasing percentage of forests around streams. We
   also confirmed the trend for the number of C. bidentata larvae to
   increase with increasing values of slope and altitude of watercourses.
   Most of the individuals were recorded at the south and southwest
   oriented streams; we did not record larvae on the north and northwest
   oriented slopes. We assume that more suitable conditions for development
   of population exist in the streams on the south and southwest oriented
   slopes. The preference for watercourses oriented south and southwest
   ensures optimal conditions for the development of the population of this
   dragonfly species. The finding of larvae at the stages of instars shows
   the permanent occurrence of the species in the Kysuce Region.},

Title = {Effect of aluminium on redox-homeostasis of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum
   esculentum)},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {426-432},
Abstract = {Common buckwheat is a significant culture in Ukraine, whose importance
   for food security has increased in recent decades. An important
   biological feature of buckwheat is the ability of the crop to grow on
   poor and especially acidic soils. Common buckwheat was sown in Ukraine
   on the area of 125,000 ha in 2020, mainly in the central part of the
   country and in the soil-climatic zone Polesie in the north of the
   country. At the same time, the area under buckwheat cultivation has been
   steadily decreasing in the last decade, which is due to the low
   profitability of cultivation on mainly acidic soils. The research was
   conducted in the field conditions during 2012-2018 in Kiev region, as
   well as in laboratory conditions. ICP analysis and biochemical methods
   were used. Yield of buckwheat on light soils of low fertility depends
   largely on the level of acidity of the soil. On acidic sod-podzolic
   soils with loam substrate, the aluminum content of the layer is 20-40 cm
   higher, compared to a layer of 0-20 cm. This is probably one of the
   reasons why, when the concentration of aluminum in the soil profile is
   increased, the root system is located mainly in the upper layer of soil
   with a lower content of aluminum. In this case, the study of the
   mechanisms of resistance to the action of aluminum on acidic soils is an
   important component of the cost-effectiveness of crop production in the
   region. In acidic soils with pH < 5.0, phytotoxic aluminum (Al3+)
   rapidly inhibits root growth and afterwards negatively affects water and
   nutrient uptake in plants. Acquiring phytotoxic capacities, in this
   connection Al ions affect a wide range of cellular and molecular
   processes, with a consequent reduction in plant growth. In most plant
   species, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can also be induced by
   Al toxicity leading to oxidative damage of biomolecules and biological
   membranes. We have detected an accumulation of Al ions in leaf tissues
   of treatment plants after 10 days of exposure. Tissues of F. esculentum
   roots contained 155.4\% of control level of Al and tissues of F.
   esculentum leaves - 186.2\% of control level of Al ions. Significant
   intensification of O-2(center dot-) generation in roots and leaf tissues
   as a reaction to Al addition to nutrient solution was detected. Increase
   in antioxidant enzymes activities and non fixed products of lipids
   peroxidation was characterized as a biochemical defense reaction of F.
   esculentum over the 10 days of exposure to Al (50 mu M). Thus, the
   results show that the action of 50 mu M of Al ions activated antioxidant
   enzymes - SOD and CAT and decreased oxidative processes, thus promotes
   pro/antioxidant balance of common buckwheat. These mechanisms of redox
   homeostasis can be triggers of morphological changes in buckwheat
   plants, which lead to increased crop resistance when growing on acidic
   soils with high aluminum content. Thus, the resistance of culture to
   acid soils may be associated with the possibility of increased
   accumulation of aluminum in the plant's tissues, as well as in changes
   in redox homeostasis with subsequent morphological changes, and
   primarily the formation of the root system in the top layer of soil with
   a reduced content of aluminum.},

Abstract = {The creation of reservoirs in river valleys for the accumulation of
   fresh water has been and remains an important issue around the world.
   This process has both positive and negative consequences for people and
   nature. Significant changes in the regime of rivers and their valleys,
   flooding of meadows and forests, flooding of soils and changes in the
   composition of flora and fauna of adjacent territories are taking place.
   In this article, we consider the restoration of the biodiversity of a
   site of disturbed lands after the creation of one of the first large
   reservoirs in Europe - the Dnieper (Zaporozhe) on the River Dnieper,
   which has existed since 1933. The territory of the Samara floodplains
   was formed on the floodplain of the mouth of the Samara River, as a
   result of which the territories of various forest, meadow and bog
   biotopes were flooded. For almost 90 years, new biotopes have been
   developing, and populations of plant and animal species, especially
   waterfowl, have been renewed and enriched. In the conditions of climate
   change and anthropogenic pressure, the existence of this territory has
   fallen into question. To control the conservation of biodiversity, it is
   necessary to apply various management methods, one of which is creation
   of nature reserves. The article presents the results of a complex of
   scientific studies that were carried out during the zoning of the
   regional park Samara Plavni to improve the management of the protection
   of water areas and river banks. We have investigated: hydrological
   features, species diversity of the flora and coenotic diversity of the
   vegetation, fauna of aquatic invertebrates, and terrestrial vertebrates.
   Zoning of the Regional Landscape Park was based on the composition of
   stable components of ecosystems. When applying the protected regime in
   different zones, conditions will be created for the preservation of
   habitats of species, including those protected in Europe: higher plants
   (Senecio borysthenicus (DC.) Andrz. ex Czern., Tragopogon borystenicus
   Artemcz.), reptiles (Emys orbicularis (Linnaeus, 1758), Vipera renardi
   (Christoph, 1861)), birds (Aythya ferina (Linnaeus, 1758), Vanellus
   vanellus (Linnaeus, 1758), Haematopus ostralegus Linnaeus, 1758,
   Numenius arquata (Linnaeus, 1758), Alcedo atthis (Linnaeus, 1758),
   Lanius excubitor (Linnaeus, 1758)), mammals (Lutra lutra (Linnaeus,
   1758)). Such changes would increase the implementation of the
   reproductive potential of all species without exception in the studied
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Physiological responses of orchids to prolonged clinorotation},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {367-373},
Abstract = {Creation of plant-based bioregenerative life support systems is crucial
   for future long-duration space exploring missions. Microgravity is one
   of the major stresses affecting plant growth and development under space
   flight conditions. Search for higher plant genotypes resilient to
   microgravity as well as revealing of biological features which could be
   used as markers of such resilience is rather urgently needed. The
   objective of this study was to analyze physiological and biochemical
   responses of three orchid species representing different life forms
   (terrestrial and epiphytic), growth types (monopodial and sympodial) and
   pathways of CO2 fixation to long-term (24 months) clinorotation which
   modeled the combined effect of two stress factors: hermetic conditions
   and microgravity. Three years old meristematic orchids Cypripedium
   flavum, Angraecum eburneum, Epidendrum radicans, representing different
   life forms, types of branching shoot system and pathways of CO2
   fixation, were used as test-plants. The microgravity was simulated using
   three-dimensional (3-D) clinostat equipped with two rotation axes placed
   at right angles (rotation frequency was 3 rpm) in controlled conditions
   of air temperature, illumination, air humidity and substrate moisture.
   The control plants were grown in the similar plastic vessels but not
   hermetically sealed and without clinorotating in the same environmental
   conditions. The vital state of the test plants was assessed using
   characteristics of mineral nutrition, content of photosynthetic
   pigments, free amino acids, soluble proteins, DNA and RNA, enzymatic and
   non-enzymatic antioxidants. The results of this study confirmed that
   orchids grown under simulated microgravity and kept in
   hermetically-sealed vessels were subjected to oxidative stress, which
   could be responsible for the observed inhibition of basic physiological
   processes such as mineral nutrition, metabolism of aminoacids, protein
   biosynthesis and photosynthesis. Monopodial orchids C. flavum and A.
   eburneum demonstrated better adaptation to prolonged clinorotation as
   compared to sympodial E. radicans. In particular, the latter
   demonstrated some stimulation of mineral nutrition processes (i.e. K, N,
   Fe, Mn, Zn accumulation), content of photosynthetic pigments, proline
   and superoxide dismutase activity. Long-lasting clinorotation induced
   adaptive changes of antioxidant systems in the studied orchids (e.i.
   increase in carotenoids and proline content and stimulation of
   superoxide dismutase activity), which helped to maintain the main
   physiological functions at stable level in the above-mentioned stressful
   conditions. The following biochemical characteristics in the studied
   orchids could be considered as markers of resilience to simulated
   microgravity and hermetic conditions: 1) an increase in the accumulation
   of non-enzymatic (proline, carotenoids) and enzymatic antioxidants
   (superoxide dismutase); 2) ability to maintain stable balance of mineral
   nutrients; 3) increase in the content of photosynthetic pigments; 4)
   increase in the content of proteinogenic amino acids and soluble
   proteins; 5) increase in the DNA content or RNA/DNA ratio. Our studies
   have also demonstrated a correlation between orchid ecomorphological
   characteristics such as type of branching with their adaptive responses
   to prolonged clinorotation. We observed no correlation between the
   studied life form of orchids, ecotype or the pathway of CO2 fixation and
   their resilience to prolonged clinorotation.
   This research can be a starting point for studying the relationships
   between ecomorphological features of various orchids and their
   resilience to microgravity conditions in the search for biological
   markers of microgravity tolerance in species of higher plants.},

Title = {Time turnover of species in bird communities: the role of landscape
   diversity and climate change},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-444},
Abstract = {The challenge of searching for patterns of species turnover dynamics in
   communities of living organisms is directly related to solving problems
   of stability and functioning of ecosystems. Avian communities are an
   essential structural and functional component of terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems which are highly diverse and play an important role in a wide
   range of ecosystem functions. The issue of changes in the dynamics of
   amphibiotic landscape complexes, where terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems conjugate, is practically not solved. In this connection, a
   study was carried out within a landscape system, which presents
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that were in different degrees of
   anthropogenic transformation. The dynamics of bird communities was
   considered in the context of recent global climate change. The
   investigation was conducted in the landscapes of the south and
   south-east of Ukraine in the nesting seasons 1988-2018. Within the
   landscape system associated with the Molochny estuary, the ten most
   important types of ecosystems were distinguished, which included :
   agricultural lands, artificial forest belts, meadows, islands and spits,
   reed beds, urban areas, solonchaks, steppe, cliffs, artificial forests.
   The temporal turnover of the bird communities was decomposed into two
   parts: the first term (D1) related to the amount of change in community
   composition, and the second term (D2) being dependent only on the amount
   of change in community size sensu its abundance. The contribution ratio
   of the species and of the environment variable were calculated to
   identify drivers that influence the turnover measure. The average annual
   temperature and the sum of annual temperatures were considered as
   environment variables. The bird metacommunity of the studied landscape
   system was represented by 132 species from 86 genera, 42 families and 13
   orders. During the research period the average annual temperature varied
   from 9.5 to 12.5 degrees C. and the temperature dynamics were subject to
   the linear trend. An oscillatory component was also present in the
   temperature dynamics. The annual rainfall ranged 220-761 mm. A coherent
   change in precipitation and temperature was observed in the period until
   2011. After that, the temperature growth stabilized and the amount of
   precipitation began to fall sharply. The steppe bird community was
   represented by an extremely small number of species, but demonstrated
   the ability to maintain a stable structure for a long time. The main
   fluctuations of the community were quantitative changes in abundance,
   while the turnover of species was practically absent. Species of the
   community replace each other cyclically, but there were no targeted
   changes in community structure. Temperature and precipitation were the
   main drivers of the bird community in the steppe. The bird communities
   on salt marshes were characterized by a stable abundance, but a constant
   directed turnover of species. Reduced water levels and the disappearance
   of islands in the salt marshes increased the risk of threats from
   predators, which could lead to a decrease in the abundance of some
   species. The islands and spits were characterized by high species
   turnover with quasi-cyclical population dynamics. The main feature of
   the community dynamics was a decrease in the role of precipitation and
   an increase in the role of the time factor. The role of temperature
   remained stably low. The species richness of bird communities in
   agrarian lands was higher than in steppe communities.
   The turnover measure was significant because of the increased abundance
   of Alauda arvensis. Over time, the role of precipitation in the
   community dynamics has been decreasing and the role of time has been
   increasing. The value of temperature varied, but was at a stationary
   level. The turnover of species was compensated by an increase in the
   abundance of bird communities. The obtained results are in line with
   findings indicating that despite more stable land use intensities in
   recent years, climate change has not overtaken land use intensities as
   the main driver of bird population dynamics.},

Abstract = {Probiotics based on bacteria of the genus Bacillus with a multifactorial
   mechanism of action are considered as a possible alternative to
   antibiotics in the treatment of purulent wounds. The aim of the study
   was to determine the antimicrobial and therapeutic effect of the
   Arederma probiotic preparation containing probiotic strains of the genus
   Bacillus in an experimental model of a purulent wound in animals. The
   antimicrobial efficacy of the probiotic against test strains and
   clinical isolates of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms was
   studied using the method of delayed antagonism. Staphylococcus aureus
   ATCC 6538 and Streptococcus pyogenes K-7 were used to model a purulent
   wound. From the surface of the wounds, bacteria of Staphylococcus,
   Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas genera and
   Enterobacteriaceae family were sown on appropriate selective media for
   the cultivation and enumeration of different groups of microorganisms by
   generally accepted microbiological research methods. The formation of a
   purulent wound in rabbits caused by mechanical skin damage and
   subsequent double infection with Staphylococcus ctureus ATCC 6538 and
   Streptococcus pyogenes K-7 strains was accompanied with a pronounced
   inflammatory process, necrosis, the formation of purulent exudate and
   general intoxication. Representatives of the genera Staphylococcus and
   Streptococcus, microscopic fungi and, to a lesser extent, members of the
   family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas were found on the surface of
   purulent wounds, which confirmed the development of the
   infectious-inflammatory process. Treatment of purulent wounds with a
   suspension of probiotic preparation once a day for 4 days led to their
   faster healing (gradual attenuation of the inflammatory process,
   reduction of edema and discharge, as well as their disappearance)
   compared with untreated purulent wounds (control). Representatives of
   the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera, as well as microscopic
   fungi, presented in purulent wounds treated with probiotic preparation
   in much smaller numbers than in the control, and bacteria of the
   Pseudomonas genus and the Enterobacteriaceae family were not detected at
   all. The effective antimicrobial effect of this probiotic preparation
   against opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms was confumed by M
   vitro studies. Therefore, the Arederma probiotic preparation showed an
   effective therapeutic and antimicrobial effect in the experimental model
   of a purulent wound in animals, so it can be recommended for further
   preclinical and clinical studies.},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {135-139},
Abstract = {Pigeons are closely related to human life and are both a source of food
   and object for hobbies and sports. Parasitic diseases of birds are the
   main reason for their growth retardation, reduced productivity and
   viability. The article presents the results of studying the prevalence
   of trichomonosis, cestodes and nematodes among the population of wild
   and domestic pigeons in the south of Ukraine. According to the results
   of the conducted researches it is established that in the south of
   Ukraine endoparasitoses of domestic and wild pigeons are quite
   widespread, and all species of this bird are carriers of Trichomonas
   gallinae. At the same time, the highest rate of Trichomonas infection
   was recorded in Columba palambus and C. livia domestica, and the overall
   infestation of males is higher by 4.4\% compared to females. It was
   determined that domestic pigeons C. livia domestica were infested with
   trichomonosis (27.5\%) and nematodes (Ascaridia columbae, 57.1\%), C.
   palambus - trichomonosis (32.1\%) and cestodes (Raillietina spp.,
   82.4\%), Streptopelia turtur - cestodes (Raillietina spp., 12.5\%) and
   S. decaocto - cestodes (Raillietina spp., 71.4\%) and nematodes
   (Heterakis gallinarum, A. columbae - 33.3\% and 44.4\% respectively).
   The overall rate of infestation of pigeons with cestodes was 28.4\% and
   the incidence in males was higher by 3.9\% compared to females. It was
   found that the most common species among pigeon cestodes is Raillietina
   spp. In addition, 22.9\% of pigeons are carriers of nematodes (H.
   gallinarum, A. columbae and Capillaria spp.). Continuous monitoring of
   pigeon parasites is necessary because they, in most cases, come into
   contact with other species of poultry and are a source of general
   invasion. In terms of further research, it would be promising to study
   the prevalence of helminthic infestation among wild migratory birds.},

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {393-398},
Abstract = {The paper is devoted to the dynamics of the water vole population in the
   conditions of total deforestation of valley forests and their subsequent
   restoration. We analyzed the relative population of small mammals in the
   typical biotopes in the Tom River basin (Western Siberia) on the border
   of the forest-steppe and taiga zones. From 1978 to 2019, 1,139 water
   voles Arvicola amphibius (Linnaeus, 1758) (synonym of A. terrestris)
   were caught with 50-meter trapping grooves; for 788 individuals we
   assessed the condition of non-metric features (phenes) of the skull. It
   was found that changes in the population level are non-cyclical, while
   against the background of a generally low occurrence of the species in
   the region, the population level increased tenfold in some years. It was
   shown that such episodic population surges can significantly impact the
   structure of the community of small mammals. In the valley of the Tom
   River, the water vole prefers inhabit wet meadows and ecotone areas
   between the meadow and the dark coniferous taiga forest. During the
   years of population surges, the water vole intensely occupies new
   nesting sites due to the dispersal activity of young animals but at the
   same time retains the original biotopic preferences. Dispersal of the
   species takes place in waterlogged wetlands. Most of the animals caught
   during the peak of their numbers were young animals of late broods born
   from overwintered individuals. The conducted phenetic analysis revealed
   the heterogeneity of young animals during the population surge, which
   allowed us to assume the participation of several populations in the
   formation of the peak. In the final surge year, the surge was
   characterized by an extremely low percentage of participation in the
   breeding of young females and the appearance of a large number of
   weakened animals, which led to crisis in the species population and the
   disappearance of the water vole from the captures. The research shows
   that one cannot predict the success of this process at the current
   stage; therefore, after flooding, it is necessary to continue
   monitoring.},

Title = {Phytoindication assessment of the effect of reconstruction on the light
   regime of an urban park},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {276-285},
Abstract = {The ecological restoration of urban parks is used to increase their
   recreational attractiveness, improve air quality, mitigate urban heat
   island effects, improve stormwater infiltration, and provide other
   social and environmental benefits. The dynamics of plant communities
   after urban forest restoration requires investigation. The study
   assessed the impact of urban park reconstruction on the state of grass
   cover, phytoindication of changes in light regime caused by park
   reconstruction and found out the dependence of reliability of
   phytoindication assessment on the number of species in the relevant
   area. The study was conducted in the recreational area of the Botanical
   Garden of the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University (Ukraine). A tree
   plantation was created after the Second World War in the location of a
   natural oak forest. In 2019, a 2.8 ha area of the park was
   reconstructed. The samples were taken within polygons, two of which were
   placed in the reconstruction area and two of which were placed in a
   similar section of the park where no reconstruction was performed.
   During the reconstruction process, walkways were rebuilt, shrubs were
   removed, old, damaged trees were removed, and tree crowns were trimmed.
   Juvenile trees were planted in place of the removed old trees. Old
   outbuildings, which greatly impaired the aesthetic perception of the
   park, were also removed. Transport and construction machinery was
   involved in the reconstruction. A total of 65 plant species were found
   within the studied polygons. The number of herbaceous species in the
   park area after reconstruction was higher than without reconstruction.
   The crown closure in the reconstructed area was significantly lower than
   that in the untreated conditions. The phytoindication assessment showed
   that the light regime varies from the conditions suitable for the
   scyophytes (plants of typical foliage forests) to the conditions
   suitable for the sub-heliophytes (plants of light forests and
   shrubberies, or high herbaceous communities; lower layers are in the
   shade). The light regime in the park area after reconstruction was
   statistically significantly different from the regime in the untreated
   park area. The lighting regime after the reconstruction was favourable
   to sub-heliophytes, and without reconstruction the regime favoured
   hemi-scyophytes. Tree canopy crown closure negatively correlated with
   grass height and herbaceous layer projective cover. The tree canopy
   crown closure, grass height, and herbaceous layer projective cover were
   able to explain 86\% of the phytoindication assessment of the lighting
   regime variation. These parameters negatively affected the light regime.
   The prospect of further research is to investigate the dependence of
   indicative reliability of the assessment of other environmental factors
   with the help of phytoindication depending on the number of species. In
   addition to the indication of traditional ecological factors it is of
   particular interest to clarify the aspect of the dynamics of hemeroby
   indicators as a result of park reconstruction.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in the diet and the morphometric parameters of the

Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The diet and the morphometric parameters of the Pseudophoxinus sp.
   (Cyprinidae) in the El Mellah ravine (M'sila, Algeria) were studied by
   determining body measurements and analyzing the contents of digestive
   tracts of 320 fish from December 2018 to November 2019. The obtained
   results show marked diversity within the fish species diets, which can
   be grouped into three main fractions: (i) a plant fraction; (ii) an
   animal fraction composed mainly of invertebrate prey; and (iii) fraction
   consisting of fish eggs (digested by males during the breeding season).
   The plant fraction was present in all the analyzed digestive tracts,
   mainly being composed of phytoplankton (algae), namely, Spirogyra sp.,
   Melosira sp. and Navicula sp. with the total relative abundances of
   38.7\%, 34.4\% and 4.1\%, respectively. On the other hand, the animal
   fraction was represented by the Chironomus sp., Austrosimulium sp., and
   Ecdyonurus sp. dipterans with a total relative abundance of 7.3\%, 6.7\%
   and 5.9\%, respectively. Pseudophoxinus sp. eggs can also be considered
   as part of this fraction with the total relative abundance of 2.9\%. The
   age of the fish seems to have an influence on their feeding behaviour.
   The juveniles of Pseudophoxinus sp. in the study area had a purely
   phytophagous diet, while adults showed a phytophagous behaviour with an
   omnivorous tendency. The present study shows that not only the age of
   the fish but also the seasonal changes (climatic conditions and entry
   into the breeding season) may have a significant influence on the diet
   and morphometric parameters of Pseudophoxinus sp. in El Mellah ravine.},

Abstract = {The study is focused on the influence of mechanisms of anthropogenic
   activity and climate changes of different types and levels on the
   autotrophic link of freshwater ecosystems. The studies of the river,
   lake, water reservoir and quarry phytoplankton in the territory of the
   Ukrainian Polissia were carried out during 2005-2019 according to the
   standard methods. At the same time, we determined water hydrophysical
   and hydrochemical characteristics. Exactly 812 algal species represented
   by 877 infraspecific taxa were identified, including 75 new ones for the
   Ukrainian Polissia, with a significant share of thermophiles and
   halophiles. The dominance of Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenozoa
   and Cyanobacteria was observed in all types of water bodies. With the
   increase in the nutrient content in the composition of dominant
   complexes of river ecosystems, the role of centric diatoms Cyclotella
   meneghiniana, C. stelligera, Stephanodiscus hantzschii increased. The
   vegetation intensity of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae increased in the water
   courses with partially regulated flow, while vegetation of Chrysococcus
   rufescens, Pseudokephyrion pillidium, Kephyrion ovum intensified in
   rivers with increased colour of water. Water reservoirs are dominated by
   representatives of Bacillariophyta, Cyanobacteria, Euglenozoa, Miozoa,
   mostly by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Peridinium cinctum. The lowest
   number of dominant species was identified in the lakes, and belonged to
   the genera Trachelomonas, Peridinium, Chlamydomonas, Crucigeniella,
   Cyclotella, Aulacoseira. The dominant species in quarries were
   Cyclotella meneghiniana, Chlamydomonas monadina, Ch. globosa, Coelastrum
   microporum, Gomphosphaeria aponina, Trachelomonas volvocina and
   Microcystis aeruginosa. The obtained data can be used to predict
   scenarios of changes in the autotrophic link under the influence of
   natural and anthropogenic factors, to develop methods for monitoring and
   managing ecosystems at different levels of anthropogenic transformation
   necessary to ensure an appropriate level of their functions and
   ecological services.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers in annual
   and perennial crops has increased in Peru. These fertilizers are quickly
   available to plants by converting to nitrates, increasing crop yields.
   However, nitrogen fertilizers are very volatile and are also lost easily
   by leaching. This lost nitrogen (N) implies economic costs and leads to
   environmental problems such as eutrophication. Biochar, a new soil
   amendment, has been suggested as a solution to these problems; however,
   there has been little research on the subject in Peru. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the effect of biochar application on corn
   yield and nitrogen balance in soils (Entisols with alluvial deposition)
   in San Ramon (Peru). Biochar was produced from green waste and pig
   manure. The research design considered five treatments: Control (T1), 7
   t.ha(-1) of pig manure (T2), 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar (T3), 23 t.ha(-1)
   of biochar with pH adjustment (T4), and 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar with pH
   and C/N ratio adjustment (T5). The results showed that treatments T1 and
   T2 obtained the lowest corn yields, with an average production of 0.41
   t.ha-1 and 2.45 t.ha-1, respectively. Treatment T5 produced the highest
   corn yield, reaching a production of 5.71 t.ha-1. A significant
   difference was only found in the yield of treatments T1 and T5 (p =
   0.011). Nitrogen use efficiency percentages (NUE), defined as the
   percentage of applied N that was available to be absorbed by the crop or
   retained in the soil, were higher for treatments T3, T4, and T5 with 28,
   28, and 56\% efficiency, respectively, in comparison to treatments T1
   and T2. Likewise, biochar treatments T3, T4, and T5 produced lower
   nitrogen losses compared to treatments T1 and T2. This research
   concluded that biochar-based amendments have positive effects on corn
   crop yield while limiting nitrogen loss.},

Abstract = {The increase of rainbow trout production in Peru generates a large
   amount of by-products which are not generally recycled, which generates
   greenhouse gases, eutrophication when they are thrown into the river and
   the appearance of pests when they are buried. The processes of
   hydrolysis and lactic acid fermentation allow to recover amino acids and
   nutrients, which can be used as a supplement for foliar fertilization of
   plants. The aim of this research was to develop a liquid fertilizer
   using rainbow trout by-products (FLVT), characterize it and evaluate the
   phytotoxicity. The total amino acid content was 3.2 g/100 g and protein
   content was 6.2 g/100 g. While the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and
   potassium were 12 040 mg/l, 1 189 mg/l, 5 540 mg/l, respectively. The
   liquid fertilizer did not contain E. coli or Salmonella sp. While the
   content of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromium were lower
   than the maximum permissible limits according to the regulations for
   liquid fertilizers. In the phytotoxicity test on Lactuca sativa lettuce
   seeds, the concentrations of FLVT from 0.1\% to 0.001\% were free of
   phytotoxic substances and germination index values (IG) were greater
   than 80\%.},

Abstract = {The sustainability of livestock production systems in the districts of
   Oxapampa, Chontabamba and Huancabamba Oxapampa, Pasco Region, Peru, were
   studied. The methodology used was the MESMIS analysis. For the
   characterization of livestock systems, the producers were grouped into
   three groups: traditional extensive livestock system, semi-extensive
   livestock system and extensive livestock system. In the first instance,
   environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social
   sustainability were partially evaluated with their respective
   indicators, and then evaluated simultaneously in an integrated manner.
   Through the MESMIS analysis, the traditional extensive livestock system
   was the most sustainable. Subsequently, the same producers with their
   environmental, economic and social indicators were subjected to the
   agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, using as proximity distance
   the Euclidean distance and with the agglomeration methods: nearest
   neighbor, nearest neighbor, average or intergroup linkage, bonding
   intragroup cluster centroid, Ward grouping medium and method with SPSS.
   The unique solution of three group clusters resulted in the similarity
   of a cluster with the same producers, obtained in the traditional
   livestock system using MESMIS with several of the agglomeration methods
   mentioned above, both at the partial and integral analysis level.},

Abstract = {Telmatobius macrostomus (Peters, 1873) is an endemic species of high
   Andean rivers and lakes in the center of Junin and Pasco / Peru,
   categorized as endangered. The present study describes the microhabitat
   of T. macrostomus tadpoles during the dry season, for this, 10
   physicochemical parameters were evaluated in substations (approximate to
   100 m2) and six in quadrants (1 m(2)). By means of a non-parametric
   Kruskal- Wallis test it was determined that none of the parameters
   evaluated in the substations with the presence (n = 10) and absence (n =
   17) of tadpoles of T. macrostomus were not different (p value > 0.05),
   likewise the quadrants with presence (n = 29) and absence (n = 1108)
   were not significantly different (p value > 0.05). However, the
   non-metric scaling analysis and a similarity analysis (ANOSIM) resulted
   in a significant difference between the quadrants with presence and
   absence in a single substation (R = 0.50, p = 0.0004). It is established
   that tadpoles of T. macrostomus live in high aquatic vegetation, near
   the banks of rivers, in silt-type substrate, minimum depth of 30 cm,
   associated with the presence of native fish of the genus Orestias and a
   high diversity of diatoms. Based on the evaluated parameters, it is
   concluded that T. macrostomus tadpoles are generalists and that some
   type of microhabitat selection in substations could be related to
   habitat alteration or feeding factors, but there are characteristics in
   quadrants observables associated with their presence. Finally,
   short-term conservation efforts are planned for this species.},

Abstract = {A paper published in 2019 in the journal Science concludes that Peru
   starred in 61 events to reduce the level of protection and size as well
   as to eliminate protected areas (events known by the acronym PADDD).
   That would place the country among those that most mistreat their
   protected areas. But, in Peru only one case is known. When reviewing the
   study methodology, it is confirmed that the authors misinterpreted the
   information, especially referring to national forests that in Peru have
   never been considered protected areas. It's seems the authors
   exaggerated the arguments to demonstrate the significance of PADDD.},

Abstract = {Decreasing outflow observed in the Apacheta micro-basin during the
   period 2000-2018, has a direct impact on the water storage of the
   Cuchoquesera dam, with subsequent negative impacts on local water
   provisioning for human consumption and agricultural activities - whose
   demand has already surpassed the supply capacity of the reservoir - as
   well as the ecological volume needed for ensuring the proper functioning
   of ecosystems along the catchment. In the long term, this problem may be
   intensified by the effects of climate change. The objective of this
   study was to assess the annual trend of the Apacheta micro-basin
   discharge and forecast future values, in comparison to its ecological
   flow of 2.24 m(3)/s and the sensitivity towards adequately satisfying
   the different demands over time. For this, we combined
   hydro-meteorological data and remote sensing information with the
   PRMS-IV hydrological model. Our results indicate that, upon continuing
   the annual outflow trend, a decrease of 46.1\% and 56.1\% below the
   ecological flow could be expected for the next 5 and 10 years,
   respectively. At the regional and national government levels, timeframes
   of 5-10 years are typically considered for planning purposes, in that
   sense, our results have the potential to guide decision-making processes
   towards mitigating water-scarcity risks.},

Abstract = {The ulcumano (Retrophyllum rospigliosii) is an important native conifer
   of Peru, which is currently disappearing from the areas where it was
   dominant, due to its excessive use and problems in its regeneration.
   Also, there is limited information on its vegetative propagation. For
   this reason, the objective was to determine the efficiency of the
   vegetative propagation of the ulcumano in the sub-irrigation chamber.
   Four concentrations of IBA were used (0, 1 000, 3 000 and 5 000 ppm),
   two ages of mother plants (two and eight years) and two types of
   cuttings (apical and middle); under a completely random factorial
   design. The results indicate that, at the end of 17 weeks, the T7
   treatment (corresponding to medium type cuttings, from two-year-old
   mother plants and treated with 3 000 ppm IBA) obtained the highest
   rooting (40\%), root length (7 mm) and number of roots per cutting
   (2.2). Auxin AIB didn ` t influence rooting. Type cuttings influenced
   survival, rooting, and sprouting. The interaction between the cuttings
   mother plant and type of s had a significant influence on rooting
   success, two- year-old trees and medium-type cuttings obtained higher
   survival (76.85\%), rooting (32.5\%) and sprouting (70\%). It is
   concluded that it is possible to propagate ulcumano using middle
   cuttings of two-year-old trees.},

Abstract = {The release of pharmaceutical products has increased in terrestrial and
   aquatic ecosystems, putting the biota at risk, being able to generate
   multiple impacts on organisms, from modifying enzymatic expression to
   intergenerational impact on exposed organisms. This study evaluated the
   influence of phenobarbital and ibuprofen on tolerance to the insecticide
   temephos in two populations of Aedes aegypti, La Esperanza (LE) and
   Rockefeller (Rock). Larvae I were exposed to 17.7 mu g/ml ibuprofen and
   200 mu g/ml phenobarbital until reaching stage III; subsequently, larvae
   mortality to temephos (0.005, 0.025 and 0.050 mu g/ml) and the enzymatic
   activity of esterases were determined. Phenobarbital was found to favors
   a higher tolerance to 0.025 mu g/ml of temephos, at 24 hours of
   exposure, in the LE population (44.00 +/- 6.93\% mortality) as opposed
   to Rock (97.33 +/- 2.67\% mortality); furthermore, it decreased
   enzymatic activity of alpha esterases in Rock and LE specimens (0.3892
   +/- 0.0756 and 0.1722 +/- 0.0194, optical density, respectively). Also,
   ibuprofen reports a lower LD90 (0.024 mu g/ml temephos) than the control
   (DL90 = 0.039 mu g/ml temephos) at 2 hours of exposure with temephos. It
   is concluded that phenobarbital increases the tolerance of Aedes aegypti
   larvae to temephos, and ibuprofen stimulates the activity of alpha- and
   beta-esterases.},

Abstract = {Toxicity tests were carried out on marine sediment elutriates from Los
   Chimus, Tortugas, and Casma bays in Peru, using the marine microalgae
   Isochrysis galbana and Nannochloropsis oceanica. The marine sediment
   samples were collected in the months of March and August 2016. These
   toxicity tests were performed following standardized protocols, using
   static tests at 96 h of exposure. Previously, the sensitivity of both
   strains of microalgae was determined using copper sulfate (CuSO4 center
   dot 5H(2)O) as a reference substance. The mean Inhibition Concentration
   (IC50) obtained in this test showed that I. galbana was more sensitive
   than N. oceanica. Marine sediment elutriates from the study areas showed
   different levels of toxicity, such as ``non-toxicity{''} (IC50 = 90\% -
   100\%), ``moderate toxicity{''} (IC50 = 59\% - 81\%), and ``high
   toxicity{''} (IC50 < 59\%) when using the microalgae I. galbana; while,
   in the case of N. oceanica, only ``non-toxicity{''} (IC50 = 90\% -
   100\%) was found for the same sediment elutriate samples. These toxicity
   tests show that the I. galbana microalgae detects different levels of
   toxicity, which is why it could be used to environmentally evaluate
   marine sediment samples as a complement to chemical tests since the
   origin of toxicity is not discriminated.},

Abstract = {Environmental factors influence positively or negatively for the
   establishment of natural pines regeneration, which may be linked to
   forest fires. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine
   the environmental variables that influence the establishment of natural
   pines regeneration in impacted areas under three fire severity
   conditions (no fire, moderate fire and extreme fire) in pine - oak
   forests (Pinus lumholtzii BL Rob. \& Fernald, Pinus devoniana Lindl.,
   Pinus oocarpa Scheide, Quercus castanea Nee, Quercus magnoliifolia Nee)
   in the state of Jalisco (Mexico). For this purpose, different parameters
   of natural regeneration were evaluated: trees, live and dead fuels in
   circular sites of similar to 400 m(2). Correlation analyses were
   performed with the data obtained to identify the most significant
   variables, and to use them in the stepwise regression analyses to
   identify predictor variables useful for the definition of the model for
   the estimation of natural pine regeneration in areas affected by fire.
   The analyzes showed that the ``stepwise{''} process presents the best
   model with an R-2 of 0.6837 and an AIC of 568.58, selecting the
   following variables: dry weight of herbs, height of shrubs, crown
   diameter of shrubs and grasses, 10 hour fuels and exposure.
   Subsequently, considering the mean square of the error as the main
   criterion, a comparison was made of the models resulting from the
   combination of these variables, with the best model excluding the dry
   weight of herbs. It is concluded that the establishment of the natural
   regeneration of pine is associated with certain variables of ground
   cover, understory and relief.},

Abstract = {The research consisted in determining the selection objectives for
   raising alpacas under two economic scenarios at the San Pedro de Racco
   Community Cooperative. The study was carried out in three stages: The
   first one described the alpaca's breeding system, in the second one the
   elaboration of the profit equation was done, and in the third one the
   relative economic values by partial derivation were calculated and the
   selection objectives were determined. Economic scenarios 1 and 2 were
   defined by the payment method of the fiber. The relative economic values
   of fleece weight (FW) and fleece weight at the first shearing (FW1) were
   S/10.6 and S/5.85, respectively, values which were equal for both
   economic scenarios. The fiber diameter (FD) obtained values of-S/2.12 in
   economic scenario 2. The selection objective by economic scenarios was
   defined by FW, FW1, and live weight at first shearing (LW1S) for
   scenario 1; and by FW, FW1, and FD for scenario 2. It was concluded that
   the payment by categorized fiber favored the relative economic value of
   the fiber diameter and fiber diameter at the first shearing,
   contributing to the thinning of the fleeces; while the fleece weight was
   the character of greatest relative economic value in the selection
   objectives of economic scenarios 1 and 2.},

   each stage of development of P. nigrispinus (nymph II, III, IV, V and
   the adult) supplied with 30 larvae from each prey throughout the life
   cycle, making a total of twenty treatments. The parameters evaluated for
   the life cycle were: number of days of life per nymph state and
   longevity in adult state and life cycle of the individual in relation to
   each prey. For the predatory capacity the parameters were: number of
   predated larvae and maximum number of prey consumed per nymph and adult
   stage. The data obtained in the evaluations were analyzed using the
   Kruskall-Wallis test. The results indicated that the number of days of
   life for nymphs were 14.6, 33.35 and 36.95 and for adults 29.5, 33.35
   and 36.95, with a life cycle of 44.10, 66.70 and 73.20 days for S.
   frugiperda, S. eridania and Galleria sp. respectively. The consumption
   of larvae in nymph stage of P. nigrispinus was 21.90, 20.20 and 13.05;
   and in adult stage it was 29.5, 33.35 36.95 for S. frugiperda, S.
   eridania and Galleria sp. respectively. The maximum predatory capacity
   of P. nigrispinus in nymph stage was 28.00 and in adult stage it was
   50.00, both with larvae of S. frugiperda. Consequently, it was shown
   that P. nigrispinus in adult stage had a greater predatory capacity when
   S. nigrispinus larvae were fed to it.},

Abstract = {The well-known distribution of the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) in
   Peru encompasses the dry forests of the northwest, the coastal desert,
   the western slopes of the Andes, and the inter-Andean valleys. However,
   in the past 20 years, this species has been seen in the Peruvian Amazon,
   in the regions of Madre de Dios, Loreto, and Ucayali. Although four
   subspecies of A. cunicularia are registered in the country, it has not
   yet been possible to precisely define the subspecies that have expanded
   their distribution range in the Peruvian Amazon. A. cunicularia can be
   considered an indicator species of anthropogenic habitats, where the
   primary forest has been replaced by agricultural activities or highly
   degraded open forests. In the present work, a bibliographic review and
   monitoring of A. cunicularia sightings in forested areas of the Peruvian
   Amazon in the degradation process is carried out with the objective of
   evaluating the expansion in the distribution range of the species in
   Peru. Eighty new and nesting records of the species were found in places
   where it had not been reported previously breeding. Broadening of the
   distribution range of this species in the Amazon colonization is
   confirmed, from the Peruvian side, following the route of the rivers
   that descends through the inter-Andean valleys, crosses the high jungle,
   and reaches the low jungle, in the advance of the establishment on
   farmland and human settlements.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Month = {JAN-JUL},
Abstract = {Wildlife management as an applied science is new in Latin America.
   Although there were some previous pioneering cases, as in the case of
   guano birds in Peru, most programs and projects were initiated only in
   the 1960s and especially in the 1970s, when specialized academic
   training also began. Currently, there are wildlife management operations
   in all countries of the region. However, the vast majority of them have
   conservation purposes, i.e. they are carried out to recover populations
   of rare or endangered species and/or to stimulate tourism. They are not
   done to stimulate economic and social development through the production
   of meat and other products that can be marketed, although in some cases
   this may occur. One of the few exceptions is the already widespread
   management of Amazonian River turtles, which serves to improve the food
   supply of riverine populations. Another is sport hunting, which is still
   tolerated in a few countries, such as Argentina. The main obstacle to
   the application of conventional wildlife management is the distorted
   environmental information that society receives and its consequent
   strong opposition to hunting, which it considers inhumane and dangerous
   for the species. On the other hand, influenced by the society's
   attitude, wildlife policies and laws are deficient and inefficient, and
   illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking are widespread. The future of
   wildlife management for direct economic purposes in the region does not
   look favorable. Its greatest possibilities are found mainly in portions
   of natural ecosystems that are not very inhabited, especially tropical
   forests, for the benefit of indigenous and rural populations, where
   hunting for sustenance is currently practiced in an unregulated manner.},

Abstract = {The use of organic waste is a viable environmental alternative, the
   sources being an organism that allows a rapid decomposition process. The
   research of rearing red worms in different substrates of biological
   development, was carried out during June and July 2019. The objectives
   were: a) To determine the influence of the type of substrate (type of
   treatment) on the increase of stumps and biomass of the red worm, b)
   Estimate the degree of association between number of worms, number of
   stumps, length and biomass in different substrate treatments. The
   methodology consists of implementing three types of substrate and one of
   control, analyzing animal faeces and fruit remains. Assessment of
   temperature, humidity and pH was performed every two days, and the
   number of earthworms, cocoons, length and biomass every 12 days. Results
   were as follows: the number of red earthworm cocoon increased to six
   cocoons or eggs in 36 days (average 4.33 cocoons/earthworm), with the
   treatment with animal manure and fruit peels, as the one with higher
   number of cocoons, in relation to the other treatments. The highest
   degree of association was recorded between length (mm) and the biomass
   (g) of earthworms, with a value of r = 0.82.},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of grazing rest on
   the vegetation structure, the hydrological function, and the ecological
   status in grasslands of regular condition for cattle. The study area is
   located at 4 095 meters above sea level, in the Cordillera Blanca
   peasant community, Ancash Region, Peru. The experimental design was
   factorial 2 x 2 in blocks, where the factors were: a) two grazing
   systems P1: Uncontrolled grazing on communal usufruct lands and P2: Rest
   or total exclusion of grazing, and b) three years of monitoring between
   2011 and 2013. At the end of the study, the vegetation structure changed
   according to the regime of the rangeland use, where the rest favored the
   increase of native gramineae species and to the detriment of herbs,
   pseudogramineae, and shrubs. Resting increased the vegetation cover, the
   accumulation of biomass and mulch on the ground with respect to grazing
   (P < 0.01). The hydrological function improved with the application of
   rest compared to grazing, which was reflected in a higher infiltration
   capacity and soil moisture content (P < 0.01). The ecological processes
   improved with resting compared to grazing expressed by the increase of
   the ecological status of the pasture, in response to the improvement of
   the components that determine its value, such as forage species and
   vigor (P < 0.01).},

Abstract = {The efficiency of three domestic wastewater treatment systems with
   Eisenia foetida, Eichornia crassipes and calcium hypochlorite in
   Moquegua was determined. A representative sample of domestic wastewater
   (tributary) was taken and physical (temperature and STS), chemical (pH
   and BOD5) and microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) parameters were
   analyzed to determine its initial state. This tributary-previous
   pre-sedimentation process- was treated in three depuration systems: the
   first with E. foetida, the second with E. foetida + E. crassipes, and
   the third with E. foetida + E. crassipes + Ca( ClO)(2). E. foetida, in
   turn, was evaluated in function of different irrigation rates: A(1) (0.5
   {[}m(3)/day]/m(2)), A(2) (1 {[}m(3)/day]/m(2)) and A(0) (control group:
   no treatment); E. crassipes was evaluated in function of retention time:
   B-1 (7 days), B-2 (14 days) and B-0 (control group: no treatment); and
   Ca(ClO)(2) was evaluated in function of C-1 (application of calcium
   hypochlorite) and C-0 (control group: no treatment). The effluents were
   analyzed considering the same parameters as in the tributary, each one
   with two repetitions, applying the analysis of variance (ANOVA) as a
   statistical test and the Tukey test. The obtained results showed that
   there are significant differences between the proposed depuration
   systems, being determined as the most efficient system to the conformed

Abstract = {A study was carried out in the provinces of Guayas and Los Rios
   (Ecuador), with the objective of characterizing rice production systems;
   one under salinity conditions in Yaguachi and the other without
   salinization problems in the Babahoyo canton. Economic, social and
   ecological indicators were developed, suitable for the rice systems
   under study to determine the level of sustainability. The evaluation
   through indicators allowed to objectively detect critical points in
   these localities that affect sustainability. In the environmental
   aspect, the salinity indicator, classified as medium to high risk, and
   the indicator for the application of agrochemicals, characterized by the
   intensive use of pesticides and fertilizers, are those that most
   negatively affect the sustainability, especially, of the rice system in
   Yaguachi. In the economic dimension, the monoculture system indicator
   that generates additional income losses and the lack of diversity of
   products used for sale and food negatively affect the two rice
   production systems. In the social aspect, the indicators that contribute
   to greater sustainability were the quality of housing, degree of
   satisfaction and relationships with other members of the community. The
   General Sustainability Indices for the two rice production systems in
   Yaguachi and Babahoyo were 1.92 and 2.12, respectively.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to evaluate the capability of lactic
   acid bacteria (LAB) to remove pathogens present in domestic wastewater,
   generated in the eco-touristic circuit Lomas de Lucumo (Lima, Peru). The
   pH decrease was used as an indicator of the elimination of fecal
   coliform bacteria in the treated water. Experiments included 36
   treatments, which consisted of different mixtures of sugar molasses and
   a lactic acid bacteria inoculum (B-Lac) in proportions of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
   and 10\% (v/v) and wastewater in a fixed proportion of 200 ml, under a
   completely randomized design (CRD) with factorial arrangement 6x6. The
   pH values on the third day were evaluated using an Analysis of Variance
   (ANOVA) followed by Tukey ` s range test for mean differences (p <
   0.05). The different treatments were analyzed in a first stage for 9
   days, after which the best three were selected for a second evaluation:
   T16 (3\% molasses and 5\% B-Lac), T22 (5\% molasses and 5\% B-Lac) and
   T33 (10\% molasses and 3\% B-Lac); results show that the interaction
   effect between the two variables is significant. Finally, treatment T16
   was selected as the most efficient, reaching a pH of 4.08 in a short
   time (3 days) that assured the complete removal of fecal coliform
   bacteria (9.65x10(5) MPN/100 ml) in the wastewater.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to characterize halotolerant bacteria
   isolated from the ripened salty process of Engraulis ringens from a
   fishing company at Chimbote (Peru). For this, three fish samples were
   collected at the beginning and at the end of the process. 14
   halotolerant bacteria were isolated, 12 from medium containing 5\% NaCl
   and two from 10\% NaCl. Its growth capacity was evaluated from 4 to 50
   degrees C and 2.5 to 12.5\% NaCl, as well as its biochemical activity by
   oxidase, urease, indole and citrate tests, carbohydrate fermentation,
   hydrolysis of starch, casein and gelatin, and sensitivity to penicillin,
   chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, rifampicin,
   sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, and
   novobiocin. 71\% of strains grew from 25 to 44 degrees C, up to 10\%
   NaCl, and showed proteolytic and amylolytic activities. The molecular
   characterization was carried out by amplification and sequencing the 16S
   ribosomal genes and these were analyzed using BioEdit and BLASTn
   programs. From this characterization, the genera Bacillus (2),
   Staphylococcus (6), Oceanobacillus (1), Salinococcus (1), Psychrobacter
   (2) and Sporosarcina (2) were obtained. Five genera of isolated
   halotolerant bacteria (Bacillus, Oceanobacillus, Salinicoccus,
   Psychrobacter and Sporosarcina) were of marine origin, they are
   non-pathogenic or no pollution indicators. Conversely, BH1 strain of
   Staphylococcus showed sensitivity only to nalidixic acid, while BH14 was
   resistant to all antimicrobials. Therefore, it is necessary to implement
   measures that ensure the safety of anchovies.},

Abstract = {The effect of Scleroderma verrucosum (Vaill) Pers and Rhizopogon
   luteolus Fr. \& Nordh. was evaluated on the morphological and biological
   quality of Pinus radiata D. Don plants in a nursery in Vilcashuaman,
   Ayacucho, Peru. Treatments: (1) Mycorrhization with Scleroderma
   verrucosum, (2) Mycorrhization with Rhizopogon luteolus, (3) Mixture of
   both fungi, and (4) Control, in a completely randomized design with 10
   repetitions per treatment. The fungi came from local Pinus radiata and
   Eucalyptus globulus forests. The inoculation was carried out in the peal
   at 30 days of sowing and the evaluation at 7.5 months after the peal.
   The mycorrhizal pines outperformed the control with significant
   differences in all the variables evaluated. In the stem neck diameter
   and dry matter of the aerial part, the inoculated treatments did not
   present significant differences; however, in the height, dry matter of
   the root, and total dry matter, the Mixture treatment stood out. In the
   biological quality, a greater number of mycorrhizae was observed in the
   inoculated, with significant differences compared to the control without
   mycorrhizae. A higher percentage of monopodial mycorrhizae (91\%) was
   evidenced in relation to dichotomous (8.5\%) and coralloid (0.6\%)
   types. Significant positive relationships were determined between the
   morphological variables, but these on P. radiata presented
   non-significant associations with the number of mycorrhizae. The
   individual and in mixture use of wild ectomycorrhizal fungi increased
   the morphological and biological quality of P. radiata; therefore, the
   application of these fungi is recommended for the production of
   seedlings in nurseries in Vilcashuaman and other high-Andean areas.},

Abstract = {The lagoons in the Amazon are being impacted by agricultural activities
   and the information about their sediments is scarce; therefore, the
   objective of the study was to determine the physicochemical
   characteristics of the sediments of the Laguna Bella, wetland which will
   contribute to the knowledge of its environmental quality. Thus, using
   standardized techniques, sediments collected at six sampling points were
   analyzed. The results show the values of density, organic matter,
   conductivity, pH, organic matter, N, P, Pb, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and K, which
   were compared with five international standards. Considering the Ontario
   standard, organic matter is below the severe effect level; N is between
   the lowest and most severe effect level, while P is below the lowest
   effect level concentration; Pb is at a moderately contaminated level,
   according to the USEPA standard, but exceeds the NOAA standard. Cu
   exceeded the maximum permissible level of the NOAA standard; Fe exceeds
   the maximum permissible level of USEPA, Ontario, and NOAA standards; Mn
   exceeds the maximum allowable level of NOAA standards, and Zn exceeds
   the NOAA standard. It is concluded that the density of the sediments is
   uniform, the pH is slightly alkaline, the salinity is negligible, and
   the concentration of metals, such as Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu, exceeds
   international standards and indicates the deterioration of the
   environmental quality of the wetland.},

   allows predicting its behavior in the future, becoming a tool for
   managing water resources. In this sense, the objective of the work was
   to model the average annual discharges of the Pisco / Ica / Peru River
   using the program MAR1 - Autoregressive model of order 1, through the
   analysis of its time series, to simulate and quantify its availability
   as part of the Hydrological Ecosystem Service (SEH) of provision for
   different uses. The statistics of the series, parameters of the model
   and the adjustment to theoretical probability distributions, were
   obtained with the use of the MAR1 program, which is a computational code
   in MATLAB R2016a developed specifically for this work, with which the
   outputs of downloads were tabulated and graphed of the successive
   simulations carried out. The results indicate that the autoregressive
   model of order 1 adjusted to the Gamma distribution is the most
   appropriate to model the annual discharges of the Pisco River, because
   it reports the lowest value of the root of the mean square error (RSME).
   The tests of goodness of statistical and graphic adjustment report
   equality between historical and simulated statistics, verifying the
   principle of randomness in the residuals of the simulated series. In
   addition, in the evaluation of the provision SEH, the availability of
   surface water for storage purposes was estimated, demonstrating the
   tendency to decrease the discharge volumes of the Pisco River.},

Abstract = {Lupinus mutabilis, or tarwi, is a crop with a great cultural and
   nutritional importance. It has advantageous agricultural characteristics
   probably related to its native microflora. The aim was to characterize
   microflora associated with Lupinus mutabilis roots, stems, nodules and
   rhizosphere. Tests were performed according to PGPR capacities: indol
   acetic acid (IAA) production, tricalcic phosphates solubilization,
   siderophores production, antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum, in vitro
   fixation of nitrogen and tarwi seedlings growth effect. Microorganisms
   were obtained from plants growing in Lima and Jauja fields; we isolated
   143 fungal strains and 190 bacterial strains. The most antagonist fungal
   strain inhibited 74\% of the pathogen growth which was identified as
   Aspergillus. The IAA production test was used as initial screening in
   bacterial isolates, resulting in 36 strains with high and medium
   production. Then, we obtained up to 4.96 efficiency in phosphate
   solubilization test; 5.00 efficiency in the production of siderophores
   and up to 49.3\% of inhibition in the antagonism test against a tarwi
   pathogen. The highest nitrogen fixation has found in strain NR05 with a
   concentration of 6 mg center dot l(-1) of ammonium ion. Most of the
   bacterial isolates identified belong to the Bacillaceae family. Finally,
   the seedlings inoculated with strain TB05 reached the best values in
   plant height with an increase of 10\% compared to the control. These
   results suggest the high potential of use in biofertilizers development
   from these microorganisms.},

Abstract = {A current topic in forestry concerns the regeneration of forests and
   degraded lands. An important aspect in this respect refers to the timing
   that different forests take to recover naturally, recomposing their
   original levels of diversity and other parameters key to their
   functioning as ecosystems. The present work focuses on the above
   mentioned, in premontane humid forests of central Peru, in the valley of
   Chanchamayo, Department of Junin, between 1 000 - 1 500 masl. A total of
   19 Gentry's Transects of 2 x 500 m, including all woody plants >= 2.5 cm
   Diameter at Breast Height, were performed in areas of mature forests,
   and forests of different ages subsequent to clearing without burning.
   Alpha-diversity and composition of the tree flora under these conditions
   were compared and analyzed. From 40 years of age on, the value of
   Fisher's Alfa diversity index becomes quite similar to the one of mature
   forests; from 30 years onwards, the taxonomic composition of species
   under different ages reaches a similarity of 69 - 73\% with those in
   mature forests. Families, genera and species were compared, and it was
   found out that forests up to 20 years are characterized by the presence
   of Piperaceae; from 30 years on, by the Moraceae family.},

Abstract = {This study is based on the studies of herbaceous plants, birds and
   coleoptera that were carried out between 1998 and 2001 in the Lachay
   National Reserve, and is based on the interest of generating a
   biological early warning of the El Nino event. The present study
   incorporated two samples for beetles in 2002 and two samples for each
   group in 2010. The objective of the research was to evaluate the
   variation of the biotic variables of the three biological groups under
   the El Nino Event between 1998-2001 and 2010, to identify indicator
   variables of the El Nino Event. In the plots, composition, abundance,
   diversity, and functional groups were estimated. In addition, for
   herbaceous plants, vegetation cover, density, IVI and Cinv were
   evaluated. Some variables (C-inv Abundance, C-inv Coverage, C-inv IVI
   native and/or endemic and in vegetation coverage) suggest a positive
   relationship with the Global Nino because they increase after its
   manifestation, from a very strong to moderate El Nino event, favoring
   the appearance of endemic herbaceous species. Other variables proposed
   for monitoring are the abundance and richness of beetles, alpha
   diversity and richness of birds, as well as the percentage of abundance
   of chamaephytes, the percentage of abundance of nanophanerophytes, and
   the abundance of predatory group. Some key species are Croton ruizianus,
   Trixis cacalioides, Crassula connata, Fuertesimalva peruviana, Nicotiana
   paniculata, and IVIg as key variable.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this work were: to delimit the growing seasons of the
   M. maximus pastoral systems in El 14 establishment, Departamento Moreno,
   Santiago del Estero, Argentina, in the 2000-2021 period using time
   series of NDVIMODIS and threshold 0.5 NDVIRATIO; to quantify their
   aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and their responses to
   seasonal rainfall anomalies; to quantify the rain use efficiency (RUE),
   relate it to seasonal rainfall and determine its trend in the period.
   Growing seasons (GS) start in November and end in May. Significant
   differences were found in the ANPP of GS with anomalies positive and
   negative of seasonal rainfall. ANPP recovers after GS with negative
   rainfall anomalies, evidencing their resilience capacity after extreme
   weather events. The RUE had a high negative trend in the period.
   Significant differences were found in the RUE and seasonal rainfall.
   Most of RUE are related to the normal range of rainfall for the study
   area. In turn, growing season with lowest RUE were related to rainfall
   >= 700 mm. Seasonal rainfall of 700 mm could be considered the threshold
   in the loss of water of pastoral systems. Anthropic activities like
   deforestation and livestock, added to shifts in seasonal storm in
   intensity/magnitude, number of rainy, timing and frequency, they would
   contribute to the loss of large amounts of water by surface runoff in
   the study area. The local information obtained enables the
   implementation of appropriate management strategies in order to mitigate
   extreme climatic adversities.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem service of water regulation is one of the most important
   offered by the high Andean ecosystems. However, knowledge about its
   contribution in hydrological terms is still scarce and its estimation is
   difficult, due to the complex eco-hydrological and climatic processes,
   and environmental characteristics of the Andes. Therefore, the influence
   of three types of ecosystems (humid puna grassland, tropical high-Andean
   wetland (bofedal) and Polylepis forest) was estimated on water flows,
   particularly flows that reach underground storage, which is equivalent
   to the ecosystem service of water regulation. This study was developed
   during the hydrological year 2018 - 2019 in the Rontoccocha hydrographic
   unit, between 3 900 and 4 635 masl, in the Apurimac Region, Peru. For
   this, the water balance for each type of ecosystem was modeled with the
   Hydrobal eco-hydrological tool. Variables of: a) vegetation, b) climatic
   parameters, and c) soil characteristics were used. The results reveal
   the contribution of the vegetation cover in the hydric regulation. In
   each ecosystem, about 15\% of all the rainfall that falls in the basin
   reaches underground storage. These data, extrapolated to the entire
   hydrographic unit, show that the humid puna grassland regulates 80\%,
   the tropical high-Andean wetland 17\%, and the Polylepis forest 3\%.
   Although the evaluation was carried out separately for each ecosystem,
   for management purposes, it is necessary to address them in an
   integrative way since interdependence relationships are established
   between them.},

   substitution models to phylogenetic data negatively affects the
   discriminatory power of previous methods and can make them insensitive
   to lineage-specific changes in the substitution process. As an
   alternative, I propose evaluating absolute fit of substitution models
   based on a novel statistic which describes the observed data without
   information loss and which is unlikely to become zero-inflated with
   increasing numbers of taxa. This method can accommodate gaps and is
   sensitive to lineage-specific shifts in the substitution process. In
   simulation experiments, it exhibits greater discriminatory power than
   previous methods. The method can be implemented in both Bayesian and
   Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, and used to screen any set of
   models. Recently, it has been suggested that model selection may be an
   unnecessary step in phylogenetic inference. However, results presented
   here emphasize the importance of model fit assessment for reliable
   phylogenetic inference. {[}Absolute model fit; model misspecification;

Abstract = {The segmented trapdoor spiders (Liphistiidae) are the sole surviving
   family of the suborder Mesothelae, which forms the sister lineage to all
   other living spiders. Liphistiids have retained a number of
   plesiomorphic traits and their present-day distribution is limited to
   East and Southeast Asia. Studying this group has the potential to shed
   light on the deep evolutionary history of spiders, but the phylogeny and
   divergence times of the family have not been resolved with confidence.
   We performed phylogenomic and molecular dating analyses of 2765
   ultraconserved element loci from 185 liphistiid taxa. Our analyses show
   that the crown group of Liphistiidae appeared in the mid-Cretaceous at
   102 Ma (95\% credibility interval 92-113 Ma), but it was not until the
   Neogene that much of the diversification within the family occurred in
   mainland Southeast and East Asia. This diversification was coincident
   with tectonic events such as the extension of the East Asian continental
   margin, as well as geological upheavals in Indochina induced by the
   collision between India and Asia. Our study highlights the important
   role of major tectonic events in shaping the evolutionary history,
   present-day diversity, and geographical distribution of mesothele and
   liphistiid spiders.},

Title = {Paralogs and Off-Target Sequences Improve Phylogenetic Resolution in a

Abstract = {We present a 517-gene phylogenetic framework for the breadfruit genus
   Artocarpus (ca. 70 spp., Moraceae), making use of silica-dried leaves
   from recent fieldwork and herbarium specimens (some up to 106 years old)
   to achieve 96\% taxon sampling. We explore issues relating to assembly,
   paralogous loci, partitions, and analysis method to reconstruct a
   phylogeny that is robust to variation in data and available tools.
   Although codon partitioning did not result in any substantial
   topological differences, the inclusion of flanking noncoding sequence in
   analyses significantly increased the resolution of gene trees. We also
   found that increasing the size of data sets increased convergence
   between analysis methods but did not reduce gene-tree conflict. We
   optimized the HybPiper targeted-enrichment sequence assembly pipeline
   for short sequences derived from degraded DNA extracted from museum
   specimens. Although the subgenera of Artocarpus were monophyletic,
   revision is required at finer scales, particularly with respect to
   widespread species. We expect our results to provide a basis for further
   studies in Artocarpus and provide guidelines for future analyses of data
   sets based on target enrichment data, particularly those using sequences
   from both fresh and museum material, counseling careful attention to the
   potential of off-target sequences to improve resolution.},

Abstract = {Gene tree discordance is expected in phylogenomic trees and biological
   processes are often invoked to explain it. However, heterogeneous levels
   of phylogenetic signal among individuals within data sets may cause
   artifactual sources of topological discordance. We examined how the
   information content in tips and subclades impacts topological
   discordance in the parrots (Order: Psittaciformes), a diverse and highly
   threatened clade of nearly 400 species. Using ultraconserved elements
   from 96\% of the clade's species-level diversity, we estimated
   concatenated and species trees for 382 ingroup taxa. We found that
   discordance among tree topologies was most common at nodes dating
   between the late Miocene and Pliocene, and often at the taxonomic level
   of the genus. Accordingly, we used two metrics to characterize
   information content in tips and assess the degree to which conflict
   between trees was being driven by lower-quality samples. Most instances
   of topological conflict and nonmonophyletic genera in the species tree
   could be objectively identified using these metrics. For subclades still
   discordant after tip-based filtering, we used a machine learning
   approach to determine whether phylogenetic signal or noise was the more
   important predictor of metrics supporting the alternative topologies. We
   found that when signal favored one of the topologies, the noise was the
   most important variable in poorly performing models that favored the
   alternative topology. In sum, we show that artifactual sources of gene
   tree discordance, which are likely a common phenomenon in many data
   sets, can be distinguished from biological sources by quantifying the
   information content in each tip and modeling which factors support each
   topology.},

Abstract = {Phylodynamic models generally aim at jointly inferring phylogenetic
   relationships, model parameters, and more recently, the number of
   lineages through time, based on molecular sequence data. In the fields
   of epidemiology and macroevolution, these models can be used to
   estimate, respectively, the past number of infected individuals
   (prevalence) or the past number of species (paleodiversity) through
   time. Recent years have seen the development of ``total-evidence{''}
   analyses, which combine molecular and morphological data from extant and
   past sampled individuals in a unified Bayesian inference framework. Even
   sampled individuals characterized only by their sampling time, that is,
   lacking morphological and molecular data, which we call occurrences,
   provide invaluable information to estimate the past number of lineages.
   Here, we present new methodological developments around the fossilized
   birth-death process enabling us to (i) incorporate occurrence data in
   the likelihood function; (ii) consider piecewise-constant birth, death,
   and sampling rates; and (iii) estimate the past number of lineages, with
   or without knowledge of the underlying tree. We implement our method in
   the RevBayes software environment, enabling its use along with a large
   set of models of molecular and morphological evolution, and validate the
   inference workflow using simulations under a wide range of conditions.
   We finally illustrate our new implementation using two empirical data
   sets stemming from the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution. In
   epidemiology, we infer the prevalence of the coronavirus disease 2019
   outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship, by taking into account jointly
   the case count record (occurrences) along with viral sequences for a
   fraction of infected individuals. In macroevolution, we infer the
   diversity trajectory of cetaceans using molecular and morphological data
   from extant taxa, morphological data from fossils, as well as numerous
   fossil occurrences. The joint modeling of occurrences and trees holds
   the promise to further bridge the gap between traditional epidemiology
   and pathogen genomics, as well as paleontology and molecular
   phylogenetics. {[}Birth-death model; epidemiology; fossils;

Abstract = {Although first posited to be of a single origin, the two superfamilies
   of phalangeriform marsupial possums (Phalangeroidea: brushtail possums
   and cuscuses and Petauroidea: possums and gliders) have long been
   considered, based on multiple sequencing studies, to have evolved from
   two separate origins. However, previous data from these sequence
   analyses suggested a variety of conflicting trees. Therefore, we
   reinvestigated these relationships by screening similar to 200,000
   orthologous short interspersed element (SINE) loci across the newly
   available whole-genome sequences of phalangeriform species and their
   relatives. Compared to sequence data, SINE presence/absence patterns are
   evolutionarily almost neutral molecular markers of the phylogenetic
   history of species. Their random and highly complex genomic insertion
   ensures their virtually homoplasy-free nature and enables one to compare
   hundreds of shared unique orthologous events to determine the true
   species tree. Here, we identify 106 highly reliable phylogenetic SINE
   markers whose presence/ absence patterns within multiple Australasian
   possum genomes unexpectedly provide the first significant evidence for
   the reunification of Australasian possums into one monophyletic group.
   Together, our findings indicate that nucleotide homoplasy and ancestral
   incomplete lineage sorting have most likely driven the conflicting
   signal distributions seen in previous sequence-based studies.},

Title = {Ecological Divergence and the History of Gene Flow in the Nearctic
   Milksnakes (Lampropeltis triangulum Complex)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {839-858},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Many phylogeographic studies on species with large ranges have found
   genetic-geographic structure associated with changes in habitat and
   physical barriers preventing or reducing gene flow. These interactions
   with geographic space, contemporary and historical climate, and
   biogeographic barriers have complex effects on contemporary population
   genetic structure and processes of speciation. While allopatric
   speciation at biogeographic barriers is considered the primary mechanism
   for generating species, more recently it has been shown that parapatric
   modes of divergence may be equally or even more common. With genomic
   data and better modeling capabilities, we can more clearly define causes
   of speciation in relation to biogeography and migration between
   lineages, the location of hybrid zones with respect to the ecology of
   parental lineages, and differential introgression of genes between taxa.
   Here, we examine the origins of three Nearctic milksnakes (Lampropeltis
   elapsoides, Lampropeltis triangulum and Lampropeltis gentilis) using
   genome-scale data to better understand species diversification. Results
   from artificial neural networks show that a mix of a strong
   biogeographic barrier, environmental changes, and physical space has
   affected genetic structure in these taxa. These results underscore
   conspicuous environmental changes that occur as the sister taxa L.
   triangulum and L. gentilis diverged near the Great Plains into the
   forested regions of the Eastern Nearctic. This area has been recognized
   as a region for turnover for many vertebrate species, but as we show
   here the contemporary boundary does not isolate these sister species.
   These two species likely formed in the mid-Pleistocene and have remained
   partially reproductively isolated over much of this time, showing
   differential introgression of loci. We also demonstrate that when L.
   triangulum and L. gentilis are each in contact with the much older L.
   elapsoides, some limited gene flow has occurred. Given the strong
   agreement between nuclear and mtDNA genomes, along with estimates of
   ecological niche, we suggest that all three lineages should continue to
   be recognized as unique species. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the
   importance of considering complex modes of divergence and differential
   allelic introgression over a complex landscape when testing mechanisms
   of speciation. {[}Cline; delimitation; Eastern Nearctic; Great Plains;

Title = {Analysis of Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data Pinpoints Multiple
   Ancient Polyploidy Events in Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {190-207},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Target enrichment is becoming increasingly popular for phylogenomic
   studies. Although baits for enrichment are typically designed to target
   single-copy genes, paralogs are often recovered with increased
   sequencing depth, sometimes from a significant proportion of loci,
   especially in groups experiencing whole-genome duplication (WGD) events.
   Common approaches for processing paralogs in target enrichment data sets
   include random selection, manual pruning, and mainly, the removal of
   entire genes that show any evidence of paralogy. These approaches are
   prone to errors in orthology inference or removing large numbers of
   genes. By removing entire genes, valuable information that could be used
   to detect and place WGD events is discarded. Here, we used an automated
   approach for orthology inference in a target enrichment data set of 68
   species of Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae), a widely distributed clade of
   plants primarily from temperate climate regions. Previous molecular
   phylogenetic studies and chromosome numbers both suggested ancient WGDs
   in the group. However, both the phylogenetic location and putative
   parental lineages of these WGD events remain unknown. By taking paralogs
   into consideration and inferring orthologs from target enrichment data,
   we identified four nodes in the backbone of Alchemilla s.l. with an
   elevated proportion of gene duplication. Furthermore, using a gene-tree
   reconciliation approach, we established the autopolyploid origin of the
   entire Alchemilla s.l. and the nested allopolyploid origin of four major
   clades within the group. Here, we showed the utility of automated
   tree-based orthology inference methods, previously designed for genomic
   or transcriptomic data sets, to study complex scenarios of polyploidy
   and reticulate evolution from target enrichment data sets.},

Title = {Modeling Mito-nuclear Compatibility and Its Role in Species
   Identification},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mitochondrial genetic material (mtDNA) is widely used for phylogenetic
   reconstruction and as a barcode for species identification. The utility
   of mtDNA in these contexts derives from its particular molecular
   properties, including its high evolutionary rate, uniparental
   inheritance, and small size. ButmtDNA may also play a fundamental role
   in speciation-as suggested by recent observations of coevolution with
   the nuclear DNA, along with the fact that respiration depends on
   coordination of genes from both sources. Here, we study how mito-nuclear
   interactions affect the accuracy of species identification by mtDNA, as
   well as the speciation process itself. We simulate the evolution of a
   population of individuals who carry a recombining nuclear genome and a
   mitochondrial genome inherited maternally. We compare a null model
   fitness landscape that lacks any mito-nuclear interaction against a
   scenario in which interactions influence fitness. Fitness is assigned to
   individuals according to their mito-nuclear compatibility, which drives
   the coevolution of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Depending on
   the model parameters, the population breaks into distinct species and
   the model output then allows us to analyze the accuracy of mtDNA barcode
   for species identification. Remarkably, we find that species
   identification by mtDNA is equally accurate in the presence or absence
   of mito-nuclear coupling and that the success of the DNA barcode derives
   mainly from population geographical isolation during speciation.
   Nevertheless, selection imposed by mito-nuclear compatibility influences
   the diversification process and leaves signatures in the genetic content
   and spatial distribution of the populations, in three ways. First,
   speciation is delayed and the resulting phylogenetic trees are more
   balanced. Second, clades in the resulting phylogenetic tree correlate
   more strongly with the spatial distribution of species and clusters of
   more similar mtDNA's. Third, there is a substantial increase in the
   intraspecies mtDNA similarity, decreasing the number of alleles
   substitutions per locus and promoting the conservation of genetic
   information. We compare the evolutionary patterns observed in our model
   to empirical data from copepods (Tigriopus californicus). We find good
   qualitative agreement in the geographic patterns and the topology of the
   phylogenetic tree, provided the model includes selection based on
   mito-nuclear interactions. These results highlight the role of
   mito-nuclear compatibility in the speciation process and its
   reconstruction from genetic data.},

Title = {Interspecific Gene Flow and Mitochondrial Genome Capture during the
   Radiation of Jamaican Anolis Lizards (Squamata; Iguanidae)},

Abstract = {Gene flow and reticulation are increasingly recognized as important
   processes in the diversification of many taxonomic groups. With the
   increasing ease of collecting genomic data and the development of
   multispecies coalescent network approaches, such reticulations can be
   accounted for when inferring phylogeny and diversification. Caribbean
   Anolis lizards are a classic example of an adaptive radiation in which
   species have independently radiated on the islands of the Greater
   Antilles into the same ecomorph classes. Within the Jamaican radiation
   at least one species, Anolis opalinus, has been documented to be
   polyphyletic in its mitochondrial DNA, which could be the result of an
   ancient reticulation event or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we
   generate mtDNA and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data and implement
   gene tree, species tree, and multispecies coalescent network methods to
   infer the diversification of this group. Our mtDNA gene tree recovers
   the same relationships previously inferred for this group, which is
   strikingly different from the species tree inferred from our GBS data.
   Posterior predictive simulations suggest that our genomic data violate
   commonly adopted assumptions of the multispecies coalescent model
   (MSCM), so we use network approaches to infer phylogenetic
   relationships. The inferred network topology contains a reticulation
   event but does not explain the mtDNA polyphyly observed in this group;
   however, coalescent simulations suggest that the observed mtDNA topology
   is likely the result of past introgression. How common a signature of
   gene flow and reticulation is across the radiation of Anolis is unknown;
   however, the reticulation events that we demonstrate here may have
   allowed for adaptive evolution, as has been suggested in other, more
   recent, adaptive radiations. {[}Adaptive radiation; hybridization;

Abstract = {Hybridization between species occurs more frequently in vertebrates than
   traditionally thought, but distinguishing ancient hybridization from
   other phenomena that generate similar evolutionary patterns remains
   challenging. Here, we used a comprehensive workflow to discover evidence
   of ancient hybridization between the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis)
   from Indonesia and a common ancestor of an Australian group of monitor
   lizards known colloquially as sand monitors. Our data comprise >300
   nuclear loci, mitochondrial genomes, phenotypic data, fossil and
   contemporary records, and past/present climatic data. We show that the
   four sand monitor species share more nuclear alleles with V. komodoensis
   than expected given a bifurcating phylogeny, likely as a result of
   hybridization between the latter species and a common ancestor of sand
   monitors. Sand monitors display phenotypes that are intermediate between
   their closest relatives and V. komodoensis. Biogeographic analyses
   suggest that V. komodoensis and ancestral sand monitors co-occurred in
   northern Australia. In agreement with the fossil record, this provides
   further evidence that the Komodo dragon once inhabited the Australian
   continent. Our study show show different sources of evidence can be used
   to thoroughly characterize evolutionary histories that deviate from a
   treelike pattern, that hybridization can have long-lasting effects on
   phenotypes, and that detecting hybridization can improve our
   understanding of evolutionary and biogeographic patterns.},

Title = {Markov-Modulated Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Identify Site- and
   Branch-Specific Evolutionary Variation in BEAST},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {181-189},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Markov models of character substitution on phylogenies form the
   foundation of phylogenetic inference frameworks. Early models made the
   simplifying assumption that the substitution process is homogeneous over
   time and across sites in the molecular sequence alignment. While
   standard practice adopts extensions that accommodate heterogeneity of
   substitution rates across sites, heterogeneity in the process over time
   in a site-specific manner remains frequently overlooked. This is
   problematic, as evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level
   are highly variable, subjecting different sites to different selective
   constraints over time, impacting their substitution behavior. We propose
   incorporating time variability through Markov-modulated models (MMMs),
   which extend covarion-like models and allow the substitution process
   (including relative character exchange rates as well as the overall
   substitution rate) at individual sites to vary across lineages. We
   implement a general MMM framework in BEAST, a popular Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference software package, allowing researchers to compose
   a wide range of MMMs through flexible XML specification. Using examples
   from bacterial, viral, and plastid genome evolution, we show that MMMs
   impact phylogenetic tree estimation and can substantially improve model
   fit compared to standard substitution models. Through simulations, we
   show that marginal likelihood estimation accurately identifies the
   generative model and does not systematically prefer the more
   parameter-rich MMMs. To mitigate the increased computational demands
   associated with MMMs, our implementation exploits recent developments in
   BEAGLE, a high-performance computational library for phylogenetic
   inference.},

Title = {Early origins of divergent patterns of morphological evolution on the

Abstract = {The origin of amniotes 320 million years ago signalled independence from
   water in vertebrates and was closely followed by divergences within the
   mammal and reptile stem lineages (Synapsida and Reptilia). Early members
   of both groups had highly similar morphologies, being superficially
   `lizard-like' forms with many plesiomorphies. However, the extent to
   which they might have exhibited divergent patterns of evolutionary
   change, with potential to explain the large biological differences
   between their living members, is unresolved. We use a new, comprehensive
   phylogenetic dataset to quantify variation in rates and constraints of
   morphological evolution among Carboniferous-early Permian amniotes. We
   find evidence for an early burst of evolutionary rates, resulting in the
   early origins of morphologically distinctive subgroups that mostly
   persisted through the Cisuralian. Rates declined substantially through
   time, especially in reptiles. Early reptile evolution was also more
   constrained compared to early synapsids, exploring a more limited
   character state space. Postcranial innovation in particular was
   important in early synapsids, potentially related to their early origins
   of large body size. In contrast, early reptiles predominantly varied the
   temporal region, suggesting disparity in skull and jaw kinematics, and
   foreshadowing the variability of cranial biomechanics seen in reptiles
   today. Our results demonstrate that synapsids and reptiles underwent an
   early divergence of macroevolutionary patterns. This laid the foundation
   for subsequent evolutionary events and may be critical in understanding
   the substantial differences between mammals and reptiles today.
   Potential explanations include an early divergence of developmental
   processes or of ecological factors, warranting cross-disciplinary
   investigation.},

Title = {A Genomic Perspective on the Evolutionary Diversification of Turtles},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAR 7},
Abstract = {To examine phylogenetic heterogeneity in turtle evolution, we collected
   thousands of high-confidence single-copy orthologs from 19 genome
   assemblies representative of extant turtle diversity and estimated a
   phylogeny with multispecies coalescent and concatenated partitioned
   methods. We also collected next-generation sequences from 26 turtle
   species and assembled millions of biallelic markers to reconstruct
   phylogenies based on annotated regions from the western painted turtle
   (Chrysemys picta bellii) genome (coding regions, introns, untranslated
   regions, intergenic, and others). We then measured gene tree-species
   tree discordance, as well as gene and site heterogeneity at each node in
   the inferred trees, and tested for temporal patterns in phylogenomic
   conflict across turtle evolution. We found strong and consistent support
   for all bifurcations in the inferred turtle species phylogenies.
   However, a number of genes, sites, and genomic features supported
   alternate relationships between turtle taxa. Our results suggest that
   gene tree-species tree discordance in these data sets is likely driven
   by population-level processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. We
   found very little effect of substitutional saturation on species tree
   topologies, and no clear phylogenetic patterns in codon usage bias and
   compositional heterogeneity. There was no correlation between gene and
   site concordance, node age, and DNA substitution rate across most
   annotated genomic regions. Our study demonstrates that heterogeneity is
   to be expected even in well-resolved clades such as turtles, and that
   future phylogenomic studies should aim to sample as much of the genome
   as possible in order to obtain accurate phylogenies for assessing
   conservation priorities in turtles. {[}Discordance; genomes; phylogeny;

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {As genomic sequence data become increasingly available, inferring the
   phylogeny of the species as that of concatenated genomic data can be
   enticing. However, this approach makes for a biased estimator of branch
   lengths and substitution rates and an inconsistent estimator of tree
   topology. Bayesian multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods address these
   issues. This is achieved by constraining a set of gene trees within a
   species tree and jointly inferring both under a Bayesian framework.
   However, this approach comes at the cost of increased computational
   demand. Here, we introduce StarBeast3-a software package for efficient
   Bayesian inference under the MSC model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We
   gain efficiency by introducing cutting-edge proposal kernels and
   adaptive operators, and StarBeast3 is particularly efficient when a
   relaxed clock model is applied. Furthermore, gene-tree inference is
   parallelized, allowing the software to scale with the size of the
   problem. We validated our software and benchmarked its performance using
   three real and two synthetic data sets. Our results indicate that
   StarBeast3 is up to one-and-a-half orders of magnitude faster than
   StarBeast2, and therefore more than two orders faster than {*}BEAST,
   depending on the data set and on the parameter, and can achieve
   convergence on large data sets with hundreds of genes. StarBeast3 is
   open-source and is easy to set up with a friendly graphical user
   interface. {[}Adaptive; Bayesian inference; BEAST 2; effective

Pages = {1255-1270},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses often produce large numbers of trees. Mapping
   trees' distribution in ``tree space{''} can illuminate the behavior and
   performance of search strategies, reveal distinct clusters of optimal
   trees, and expose differences between different data sources or
   phylogenetic methods-but the high-dimensional spaces defined by metric
   distances are necessarily distorted when represented in fewer
   dimensions. Here, I explore the consequences of this transformation in
   phylogenetic search results from 128 morphological data sets, using
   stratigraphic congruence-a complementary aspect of tree similarity-to
   evaluate the utility of low-dimensional mappings. I find that
   phylogenetic similarities between cladograms are most accurately
   depicted in tree spaces derived from information-theoretic tree
   distances or the quartet distance. Robinson-Foulds tree spaces exhibit
   prominent distortions and often fail to group trees according to
   phylogenetic similarity, whereas the strong influence of tree shape on
   the Kendall-Colijn distance makes its tree space unsuitable for many
   purposes. Distances mapped into two or even three dimensions often
   display little correspondence with true distances, which can lead to
   profound misrepresentation of clustering structure. Without explicit
   testing, one cannot be confident that a tree space mapping faithfully
   represents the true distribution of trees, nor that visually evident
   structure is valid. My recommendations for tree space validation and
   visualization are implemented in a new graphical user interface in the
   ``TreeDist{''} R package. {[}Multidimensional scaling; phylogenetic

Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1009-1022},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses may suffer from multiple sources of error leading
   to conflict between genes and methods of inference. The evolutionary
   history of the mollusc clade Vetigastropoda makes them susceptible to
   these conflicts, their higher level phylogeny remaining largely
   unresolved. Originating over 350 Ma, vetigastropods were the dominant
   marine snails in the Paleozoic. Multiple extinction events and new
   radiations have resulted in both very long and very short branches and a
   large extant diversity of over 4000 species. This is the perfect setting
   of a hard phylogenetic question in which sources of conflict can be
   explored. We present 41 new transcriptomes across the diversity of
   vetigastropods (62 terminals total), and provide the first genomic-scale
   phylogeny for the group. We find that deep divergences differ from
   previous studies in which long branch attraction was likely pervasive.
   Robust results leading to changes in taxonomy include the paraphyly of
   the order Lepetellida and the family Tegulidae. Tectinae subfam. nov. is
   designated for the clade comprising Tectus, Cittarium, and Rochia. For
   two early divergences, topologies disagreed between concatenated
   analyses using site heterogeneous models versus concatenated partitioned
   analyses and summary coalescent methods. We investigated rate and
   composition heterogeneity among genes, as well as missing data by locus
   and by taxon, none of which had an impact on the inferred topologies. We
   also found no evidence for ancient introgression throughout the
   phylogeny. We further tested whether uninformative genes and
   over-partitioning were responsible for this discordance by evaluating
   the phylogenetic signal of individual genes using likelihood mapping,
   and by analyzing the most informative genes with a full multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model. We find that most genes are not informative at
   the two conflicting nodes, but neither this nor gene-wise partitioning
   are the cause of discordant results. New method implementations that
   simultaneously integrate amino acid profile mixture models and the MSC
   might be necessary to resolve these and other recalcitrant nodes in the
   Tree of Life. {[}Fissurellidae; Haliotidae; likelihood mapping;

Abstract = {Establishing an evolutionary timeline is fundamental for tackling a
   great variety of topics in evolutionary biology, including the
   reconstruction of patterns of historical biogeography, coevolution, and
   diversification. However, the tree of life is pruned by extinction and
   molecular data cannot be gathered for extinct lineages. Until recently
   methodological challenges have prevented the application of tip-dating
   Bayesian approaches in morphology-based fossil-only data sets. Herein,
   we present a morphological data set for a group of cricetid rodents to
   which we apply an array of methods fairly new in paleontology that can
   be used by paleontologists for the analysis of entirely extinct clades.
   We compare the tree topologies obtained by traditional parsimony,
   time-calibrated, and noncalibrated Bayesian inference phylogenetic
   approaches and calculate stratigraphic congruence indices for each.
   Bayesian tip-dated clock methods outperform parsimony in the case of our
   data set, which includes highly homoplastic morphological characters.
   Regardless, all three topologies support the monophyly of
   Megacricetodontinae, Democricetodontinae, and Cricetodontinae. Dispersal
   and speciation events inferred through Bayesian Binary Markov chain
   Monte Carlo and biodiversity analyses provide evidence for a correlation
   between biogeographic events, climatic changes, and diversification in
   cricetids. {[}Bayesian tip-dating; Cricetidae; Miocene; morphological

Title = {Disentangling Sources of Gene Tree Discordance in Phylogenomic Data
   Sets: Testing Ancient Hybridizations in Amaranthaceae s.l.},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Gene tree discordance in large genomic data sets can be caused by
   evolutionary processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and
   hybridization, as well as model violation, and errors in data
   processing, orthology inference, and gene tree estimation. Species tree
   methods that identify and accommodate all sources of conflict are not
   available, but a combination of multiple approaches can help tease apart
   alternative sources of conflict. Here, using a phylotranscriptomic
   analysis in combination with reference genomes, we test a hypothesis of
   ancient hybridization events within the plant family Amaranthaceae s.l.
   thatwas previously supported bymorphological, ecological, and
   Sanger-based molecular data. The data set included seven genomes and 88
   transcriptomes, 17 generated for this study. We examined gene-tree
   discordance using coalescent-based species trees and network inference,
   gene tree discordance analyses, site pattern tests of introgression,
   topology tests, synteny analyses, and simulations. We found that a
   combination of processes might have generated the high levels of gene
   tree discordance in the backbone of Amaranthaceae s.l. Furthermore, we
   found evidence that three consecutive short internal branches produce
   anomalous trees contributing to the discordance. Overall, our results
   suggest that Amaranthaceae s.l. might be a product of an ancient and
   rapid lineage diversification, and remains, and probably will remain,
   unresolved. This work highlights the potential problems of
   identifiability associated with the sources of gene tree discordance
   including, in particular, phylogenetic network methods. Our results also
   demonstrate the importance of thoroughly testing for multiple sources of
   conflict in phylogenomic analyses, especially in the context of ancient,
   rapid radiations. We provide several recommendations for exploring
   conflicting signals in such situations.},

Abstract = {Humic substances are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
   Humic acids (HAs) actively interact with organic and inorganic
   components of lake sediments. This interaction depends on the molecular
   structure and elemental composition of HAs. The presented research
   focuses on the investigation of the composition and molecular structure
   of humic acids isolated from lakes located in the Lena Delta in the
   Russian Arctic. The findings of the research are needed to estimate the
   potential capacity of humic acids to bind microelements, particularly
   toxic metals, in stable compounds. Surface sediment samples (0-10 cm)
   were collected from 8 lakes by Van Veen grab during the summer period of
   the ``Expedition LENA 2019{''}. We analyzed elemental composition of the
   HAs samples. The results showed that the studied HAs of lake sediments
   are characterized by low nitrogen content and prevalence of aliphatic
   fragments in their molecular structure. Furthermore, it was found that
   the studied humic acids are less mature, showing mineralization
   processes dominant over humification, and have relatively low potential
   to complexation compared with soils of the Lena Delta as well as lake
   sediments of territories with more boreal climate conditions.},

Title = {Robust, Universal Tree Balance Indices},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 12},
Abstract = {Balance indices that quantify the symmetry of branching events and the
   compactness of trees are widely used to compare evolutionary processes
   or tree-generating algorithms. Yet, existing indices are not defined for
   all rooted trees, are unreliable for comparing trees with different
   numbers of leaves, and are sensitive to the presence or absence of rare
   types. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we define a
   new class of robust, universal tree balance indices. These indices take
   a form similar to Colless' index but can account for population sizes,
   are defined for trees with any degree distribution, and enable
   meaningful comparison of trees with different numbers of leaves. Second,
   we show that for bifurcating and all other full m-ary cladograms (in
   which every internal node has the same out-degree), one such
   Colless-like index is equivalent to the normalized reciprocal of
   Sackin's index. Hence, we both unify and generalize the two most popular
   existing tree balance indices. Our indices are intrinsically normalized
   and can be computed in linear time. We conclude that these more widely
   applicable indices have the potential to supersede those in current use.

   Divergence and Introgression: The Example of the erato-sara Group of
   Heliconius Butterflies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 16},
Abstract = {Introgressive hybridization plays a key role in adaptive evolution and
   species diversification in many groups of species. However, frequent
   hybridization and gene flow between species make estimation of the
   species phylogeny and key population parameters challenging. Here, we
   show that by accounting for phasing and using full-likelihood methods,
   introgression histories and population parameters can be estimated
   reliably from whole-genome sequence data. We employ the multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model with and without gene flow to infer the species
   phylogeny and cross-species introgression events using genomic data from
   six members of the erato-sara clade of Heliconius butterflies. The
   methods naturally accommodate random fluctuations in genealogical
   history across the genome due to deep coalescence. To avoid heterozygote
   phasing errors in haploid sequences commonly produced by genome assembly
   methods, we process and compile unphased diploid sequence alignments and
   use analytical methods to average over uncertainties in heterozygote
   phase resolution. There is robust evidence for introgression across the
   genome, both among distantly related species deep in the phylogeny and
   between sister species in shallow parts of the tree. We obtain
   chromosome-specific estimates of key population parameters such as
   introgression directions, times and probabilities, as well as species
   divergence times and population sizes for modern and ancestral species.
   We confirm ancestral gene flow between the sara clade and an ancestral
   population of Heliconius telesiphe, a likely hybrid speciation origin
   for Heliconius hecalesia, and gene flow between the sister species
   Heliconius erato and Heliconius himera. Inferred introgression among
   ancestral species also explains the history of two chromosomal
   inversions deep in the phylogeny of the group. This study illustrates
   how a full-likelihood approach based on the MSC makes it possible to
   extract rich historical information of species divergence and gene flow
   from genomic data. {[}3s; bpp; gene flow; Heliconius; hybrid speciation;

Title = {Relative Time Constraints Improve Molecular Dating},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Dating the tree of life is central to understanding the evolution of
   life on Earth. Molecular clocks calibrated with fossils represent the
   state of the art for inferring the ages of major groups. Yet, other
   information on the timing of species diversification can be used to date
   the tree of life. For example, horizontal gene transfer events and
   ancient coevolutionary interactions such as (endo)symbioses occur
   between contemporaneous species and thus can imply temporal
   relationships between two nodes in a phylogeny. Temporal constraints
   from these alternative sources can be particularly helpful when the
   geological record is sparse, for example, for microorganisms, which
   represent the majority of extant and extinct biodiversity. Here, we
   present a new method to combine fossil calibrations and relative age
   constraints to estimate chronograms. We provide an implementation of
   relative age constraints in RevBayes that can be combined in a modular
   manner with the wide range of molecular dating methods available in the
   software. We use both realistic simulations and empirical datasets of 40
   Cyanobacteria and 62 Archaea to evaluate our method. We show that the
   combination of relative age constraints with fossil calibrations
   significantly improves the estimation of node ages. {[}Archaea, Bayesian

Abstract = {Evolutionary comparisons between major environmental divides, such as
   between marine and freshwater systems, can reveal the fundamental
   processes governing diversification dynamics. Although processes may
   differ due to the different scales of their biogeographic barriers,
   freshwater and marine environments nevertheless offer similar
   opportunities for diversification in benthic, demersal, and pelagic
   habitats. Here, we compare the evolutionary patterns and processes
   shaping teleost diversity in each of these three habitats and between
   marine and freshwater systems. Using specimens from the National Museum
   of Natural History, we developed a data set of linear measurements
   capturing body shape in 2266 freshwater and 3344 marine teleost species.
   With a novel comparative approach, we contrast the primary axis of
   morphological diversification in each habitat with the major axis
   defined by phylogenetic signal. By comparing angles between these axes,
   we find that fish in corresponding habitats have more similar primary
   axes of morphological diversity than would be expected by chance, but
   that different historical processes underlie these parallel patterns in
   freshwater and marine environments. Marine diversification is more
   strongly aligned with phylogenetic signal and shows a trend toward
   lineages occupying separate regions of morphospace. In contrast,
   ecological signal appears to be a strong driver of diversification in
   freshwater lineages through repeated morphological evolution in densely
   packed regions of morphospace. In spite of these divergent histories,
   our findings reveal that habitat has driven convergent patterns of
   evolutionary diversification on a global scale. {[}Benthic-pelagic axis;

Abstract = {In Bayesian phylogenetics, the coalescent process provides an
   informative framework for inferring changes in the effective size of a
   population from a phylogeny (or tree) of sequences sampled from that
   population. Popular coalescent inference approaches such as the Bayesian
   Skyline Plot, Skyride, and Skygrid all model these population size
   changes with a discontinuous, piecewise-constant function but then apply
   a smoothing prior to ensure that their posterior population size
   estimates transition gradually with time. These prior distributions
   implicitly encode extra population size information that is not
   available from the observed coalescent data or tree. Here, we present a
   novel statistic, Omega, to quantify and disaggregate the relative
   contributions of the coalescent data and prior assumptions to the
   resulting posterior estimate precision. Our statistic also measures the
   additional mutual information introduced by such priors. Using we show
   that, because it is surprisingly easy to overparametrize
   piecewise-constant population models, common smoothing priors can lead
   to overconfident and potentially misleading inference, even under robust
   experimental designs. We propose Omega as a useful tool for detecting
   when effective population size estimates are overly reliant on prior
   assumptions and for improving quantification of the uncertainty in those
   estimates.},

Title = {The Perfect Storm: Gene Tree Estimation Error, Incomplete Lineage
   Sorting, and Ancient Gene Flow Explain the Most Recalcitrant Ancient

Abstract = {The genomic revolution offers renewed hope of resolving rapid radiations
   in the Tree of Life. The development of the multispecies coalescent
   model and improved gene tree estimation methods can better accommodate
   gene tree heterogeneity caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and
   gene tree estimation error stemming from the short internal branches.
   However, the relative influence of these factors in species tree
   inference is not well understood. Using anchored hybrid enrichment, we
   generated a data set including 423 single-copy loci from 64 taxa
   representing 39 families to infer the species tree of the flowering
   plant order Malpighiales. This order includes 9 of the top 10 most
   unstable nodes in angiosperms, which have been hypothesized to arise
   from the rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Here, we show that
   coalescent-based methods do not resolve the backbone of Malpighiales and
   concatenation methods yield inconsistent estimations, providing evidence
   that gene tree heterogeneity is high in this clade. Despite high levels
   of ILS and gene tree estimation error, our simulations demonstrate that
   these two factors alone are insufficient to explain the lack of
   resolution in this order. To explore this further, we examined triplet
   frequencies among empirical gene trees and discovered some of them
   deviated significantly from those attributed to ILS and estimation
   error, suggesting gene flow as an additional and previously
   unappreciated phenomenon promoting gene tree variation in Malpighiales.
   Finally, we applied a novel method to quantify the relative contribution
   of these three primary sources of gene tree heterogeneity and
   demonstrated that ILS, gene tree estimation error, and gene flow
   contributed to 10.0, 34.8, and 21.4 of the variation, respectively.
   Together, our results suggest that a perfect storm of factors likely
   influence this lack of resolution, and further indicate that
   recalcitrant phylogenetic relationships like the backbone of
   Malpighiales may be better represented as phylogenetic networks. Thus,
   reducing such groups solely to existing models that adhere strictly to
   bifurcating trees greatly oversimplifies reality, and obscures our
   ability to more clearly discern the process of evolution.},

Abstract = {The extent to which phylogenetic diversity (PD) captures feature
   diversity (FD) is a topical and controversial question in biodiversity

   main reasons why the two diversity measures might disagree for given
   data; namely, the presence of certain patterns of feature evolution and
   loss, and using temporal branch lengths for PD in settings that may not
   be appropriate (e.g., due to rapid evolution of certain features over
   short periods of time). Our article also explores the relationship
   between the ``Fair Proportion{''} index of PD and a simple index of FD
   (both of which correspond to Shapley values in cooperative game theory).
   In a second mathematical result, we show that the two indices can take
   identical values for any phylogenetic tree, provided the branch lengths
   in the tree are chosen appropriately.},

Abstract = {Researchers commonly present results of comparative studies of taxonomic
   groups. In this review, we criticize the focus on named clades, usually,
   comparably ranked groups such as families or orders, for comparative
   evolutionary analyses and question the general practice of using clades
   as units of analysis. The practice of analyzing sets of named groups
   persists despite widespread appreciation that the groups we have chosen
   to name are based on subjective human concerns rather than objective
   properties of nature. We demonstrate an effect of clade selection on
   results in one study and present some potential alternatives to
   selecting named clades for analysis that are relatively objective in
   clade choice. However, we note that these alternatives are only partial
   solutions for clade-based studies. The practice of analyzing named
   clades obviously is biased and problematic, but its issues portend
   broader problems with the general approach of employing clades as units
   of analysis. Most clade-based studies do not account for the
   nonindependence of clades, and the biological insight gained from
   demonstrating some pattern among a particular arbitrary sample of groups
   is arguable.},

Abstract = {Reliable estimation of phylogeny is central to avoid inaccuracy in
   downstream macroevolutionary inferences. However, limitations exist in
   the implementation of concatenated and summary coalescent approaches,
   and Bayesian and full coalescent inference methods may not yet be
   feasible for computation of phylogeny using complicated models and large
   data sets. Here, we explored methodological (e.g., optimality criteria,
   character sampling, model selection) and biological (e.g., heterotachy,
   branch length heterogeneity) sources of systematic error that can result
   in biased or incorrect parameter estimates when reconstructing phylogeny
   by using the gadiform fishes as a model Glade. Gadiformes include some
   of the most economically important fishes in the world (e.g., Cods,
   Hakes, and Rattails). Despite many attempts, a robust higher-level
   phylogenetic framework was lacking due to limited character and
   taxonomic sampling, particularly from several species-poor families that
   have been recalcitrant to phylogenetic placement. We compiled the first
   phylogenomic data set, including 14,208 loci (>2.8 M bp) from 58 species
   representing all recognized gadiform families, to infer a
   time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. Data were generated with a
   gene-capture approach targeting coding DNA sequences from single-copy
   protein-coding genes. Species-tree and concatenated maximum-likelihood
   (ML) analyses resolved all family-level relationships within Gadiformes.
   While there were a few differences between topologies produced by the
   DNA and the amino acid data sets, most of the historically unresolved
   relationships among gadiform lineages were consistently well resolved
   with high support in our analyses regardless of the methodological and
   biological approaches used. However, at deeper levels, we observed
   inconsistency in branch support estimates between bootstrap and gene and
   site coefficient factors (gCF, sCF). Despite numerous short internodes,
   all relationships received unequivocal bootstrap support while gCF and
   sCF had very little support, reflecting hidden conflict across loci.
   Most of the gene-tree and species-tree discordance in our study is a
   result of short divergence times, and consequent lack of informative
   characters at deep levels, rather than incomplete lineage sorting. We
   use this phylogeny to establish a new higher-level classification of
   Gadiformes as a way of clarifying the evolutionary diversification of
   the order. We recognize 17 families in five suborders: Bregmacerotoidei,
   Gadoidei, Ranicipitoidei, Merluccioidei, and Macrouroidei (including two
   subclades). A time-calibrated analysis using 15 fossil taxa suggests
   that Gadiformes evolved similar to 79.5 Ma in the late Cretaceous, but
   that most extant lineages diverged after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg)
   mass extinction (66 Ma). Our results reiterate the importance of
   examining phylogenomic analyses for evidence of systematic error that
   can emerge as a result of unsuitable modeling of biological factors
   and/or methodological issues, even when data sets are large and yield
   high support for phylogenetic relationships.},

Abstract = {The geographic distribution of biodiversity is central to understanding
   evolutionary biology. Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic histories often
   help to explain how biogeographic patterns unfold through time. However,
   such patterns are also influenced by a variety of other factors, such as
   lineage diversification, that may affect the probability of certain
   types of biogeographic events. The complex and well-known geologic and
   climatic history of Afro-Arabia, together with the extensive research on
   reptile systematics in the region, makes Afro-Arabian squamate
   communities an ideal system to investigate biogeographic patterns and
   their drivers. Here, we reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and
   the ancestral geographic distributions of several Afro-Arabian reptile
   clades (totaling 430 species) to estimate the number of dispersal,
   vicariance and range contraction events. We then compare the observed
   biogeographic history to a distribution of simulated biogeographic
   events based on the empirical phylogeny and the best-fit model. This
   allows us to identify periods in the past where the observed
   biogeographic history was likely shaped by forces beyond the ones
   included in the model. We find an increase in vicariance following the
   Oligocene, most likely caused by the fragmentation of the Afro-Arabian
   plate. In contrast, we did not find differences between observed and
   expected dispersal and range contraction levels. This is consistent with
   diversification enhanced by environmental processes and with the
   establishment of a dispersal corridor connecting Africa, Arabia and
   Eurasia since the middle Miocene. Finally, here we show that our novel
   approach is useful to pinpoint events in the evolutionary history of
   lineages that might reflect external forces not predicted by the
   underlying biogeographic model. {[}Dispersal; diversification; model

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees provide a powerful framework for testing
   macroevolutionary hypotheses, but it is becoming increasingly apparent
   that inferences derived from extant species alone can be highly
   misleading. Trees incorporating living and extinct taxa are needed to
   address fundamental questions about the origins of diversity and
   disparity but it has proved challenging to generate robust, species-rich
   phylogenies that include large numbers of fossil taxa. As a result, most
   studies of diversification dynamics continue to rely on molecular
   phylogenies. Here, we extend and apply a recently developed
   meta-analytic approach for synthesizing previously published
   phylogenetic studies to infer a well-resolved set of species level,
   time-scaled phylogenetic hypotheses for extinct and extant cetaceans
   (whales, dolphins, and allies). Our trees extend sampling from the
   similar to 90 extant species to over 500 living and extinct species, and
   therefore allow for more robust inference of macroevolutionary dynamics.
   While the diversification scenarios, we recover are broadly concordant
   with those inferred from molecular phylogenies they differ in critical
   ways, notably in the relative contributions of extinction and speciation
   rate shifts in driving rapid radiations. The metatree approach provides
   the most immediate route for generating higher level phylogenies of
   extinct taxa and opens the door to re-evaluation of macroevolutionary
   hypotheses derived only from extant taxa.},

Abstract = {Molecular phylogenies have yielded strong support for many parts of the
   amphibian Tree of Life, but poor support for the resolution of deeper
   nodes, including relationships among families and orders. To clarify
   these relationships, we provide a phylogenomic perspective on amphibian
   relationships by developing a taxon-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment
   protocol targeting hundreds of conserved exons which are effective
   across the class. After obtaining data from 220 loci for 286 species
   (representing 94\% of the families and 44\% of the genera), we estimate
   a phylogeny for extant amphibians and identify gene tree-species tree
   conflict across the deepest branches of the amphibian phylogeny. We
   perform locus-by-locus genealogical interrogation of alternative
   topological hypotheses for amphibian monophyly, focusing on interordinal
   relationships. We find that phylogenetic signal deep in the amphibian
   phylogeny varies greatly across loci in a manner that is consistent with
   incomplete lineage sorting in the ancestral lineage of extant
   amphibians. Our results overwhelmingly support amphibian monophyly and a
   sister relationship between frogs and salamanders, consistent with the
   Batrachia hypothesis. Species tree analyses converge on a small set of
   topological hypotheses for the relationships among extant amphibian
   families. These results clarify several contentious portions of the
   amphibian Tree of Life, which in conjunction with a set of vetted fossil
   calibrations, support a surprisingly younger timescale for crown and
   ordinal amphibian diversification than previously reported. More
   broadly, our study provides insight into the sources, magnitudes, and
   heterogeneity of support across loci in phylogenomic data sets.},

Title = {Joint Phylogenetic Estimation of Geographic Movements and Biome Shifts
   during the Global Diversification of Viburnum},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Phylogeny, molecular sequences, fossils, biogeography, and biome
   occupancy are all lines of evidence that reflect the singular
   evolutionary history of a clade, but they are most often studied
   separately, by first inferring a fossil-dated molecular phylogeny, then
   mapping on ancestral ranges and biomes inferred from extant species.
   Here we jointly model the evolution of biogeographic ranges, biome
   affinities, and molecular sequences, while incorporating fossils to
   estimate a dated phylogeny for all of the 163 extant species of the
   woody plant clade Viburnum (Adoxaceae) that we currently recognize in
   our ongoing worldwide monographic treatment of the group. Our analyses
   indicate that while the major Viburnum lineages evolved in the Eocene,
   the majority of extant species originated since the Miocene. Viburnum
   radiated first in Asia, in warm, broad-leaved evergreen (lucidophyllous)
   forests. Within Asia, we infer several early shifts into more tropical
   forests, and multiple shifts into forests that experience prolonged
   freezing. From Asia, we infer two early movements into the New World.
   These two lineages probably first occupied warm temperate forests and
   adapted later to spreading cold climates. One of these lineages
   (Porphyrotinus) occupied cloud forests and moved south through the
   mountains of the Neotropics. Several other movements into North America
   took place more recently, facilitated by prior adaptations to freezing
   in the Old World. We also infer four disjunctions between Asia and
   Europe: the Tinus lineage is the oldest and probably occupied warm
   forests when it spread, whereas the other three were more recent and in
   cold-adapted lineages. These results variously contradict published
   accounts, especially the view that Viburnum radiated initially in cold
   forests and, accordingly, maintained vessel elements with scalariform
   perforations. We explored how the location and biome assignments of
   fossils affected our inference of ancestral areas and biome states. Our
   results are sensitive to, but not entirely dependent upon, the inclusion
   of fossil biome data. It will be critical to take advantage of all
   available lines of evidence to decipher events in the distant past. The
   joint estimation approach developed here provides cautious hope even
   when fossil evidence is limited.},

Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-76},
Abstract = {Interpersonal interaction performance is significantly determined by
   group members' personality traits. If a group lives in long-term
   isolation, the influence of personality traits on interpersonal
   interaction performance will be even stronger. The current study
   identified and examined the impact of the personality traits of the
   personnel living at the Ukrainian Antarctic Akademik Vernadsky station
   (N = 35) on their interpersonal interactions during long-term Antarctic
   expeditions. The results show that expeditioners' personality traits
   significantly determined their interpersonal interactions. However, the
   influence of personality traits on different areas of interactions can
   vary significantly among different groups of expeditioners, even
   sometimes in diametrically opposite directions. The main reason for this
   is a formed microclimate specific to each group and corresponding group
   norms for formal and informal relations due to significant differences
   in personality traits that are characteristic of different groups'
   participants. We determined that eleven indicators, out of a total of 23
   examined personality traits, significantly differed among expeditioners
   from different groups (different expeditions). The study results can be
   used to enable better psychological selection of Antarctic expedition
   participants and to provide psychological support for these individuals.},

   or chance for progress in the region?},
Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-159},
Abstract = {The Arctic region is under considerable pressure from the rapidly
   growing global tourism industry. The goal of this article is to present
   the current state of tourism in Spitsbergen, including the results of
   empirical research about the type of tourists and their preferences in
   organizing a trip, i.e. motivation, choice of attractions, etc. The
   survey in Longyearbyen town was conducted in 2018 and 2019 during two
   summer and two winter trips. As a result, a total of n=214
   questionnaires were collected, presenting interesting insights into
   tourists' profiles and their motivation in coming to the island. Based
   on the results, the Arctic tourism sector is characterized by
   seasonality, which significantly affects the distribution of tourist
   arrivals throughout the year. During the last 15 years, Spitsbergen
   island noticed the greatest boom in tourism linked to the development of
   transport infrastructure (new ports and airports) and accommodation
   (hotels). From one side, the tourism industry contributes significantly
   to employment in Longyearbyen, still from the other side, it burdens the
   local community and challenges their lives due to increased pollution of
   air, water and ground. The increased tourism also poses serious threats
   to the natural environment, which is already under pressure due to
   global warming resulting in melting Arctic glaciers and increased sea
   level. Therefore, it is crucial to implement new regulations to control
   and manage the development of tourism while protecting nature and its
   residents.},

Title = {The Community Coevolution Model with Application to the Study of
   Evolutionary Relationships between Genes Based on Phylogenetic Profiles},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {559-574},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Organismal traits can evolve in a coordinated way, with correlated
   patterns of gains and losses reflecting important evolutionary
   associations. Discovering these associations can reveal important
   information about the functional and ecological linkages among traits.
   Phylogenetic profiles treat individual genes as traits distributed
   across sets of genomes and can provide a fine-grained view of the
   genetic underpinnings of evolutionary processes in a set of genomes.
   Phylogenetic profiling has been used to identify genes that are
   functionally linked and to identify common patterns of lateral gene
   transfer in microorganisms. However, comparative analysis of
   phylogenetic profiles and other trait distributions should take into
   account the phylogenetic relationships among the organisms under
   consideration. Here, we propose the Community Coevolution Model (CCM), a
   new coevolutionary model to analyze the evolutionary associations among
   traits, with a focus on phylogenetic profiles. In the CCM, traits are
   considered to evolve as a community with interactions, and the
   transition rate for each trait depends on the current states of other
   traits. Surpassing other comparative methods for pairwise trait
   analysis, CCM has the additional advantage of being able to examine
   multiple traits as a community to reveal more dependency relationships.
   We also develop a simulation procedure to generate phylogenetic profiles
   with correlated evolutionary patterns that can be used as benchmark data
   for evaluation purposes. A simulation study demonstrates that CCM is
   more accurate than other methods including the Jaccard Index and three
   tree-aware methods. The parameterization of CCM makes the interpretation
   of the relations between genes more direct, which leads to Darwin's
   scenario being identified easily based on the estimated parameters. We
   show that CCM is more efficient and fits real data better than other
   methods resulting in higher likelihood scores with fewer parameters. An
   examination of 3786 phylogenetic profiles across a set of 659 bacterial
   genomes highlights linkages between genes with common functions,
   including many patterns that would not have been identified under a
   nonphylogenetic model of common distribution. We also applied the CCM to
   44 proteins in the well-studied Mitochondrial Respiratory Complex I and
   recovered associations that mapped well onto the structural associations
   that exist in the complex. {[}Coevolution; evolutionary rates; gene

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are a central tool in many areas of life science and
   medicine. They demonstrate evolutionary patterns among species, genes,
   and patterns of ancestry among sets of individuals. The tree shapes and
   branch lengths of phylogenetic trees encode evolutionary and
   epidemiological information. To extract information from tree shapes and
   branch lengths, representation and comparison methods for phylogenetic
   trees are needed. Representing and comparing tree shapes and branch
   lengths of phylogenetic trees are challenging, for a tree shape is
   unlabeled and can be displayed in numerous different forms, and branch
   lengths of a tree shape are specific to edges whose positions vary with
   respect to the displayed forms of the tree shape. In this article, we
   introduce representation and comparison methods for rooted unlabeled
   phylogenetic trees based on a tree lattice that serves as a coordinate
   system for rooted binary trees with branch lengths and a graph
   polynomial that fully characterizes tree shapes. We show that the
   introduced tree representations and metrics provide distance-based
   likelihood-free methods for tree clustering, parameter estimation, and
   model selection and apply the methods to analyze phylogenies
   reconstructed from virus sequences. {[}Graph polynomial; likelihood-free

Title = {Theoretical and Practical Considerations when using Retroelement
   Insertions to Estimate Species Trees in the Anomaly Zone},

Abstract = {A potential shortcoming of concatenation methods for species tree
   estimation is their failure to account for incomplete lineage sorting.
   Coalescent methods address this problem but make various assumptions
   that, if violated, can result in worse performance than concatenation.
   Given the challenges of analyzing DNA sequences with both concatenation
   and coalescent methods, retroelement insertions (RIs) have emerged as
   powerful phylogenomic markers for species tree estimation. Here, we show
   that two recently proposed quartet-based methods, SDPquartets and
   ASTRAL\_BP, are statistically consistent estimators of the unrooted
   species tree topology under the coalescent when RIs follow a neutral
   infinite-sites model of mutation and the expected number of new RIs per
   generation is constant across the species tree. The accuracy of these
   (and other) methods for inferring species trees from RIs has yet to be
   assessed on simulated data sets, where the true species tree topology is
   known. Therefore, we evaluated eight methods given RIs simulated from
   four model species trees, all of which have short branches and at least
   three of which are in the anomaly zone. In our simulation study,
   ASTRAL\_BP and SDPquartets always recovered the correct species tree
   topology when given a sufficiently large number of RIs, as predicted. A
   distance-based method (ASTRID\_BP) and Dollo parsimony also performed
   well in recovering the species tree topology. In contrast, unordered,
   polymorphism, and Camin-Sokal parsimony (as well as an approach based on
   MDC) typically fail to recover the correct species tree topology in
   anomaly zone situations with more than four ingroup taxa. Of the methods
   studied, only ASTRAL\_BP automatically estimates internal branch lengths
   (in coalescent units) and support values (i.e., local posterior
   probabilities). We examined the accuracy of branch length estimation,
   finding that estimated lengths were accurate for short branches but
   upwardly biased otherwise. This led us to derive the maximum likelihood
   (branch length) estimate for when RIs are given as input instead of
   binary gene trees; this corrected formula produced accurate estimates of
   branch lengths in our simulation study provided that a sufficiently
   large number of RIs were given as input. Lastly, we evaluated the impact
   of data quantity on species tree estimation by repeating the above
   experiments with input sizes varying from 100 to 100,000
   parsimony-informative RIs. We found that, when given just 1000
   parsimony-informative RIs as input, ASTRAL\_BP successfully
   reconstructed major clades (i.e., clades separated by branches >0.3
   coalescent units) with high support and identified rapid radiations
   (i.e., shorter connected branches), although not their precise branching
   order. The local posterior probability was effective for controlling
   false positive branches in these scenarios. {[}Coalescence; incomplete

Abstract = {Mountain systems harbor a substantial fraction of global biodiversity
   and, thus, provide excellent opportunities to study rapid
   diversification and to understand the historical processes underlying
   the assembly of biodiversity hotspots. The rich biodiversity in
   mountains is widely regarded as having arisen under the influence of
   geological and climatic processes as well as the complex interactions
   among them. However, the relative contribution of geology and climate in
   driving species radiation is seldom explored. Here, we studied the
   evolutionary radiation of Oreocharis (Gesneriaceae), which has
   diversified extensively throughout East Asia, especially within the
   Hengduan Mountains (HDM), using transcriptomic data and a time
   calibrated phylogeny for 88\% (111/126) of all species of the genus. In
   particular, we applied phylogenetic reconstructions to evaluate the
   extent of incomplete lineage sorting accompanying the early and rapid
   radiation in the genus. We then fit macroevolutionary models to explore
   its spatial and diversification dynamics in Oreocharis and applied
   explicit birth-death models to investigate the effects of past
   environmental changes on its diversification. Evidence from 574
   orthologous loci suggest that Oreocharis underwent an impressive early
   burst of speciation starting ca. 12 Ma in the Miocene, followed by a
   drastic decline in speciation toward the present. Although we found no
   evidence for a shift in diversification rate across the phylogeny of
   Oreocharis, we showed a difference in diversification dynamics between
   the HDM and non-HDM lineages, with higher diversification rates in the
   HDM. The diversification dynamic of Oreocharis is most likely positively
   associated with temperature-dependent speciation and dependency on the
   Asian monsoons. We suggest that the warm and humid climate of the
   mid-Miocene was probably the primary driver of the rapid diversification
   in Oreocharis, while mountain building of the HDM might have indirectly
   affected species diversification of the HDM lineage. This study
   highlights the importance of past climatic changes, combined with
   mountain building, in creating strong environmental heterogeneity and
   driving diversification of mountain plants, and suggests that the
   biodiversity in the HDM cannot directly be attributed to mountain
   uplift, contrary to many recent speculations.{[}East Asian monsoons;

Title = {Do Meristic Characters Used in Phylogenetic Analysis Evolve in an
   Ordered Manner?},

Abstract = {The use of ordered characters in phylogenetic analysis has been
   inconsistent throughout the history of phylogenetic inference. It has
   become more widespread in recent years, and some have advocated that all
   characters representing continuous or meristic traits should be ordered
   as a matter of course. Here, using the example of dental evolution, we
   examine two factors that may impact on whether meristic characters
   actually evolve in an ordered manner: the regulatory hierarchy governing
   the development of teeth that allows large sections of the entire tooth
   row to be suppressed in a single transition and regionalization of the
   tooth row where different modules have a degree of independence in their
   evolution. These are studied using both empirical and simulated data.
   Models of evolution of such characters are examined over molecular
   phylogenies to see if ordered or unordered models fit best. Simulations
   of tooth-row evolution are designed to incorporate changes in region
   size and multiple levels of developmental control to suppress individual
   regions or the entire row. The empirical analyses show that in a Glade
   with largely homodont dentition the characters evolve in an ordered
   manner, but if dentition is heterodont with distinct regionalization
   their evolution better fits an unordered model. In the simulations, even
   if teeth are added and removed from the tooth row in an ordered manner,
   dividing the row into independently evolving modules can lead to
   characters covering multiple modules better fitting an unordered model
   of evolution. Adding the ability to suppress regions or the entire tooth
   row has a variable effect depending on the rates of suppression relative
   to the rates of addition and subtraction of individual teeth. We
   therefore advise not following a single policy when deciding whether to
   order meristic traits but to base the decision on a priori knowledge of
   the focal Glade's evolution and developmental biology.},

Abstract = {The phylogeny and systematics of fur seals and sea lions (Otariidae)
   have long been studied with diverse data types, including an increasing
   amount of molecular data. However, only a few phylogenetic relationships
   have reached acceptance because of strong gene-tree species tree
   discordance. Divergence times estimates in the group also vary largely
   between studies. These uncertainties impeded the understanding of the
   biogeographical history of the group, such as when and how
   trans-equatorial dispersal and subsequent speciation events occurred.
   Here, we used high-coverage genome-wide sequencing for 14 of the 15
   species of Otariidae to elucidate the phylogeny of the family and its
   bearing on the taxonomy and biogeographical history. Despite extreme
   topological discordance among gene trees, we found a fully supported
   species tree that agrees with the few well-accepted relationships and
   establishes monophyly of the genus Arctocephalus. Our data support a
   relatively recent trans-hemispheric dispersal at the base of a southern
   lade, which rapidly diversified into six major lineages between 3 and
   2.5 Ma. Otaria diverged first, followed by Phocarctos and then four
   major lineages within Arctocephalus. However, we found Zalophus to be
   nonmonophyletic, with California (Zalophus californianus) and Steller
   sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) grouping closer than the Galapagos sea
   lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) with evidence for introgression between the
   two genera. Overall, the high degree of genealogical discordance was
   best explained by incomplete lineage sorting resulting from
   quasi-simultaneous speciation within the southern Glade with
   introgresssion playing a subordinate role in explaining the incongruence
   among and within prior phylogenetic studies of the family.},

Abstract = {Temperate woody plants in the Northern Hemisphere have long been known
   to exhibit high species richness in East Asia and North America and
   significantly lower diversity in Europe, but the causes of this pattern
   remain debated. Here, we quantify the roles of dispersal, niche
   evolution, and extinction in shaping the geographic diversity of the
   temperate woody plant family Juglandaceae (walnuts and their relatives).
   Integrating evidence from molecular, morphological, fossil, and
   (paleo)environmental data, we find strong support for a Boreotropical
   origin of the family with contrasting evolutionary trajectories between
   the temperate subfamily Juglandoideae and the tropical subfamily
   Engelhardioideae. Juglandoideae rapidly evolved frost tolerance when the
   global climate shifted to ice-house conditions from the Oligocene, with
   diversification at high latitudes especially in Europe and Asia during
   the Miocene. Subsequent range contraction at high latitudes and high
   levels of extinction in Europe driven by global cooling led to the
   current regional disparity in species diversity. Engelhardioideae showed
   temperature conservatism while adapting to increased humidity, tracking
   tropical climates to low latitudes since the middle Eocene with
   comparatively little diversification, perhaps due to high competition in
   the tropical zone. The biogeographic history of Juglandaceae shows that
   the North Atlantic land bridge and Europe played more critical roles
   than previously thought in linking the floras of East Asia and North
   America, and showcases the complex interplay among climate change, niche
   evolution, dispersal, and extinction that shaped the modern disjunct
   pattern of species richness in temperate woody plants.},

Abstract = {Species tree estimation from multilocus data sets is extremely
   challenging, especially in the presence of gene tree heterogeneity
   across the genome due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Summary
   methods have been developed which estimate gene trees and then combine
   the gene trees to estimate a species tree by optimizing various
   optimization scores. In this study, we have extended and adapted the
   concept of phylogenetic terraces to species tree estimation by
   ``summarizing{''} a set of gene trees, where multiple species trees with
   distinct topologies may have exactly the same optimality score (i.e.,
   quartet score, extra lineage score, etc.). We particularly investigated
   the presence and impacts of equally optimal trees in species tree
   estimation from multilocus data using summary methods by taking ILS into
   account. We analyzed two of the most popular ILS-aware optimization
   criteria: maximize quartet consistency (MQC) and minimize deep
   coalescence (MDC). Methods based on MQC are provably statistically
   consistent, whereas MDC is not a consistent criterion for species tree
   estimation. We present a comprehensive comparative study of these two
   optimality criteria. Our experiments, on a collection of data sets
   simulated under ILS, indicate that MDC may result in competitive or
   identical quartet consistency score as MQC, but could be significantly
   worse than MQC in terms of tree accuracy-demonstrating the presence and
   impacts of equally optimal species trees. This is the first known study
   that provides the conditions for the data sets to have equally optimal
   trees in the context of phylogenomic inference using summary methods.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Anthozoan cnidarians (corals and sea anemones) include some of the
   world's most important foundation species, capable of building massive
   reef complexes that support entire ecosystems. Although previous
   molecular phylogenetic analyses have revealed widespread homoplasy of
   the morphological characters traditionally used to define orders and
   families of anthozoans, analyses using mitochondrial genes or rDNA have
   failed to resolve many key nodes in the phylogeny. With a fully
   resolved, time-calibrated phylogeny for 234 species constructed from
   hundreds of ultraconserved elements and exon loci, we explore the
   evolutionary origins of the major clades of Anthozoa and some of their
   salient morphological features. The phylogeny supports reciprocally
   monophyletic Hexacorallia and Octocorallia, with Ceriantharia as the
   earliest diverging hexacorals; two reciprocally monophyletic clades of
   Octocorallia; and monophyly of all hexacoral orders with the exception
   of the enigmatic sea anemone Relicanthus daphneae. Divergence dating
   analyses place Anthozoa in the Cryogenian to Tonian periods (648-894
   Ma), older than has been suggested by previous studies. Ancestral state
   reconstructions indicate that the ancestral anthozoan was a solitary
   polyp that had bilateral symmetry and lacked a skeleton. Colonial growth
   forms and the ability to precipitate calcium carbonate evolved in the
   Ediacaran (578 Ma) and Cambrian (503 Ma) respectively; these hallmarks
   of reef-building species have subsequently arisen multiple times
   independently in different orders. Anthozoans formed associations with
   photosymbionts by the Devonian ( 383 Ma), and photosymbioses have been
   gained and lost repeatedly in all orders. Together, these results have
   profound implications for the interpretation of the Precambrian
   environment and the early evolution of metazoans.},

Abstract = {Genomic data have only sometimes brought resolution to the tree of life.
   Large phylogenomic studies can reach conflicting conclusions about
   important relationships, with mutually exclusive hypotheses receiving
   strong support. Reconciling such differences requires a detailed
   understanding of how phylogenetic signal varies among data sets. Two
   complementary strategies for better understanding phylogenomic conflicts
   are to examine support on a locus-by-locus basis and use support values
   that capture a larger range of variation in phylogenetic information,
   such as likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios can be calculated using
   either maximum or marginal likelihoods. Despite being conceptually
   similar, differences in how these ratios are calculated and interpreted
   have not been closely examined in phylogenomics. Here, we compare the
   behavior of maximum and marginal likelihood ratios when evaluating
   alternate resolutions of recalcitrant relationships among major squamate
   lineages. We find that these ratios are broadly correlated between loci,
   but the correlation is driven by extreme values. As a consequence, the
   proportion of loci that support a hypothesis can change depending on
   which ratio is used and whether smaller values are discarded. In
   addition, maximum likelihood ratios frequently exhibit identical support
   for alternate hypotheses, making conflict resolution a challenge. We
   find surprising support for a sister relationship between snakes and
   iguanians across four different phylogenomic data sets in contrast to
   previous empirical studies. {[}Bayes factors; likelihood ratios;

Abstract = {Estimating time-dependent rates of speciation and extinction from dated
   phylogenetic trees of extant species (timetrees), and determining how
   and why they vary, is key to understanding how ecological and
   evolutionary processes shape biodiversity. Due to an increasing
   availability of phylogenetic trees, a growing number of process-based
   methods relying on the birth-death model have been developed in the last
   decade to address a variety of questions in macroevolution. However,
   this methodological progress has regularly been criticized such that one
   may wonder how reliable the estimations of speciation and extinction
   rates are. In particular, using lineages-through-time (LTT) plots, a
   recent study has shown that there are an infinite number of equally
   likely diversification scenarios that can generate any timetree. This
   has led to questioning whether or not diversification rates should be
   estimated at all. Here, we summarize, clarify, and highlight technical
   considerations on recent findings regarding the capacity of models to
   disentangle diversification histories. Using simulations, we illustrate
   the characteristics of newly proposed ``pulled rates{''} and their
   utility. We recognize that the recent findings are a step forward in
   understanding the behavior of macroevolutionary modeling, but they in no
   way suggest we should abandon diversification modeling altogether. On
   the contrary, the study of macroevolution using phylogenetic trees has
   never been more exciting and promising than today. We still face
   important limitations in regard to data availability and methods, but by
   acknowledging them we can better target our joint efforts as a
   scientific community. {[}Birth-death models; extinction; phylogenetics;

Title = {On Information Rank Deficiency in Phenotypic Covariance Matrices},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {810-822},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {This article investigates a form of rank deficiency in phenotypic
   covariance matrices derived from geometric morphometric data, and its
   impact on measures of phenotypic integration. We first define a type of
   rank deficiency based on information theory then demonstrate that this
   deficiency impairs the performance of phenotypic integration metrics in
   a model system. Lastly, we propose methods to treat for this information
   rank deficiency. Our first goal is to establish how the rank of a
   typical geometric morphometric covariance matrix relates to the
   information entropy of its eigenvalue spectrum. This requires clear
   definitions of matrix rank, of which we define three: the full matrix
   rank (equal to the number of input variables), the mathematical rank
   (the number of nonzero eigenvalues), and the information rank or
   ``effective rank{''} (equal to the number of nonredundant eigenvalues).
   We demonstrate that effective rank deficiency arises from a combination
   of methodological factors-Generalized Procrustes analysis, use of the
   correlation matrix, and insufficient sample size-as well as phenotypic
   covariance. Secondly, we use dire wolf jaws to document how differences
   in effective rank deficiency bias two metrics used to measure phenotypic
   integration. The eigenvalue variance characterizes the integration
   change incorrectly, and the standardized generalized variance lacks the
   sensitivity needed to detect subtle changes in integration. Both metrics
   are impacted by the inclusion of many small, but nonzero, eigenvalues
   arising from a lack of information in the covariance matrix, a problem
   that usually becomes more pronounced as the number of landmarks
   increases. We propose a new metric for phenotypic integration that
   combines the standardized generalized variance with information entropy.
   This metric is equivalent to the standardized generalized variance but
   calculated only from those eigenvalues that carry nonredundant
   information. It is the standardized generalized variance scaled to the
   effective rank of the eigenvalue spectrum. We demonstrate that this
   metric successfully detects the shift of integration in our dire wolf
   sample. Our third goal is to generalize the new metric to compare data
   sets with different sample sizes and numbers of variables. We develop a
   standardization for matrix information based on data permutation then
   demonstrate that Smilodon jaws are more integrated than dire wolf jaws.
   Finally, we describe how our information entropy-based measure allows
   phenotypic integration to be compared in dense semilandmark data sets
   without bias, allowing characterization of the information content of
   any given shape, a quantity we term ``latent dispersion{''}. {[}Canis

Title = {Evaluating Species Delimitation Methods in Radiations: The Land Snail
   Albinaria cretensis Complex on Crete},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {439-460},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Delimiting species in radiations is notoriously difficult because of the
   small differences between the incipient species, the star-like tree with
   short branches between species, incomplete lineage sorting, and the
   possibility of introgression between several of the incipient species.
   Next-generation sequencing data may help to overcome some of these
   problems. We evaluated methods for species delimitation based on
   genome-wide markers in a land snail radiation on Crete. Species
   delimitation in the Albinaria cretensis group was based exclusively on
   shell characters until now and resulted in classifications
   distinguishing 3-9 species. We generated sequences of 4270 loci for 140
   specimens of the A. cretensis group from 48 populations by double-digest
   restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We evaluated three methods
   for species discovery. The multispecies coalescent approach implemented
   in the program Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography resulted in a
   drastic overestimating of the number of species, whereas Gaussian
   clustering resulted in an overlumping. Primary species hypotheses based
   on the maximum percentage of the genome of the individuals derived from
   ancestral populations as estimated with the program ADMIXTURE moderately
   overestimated the number of species, but this was the only approach that
   provided information about gene flow between groups. Two of the methods
   for species validation that we applied, BFD{*} and delimitR, resulted in
   an acceptance of almost all primary species hypotheses, even such based
   on arbitrary subdivisions of hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE. In contrast,
   secondary species hypotheses, resulting from an evaluation of primary
   species hypotheses based on ADMIXTURE with isolation by distance tests,
   approached the morphological classification, but also uncovered two
   cryptic species and indicated that some of the previously delimited
   units should be combined. Thus, we recommend this combination of
   approaches that provided more detailed insights in the distinctness of
   barriers between the taxa of a species complex and the spatial
   distribution of admixture between them than the other methods. The
   recognition and delimitation of undersampled species remained a major
   challenge. {[}ADMIXTURE; Clausiliidae; delimitR, Gaussian clustering;

Title = {A Multifunction Trade-Off has Contrasting Effects on the Evolution of
   Form and Function},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {681-693},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Trade-offs caused by the use of an anatomical apparatus for more than
   one function are thought to be an important constraint on evolution.
   However, whether multifunctionality suppresses diversification of
   biomechanical systems is challenged by recent literature showing that
   traits more closely tied to trade-offs evolve more rapidly. We contrast
   the evolutionary dynamics of feeding mechanics and morphology between
   fishes that exclusively capture prey with suction and multifunctional
   species that augment this mechanism with biting behaviors to remove
   attached benthic prey. Diversification of feeding kinematic traits was,
   on average, over 13.5 times faster in suction feeders, consistent with
   constraint on biters due to mechanical trade-offs between biting and
   suction performance. Surprisingly, we found that the evolution of
   morphology contrasts directly with these differences in kinematic
   evolution, with significantly faster rates of evolution of head shape in
   biters. This system provides clear support for an often postulated, but
   rarely confirmed prediction that multifunctionality stifles functional
   diversification, while also illustrating the sometimes weak relationship
   between form and function.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {258-267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Relaxed randomwalk (RRW) models of trait evolution introduce
   branch-specific rate multipliers tomodulate the variance of a standard
   Brownian diffusion process along a phylogeny and more accurately model
   overdispersed biological data. Increased taxonomic sampling challenges
   inference under RRWs as the number of unknown parameters grows with the
   number of taxa. To solve this problem, we present a scalable method to
   efficiently fit RRWs and infer this branchspecific variation in a
   Bayesian framework. We develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler
   to approximate the high-dimensional, correlated posterior that exploits
   a closed-form evaluation of the gradient of the trait data
   log-likelihood with respect to all branch-ratemultipliers
   simultaneously. Our gradient calculation achieves computational
   complexity that scales only linearly with the number of taxa under
   study. We compare the efficiency of our HMC sampler to the previously
   standard univariable Metropolis-Hastings approach while studying the
   spatial emergence of theWest Nile virus in North America in the early
   2000s. Our method achieves at least a 6-fold speed increase over the
   univariable approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of
   our method by applying the RRW to study the correlation between five
   mammalian life history traits in a phylogenetic tree with 3650 tips.},

   models have been used extensively for statistical inference, they have
   largely been ignored for the purpose of measuring distances between
   phylogeny-aware models. Recent contributions to the problem of
   phylogenetic distance computation have highlighted the importance of
   explicitly considering evolutionary model parameters and their impacts
   on molecular sequence data when quantifying dissimilarity between trees.
   By comparing two phylogenies in terms of their induced probability
   distributions that are functions of many model parameters, these
   distances can be more informative than traditional approaches that rely
   strictly on differences in topology or branch lengths alone. Currently,
   however, these approaches are designed for comparing models of
   nucleotide substitution and gene tree distributions, and thus, are
   unable to address other classes of traits and associated models that may
   be of interest to evolutionary biologists. Here, we expand the
   principles of probabilistic phylogenetic distances to compute tree
   distances under models of continuous trait evolution along a phylogeny.
   By explicitly considering both the degree of relatedness among species
   and the evolutionary processes that collectively give rise to character
   traits, these distances provide a foundation for comparing models and
   their predictions, and for quantifying the impacts of assuming one
   phylogenetic background over another while studying the evolution of a
   particular trait. We demonstrate the properties of these approaches
   using theory, simulations, and several empirical data sets that
   highlight potential uses of probabilistic distances in many scenarios.
   We also introduce an open-source R package named PRDATR for easy
   application by the scientific community for computing phylogenetic
   distances under models of character trait evolution.},

Abstract = {We describe a new and computationally efficient Bayesian methodology for

   Likelihood calculations are carried out using diffusion models of allele
   frequency dynamics combined with novel numerical algorithms. The
   diffusion approach allows for analysis of data sets containing hundreds
   or thousands of individuals. The method, which we call SNAPPER, has been
   implemented as part of the BEAST2 package. We conducted simulation
   experiments to assess numerical error, computational requirements, and
   accuracy recovering known model parameters. A reanalysis of soybean SNP
   data demonstrates that the models implemented in SNAPP and SNAPPER can
   be difficult to distinguish in practice, a characteristic which we
   tested with further simulations. We demonstrate the scale of analysis
   possible using a SNP data set sampled from 399 fresh water turtles in 41
   populations.},

Title = {Multi-method geophysical mapping of ground properties and periglacial

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a geophysical survey from which
   detailed images of glacial and periglacial landforms and subsurface
   structures were obtained. Sediments and landforms on newly deglaciated
   terrain can be used to reconstruct the extent and character of glaciers
   in the past and add to the understanding of their response to climate
   and environmental changes. To derive spatial information from complex
   geomorphological terrain, joint interpretation of three non-intrusive
   geophysical methods were applied: Electrical Resistivity Tomography
   (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and time-lapse Seismic
   Tomography. These were used to identify subsurface structures in the
   forefield of the retreating Hans Glacier in SW Spitsbergen, Svalbard.
   Three main zones were distinguished and described: outwash plain,
   terminal moraine from the last glacial maximum, and glacial forefield
   proximal to the glacier front. Geophysical profiles across these zones
   reveal information on glacio-fluvial sediment thickness and structure,
   ice thickness and structure, and bedrock topography. The
   freezing-thawing effect of the active layer has a strong and deep
   impact, as demonstrated by variations in P-wave velocity in the obtained
   outcomes. The results are discussed in the context of the current
   climate in Svalbard. This study provides a snapshot of ground parameters
   and the current state of the subsurface in southern Spitsbergen. The
   boundary between sediment-bedrock layers was estimated to be from 5 to
   20 m in depth. It is the first such extensive description of periglacial
   structures in the forefield of the Hans Glacier, utilising the longest
   ERT profile (1500 m) in Svalbard together with deep GPR and precise
   seismic tomography.},

Title = {Ice surface near melting point: Effects on the tropospheric ice},
Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {237-248},
Abstract = {Atmospheric gases and chemical impurities can be stored and chemically
   transformed in the tropospheric ice. Impurities are rejected during
   freezing of the ice to the grain boundaries, free ice surfaces or
   inclusions. Surface snow and tropospheric ice, however, may be exposed
   to high temperatures and, eventually, the gases and chemical impurities
   can be released into the environment. It is important to study the
   surface structure and transport mechanisms at temperatures near the
   melting point because the location of impurities and their interactions
   with water molecules in the ice are not yet sufficiently explained. In
   this work, the evolution of a scratch on the bicrystalline ice surface
   was studied at -5 degrees C. The surface transport mechanisms near the
   melting point were studied and, as a consequence, the surface structure
   could be determined. An ice sample was kept immersed in ultra-pure
   silicone oil to prevent evaporation and, thus, isolate the effect of
   surface diffusion. The ice sample was made with water with chemical
   conditions similar to the water of polar ice sheets. Photographs of the
   scratch were taken periodically, for approximately 50 hours, using a
   photographic camera coupled to an optical microscope. From these images,
   the evolution of the width of the scratch was studied and the surface
   diffusion was the dominant transport mechanism in the experiment.
   Finally, the ice surface self-diffusion coefficient at -5 degrees C was
   determined and it was very similar to the super-cooled water diffusion
   coefficient. A liquid-like behavior of ice surfaces near the melting
   point was found and it could have a strong influence on the reaction
   rates with atmospheric gases.},

Abstract = {The concept that complex ancestral traits can never be recovered after
   their loss is still widely accepted, despite phylogenetic and molecular
   approaches suggest instances where phenotypes may have been lost
   throughout the evolutionary history of a clade and subsequently reverted
   back in derived lineages. One of the first and most notable examples of
   such a process is wing evolution in phasmids; this polyneopteran order
   of insects, which comprises stick and leaf insects, has played a central
   role in initiating a long-standing debate on the topic. In this study, a
   novel and comprehensive time tree including over 300 Phasmatodea species
   is used as a framework for investigating wing evolutionary patterns in
   the clade. Despite accounting for several possible biases and sources of
   uncertainty, macroevolutionary analyses consistently revealed multiple
   reversals to winged states taking place after their loss, and
   reversibility is coupled with higher species diversification rates. Our
   findings support a loss of or reduction in wings that occurred in the
   lineage leading to the extant phasmid most recent common ancestor, and
   brachyptery is inferred to be an unstable state unless co-opted for
   nonaerodynamic adaptations. We also explored how different assumptions
   of wing reversals probability could impact their inference: we found
   that until reversals are assumed to be over 30 times more unlikely than
   losses, they are consistently inferred despite uncertainty in tree and
   model parameters. Our findings demonstrate that wing evolution is a
   reversible and dynamic process in phasmids and contribute to our
   understanding of complex trait evolution. {[}Dollo's law; Phasmatodea;

Abstract = {The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is widely used in comparative
   phylogenetic analyses to study the evolution of quantitative traits. It
   has been applied to various purposes, including the estimation of the
   strength of selection or ancestral traits, inferring the existence of
   several selective regimes, or accounting for phylogenetic correlation in
   regression analyses. Most programs implementing statistical inference
   under the OU model have resorted to maximum-likelihood (ML) inference
   until the recent advent of Bayesian methods. A series of issues have
   been noted for ML inference using the OU model, including parameter
   nonidentifiability. How these problems translate to a Bayesian framework
   has not been studied much to date and is the focus of the present
   article. In particular, I aim to assess the impact of the choice of
   priors on parameter estimates. I show that complex interactions between
   parameters may cause the priors for virtually all parameters to impact
   inference in sometimes unexpected ways, whatever the purpose of
   inference. I specifically draw attention to the difficulty of setting
   the prior for the selection strength parameter, a task to be undertaken
   with much caution. I particularly address investigators who do not have
   precise prior information, by highlighting the fact that the effect of
   the prior for one parameter is often only visible through its impact on
   the estimate of another parameter. Finally, I propose a new
   parameterization of the OU model that can be helpful when prior
   information about the parameters is not available. {[}Bayesian

Abstract = {Phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated loci
   ({''}phylogenomics{''} or ``supermatrix phylogeny{''}) is a powerful
   tool for solving evolutionary splits that are poorly resolved in single
   gene/protein trees. However, recent phylogenomic attempts to resolve the
   eukaryote root have yielded conflicting results, along with claims of
   various artifacts hidden in the data. We have investigated these
   conflicts using two new methods for assessing phylogenetic conflict.
   ConJak uses whole marker (gene or protein) jackknifing to assess
   deviation from a central mean for each individual sequence, whereas
   ConWin uses a sliding window to screen for incongruent protein fragments
   (mosaics). Both methods allow selective masking of individual sequences
   or sequence fragments in order to minimize missing data, an important
   consideration for resolving deep splits with limited data. Analyses
   focused on a set of 76 eukaryotic proteins of bacterial ancestry
   previously used in various combinations to assess the branching order
   among the three major divisions of eukaryotes: Amorphea (mainly animals,
   fungi, and Amoebozoa), Diaphoretickes (most other well-known eukaryotes
   and nearly all algae) and Excavata, represented here by Discoba
   (Jakobida, Heterolobosea, and Euglenozoa). ConJak analyses found strong
   outliers to be concentrated in undersampled lineages, whereas ConWin
   analyses of Discoba, the most undersampled of the major lineages,
   detected potentially incongruent fragments scattered throughout.
   Phylogenetic analyses of the full data using an LG-gamma model support a
   Discoba sister scenario (neozoan-excavate root), which rises to 99-100\%
   bootstrap support with data masked according to either protocol.
   However, analyses with two site-specific (CAT) mixture models yielded
   widely inconsistent results and a striking sensitivity to missing data.
   The neozoan-excavate root places Amorphea and Diaphoretickes as more
   closely related to each other than either is to Discoba, a fundamental

Title = {Image-Based Automated Species Identification: Can Virtual Data
   Augmentation Overcome Problems of Insufficient Sampling?},

Abstract = {Automated species identification and delimitation is challenging,
   particularly in rare and thus often scarcely sampled species, which do
   not allow sufficient discrimination of infraspecific versus
   interspecific variation. Typical problems arising from either low or
   exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by
   automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective
   species identification from training samples. However, limited
   infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning.
   In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help
   to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual
   species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised
   image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual
   data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and
   generation of artificial images using a generative adversarial networks
   approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck
   features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network that are then stepwise
   reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and principal
   component analysis to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation
   employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an
   oversampling algorithm in vector space. Applied on four different image
   data sets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla,
   Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart
   butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep
   learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy
   with nonaugmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach
   (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia). {[}Deep learning;

Title = {Do Alignment and Trimming Methods Matter for Phylogenomic (UCE)
   Analyses?},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Alignment is a crucial issue in molecular phylogenetics because
   different alignment methods can potentially yield very different
   topologies for individual genes. But it is unclear if the choice of
   alignment methods remains important in phylogenomic analyses, which
   incorporate data from hundreds or thousands of genes. For example,
   problematic biases in alignment might be multiplied across many loci,
   whereas alignment errors in individual genes might become irrelevant.
   The issue of alignment trimming (i.e., removing poorly aligned regions
   or missing data from individual genes) is also poorly explored. Here, we
   test the impact of 12 different combinations of alignment and trimming
   methods on phylogenomic analyses. We compare these methods using
   published phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from
   squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), birds, and tetrapods. We compare
   the properties of alignments generated by different alignment and
   trimming methods (e.g., length, informative sites, missing data). We
   also test whether these data sets can recover well-established clades
   when analyzed with concatenated (RAxML) and species-tree methods
   (ASTRAL-III), using the full data (similar to 5000 loci) and subsampled
   data sets (10\% and 1\% of loci). We show that different alignment and
   trimming methods can significantly impact various aspects of
   phylogenomic data sets (e.g., length, informative sites). However, these
   different methods generally had little impact on the recovery and
   support values for well-established clades, even across very different
   numbers of loci. Nevertheless, our results suggest several ``best
   practices{''} for alignment and trimming. Intriguingly, the choice of
   phylogenetic methods impacted the phylogenetic results most strongly,
   with concatenated analyses recovering significantly more
   well-established clades (with stronger support) than the species-tree
   analyses.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Genome-scale data have the potential to clarify phylogenetic
   relationships across the tree of life but have also revealed extensive
   gene tree conflict. This seeming paradox, whereby larger data sets both
   increase statistical confidence and uncover significant discordance,
   suggests that understanding sources of conflict is important for
   accurate reconstruction of evolutionary history. We explore this paradox
   in squamate reptiles, the vertebrate clade comprising lizards, snakes,
   and amphisbaenians. We collected an average of 5103 loci for 91 species
   of squamates that span higher-level diversity within the clade, which we
   augmented with publicly available sequences for an additional 17 taxa.
   Using a locus-by-locus approach, we evaluated support for alternative
   topologies at 17 contentious nodes in the phylogeny. We identified
   shared properties of conflicting loci, finding that rate and
   compositional heterogeneity drives discordance between gene trees and
   species tree and that conflicting loci rarely overlap across contentious
   nodes. Finally, by comparing our tests of nodal conflict to previous
   phylogenomic studies, we confidently resolve 9 of the 17 problematic
   nodes. We suggest this locus-by-locus and node-by-node approach can
   build consensus on which topological resolutions remain uncertain in
   phylogenomic studies of other contentious groups.},

Volume = {70},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The incorporation of stratigraphic data into phylogenetic analysis has a
   long history of debate but is not currently standard practice for
   paleontologists. Bayesian tip-dated (or morphological clock)
   phylogenetic methods have returned these arguments to the spotlight, but
   how tip dating affects the recovery of evolutionary relationships has
   yet to be fully explored. Here I show, through analysis of several data
   sets with multiple phylogenetic methods, that topologies produced by tip
   dating are outliers as compared to topologies produced by parsimony and
   undated Bayesian methods, which retrieve broadly similar trees.
   Unsurprisingly, trees recovered by tip dating have better fit to
   stratigraphy than trees recovered by other methods under both the Gap
   Excess Ratio (GER) and the Stratigraphic Completeness Index (SCI). This
   is because trees with better stratigraphic fit are assigned a higher
   likelihood by the fossilized birth-death treemodel. However, the degree
   to which the tree model favors tree topologies with high stratigraphic
   fit metrics is modulated by the diversification dynamics of the group
   under investigation. In particular, when net diversification rate is
   low, the treemodel favors trees with a higher GER compared to when net
   diversification rate is high. Differences in stratigraphic fit and tree
   topology between tip dating and other methods are concentrated in parts
   of the tree with weaker character signal, as shown by successive
   deletion of the most incomplete taxa from two data sets. These results
   show that tip dating incorporates stratigraphic data in an intuitive
   way, with good stratigraphic fit an expectation that can be overturned
   by strong evidence from character data.},

Abstract = {Taxon sampling is a central aspect of phylogenetic study design, but it
   has received limited attention in the context of total-evidence dating,
   a widely used dating approach that directly integrates molecular and
   morphological information from extant and fossil taxa. We here assess
   the impact of commonly employed outgroup sampling schemes and missing
   morphological data in extant taxa on age estimates in a total-evidence
   dating analysis under the uniform tree prior. Our study group is
   Pimpliformes, a highly diverse, rapidly radiating group of parasitoid
   wasps of the family Ichneumonidae. We analyze a data set comprising 201
   extant and 79 fossil taxa, including the oldest fossils of the family
   from the Early Cretaceous and the first unequivocal representatives of
   extant subfamilies from themid-Paleogene. Based on newly compiled
   molecular data fromten nuclear genes and amorphological matrix that
   includes 222 characters, we showthat age estimates become both older and
   less precise with the inclusion of more distant and more poorly sampled
   outgroups. These outgroups not only lack morphological and temporal
   information but also sit on long terminal branches and considerably
   increase the evolutionary rate heterogeneity. In addition, we discover
   an artifact that might be detrimental for total-evidence dating:
   ``bare-branch attraction,{''} namely high attachment probabilities of
   certain fossils to terminal branches for which morphological data are
   missing. Using computer simulations, we confirm the generality of this
   phenomenon and show that a large phylogenetic distance to any of the
   extant taxa, rather than just older age, increases the risk of a fossil
   being misplaced due to bare-branch attraction. After restricting
   outgroup sampling and adding morphological data for the previously
   attracting, bare branches, we recover a Jurassic origin for Pimpliformes
   and Ichneumonidae. This first age estimate for the group not only
   suggests an older origin than previously thought but also that
   diversification of the crown group happened well before the
   CretaceousPaleogene boundary. Our case study demonstrates that in order
   to obtain robust age estimates, total-evidence dating studies need to be
   based on a thorough and balancedsampling of both extant and fossil taxa,
   with the aim of minimizing evolutionary rate heterogeneity and missing
   morphological information.},

Abstract = {Long branch attraction (LBA) is a prevalent form of bias in phylogenetic
   estimation but the reasons for it are only partially understood. We
   argue here that it is largely due to differences in the sizes of the
   model spaces corresponding to different trees. Trees with long branches
   together allow much more flexible internal branch length parameter
   estimation. Consequently, although each tree has the same number of
   parameters, trees with long branches together have larger effective
   model spaces. The problem of LBA becomes particularly pronounced with
   partitioned data. Formulation of tree estimation as model selection
   leads us to propose bootstrap bias corrections as cross-checks on
   estimation when long branches end up being estimated together.},

Abstract = {Whatever one's definition of species, it is generally expected that
   individuals of the same species should be genetically more similar to
   each other than they are to individuals of another species. Here, we
   show that in the presence of cross-species gene flow, this expectation
   may be incorrect. We use the multispecies coalescent model with
   continuous-time migration or episodic introgression to study the impact
   of gene flow on genetic differences within and between species and
   highlight a surprising but plausible scenario in which different
   population sizes and asymmetrical migration rates cause a genetic
   sequence to be on average more closely related to a sequence from
   another species than to a sequence from the same species. Our results
   highlight the extraordinary impact that even a small amount of gene flow
   may have on the genetic history of the species. We suggest that
   contrasting long-term migration rate and short-term hybridization rate,
   both of which can be estimated using genetic data, may be a powerful
   approach to detecting the presence of reproductive barriers and to
   define species boundaries.},

Abstract = {Although phylogeny estimation is notoriously difficult in radiations
   that occurred several hundred million years ago, phylogenomic approaches
   offer new ways to examine relationships among ancient lineages and
   evaluate hypotheses that are key to evolutionary biology. Here, we
   reconstruct the deep-rooted relationships of one of the oldest living
   arthropod clades, the branchiopod crustaceans, using a kaleidoscopic
   approach. We use concatenation and coalescent tree-building methods to
   analyze a large multigene data set at the nucleotide and amino acid
   level and examine gene tree versus species tree discordance. We
   unequivocally resolve long-debated relationships among extant orders of
   the Cladocera, the waterfleas, an ecologically relevant zooplankton
   group in global aquatic and marine ecosystems that is famous for its
   model systems in ecology and evolution. To build the data set, we
   assembled eight de novo genomes of key taxa including representatives of
   all extant cladoceran orders and suborders. Our phylogenetic analysis
   focused on a BUSCO-based set of 823 conserved single-copy orthologs
   shared among 23 representative taxa spanning all living branchiopod
   orders, including 11 cladoceran families. Our analysis supports the
   monophyly of the Cladocera and reveals remarkable homoplasy in their
   body plans. We found large phylogenetic distances between lineages with
   similar ecological specializations, indicating independent evolution in
   major body plans, such as in the pelagic predatory orders Haplopoda and
   Onychopoda (the ``Gymnomera{''}). In addition, we assessed rapid
   cladogenesis by estimating relative timings of divergence in major
   lineages using reliable fossil-calibrated priors on eight nodes in the
   branchiopod tree, suggesting a Paleozoic origin around 325 Ma for the
   cladoceran ancestor and an ancient rapid radiation around 252 Ma at the
   Perm/Triassic boundary. These findings raise new questions about the
   roles of homoplasy and rapid radiation in the diversification of the
   cladocerans and help examine trait evolution from a genomic perspective
   in a functionally well understood, ancient arthropod group.

Abstract = {Whole-genome comparisons based on average nucleotide identities (ANI)
   and the genome-to-genome distance calculator have risen to prominence in
   rapidly classifying prokaryotic taxa using whole-genome sequences. Some
   implementations have even been proposed as a new standard in species
   classification and have become a common technique for papers describing
   newly sequenced genomes. However, attempts to apply whole-genome
   divergence data to the delineation of higher taxonomic units and to
   phylogenetic inference have had difficulty matching those produced by
   more complex phylogenetic methods. We present a novel method for
   generating statistically supported phylogenies of archaeal and bacterial
   groups using a combined ANI and alignment fraction-based metric. For the
   test cases to which we applied the developed approach, we obtained
   results comparable with other methodologies up to at least the family
   level. The developed method uses nonparametric bootstrapping to gauge
   support for inferred groups. This method offers the opportunity to make
   use of whole-genome comparison data, that is already being generated, to
   quickly produce phylogenies including support for inferred groups.
   Additionally, the developed ANI methodology can assist the
   classification of higher taxonomic groups.{[}Average nucleotide identity

Title = {On Defining and Finding Islands of Trees and Mitigating Large Island
   Bias},

Volume = {70},

Pages = {1282-1294},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How best can we summarize sets of phylogenetic trees? Systematists have
   relied heavily on consensus methods, but if tree distributions can be
   partitioned into distinct subsets, it may be helpful to provide separate
   summaries of these rather than relying entirely upon a single consensus
   tree. How sets of trees can most helpfully be partitioned and
   represented leads to many open questions, but one natural partitioning
   is provided by the islands of trees found during tree searches. Islands
   that are of dissimilar size have been shown to yield majority-rule
   consensus trees dominated by the largest sets We illustrate this large
   island bias and approaches that mitigate its impact by revisiting a
   recent analysis of phylogenetic relationships of living and fossil
   amphibians. We introduce a revised definition of tree islands based on
   any tree-to-tree pairwise distance metric that usefully extends the
   notion to any set or multiset of trees, as might be produced by, for
   example, Bayesian or bootstrap methods, and that facilitates finding
   tree islands a posteriori. We extract islands from a tree distribution
   obtained in a Bayesian analysis of the amphibian data to investigate
   their impact in that context, and we compare the partitioning produced
   by tree islands with those resulting from some alternative approaches.
   Distinct subsets of trees, such as tree islands, should be of interest
   because of what they may reveal about evolution and/or our attempts to
   understand it, and are an important, sometimes overlooked, consideration
   when building and interpreting consensus trees.},

Abstract = {Topological conflict or incongruence is widespread in phylogenomic data.
   Concatenation- and coalescent-based approaches often result in
   incongruent topologies, but the causes of this conflict can be difficult
   to characterize. We examined incongruence stemming from conflict the
   between likelihood-based signal (quantified by the difference in
   gene-wise log-likelihood score or Delta GLS) and quartet-based
   topological signal (quantified by the difference in gene-wise quartet
   score or Delta GQS) for every gene in three phylogenomic studies in
   animals, fungi, and plants, which were chosen because their
   concatenation-based IQ-TREE (T1) and quartet-based ASTRAL (T2)
   phylogenies are known to produce eight conflicting internal branches
   (bipartitions). By comparing the types of phylogenetic signal for all
   genes in these three data matrices, we found that 30-36\% of genes in
   each data matrix are inconsistent, that is, each of these genes has a
   higher log-likelihood score for T1 versus T2 (i.e., Delta GLS >0)
   whereas its T1 topology has lower quartet score than its T2 topology
   (i.e., Delta GQS <0) or vice versa. Comparison of inconsistent and
   consistent genes using a variety of metrics (e.g., evolutionary rate,
   gene tree topology, distribution of branch lengths, hidden paralogy, and
   gene tree discordance) showed that inconsistent genes are more likely to
   recover neither T1 nor T2 and have higher levels of gene tree
   discordance than consistent genes. Simulation analyses demonstrate that
   the removal of inconsistent genes from data sets with low levels of
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and low and medium levels of gene tree
   estimation error (GTEE) reduced incongruence and increased accuracy. In
   contrast, removal of inconsistent genes from data sets withmedium and
   high ILS levels and high GTEE levels eliminated or extensively reduced
   incongruence, but the resulting congruent species phylogenies were not
   always topologically identical to the true species trees.},

Abstract = {Contamination of a genetic sample with DNA from one or more nontarget
   species is a continuing concern of molecular phylogenetic studies, both
   Sanger sequencing studies and next-generation sequencing studies. We
   developed an automated pipeline for identifying and excluding likely
   cross-contaminated loci based on the detection of bimodal distributions
   of patristic distances across gene trees. When contamination occurs
   between samples within a data set, a comparison between a contaminated
   sample and its contaminant taxon will yield bimodal distributions with
   one peak close to zero patristic distance. This new method does not rely
   on a priori knowledge of taxon relatedness nor does it determine the
   causes(s) of the contamination. Exclusion of putatively contaminated
   loci from a data set generated for the insect family Cicadidae showed
   that these sequences were affecting some topological patterns and branch
   supports, although the effects were sometimes subtle, with some
   contamination-influenced relationships exhibiting strong bootstrap
   support. Long tip branches and outlier values for one anchored
   phylogenomic pipeline statistic (AvgNHomologs) were correlated with the
   presence of contamination. While the anchored hybrid enrichment markers
   used here, which target hemipteroid taxa, proved effective in resolving
   deep and shallow level Cicadidae relationships in aggregate, individual
   markers contained inadequate phylogenetic signal, in part probably due
   to short length. The cleaned data set, consisting of 429 loci, from 90
   genera representing 44 of 56 current Cicadidae tribes, supported three
   of the four sampled Cicadidae subfamilies in concatenated-matrix maximum
   likelihood (ML) and multispecies coalescent-based species tree analyses,
   with the fourth subfamily weakly supported in the ML trees. No
   well-supported patterns from previous family-level Sanger sequencing
   studies of Cicadidae phylogeny were contradicted. One taxon (Aragualna
   plenalinea) did not fall with its current subfamily in the genetic tree,
   and this genus and its tribe Aragualnini is reclassified to Tibicininae
   following morphological re-examination. Only subtle differences were
   observed in trees after the removal of loci for which divergent base
   frequencies were detected. Greater success may be achieved by increased
   taxon sampling and developing a probe set targeting a more recent common
   ancestor and longer loci. Searches for contamination are an essential
   step in phylogenomic analyses of all kinds and our pipeline is an
   effective solution. {[}Auchenorrhyncha; base-composition bias;

Abstract = {Diversification rates vary across species as a response to various
   factors, including environmental conditions and species-specific
   features. Phylogenetic models that allow accounting for and quantifying
   this heterogeneity in diversification rates have proven particularly
   useful for understanding clades diversification. Recently, we introduced
   the cladogenetic diversification rate shift model, which allows
   inferring multiple rate changes of small magnitude across lineages.
   Here, we present a new inference technique for this model that
   considerably reduces computation time through the use of data
   augmentation and provide an implementation of this method in Julia. In
   addition to drastically reducing computation time, this new inference
   approach provides a posterior distribution of the augmented data, that
   is the tree with extinct and unsampled lineages as well as associated
   diversification rates. In particular, this allows extracting the
   distribution through time of both the mean rate and the number of
   lineages. We assess the statistical performances of our approach using
   simulations and illustrate its application on the entire bird
   radiation.{[}Birth-death model; data augmentation; diversification;

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the interaction between coalescence
   and speciation, can generate incongruence between gene trees and species
   trees, as can gene duplication (D), transfer (T), and loss (L). These
   processes are usually modeled independently, but in reality, ILS can
   affect gene copy number polymorphism, that is, interfere with DTL. This
   has been previously recognized, but not treated in a satisfactory way,
   mainly because DTL events are naturally modeled forward-in-time, while
   ILS is naturally modeled backward-in-time with the coalescent. Here, we
   consider the joint action of ILS and DTL on the gene tree/species tree
   problem in all its complexity. In particular, we show that the
   interaction between ILS and duplications/transfers (without losses) can
   result in patterns usually interpreted as resulting from gene loss, and
   that the realized rate of D, T, and L becomes nonhomogeneous in time
   when ILS is taken into account. We introduce algorithmic solutions to
   these problems. Our new model, the multilocus multispecies coalescent,
   which also accounts for any level of linkage between loci, generalizes
   the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model and offers a versatile, powerful
   framework for proper simulation, and inference of gene family evolution.},

Title = {Morphological Characters Can Strongly Influence Early Animal
   Relationships Inferred from Phylogenomic Data Sets},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {There are considerable phylogenetic incongruencies between morphological
   and phylogenomic data for the deep evolution of animals. This has
   contributed to a heated debate over the earliest-branching lineage of
   the animal kingdom: the sister to all other Metazoa (SOM). Here, we use
   published phylogenomic data sets (similar to 45,000-400,000 characters
   in size with similar to 15-100 taxa) that focus on early metazoan
   phylogeny to evaluate the impact of incorporating morphological data
   sets (similar to 15-275 characters). We additionally use small exemplar
   data sets to quantify how increased taxon sampling can help stabilize
   phylogenetic inferences. We apply a plethora of common methods, that is,
   likelihood models and their ``equivalent{''} under parsimony: character
   weighting schemes. Our results are at odds with the typical view of
   phylogenomics, that is, that genomic-scale data sets will swamp out
   inferences from morphological data. Instead, weighting morphological
   data 2-10x in both likelihood and parsimony can in some cases ``flip{''}
   which phylum is inferred to be the SOM. This typically results in the
   molecular hypothesis of Ctenophora as the SOM flipping to Porifera (or
   occasionally Placozoa). However, greater taxon sampling improves
   phylogenetic stability, with some of the larger molecular data sets
   (>200,000 characters and up to similar to 100 taxa) showing node
   stability even with >= 100x upweighting of morphological data.
   Accordingly, our analyses have three strong messages. 1) The assumption
   that genomic data will automatically ``swamp out{''} morphological data
   is not always true for the SOM question. Morphological data have a
   strong influence in our analyses of combined data sets, even when
   outnumbered thousands of times by molecular data. Morphology therefore
   should not be counted out a priori. 2) We here quantify for the first
   time how the stability of the SOM node improves for several genomic data
   sets when the taxon sampling is increased. 3) The patterns of ``flipping
   points{''} (i.e., the weighting of morphological data it takes to change
   the inferred SOM) carry information about the phylogenetic stability of
   matrices. The weighting space is an innovative way to assess
   comparability of data sets that could be developed into a new
   sensitivity analysis tool.},

Abstract = {Popular optimality criteria for phylogenetic trees focus on sequences of
   characters that are applicable to all the taxa. As studies grow in
   breadth, it can be the case that some characters are applicable for a
   portion of the taxa and inapplicable for others. Past work has explored
   the limitations of treating inapplicable characters as missing data,
   noting that this strategy may favor trees where internal nodes are
   assigned impossible states, where the arrangement of taxa within
   subclades is unduly influenced by variation in distant parts of the
   tree, and/or where taxa that otherwise share most primary characters are
   grouped distantly. Approaches that avoid the first two problems have
   recently been proposed. Here, we propose an alternative approach which
   avoids all three problems. We focus on data matrices that use reductive
   coding of traits, that is, explicitly incorporate the innate hierarchy
   induced by inapplicability, and as such our approach extend to
   hierarchical characters, in general. In the spirit of maximum parsimony,
   the proposed criterion seeks the phylogenetic tree with the minimal
   changes across any tree branch, but where changes are defined in terms
   of dissimilarity metrics that weigh the effects of inapplicable
   characters. The approach can accommodate binary, multistate, ordered,
   unordered, and polymorphic characters. We give a polynomial-time
   algorithm, inspired by Fitch's algorithm, to score trees under a family
   of dissimilarity metrics, and prove its correctness. We show that the
   resulting optimality criteria is computationally hard, by reduction to
   the NP-hardness of the maximum parsimony optimality criteria. We
   demonstrate our approach using synthetic and empirical data sets and
   compare the results with other recently proposed methods for choosing
   optimal phylogenetic trees when the data includes hierarchical
   characters.},

Abstract = {Identification of discrete stocks of Greenland halibut is an important
   aspect of proper fisheries exploitation. Available literature data
   indicated a lack of significant inter-area differences between Greenland
   halibut populations from the Northeast Atlantic. To define the
   population diversity, two aspects were taken into account:
   enzyme-genetic diversity and the concentration of heavy metals in
   tissues. Seven allozyme loci variations were used to characterize the
   genetic structure of four populations of Greenland halibut from the
   Western Barents Sea region. The samples were collected from the spawning
   area in the period when this species took migration to spawn. The sample
   RH4 was significantly different from the other samples collected from
   the same location (RH2 and RH3) and depth for over two days. Another
   sample (RH8), collected from the nearby area 6 days later was similar to
   the samples RH2, RH3. We noticed a significant divergence between the
   sample RH4 and the three remaining samples, where the value of the index
   FST fluctuated about 0.40 and approximately 0.01 between three similar
   populations. This genetic fluctuation negates the thesis of a panmictic
   character of the Western Atlantic population.
   Feeding groups of Greenland halibut are moving along the Barents Sea
   shelf and they are exposed to different heavy metals concentrations
   according to the food preferences or the exact place of feeding. We
   identified similar concentrations of heavy metals, i.e., Zn, Cu, Cd, and
   Pb in all samples. Trace metal analysis of aquatic organisms from the
   Barents Sea can provide important information on the degree of
   environmental contamination, and the potential impact of seafood
   consumption.},

Abstract = {An evolutionary process is reflected in the sequence of changes of any
   trait (e.g., morphological or molecular) through time. Yet, a better
   understanding of evolution would be procured by characterizing
   correlated evolution, or when two or more evolutionary processes
   interact. Previously developed parametric methods often require
   significant computing time as they rely on the estimation of many
   parameters. Here, we propose a minimal likelihood framework modeling the
   joint evolution of two traits on a known phylogenetic tree. The type and
   strength of correlated evolution are characterized by a few parameters
   tuning mutation rates of each trait and interdependencies between these
   rates. The framework can be applied to study any discrete trait or
   character ranging from nucleotide substitution to gain or loss of a
   biological function. More specifically, it can be used to 1) test for
   independence between two evolutionary processes, 2) identify the type of
   interaction between them, and 3) estimate parameter values of the most
   likely model of interaction. In the current implementation, the method
   takes as input a phylogenetic tree with discrete evolutionary events
   mapped on its branches. The method then maximizes the likelihood for one
   or several chosen scenarios. The strengths and limits of the method, as
   well as its relative power compared to a few other methods, are assessed
   using both simulations and data from 16S rRNA sequences in a sample of
   54 gamma-enterobacteria. We show that, even with data sets of fewer than
   100 species, the method performs well in parameter estimation and in
   evolutionary model selection.},

Title = {Inferring the Effect of Species Interactions on Trait Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {463-479},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Models of trait evolution form an important part of macroevolutionary
   biology. The Brownian motion model and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models have
   become classic (null) models of character evolution, in which species
   evolve independently. Recently, models incorporating species
   interactions have been developed, particularly involving competition
   where abiotic factors pull species toward an optimal trait value and
   competitive interactions drive the trait values apart. However, these
   models assume a fitness function rather than derive it from population
   dynamics and they do not consider dynamics of the trait variance. Here,
   we develop a general coherent trait evolution framework where the
   fitness function is based on a model of population dynamics, and
   therefore it can, in principle, accommodate any type of species
   interaction. We illustrate our framework with a model of
   abundance-dependent competitive interactions against a macroevolutionary
   background encoded in a phylogenetic tree. We develop an inference tool
   based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and test it on simulated data
   (of traits at the tips). We find that inference performs well when the
   diversity predicted by the parameters equals the number of species in
   the phylogeny. We then fit the model to empirical data of baleen whale
   body lengths, using three different summary statistics, and compare it
   to a model without population dynamics and a model where competition
   depends on the total metabolic rate of the competitors. We show that the
   unweighted model performs best for the least informative summary
   statistic, while the model with competition weighted by the total
   metabolic rate fits the data slightly better than the other two models
   for the two more informative summary statistics. Regardless of the
   summary statistic used, the three models substantially differ in their
   predictions of the abundance distribution. Therefore, data on abundance
   distributions will allow us to better distinguish the models from one
   another, and infer the nature of species interactions. Thus, our
   framework provides a conceptual approach to reveal species interactions
   underlying trait evolution and identifies the data needed to do so in
   practice.},

Title = {Interrogating Phylogenetic Discordance Resolves Deep Splits in the Rapid
   Radiation of Old World Fruit Bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1077-1089},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The family Pteropodidae (Old World fruit bats) comprises >200 species
   distributed across the Old World tropics and subtropics. Most
   pteropodids feed on fruit, suggesting an early origin of frugivory,
   although several lineages have shifted to nectar-based diets.
   Pteropodids are of exceptional conservation concern with >50\% of
   species considered threatened, yet the systematics of this group has
   long been debated, with uncertainty surrounding early splits attributed
   to an ancient rapid diversification. Resolving the relationships among
   the main pteropodid lineages is essential if we are to fully understand
   their evolutionary distinctiveness, and the extent to which these bats
   have transitioned to nectar-feeding. Here we generated orthologous
   sequences for >1400 nuclear protein-coding genes (2.8 million base
   pairs) across 114 species from 43 genera of Old World fruit bats (57\%
   and 96\% of extant species- and genus-level diversity, respectively),
   and combined phylogenomic inference with filtering by information
   content to resolve systematic relationships among the major lineages.
   Concatenation and coalescent-based methods recovered three distinct
   backbone topologies that were not able to be reconciled by filtering via
   phylogenetic information content. Concordance analysis and gene
   genealogy interrogation show that one topology is consistently the best
   supported, and that observed phylogenetic conflicts arise from both gene
   tree error and deep incomplete lineage sorting. In addition to resolving
   long-standing inconsistencies in the reported relationships among major
   lineages, we show that Old World fruit bats have likely undergone at
   least seven independent dietary transitions from frugivory to
   nectarivory. Finally, we use this phylogeny to identify and describe one
   new genus.},

Title = {Integrating Sequence Capture and Restriction Site-Associated DNA
   Sequencing to Resolve Recent Radiations of Pelagic Seabirds},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {The diversification of modern birds has been shaped by a number of
   radiations. Rapid diversification events make reconstructing the
   evolutionary relationships among taxa challenging due to the convoluted
   effects of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression.
   Phylogenomic data sets have the potential to detect patterns of
   phylogenetic incongruence, and to address their causes. However, the
   footprints of ILS and introgression on sequence data can vary between
   different phylogenomic markers at different phylogenetic scales
   depending on factors such as their evolutionary rates or their selection
   pressures. We show that combining phylogenomic markers that evolve at
   different rates, such as paired-end double-digest restriction
   site-associated DNA(PE-ddRAD) and ultraconserved elements (UCEs), allows
   a comprehensive exploration of the causes of phylogenetic discordance
   associated with short internodes at different timescales. We used
   thousands of UCE and PE-ddRAD markers to produce the first well-resolved
   phylogeny of shear waters, a group of medium-sized pelagic seabirds that
   are among the most phylogenetically controversial and endangered bird
   groups. We found that phylogenomic conflict was mainly derived from high
   levels of ILS due to rapid speciation events. We also documented a case
   of introgression, despite the high philopatry of shearwaters to their
   breeding sites, which typically limits gene flow. We integrated
   state-of-the-art concatenated and coalescent-based approaches to expand
   on previous comparisons of UCE and RAD-Seq data sets for phylogenetics,
   divergence time estimation, and inference of introgression, and we
   propose a strategy to optimize RAD-Seq data for phylogenetic analyses.
   Our results highlight the usefulness of combining phylogenomic markers
   evolving at different rates to understand the causes of phylogenetic
   discordance at different timescales.},

Abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon that
   generates genetic variability in a population and fosters species
   diversity in nature. The availability of large genome scale data sets
   has revolutionized hybridization studies to shift from the observation
   of the presence or absence of hybrids to the investigation of the
   genomic constitution of hybrids and their genome-specific evolutionary
   dynamics. Although a handful of methods have been proposed in an attempt
   to identify hybrids, accurate detection of hybridization from genomic
   data remains a challenging task. In addition to methods that infer
   phylogenetic networks or that utilize pairwise divergence, site pattern
   frequency based and population genetic clustering approaches are
   popularly used in practice, though the performance of these methods
   under different hybridization scenarios has not been extensively
   examined. Here, we use simulated data to comparatively evaluate the
   performance of four tools that are commonly used to infer hybridization
   events: the site pattern frequency based methods HyDe and the
   D-statistic (i.e., the ABBA-BABA test) and the population clustering
   approaches structure and ADMIXTURE. We consider single hybridization
   scenarios that vary in the time of hybridization and the amount of
   incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) for different proportions of parental
   contributions (gamma); introgressive hybridization; multiple
   hybridization scenarios; and a mixture of ancestral and recent
   hybridization scenarios. We focus on the statistical power to detect
   hybridization and the false discovery rate (FDR) for comparisons of the
   D-statistic and HyDe, and the accuracy of the estimates of gamma as
   measured by the mean squared error for HyDe, structure, and ADMIXTURE.
   Both HyDe and the D-statistic are powerful for detecting hybridization
   in all scenarios except those with high ILS, although the D-statistic
   often has an unacceptably high FDR. The estimates of gamma in HyDe are
   impressively robust and accurate whereas structure and ADMIXTURE
   sometimes fail to identify hybrids, particularly when the proportional
   parental contributions are asymmetric (i.e., when v is close to 0).
   Moreover, the posterior distribution estimated using structure exhibits
   multimodality in many scenarios, making interpretation difficult. Our
   results provide guidance in selecting appropriate methods for
   identifying hybrid populations from genomic data.},

Abstract = {Organismal interactions drive the accumulation of diversity by
   influencing species ranges, morphology, and behavior. Interactions vary
   from agonistic to cooperative and should result in predictable patterns
   in trait and range evolution. However, despite a conceptual
   understanding of these processes, they have been difficult to model,
   particularly on macroevolutionary timescales and across broad geographic
   spaces. Here, we investigate the influence of biotic interactions on
   trait evolution and community assembly inmonitor lizards (Varanus).
   Monitors are an iconic radiation with a cosmopolitan distribution and
   the greatest size disparity of any living terrestrial vertebrate genus.
   Between the colossal Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis and the smallest
   Australian dwarf goannas, Varanus length and mass vary by multiple
   orders of magnitude. To test the hypothesis that size variation in this
   genus was driven by character displacement, we extended existing
   phylogenetic comparative methods which consider lineage interactions to
   account for dynamic biogeographic history and apply these methods to
   Australian monitors and marsupial predators. Incorporating both
   exon-capture molecular and morphological data sets we use a combined

   varaniform lizards. Our results suggest that communities of Australian
   Varanus show high functional diversity as a result of continent-wide
   interspecific competition among monitors but not with faunivorous
   marsupials. We demonstrate that patterns of trait evolution resulting
   from character displacement on continental scales are recoverable from

Abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurs broadly and repeatedly across the
   history of eukaryotes and is recognized as a prominent evolutionary
   force, especially in plants. Immediately following WGD, most genes are
   present in two copies as paralogs. Due to this redundancy, one copy of a
   paralog pair commonly undergoes pseudogenization and is eventually lost.
   When speciation occurs shortly after WGD; however, differential loss of
   paralogs may lead to spurious phylogenetic inference resulting from the
   inclusion of pseudoorthologs-paralogous genes mistakenly identified as
   orthologs because they are present in single copies within each sampled
   species. The influence and impact of including pseudoorthologs versus
   true orthologs as a result of gene extinction (or incomplete laboratory
   sampling) are only recently gaining empirical attention in the
   phylogenomics community. Moreover, few studies have yet to investigate
   this phenomenon in an explicit coalescent framework. Here, using
   mathematical models, numerous simulated data sets, and two newly
   assembled empirical data sets, we assess the effect of pseudoorthologs
   on species tree estimation under varying degrees of incomplete lineage
   sorting (ILS) and differential gene loss scenarios following WGD. When
   gene loss occurs along the terminal branches of the species tree,
   alignment-based (BPP) and gene-tree-based (ASTRAL, MP-EST, and STAR)
   coalescent methods are adversely affected as the degree of ILS
   increases. This can be greatly improved by sampling a sufficiently large
   number of genes. Under the same circumstances, however, concatenation
   methods consistently estimate incorrect species trees as the number of
   genes increases. Additionally, pseudoorthologs can greatly mislead
   species tree inference when gene loss occurs along the internal branches
   of the species tree. Here, both coalescent and concatenation methods
   yield inconsistent results. These results underscore the importance of
   understanding the influence of pseudoorthologs in the phylogenomics era.

Abstract = {Understanding phenotypic disparity across the tree of life requires
   identifying where and when evolutionary rates change on phylogeny. A
   primary methodological challenge in macroevolution is therefore to
   develop methods for accurate inference of among-lineage variation in
   rates of phenotypic evolution. Here, we describe a method for inferring
   among-lineage evolutionary rate heterogeneity in both continuous and
   discrete traits. The method assumes that the present-day distribution of
   a trait is shaped by a variable-rate process arising from a mixture of
   constant-rate processes and uses a single-pass tree traversal algorithm
   to estimate branch-specific evolutionary rates. By employing dynamic
   programming optimization techniques and approximate maximum likelihood
   estimators where appropriate, our method permits rapid exploration of
   the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Simulations indicate that
   the method reconstructs rates of trait evolution with high accuracy.
   Application of the method to data sets on squamate reptile reproduction
   and turtle body size recovers patterns of rate heterogeneity identified
   by previous studies but with computational costs reduced by many orders
   of magnitude. Our results expand the set of tools available for
   detecting macroevolutionary rate heterogeneity and point to the utility
   of fast, approximate methods for studying large-scale biodiversity
   dynamics. {[}Brownian motion; continuous characters; discrete

Volume = {71},

Pages = {476-489},

Abstract = {The species tree paradigm that dominates current molecular systematic
   practice infers species trees from collections of sequences under
   assumptions of the multispecies coalescent (MSC), that is, that there is
   free recombination between the sequences and no (or very low)
   recombination within them. These coalescent genes (c-genes) are thus
   defined in an historical rather than molecular sense and can in theory
   be as large as an entire genome or as small as a single nucleotide. A
   debate about how to define c-genes centers on the contention that
   nuclear gene sequences used in many coalescent analyses undergo too much
   recombination, such that their introns comprise multiple c-genes,
   violating a key assumption of the MSC. Recently a similar argument has
   been made for the genes of plastid (e.g., chloroplast) and mitochondrial
   genomes, which for the last 30 or more years have been considered to
   represent a single c-gene for the purposes of phylogeny reconstruction
   because they are nonrecombining in an historical sense. Consequently, it
   has been suggested that these genomes should be analyzed using
   coalescent methods that treat their genes-over 70 protein-coding genes
   in the case of most plastid genomes (plastomes)-as independent estimates
   of species phylogeny, in contrast to the usual practice of
   concatenation, which is appropriate for generating gene trees. However,
   although recombination certainly occurs in the plastome, as has been
   recognized since the 1970's, it is unlikely to be phylogenetically
   relevant. This is because such historically effective recombination can
   only occur when plastomes with incongruent histories are brought
   together in the same plastid. However, plastids sort rapidly into
   different cell lineages and rarely fuse. Thus, because of plastid
   biology, the plastome is a more canonical c-gene than is the average
   multi-intron mammalian nuclear gene. The plastome should thus continue
   to be treated as a single estimate of the underlying species phylogeny,
   as should the mitochondrial genome. The implications of this long-held
   insight of molecular systematics for studies in the phylogenomic era are
   explored. {[}c-gene; coalescent gene; concatalescence; organelle genome;

Title = {A New Pipeline for Removing Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {410-425},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Target enrichment (such as Hyb-Seq) is a well-established high
   throughput sequencing method that has been increasingly used for
   phylogenomic studies. Unfortunately, current widely used pipelines for
   analysis of target enrichment data do not have a vigorous procedure to
   remove paralogs in target enrichment data. In this study, we develop a
   pipeline we call Putative Paralogs Detection (PPD) to better address
   putative paralogs from enrichment data. The new pipeline is an add-on to
   the existing HybPiper pipeline, and the entire pipeline applies criteria
   in both sequence similarity and heterozygous sites at each locus in the
   identification of paralogs. Users may adjust the thresholds of sequence
   identity and heterozygous sites to identify and remove paralogs
   according to the level of phylogenetic divergence of their group of
   interest. The new pipeline also removes highly polymorphic sites
   attributed to errors in sequence assembly and gappy regions in the
   alignment. We demonstrated the value of the new pipeline using empirical
   data generated from Hyb-Seq and the Angiosperms353 kit for two woody
   genera Castanea (Fagaceae, Fagales) and Hamamelis (Hamamelidaceae,
   Saxifragales). Comparisons of data sets showed that the PPD identified
   many more putative paralogs than the popular method HybPiper.
   Comparisons of tree topologies and divergence times showed evident
   differences between data from HybPiper and data from our new PPD
   pipeline. We further evaluated the accuracy and error rates of PPD by
   BLAST mapping of putative paralogous and orthologous sequences to a
   reference genome sequence of Castanea mollissima. Compared to HybPiper
   alone, PPD identified substantially more paralogous gene sequences that
   mapped to multiple regions of the reference genome (31 genes for PPD
   compared with 4 genes for HybPiper alone). In conjunction with HybPiper,
   paralogous genes identified by both pipelines can be removed resulting
   in the construction of more robust orthologous gene data sets for
   phylogenomic and divergence time analyses. Our study demonstrates the
   value of Hyb-Seq with data derived from the Angiosperms353 probe set for
   elucidating species relationships within a genus, and argues for the
   importance of additional steps to filter paralogous genes and poorly
   aligned regions (e.g., as occur through assembly errors), such as our
   new PPD pipeline described in this study. {[}Angiosperms353; Castanea;

Abstract = {Understanding how gene flow affects population divergence and speciation
   remains challenging. Differentiating one evolutionary process from
   another can be difficult because multiple processes can produce similar
   patterns, and more than one process can occur simultaneously. Although
   simple population models produce predictable results, how these
   processes balance in taxa with patchy distributions and complicated
   natural histories is less certain. These types of populations might be
   highly connected through migration (gene flow), but can experience
   stronger effects of genetic drift and inbreeding, or localized
   selection. Although different signals can be difficult to separate, the
   application of high-throughput sequence data can provide the resolution
   necessary to distinguish many of these processes. We present
   whole-genome sequence data for an avian species group with an alpine and
   arctic tundra distribution to examine the role that different population
   genetic processes have played in their evolutionary history.
   Rosy-finches inhabit high elevation mountaintop sky islands and
   high-latitude island and continental tundra. They exhibit extensive
   plumage variation coupled with low levels of genetic variation.
   Additionally, the number of species within the complex is debated,
   making them excellent for studying the forces involved in the process of
   diversification, as well as an important species group in which to
   investigate species boundaries. Total genomic variation suggests a
   broadly continuous pattern of allele frequency changes across the
   mainland taxa of this group in North America. However, phylogenomic
   analyses recover multiple distinct, well supported, groups that coincide
   with previously described morphological variation and current
   species-level taxonomy. Tests of introgression using D-statistics and
   approximate Bayesian computation reveal significant levels of
   introgression between multiple North American taxa. These results
   provide insight into the balance between divergent and homogenizing
   population genetic processes and highlight remaining challenges in
   interpreting conflict between different types of analytical approaches
   with whole-genome sequence data.},

Abstract = {Trade-offs are thought to bias evolution and are core features of many
   anatomical systems. Therefore, trade-offs may have far-reaching
   macroevolutionary consequences, including patterns of morphological,
   functional, and ecological diversity. Jaws, like many complex anatomical
   systems, are comprised of elements involved in biomechanical trade-offs.
   We test the impact of a core mechanical trade-off, the transmission of
   velocity versus force (i.e., mechanical advantage), on rates of jaw
   evolution in Neotropical cichlids. Across 130 species representing a
   wide array of feeding ecologies, we find that the velocity-force
   trade-off impacts the evolution of the surrounding jaw system.
   Specifically, rates of jaw evolution are faster at functional extremes
   than in more functionally intermediate or unspecialized jaws. Yet,
   surprisingly, the effect on jaw evolution is uneven across the extremes
   of the velocity-force continuum. Rates of jaw evolution are 4- to
   10-fold faster in velocity-modified jaws, whereas force-modified jaws
   are 7- to 18-fold faster, compared to unspecialized jaws, depending on
   the extent of specialization. Further, we find that a more extreme
   mechanical trade-off resulted in faster rates of jaw evolution. The
   velocity-force trade-off reflects a gradient from specialization on
   capture-intensive (e.g., evasive or buried) to processing-intensive prey
   (e.g., attached or shelled), respectively. The velocity extreme of the
   trade-off is characterized by large magnitudes of trait change leading
   to functionally divergent specialists and ecological stasis. By
   contrast, the force extreme of the trade-off is characterized by
   enhanced ecological lability made possible by phenotypes more readily
   co-opted for different feeding ecologies. This asymmetry of
   macroevolutionary outcomes along each extreme is likely the result of an
   enhanced utility of the pharyngeal jaw system as force-modified oral
   jaws are adapted for prey that requires intensive processing (e.g.,
   algae, detritus, and mollusks). The velocity-force trade-off, a
   fundamental feature of many anatomical systems, promotes rapid
   phenotypic evolution of the surrounding jaw system in a canonical
   continental adaptive radiation. Considering that the velocity-force
   trade-off is an inherent feature of all jaw systems that involve a lower
   element that rotates at a joint, spanning the vast majority of
   vertebrates, our results may be widely applicable across the tree of
   life. {[}Adaptive radiation; constraint; decoupling; jaws;

Title = {Measuring Phylogenetic Information of Incomplete Sequence Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {630-648},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Widely used approaches for extracting phylogenetic information from
   aligned sets of molecular sequences rely upon probabilistic models of
   nucleotide substitution or amino-acid replacement. The phylogenetic
   information that can be extracted depends on the number of columns in
   the sequence alignment and will be decreased when the alignment contains
   gaps due to insertion or deletion events. Motivated by the measurement
   of information loss, we suggest assessment of the effective sequence
   length (ESL) of an aligned data set. The ESL can differ from the actual
   number of columns in a sequence alignment because of the presence of
   alignment gaps. Furthermore, the estimation of phylogenetic information
   is affected by model misspecification. Inevitably, the actual process of
   molecular evolution differs from the probabilistic models employed to
   describe this process. This disparity means the amount of phylogenetic
   information in an actual sequence alignment will differ from the amount
   in a simulated data set of equal size, which motivated us to develop a
   new test for model adequacy. Via theory and empirical data analysis, we
   show how to disentangle the effects of gaps and model misspecification.
   By comparing the Fisher information of actual and simulated sequences,
   we identify which alignment sites and tree branches are most affected by
   gaps and model misspecification. {[}Fisher information; gaps; insertion;

Abstract = {The Amazon and neighboring South American river basins harbor the
   world's most diverse assemblages of freshwater fishes. One of the most
   prominent South American fish families is the Serrasalmidae (pacus and
   piranhas), found in nearly every continental basin. Serrasalmids are
   keystone ecological taxa, being some of the top riverine predators as
   well as the primary seed dispersers in the flooded forest. Despite their
   widespread occurrence and notable ecologies, serrasalmid evolutionary
   history and systematics are controversial. For example, the sister taxon
   to serrasalmids is contentious, the relationships of major clades within
   the family are inconsistent across different methodologies, and half of
   the extant serrasalmid genera are suggested to be non-monophyletic. We
   analyzed exon capture to reexamine the evolutionary relationships among
   63 (of 99) species across all 16 serrasalmid genera and their nearest
   outgroups, including multiple individuals per species to account for
   cryptic lineages. To reconstruct the timeline of serrasalmid
   diversification, we time-calibrated this phylogeny using two different
   fossil-calibration schemes to account for uncertainty in taxonomy with
   respect to fossil teeth. Finally, we analyzed diet evolution across the
   family and comment on associated changes in dentition, highlighting the
   ecomorphological diversity within serrasalmids. We document widespread
   non-monophyly of genera within Myleinae, as well as between Serrasalmus
   and Pristobrycon, and propose that reliance on traits like teeth to
   distinguish among genera is confounded by ecological homoplasy,
   especially among herbivorous and omnivorous taxa. We clarify the
   relationships among all serrasalmid genera, propose new subfamily
   affiliations, and support hemiodontids as the sister taxon to
   Serrasalmidae.},

Abstract = {Complex speciation, involving rapid divergence and multiple bouts of
   post-divergence gene flow, can obfuscate phylogenetic relationships and
   species limits. In North America, cases of complex speciation are
   common, due at least in part to the cyclical Pleistocene glacial history
   of the continent. Scrub-Jays in the genus Aphelocoma provide a useful
   case study in complex speciation because their range throughout North
   America is structured by phylogeographic barriers with multiple cases of
   secondary contact between divergent lineages. Here, we show that a
   comprehensive approach to genomic reconstruction of evolutionary
   history, i.e., synthesizing results from species delimitation, species
   tree reconstruction, demographic model testing, and tests for gene flow,
   is capable of clarifying evolutionary history despite complex
   speciation. We find concordant evidence across all statistical
   approaches for the distinctiveness of an endemic southern Mexico lineage
   (A. w. sumichrasti), culminating in support for the species status of
   this lineage under any commonly applied species concept. We also find
   novel genomic evidence for the species status of a Texas endemic lineage
   A. w. texana, for which equivocal species delimitation results were
   clarified by demographic modeling and spatially explicit models of gene
   flow. Finally, we find that complex signatures of both ancient and
   modern gene flow between the non-sister California Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma
   californica) and Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma woodhouseii) result
   in discordant gene trees throughout the species' genomes despite clear
   support for their overall isolation and species status. In sum, we find
   that a multi-faceted approach to genomic analysis can increase our
   understanding of complex speciation histories, even in well-studied
   groups. Given the emerging recognition that complex speciation is
   relatively commonplace, the comprehensive framework that we demonstrate
   for interrogation of species limits and evolutionary history using
   genomic data can provide a necessary roadmap for disentangling the
   impacts of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) to better
   understand the systematics of other groups with similarly complex
   evolutionary histories. {[}Gene flow; genomics; introgression;

Abstract = {How long does speciation take? The answer to this important question in
   evolutionary biology lies in the genetic difference not only among
   species, but also among lineages within each species. With the advance
   of genome sequencing in non-model organisms and the statistical tools to
   improve accuracy in inferring evolutionary histories among recently
   diverged lineages, we now have the lineage-level trees to answer these
   questions. However, we do not yet have an analytical tool for inferring
   speciation processes from these trees. What is needed is a model of
   speciation processes that generates both the trees and species
   identities of extant lineages. The model should allow calculation of the
   probability that certain lineages belong to certain species and have an
   evolutionary history consistent with the tree. Here, we propose such a
   model and test the model performance on both simulated data and real
   data. We show that maximum-likelihood estimates of the model are highly
   accurate and give estimates from real data that generate patterns
   consistent with observations. We discuss how to extend the model to
   account for different rates and types of speciation processes across
   lineages in a species group. By linking evolutionary processes on
   lineage level to species level, the model provides a new phylogenetic
   approach to study not just when speciation happened, but how speciation
   happened. {[}Micro-macro evolution; Protracted birth-death process;

Abstract = {The historical signal in nucleotide sequences becomes eroded over time
   by substitutions occurring repeatedly at the same sites. This
   phenomenon, known as substitution saturation, is recognized as one of
   the primary obstacles to deep-time phylogenetic inference using
   genome-scale data sets. We present a new test of substitution saturation
   and demonstrate its performance in simulated and empirical data. For
   some of the 36 empirical phylogenomic data sets that we examined, we
   detect substitution saturation in around 50\% of loci. We found that
   saturation tends to be flagged as problematic in loci with highly
   discordant phylogenetic signals across sites. Within each data set, the
   loci with smaller numbers of informative sites are more likely to be
   flagged as containing problematic levels of saturation. The entropy
   saturation test proposed here is sensitive to high evolutionary rates
   relative to the evolutionary timeframe, while also being sensitive to
   several factors known to mislead phylogenetic inference, including short
   internal branches relative to external branches, short nucleotide
   sequences, and tree imbalance. Our study demonstrates that excluding
   loci with substitution saturation can be an effective means of
   mitigating the negative impact of multiple substitutions on phylogenetic
   inferences. {[}Phylogenetic model performance; phylogenomics;

Title = {Unveiling the Patterns of Reticulated Evolutionary Processes with
   Phylogenomics: Hybridization and Polyploidy in the Genus Rosa},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Reticulation, caused by hybridization and allopolyploidization, is
   considered an important and frequent phenomenon in the evolution of
   numerous plant lineages. Although both processes represent important
   driving forces of evolution, they are mostly ignored in phylogenetic
   studies involving a large number of species. Indeed only a scattering of
   methods exists to recover a comprehensive reticulated evolutionary
   history for a broad taxon sampling. Among these methods, comparisons of
   topologies obtained from plastid markers with those from a few nuclear
   sequences are favored, even though they restrict in-depth studies of
   hybridization and polyploidization. The genus Rosa encompasses c. 150
   species widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere and
   represents a challenging taxonomic group in which hybridization and
   polyploidization are prominent. Our main objective was to develop a
   general framework that would take patterns of reticulation into account
   in the study of the phylogenetic relationships among Rosa species. Using
   amplicon sequencing, we targeted allele variation in the nuclear genome
   as well as haploid sequences in the chloroplast genome. We successfully
   recovered robust plastid and nuclear phylogenies and performed in-depth
   tests for several scenarios of hybridization using a maximum
   pseudo-likelihood approach on taxon subsets. Our diploid-first approach
   followed by hybrid and polyploid grafting resolved most of the
   evolutionary relationships among Rosa subgenera, sections, and selected
   species. Based on these results, we provide new directions for a future
   revision of the infrageneric classification in Rosa. The stepwise
   strategy proposed here can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic
   relationships of other challenging taxonomic groups with large numbers
   of hybrid and polyploid taxa. {[}Amplicon sequencing; interspecific

Title = {Genomics Reveals Widespread Ecological Speciation in Flightless Insects},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Pages = {863-876},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent genomic analyses have highlighted parallel divergence in response
   to ecological gradients, but the extent to which altitude can underpin
   such repeated speciation remains unclear. Wing reduction and flight loss
   have apparently evolved repeatedly in montane insect assemblages and
   have been suggested as important drivers of hexapod diversification. We
   test this hypothesis using genomic analyses of a wide spread
   wing-polymorphic stonefly species complex in New Zealand. We identified
   over 50,000 polymorphic genetic markers generated across almost 200
   Zelandoperla fenestrata stonefly specimens using a newly generated
   plecopteran reference genome, to reveal widespread parallel speciation
   between sympatric full-winged and wing-reduced ecotypes. Rather than the
   existence of a single, widespread, flightless taxon (Zelandoperla
   pennulata), evolutionary genomic data reveal that wing-reduced upland
   lineages have speciated repeatedly and independently from full-winged Z.
   fenestrata. This repeated evolution of reproductive isolation between
   local ecotype pairs that lack mitochondrial DNA differentiation suggests
   that ecological speciation has evolved recently. Acluster of outlier
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected in independently wing-reduced
   lineages, tightly linked in an approximately 85 kb genomic region that
   includes the developmental ``supergene{''} doublesex, suggests that this
   ``island of divergence{''} may play a key role in rapid ecological
   speciation.},

Title = {Phase Resolution of Heterozygous Sites in Diploid Genomes is Important
   to Phylogenomic Analysis under the Multispecies Coalescent Model},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {334-352},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Genome sequencing projects routinely generate haploid consensus
   sequences from diploid genomes, which are effectively chimeric sequences
   with the phase at heterozygous sites resolved at random. The impact of
   phasing errors on phylogenomic analyses under the multispecies
   coalescent (MSC) model is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a computer
   simulation to evaluate the performance of four phase-resolution
   strategies (the true phase resolution, the diploid analytical
   integration algorithm which averages over all phase resolutions,
   computational phase resolution using the program PHASE, and random
   resolution) on estimation of the species tree and evolutionary
   parameters in analysis of multilocus genomic data under the MSC model.
   We found that species tree estimation is robust to phasing errors when
   species divergences were much older than average coalescent times but
   may be affected by phasing errors when the species tree is shallow.
   Estimation of parameters under the MSC model with and without
   introgression is affected by phasing errors. In particular, random phase
   resolution causes serious overestimation of population sizes for modern
   species and biased estimation of cross-species introgression
   probability. In general, the impact of phasing errors is greater when
   the mutation rate is higher, the data include more samples per species,
   and the species tree is shallower with recent divergences. Use of phased
   sequences inferred by the PHASE program produced small biases in
   parameter estimates. We analyze two real data sets, one of East Asian
   brown frogs and another of Rocky Mountains chipmunks, to demonstrate
   that heterozygote phase-resolution strategies have similar impacts on
   practical data analyses. We suggest that genome sequencing projects
   should produce unphased diploid genotype sequences if fully phased data
   are too challenging to generate, and avoid haploid consensus sequences,
   which have heterozygous sites phased at random. In case the analytical
   integration algorithm is computationally unfeasible, computational
   phasing prior to population genomic analyses is an acceptable
   alternative. {[}BPP; introgression; multispecies coalescent; phase;

Abstract = {Rapid evolutionary radiations are among the most challenging
   phylogenetic problems, wherein different types of data (e.g., morphology
   and molecular) or genetic markers (e.g., nuclear and organelle) often
   yield inconsistent results. The tribe Arundinarieae, that is, the
   temperate bamboos, is a Glade of tetraploid originated 22 Ma and
   subsequently radiated in East Asia. Previous studies of Arundinarieae
   have found conflicting relationships and/or low support. Here, we obtain
   nuclear markers from ddRAD data for 213 Arundinarieae taxa and parallel
   sampling of chloroplast genomes from genome skimming for 147 taxa. We
   first assess the feasibility of using ddRAD-seq data for phylogenetic
   estimates of paleopolyploid and rapidly radiated lineages, optimize
   clustering thresholds, and analysis workflow for orthology
   identification. Reference-based ddRAD data assembly approaches perform
   well and yield strongly supported relationships that are generally
   concordant with morphology-based taxonomy. We recover five major
   lineages, two of which are notable (the pachymorph and leptomorph
   lineages), in that they correspond with distinct rhizome morphologies.
   By contrast, the phylogeny from chloroplast genomes differed
   significantly. Based on multiple lines of evidence, the ddRAD tree is
   favored as the best species tree estimation for temperate bamboos. Using
   a time-calibrated ddRAD tree, we find that Arundinarieae diversified
   rapidly around the mid-Miocene corresponding with intensification of the
   East Asian monsoon and the evolution of key innovations including the
   leptomorph rhizomes. Our results provide a highly resolved phylogeny of
   Arundinarieae, shed new light on the radiation and reticulate
   evolutionary history of this tribe, and provide an empirical example for
   the study of recalcitrant plant radiations.},

Abstract = {Extremely dense fog event was studied on the 3rd December 2001, which
   occurred in the city of Apatity, the Kola Peninsula, northwestern
   Russia. Fog had low visibility (30-50 m) and lasted 17 h. Variations of
   atmospheric pressure and electric field before and during the fog event
   were measured. Multiple Taper Method (MTM) of spectral analysis has
   revealed pulsations of the atmospheric electric field in the frequency
   band of 0.007-0.05 Hz with a power-law turbulence spectrum. MTM and
   wavelet decomposition analysis results indicate the appearance of two
   types of atmospheric pressure oscillations under the fog conditions:
   low-frequency variations with periods of internal gravity waves and a
   substantial increase in pulsation intensity (more than an order of
   magnitude) in the high frequency (0.03-0.35 Hz) range. These results may
   help to improve the understanding of the microphysics of fog formation,
   development, and dissipation. High-frequency pulsations generation of
   atmospheric pressure under the fog conditions is also of interest
   because their period is close to the range of infrasonic oscillations,
   which can have negative consequences for human health.},

Abstract = {The paper presents data on the total phenolic and flavonoid content in
   Deschampsia antarctica E. Desv. plants collected from natural habitats,
   plants cultured in vitro, regenerated plants, and plants cultivated in a
   growth chamber. It was found that the shoots (aerial parts) had higher
   phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to the roots. The largest
   amount of these substances was found in wild plants from Great Yalour
   Island. The content of phenolics and flavonoids in plants cultured in
   vitro was generally comparable to that in plants collected from natural
   habitats except for some clones. HPLC analysis revealed five main
   metabolites present in similar ratios in the studied samples of wild and
   in vitro plants. Minor substances varied slightly in different extracts,
   however their presence did not depend on plant growth conditions. No
   significant qualitative differences in HPLC profiles were found between
   the wild and in vitro plants. The studied samples did not contain
   quercetin, kaempferol and luteolin, whereas orientin was found in all
   studied samples of D. antarctica.},

Title = {Hidden Phylogenomic Signal Helps Elucidate Arsenurine Silkmoth Phylogeny
   and the Evolution of Body Size and Wing Shape Trade-Offs},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {One of the key objectives in biological research is understanding how
   evolutionary processes have produced Earth's diversity. A critical step
   toward revealing these processes is an investigation of evolutionary
   tradeoffs-that is, the opposing pressures of multiple selective forces.
   For millennia, nocturnal moths have had to balance successful flight, as
   they search for mates or host plants, with evading bat predators.
   However, the potential for evolutionary trade-offs between wing shape
   and body size are poorly understood. In this study, we used
   phylogenomics and geometric morphometrics to examine the evolution of
   wing shape in the wild silkmoth subfamily Arsenurinae (Saturniidae) and
   evaluate potential evolutionary relationships between body size and wing
   shape. The phylogeny was inferred based on 782 loci from target capture
   data of 42 arsenurine species representing all 10 recognized genera.
   After detecting in our data one of the most vexing problems in
   phylogenetic inference-a region of a tree that possesses short branches
   and no ``support{''} for relationships (i.e., a polytomy), we looked for
   hidden phylogenomic signal (i.e., inspecting differing phylogenetic
   inferences, alternative support values, quartets, and phylogenetic
   networks) to better illuminate the most probable generic relationships
   within the subfamily. We found there are putative evolutionary
   trade-offs between wing shape, body size, and the interaction of fore-
   and hindwing (HW) shape. Namely, body size tends to decrease with
   increasing HW length but increases as forewing (FW) shape becomes more
   complex. Additionally, the type of HW (i.e., tail or no tail) a lineage
   possesses has a significant effect on the complexity of FW shape. We
   outline possible selective forces driving the complex HW shapes that
   make Arsenurinae, and silkmoths as a whole, so charismatic. {[}Anchored

Title = {Gene Tree Estimation Error with Ultraconserved Elements: An Empirical
   Study on Pseudapis Bees},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {803-821},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Summarizing individual gene trees to species phylogenies using two-step
   coalescent methods is now a standard strategy in the field of
   phylogenomics. However, practical implementations of summary methods
   suffer from gene tree estimation error, which is caused by various
   biological and analytical factors. Greatly understudied is the choice of
   gene tree inference method and downstream effects on species tree
   estimation for empirical data sets. To better understand the impact of
   this method choice on gene and species tree accuracy, we compare gene
   trees estimated through four widely used programs under different
   model-selection criteria: PhyloBayes, MrBayes, IQ-Tree, and RAxML. We
   study their performance in the phylogenomic framework of >800
   ultraconserved elements from the bee subfamily Nomiinae (Halictidae).
   Our taxon sampling focuses on the genus Pseudapis, a distinct lineage
   with diverse morphological features, but contentious morphology-based
   taxonomic classifications and no molecular phylogenetic guidance. We
   approximate topological accuracy of gene trees by assessing their
   ability to recover two uncontroversial, monophyletic groups, and compare
   branch lengths of individual trees using the stemminess metric (the
   relative length of internal branches). We further examine different
   strategies of removing uninformative loci and the collapsing of weakly
   supported nodes into polytomies. We then summarize gene trees with
   ASTRAL and compare resulting species phylogenies, including comparisons
   to concatenation-based estimates. Gene trees obtained with the
   reversible jump model search in MrBayes were most concordant on average
   and all Bayesian methods yielded gene trees with better stemminess
   values. The only gene tree estimation approach whose ASTRAL summary
   trees consistently produced the most likely correct topology, however,
   was IQ-Tree with automated model designation (ModelFinder program). We
   discuss these findings and provide practical advice on gene tree
   estimation for summary methods. Lastly, we establish the first
   phylogeny-informed classification for Pseudapis s. 1. and map the
   distribution of distinct morphological features of the group.},

Title = {Color Polymorphism is a Driver of Diversification in the Lizard Family
   Lacertidae},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Color polymorphism-two or more heritable color phenotypes maintained
   within a single breeding population-is an extreme type of intraspecific
   diversity widespread across the tree of life. Color polymorphism is
   hypothesized to be an engine for speciation, where morph loss or
   divergence between distinct color morphs within a species results in the
   rapid evolution of new lineages, and thus, color polymorphic lineages
   are expected to display elevated diversification rates. Multiple species
   in the lizard family Lacertidae are color polymorphic, making them an
   ideal group to investigate the evolutionary history of this trait and
   its influence on macroevolution. Here, we produce a comprehensive
   species-level phylogeny of the lizard family Lacertidae to reconstruct
   the evolutionary history of color polymorphism and test if color
   polymorphism has been a driver of diversification. Accounting for
   phylogenetic uncertainty with multiple phylogenies and simulation
   studies, we estimate an ancient origin of color polymorphism (111 Ma)
   within the Lacertini tribe (subfamily Lacertinae). Color polymorphism
   most likely evolved few times in the Lacertidae and has been lost at a
   much faster rate than gained. Evolutionary transitions to color
   polymorphism are associated with shifts in increased net diversification
   rate in this family of lizards. Taken together, our empirical results
   support long-standing theoretical expectations that color polymorphism
   is a driver of diversification.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) are commonly used to study
   evolution and adaptation. However, frequently used PCMs for discrete
   traits mishandle single evolutionary transitions. They erroneously
   detect correlated evolution in these situations. For example, hair and
   mammary glands cannot be said to have evolved in a correlated fashion
   because each evolved only once in mammals, but a commonly used model
   (Pagel's Discrete) statistically supports correlated (dependent)
   evolution. Using simulations, we find that rate parameter estimation,
   which is central for model selection, is poor in these scenarios due to
   small effective (evolutionary) sample sizes of independent character
   state change. Pagel's Discrete model also tends to favor dependent
   evolution in these scenarios, in part, because it forces evolution
   through state combinations unobserved in the tip data. This model
   prohibits simultaneous dual transitions along branches. Models with
   underlying continuous data distributions (e.g., Threshold and GLMM) are
   less prone to favor correlated evolution but are still susceptible when
   evolutionary sample sizes are small. We provide three general
   recommendations for researchers who encounter these common situations:
   i) create study designs that evaluate a priori hypotheses and maximize
   evolutionary sample sizes; ii) assess the suitability of evolutionary
   models-for discrete traits, we introduce the phylogenetic imbalance
   ratio; and iii) evaluate evolutionary hypotheses with a consilience of
   evidence from disparate fields, like biogeography and developmental
   biology. Consilience plays a central role in hypothesis testing within
   the historical sciences where experiments are difficult or impossible to
   conduct, such as many hypotheses about correlated evolution. These
   recommendations are useful for investigations that employ any type of
   PCM.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Analysis of Concatenated Ultraconserved Elements Reveals
   the Recent Evolutionary Radiation of the Fairy Wrasses (Teleostei:
   Labridae: Cirrhilabrus)},

Abstract = {The fairy wrasses (genus Cirrhilabrus) are among the most successful of
   the extant wrasse lineages (Teleostei: Labridae), with their 61 species
   accounting for nearly 10 of the family. Although species complexes
   within the genus have been diagnosed on the basis of coloration patterns
   and synapomorphies, attempts to resolve evolutionary relationships among
   these groups using molecular and morphological data have largely been
   unsuccessful. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach with a data set
   comprising 991 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and mitochondrial COI to
   uncover the evolutionary history and patterns of temporal and spatial
   diversification of the fairy wrasses. Our analyses of phylogenetic
   signal suggest that most gene-tree incongruence is caused by estimation
   error, leading to poor resolution in a summary-coalescent analysis of
   the data. In contrast, analyses of concatenated sequences are able to
   resolve the major relationships of Cirrhilabrus. We determine the
   placements of species that were previously regarded as incertae sedis
   and find evidence for the nesting of Conniella, an unusual, monotypic
   genus, within Cirrhilabrus. Our relaxed-clock dating analysis indicates
   that the major divergences within the genus occurred around the
   Miocene-Pliocene boundary, followed by extensive cladogenesis of species
   complexes in the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Biogeographic reconstruction
   suggests that the fairy wrasses emerged within the Coral Triangle, with
   episodic fluctuations of sea levels during glacial cycles coinciding
   with shallow divergence events but providing few opportunities for more
   widespread dispersal. Our study demonstrates both the resolving power
   and limitations of UCEs across shallow timescales where there is
   substantial estimation error in individual gene trees.},

Abstract = {Amino acid substitution models play a crucial role in phylogenetic
   analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate
   amino acid substitution models; however, they are typically complicated
   and slow. In this article, we propose QMaker, a new ML method to
   estimate a general time-reversible Q matrix from a large protein data
   set consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines an
   efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling
   themodel heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate
   mixturemodels among sites. We provide QMaker as a user-friendly function
   in the IQ-TREEsoftware package (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the
   use of multiple CPU cores so that biologists can easily estimate amino
   acid substitution models from their own protein alignments. We used
   QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino acid substitution models
   from the current Pfam database as well as five clade-specific models for
   mammals, birds, insects, yeasts, and plants. Our results show that the
   new models considerably improve the fit between model and data and in
   some cases influence the inference of phylogenetic tree topologies.},

Title = {Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Widespread Nuclear and Plastid-Nuclear
   Discordance in the Flowering Plant Genus Polemonium (Polemoniaceae)
   Suggests Widespread Historical Gene Flow Despite Limited Nuclear Signal},

Abstract = {Phylogenomic data from a rapidly increasing number of studies provide
   new evidence for resolving relationships in recently radiated clades,
   but they also pose new challenges for inferring evolutionary histories.
   Most existing methods for reconstructing phylogenetic hypotheses rely
   solely on algorithms that only consider incomplete lineage sorting (ILS)
   as a cause of intra- or intergenomic discordance. Here, we utilize a
   variety of methods, including those to infer phylogenetic networks, to
   account for both ILS and introgression as a cause for nuclear and
   cytoplasmic-nuclear discordance using phylogenomic data from the
   recently radiated flowering plant genus Polemonium (Polemoniaceae), an
   ecologically diverse genus in Western North America with known and
   suspected gene flow between species. We find evidence for widespread
   discordance among nuclear loci that can be explained by both ILS and
   reticulate evolution in the evolutionary history of Polemonium.
   Furthermore, the histories of organellar genomes show strong discordance
   with the inferred species tree from the nuclear genome. Discordance
   between the nuclear and plastid genome is not completely explained by
   ILS, and only one case of discordance is explained by detected
   introgression events. Our results suggest that multiple processes have
   been involved in the evolutionary history of Polemonium and that the
   plastid genome does not accurately reflect species relationships. We
   discuss several potential causes for this cytoplasmic-nuclear
   discordance, which emerging evidence suggests is more widespread across
   the Tree of Life than previously thought.},

Abstract = {During the evolution organisms are subjected to the continuous impact of
   environmental factors. In recent years an increasing number of studies
   have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as
   temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc.
   Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions
   that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this
   reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of
   particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important
   part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and
   diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In
   the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated
   from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal
   cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was
   observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature
   exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in
   enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve
   carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence.
   Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different
   pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress
   temperatures was detected. Overall, this study aimed to observe the
   survival strategy of filamentous fungi in extremely cold habitats, and
   to acquire new knowledge about the relationship between low temperature
   and oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {This study presents the determination of the content of selected metals

   usefulness of the handheld energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence
   technique in the study of samples from the polar zone, before performing
   the future field tests. Deposit analyses were performed (in parallel)
   with two handheld X-ray fluorescence spectrometers from different
   manufacturers, to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the
   instruments. The statistical analysis of the results indicated that the
   measurements carried out with two spectrometers were statistically
   significantly different, which was probably due to the different
   calibration characteristics used by the manufacturers. However, the
   analysis of the spatial distribution of element concentrations using
   Geographic Information System tools showed that the distribution maps of
   elements concentrations were similar regardless of the spectrometer used
   in the analyses.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the details of the morphological and anatomical
   structure of the generative organs of the Subantarctic flowering plant,
   belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae - Colobanthus apetalus (Labill.)
   Druce. The research material was collected in hostile natural conditions
   in Subantarctic regions, and also was grown in the incubators and the
   greenhouse of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland).
   C. apetalus forms tufts with soft and grassy leaves and small greenish
   flowers that are more obvious than in other Colobanthus species. C.
   apetalus forms open (chasmogamic) flowers in greenhouse cultivation. The
   flowers most often form five stamens with two microsporangia. Over a
   dozen pollen grains are formed in each microsporangium. Studies of the
   plant material originated from natural conditions conducted by means of
   a light microscope, have shown that the ovules of the analyzed
   representative of the genus Colobanthus are anatropous, crassinucellar,
   and the monosporic embryo sac develops according to the Polygonum type
   (the most common type in angiosperms). C. apetalus plants underwent a
   full development cycle in greenhouse cultivation and produced fertile,
   perispermic seeds. During the C. apetalus growth in conditions at
   increased air humidity, the vivipary was also observed.},

Title = {Recoding Amino Acids to a Reduced Alphabet may Increase or Decrease
   Phylogenetic Accuracy},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Common molecular phylogenetic characteristics such as long branches and
   compositional heterogeneity can be problematic for phylogenetic
   reconstruction when using amino acid data. Recoding alignments to
   reduced alphabets before phylogenetic analysis has often been used both
   to explore and potentially decrease the effect of such problems. We
   tested the effectiveness of this strategy on topological accuracy using
   simulated data on four-taxon trees. We simulated alignments in
   phylogenetically challenging ways to test the phylogenetic accuracy of
   analyses using various recoding strategies together with commonly used
   homogeneous models. We tested three recoding methods based on amino acid
   exchangeability, and another recoding method based on lowering the
   compositional heterogeneity among alignment sequences as measured by the
   Chi-squared statistic. Our simulation results show that on trees with
   long branches where sequences approach saturation, accuracy was not
   greatly affected by exchangeability-based recodings, but
   Chi-squared-based recoding decreased accuracy. We then simulated
   sequences with different kinds of compositional heterogeneity over the
   tree. Recoding often increased accuracy on such alignments.
   Exchangeability-based recoding was rarely worse than not recoding, and
   often considerably better. Recoding based on lowering the Chi-squared
   value improved accuracy in some cases but not in others, suggesting that
   low compositional heterogeneity by itself is not sufficient to increase
   accuracy in the analysis of these alignments. We also simulated
   alignments using site-specific amino acid profiles, making sequences
   that had compositional heterogeneity over alignment sites.
   Exchangeability-based recoding coupled with site-homogeneous models had
   poor accuracy for these data sets but Chi-squared-based recoding on
   these alignments increased accuracy. We then simulated data sets that
   were compositionally both site- and tree-heterogeneous, like many real
   data sets. The effect on the accuracy of recoding such doubly
   problematic data sets varied widely, depending on the type of
   compositional tree heterogeneity and on the recoding scheme.
   Interestingly, analysis of unrecoded compositionally heterogeneous
   alignments with the NDCH or CAT models was generally more accurate than
   homogeneous analysis, whether recoded or not. Overall, our results
   suggest that making trees for recoded amino acid data sets can be
   useful, but they need to be interpreted cautiously as part of a more
   comprehensive analysis. The use of better-fitting models like NDCH and
   CAT, which directly account for the patterns in the data, may offer a
   more promising long-term solution for analyzing empirical data.

Title = {Ghost Lineages Highly Influence the Interpretation of Introgression
   Tests},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 16},
Abstract = {Most species are extinct, those that are not are often unknown.
   Sequenced and sampled species are often a minority of known ones. Past
   evolutionary events involving horizontal gene flow, such as horizontal
   gene transfer, hybridization, introgression, and admixture, are
   therefore likely to involve ``ghosts,{''} that is extinct, unknown, or
   unsampled lineages. The existence of these ghost lineages is widely
   acknowledged, but their possible impact on the detection of gene flow
   and on the identification of the species involved is largely overlooked.
   It is generally considered as a possible source of error that, with
   reasonable approximation, can be ignored. We explore the possible
   influence of absent species on an evolutionary study by quantifying the
   effect of ghost lineages on introgression as detected by the popular
   D-statistic method. We show from simulated data that under certain
   frequently encountered conditions, the donors and recipients of
   horizontal gene flow can be wrongly identified if ghost lineages are not
   taken into account. In particular, having a distant outgroup, which is
   usually recommended, leads to an increase in the error probability and
   to false interpretations in most cases. We conclude that introgression
   from ghost lineages should be systematically considered as an
   alternative possible, even probable, scenario. {[}ABBA-BABA;

Title = {Different Evolutionary Pathways Lead to Incomplete Convergence of
   Elongate Body Shapes in Carnivoran Mammals},

Abstract = {Although convergence is often recognized as a ubiquitous feature across
   the Tree of Life, whether the underlying traits also exhibit similar
   evolutionary pathways towards convergent forms puzzles biologists. In
   carnivoran mammals, ``elongate,{''} ``slender,{''} and ``long{''} are
   often used to describe and even to categorize mustelids (martens,
   polecats, and weasels), herpestids (mongooses), viverrids (civets and
   genets), and other carnivorans together. But just how similar these
   carnivorans are and whether there is convergence in the morphological
   component that contribute to elongation has never been assessed. Here, I
   found that these qualitatively described elongate carnivorans exhibited
   incomplete convergence towards elongate bodies compared to other
   terrestrial carnivorans. In contrast, the morphological components
   underlying body shape variation do not exhibit convergence despite
   evidence that these components are more elongate in elongate carnivorans
   compared to nonelongate carnivorans. Furthermore, these components also
   exhibited shorter but different phylogenetic half-lives towards more
   elongate adaptive peaks, indicating that different selective pressures
   can create multiple pathways to elongation. Incorporating the fossil
   record will facilitate further investigation of whether body elongation
   evolved adaptively or if it is simply a retained ancestral
   trait.{[}Axial skeleton; body elongation; convergent evolution;

Title = {Morphology-Based Identification of Bemisia tabaci Cryptic Species
   Puparia via Embedded Group-Contrast Convolution Neural Network Analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1095-1109},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {The Bemisia tabaci species complex is a group of tropical-subtropical
   hemipterans, some species of which have achieved global distribution
   over the past 150 years. Several species are regarded currently as among
   the world's most pernicious agricultural pests, causing a variety of
   damage types via direct feeding and plant-disease transmission. Long
   considered a single variable species, genetic, molecular and
   reproductive compatibility analyses have revealed that this
   ``species{''} is actually a complex of between 24 and 48 morphologically
   cryptic species. However, determinations of which populations represent
   distinct species have been hampered by a failure to integrate
   genetic/molecular and morphological species-diagnoses. This, in turn,
   has limited the success of outbreak-control and eradication programs.
   Previous morphological investigations, based on traditional and
   geometric morphometric procedures, have had limited success in
   identifying genetic/molecular species from patterns of morphological
   variation in puparia. As an alternative, our investigation focused on
   exploring the use of a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN)
   trained on puparial images and based on an embedded, group-contrast
   training protocol as a means of searching for consistent differences in
   puparial morphology. Fifteen molecular species were selected for
   analysis, all of which had been identified via DNA barcoding and
   confirmed using more extensive molecular characterizations and crossing
   experiments. Results demonstrate that all 15 species can be
   discriminated successfully based on differences in puparium morphology
   alone. This level of discrimination was achieved for laboratory
   populations reared on both hairy-leaved and glabrous-leaved host plants.
   Moreover, cross-tabulation tests confirmed the generality and stability
   of the CNN discriminant system trained on both ecophenotypic variants.
   The ability to identify B. tabaci species quickly and accurately from
   puparial images has the potential to address many long-standing problems
   in B. tabaci taxonomy and systematics as well as playing a vital role in
   ongoing pest-management efforts. {[}Aleyrodidae; entomology; Hemiptera;

Title = {Nucleotide Substitutions during Speciation may Explain Substitution Rate
   Variation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 NOV 24},
Abstract = {Although molecular mechanisms associated with the generation of
   mutations are highly conserved across taxa, there is widespread
   variation in mutation rates between evolutionary lineages. When
   phylogenies are reconstructed based on nucleotide sequences, such
   variation is typically accounted for by the assumption of a relaxed
   molecular clock, which is a statistical distribution of mutation rates
   without much underlying biological mechanism. Here, we propose that
   variation in accumulated mutations may be partly explained by an
   elevated mutation rate during speciation. Using simulations, we show how
   shifting mutations from branches to speciation events impacts inference
   of branching times in phylogenetic reconstruction. Furthermore, the
   resulting nucleotide alignments are better described by a relaxed than
   by a strict molecular clock. Thus, elevated mutation rates during
   speciation potentially explain part of the variation in substitution
   rates that is observed across the tree of life. {[}Molecular clock;

Abstract = {The tree of life is the fundamental biological roadmap for navigating
   the evolution and properties of life on Earth, and yet remains largely
   unknown. Even angiosperms (flowering plants) are fraught with data gaps,
   despite their critical role in sustaining terrestrial life. Today,
   high-throughput sequencing promises to significantly deepen our
   understanding of evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe a
   comprehensive phylogenomic platform for exploring the angiosperm tree of
   life, comprising a set of open tools and data based on the 353 nuclear
   genes targeted by the universal Angiosperms353 sequence capture probes.
   The primary goals of this article are to (i) document our methods, (ii)
   describe our first data release, and (iii) present a novel open data
   portal, the Kew Tree of Life Explorer (htips://treeoflife.keworg). We
   aim to generate novel target sequence capture data for all genera of
   flowering plants, exploiting natural history collections such as
   herbarium specimens, and augment it with mined public data. Our first
   data release, described here, is the most extensive nuclear phylogenomic
   data set for angiosperms to date, comprising 3099 samples validated by
   DNA barcode and phylogenetic tests, representing all 64 orders, 404
   families (96\%) and 2333 genera (17\%). A ``first pass{''} angiosperm
   tree of life was inferred from the data, which totaled 824,878
   sequences, 489,086,049 base pairs, and 532,260 alignment columns, for
   interactive presentation in the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. This species
   tree was generated using methods that were rigorous, yet tractable at
   our scale of operation. Despite limitations pertaining to taxon and gene
   sampling, gene recovery, models of sequence evolution and paralogy, the
   tree strongly supports existing taxonomy, while challenging numerous
   hypothesized relationships among orders and placing many genera for the
   first time. The validated data set, species tree and all intermediates
   are openly accessible via the Kew Tree of Life Explorer and will be
   updated as further data become available. This major milestone toward a
   complete tree of life for all flowering plant species opens doors to a
   highly integrated future for angiosperm phylogenomics through the
   systematic sequencing of standardized nuclear markers. Our approach has
   the potential to serve as a much-needed bridge between the growing
   movement to sequence the genomes of all life on Earth and the vast
   phylogenomic potential of the world's natural history collections.},

Title = {The Origin of the Legumes is a Complex Paleopolyploid Phylogenomic
   Tangle Closely Associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) Mass
   Extinction Event},

Abstract = {The consequences of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (KPB) mass
   extinction for the evolution of plant diversity remain poorly
   understood, even though evolutionary turnover of plant lineages at the
   KPB is central to understanding assembly of the Cenozoic biota. The
   apparent concentration of whole genome duplication (WGD) events around
   the KPB may have played a role in survival and subsequent
   diversification of plant lineages. To gain new insights into the origins
   of Cenozoic biodiversity, we examine the origin and early evolution of
   the globally diverse legume family (Leguminosae or Fabaceae). Legumes
   are ecologically (co-)dominant across many vegetation types, and the
   fossil record suggests that they rose to such prominence after the KPB
   in parallel with several well-studied animal clades including
   Placentalia and Neoaves. Furthermore, multiple WGD events are
   hypothesized to have occurred early in legume evolution. Using a
   recently inferred phylogenomic framework, we investigate the placement
   of WGDs during early legume evolution using gene tree reconciliation
   methods, gene count data and phylogenetic supernetwork reconstruction.
   Using 20 fossil calibrations we estimate a revised timeline of legume
   evolution based on 36 nuclear genes selected as informative and evolving
   in an approximately clock-like fashion. To establish the timing of WGDs
   we also date duplication nodes in gene trees. Results suggest either a
   pan-legume WGD event on the stem lineage of the family, or an
   allopolyploid event involving (some of) the earliest lineages within the
   crown group, with additional nested WGDs subtending subfamilies
   Papilionoideae and Detarioideae. Gene tree reconciliation methods that
   do not account for allopolyploidy may be misleading in inferring an
   earlier WGD event at the time of divergence of the two parental lineages
   of the polyploid, suggesting that the allopolyploid scenario is more
   likely. We show that the crown age of the legumes dates to the
   Maastrichtian or early Paleocene and that, apart from the Detarioideae
   WGD, paleopolyploidy occurred close to the KPB. We conclude that the
   early evolution of the legumes followed a complex history, in which
   multiple auto- and/or allopolyploidy events coincided with rapid
   diversification and in association with the mass extinction event at the
   KPB, ultimately underpinning the evolutionary success of the Leguminosae
   in the Cenozoic.},

Title = {Consistency of SVDQuartets and Maximum Likelihood for Coalescent-Based
   Species Tree Estimation},

Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Numerous methods for inferring species-level phylogenies under the
   coalescent model have been proposed within the last 20 years, and
   debates continue about the relative strengths and weaknesses of these
   methods. One desirable property of a phylogenetic estimator is that of
   statistical consistency, which means intuitively that as more data are
   collected, the probability that the estimated tree has the same topology
   as the true tree goes to 1. To date, consistency results for species
   tree inference under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) have been derived
   only for summary statistics methods, such as ASTRAL and MP-EST. These
   methods have been found to be consistent given true gene trees but may
   be inconsistent when gene trees are estimated from data for loci of
   finite length. Here, we consider the question of statistical consistency
   for four taxa for SVDQuartets for general data types, as well as for the
   maximum likelihood (ML) method in the case in which the data are a
   collection of sites generated under the MSC model such that the sites
   are conditionally independent given the species tree (we call these data
   coalescent independent sites {[}CIS] data). We show that SVDQuartets is
   statistically consistent for all data types (i.e., for both CIS data and
   formultilocus data), and we derive its rate of convergence. We
   additionally show that ML is consistent for CIS data under the JC69
   model and discuss why a proof for the more general multilocus case is
   difficult. Finally, we compare the performance of ML and SDVQuartets
   using simulation for both data types.},

Title = {Modeling Pulsed Evolution and Time-Independent Variation Improves the
   Confidence Level of Ancestral and Hidden State Predictions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 25},
Abstract = {Ancestral state reconstruction is not only a fundamental tool for
   studying trait evolution, but also very useful for predicting the
   unknown trait values (hidden states) of extant species. A well-known
   problem in ancestral and hidden state predictions is that the
   uncertainty associated with predictions can be so large that predictions
   themselves are of little use. Therefore, for meaningful interpretation
   of predicted traits and hypothesis testing, it is prudent to accurately
   assess the uncertainty of the predictions. Commonly used constant-rate
   Brownian motion (BM) model fails to capture the complexity of tempo and
   mode of trait evolution in nature, making predictions under the BM model
   vulnerable to lack-of-fit errors from model misspecification. Using
   empirical data (mammalian body size and bacterial genome size), we show
   that the distribution of residual Z-scores under the BM model is neither
   homoscedastic nor normal as expected. Consequently, the 95\% confidence
   intervals of predicted traits are so unreliable that the actual coverage
   probability ranges from 33\% (strongly permissive) to 100\% (strongly
   conservative). Alternative methods such as BayesTraits and StableTraits
   that allow variable rates in evolution improve the predictions but are
   computationally expensive. Here, we develop Reconstructing Ancestral
   State under Pulsed Evolution in R by Gaussian Decomposition
   (RasperGade), a method of ancestral and hidden state prediction that
   uses the Levy process to explicitly model gradual evolution, pulsed
   evolution, and time-independent variation. Using the same empirical
   data, we show that RasperGade outperforms both BayesTraits and
   StableTraits in providing reliable confidence estimates and is
   orders-of-magnitude faster. Our results suggest that, when predicting
   the ancestral and hidden states of continuous traits, the rate variation
   should always be assessed and the quality of confidence estimates should
   always be examined. {[}Bacterial genomic traits; model misspecification;

Title = {On the Need for New Measures of Phylogenomic Support},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {917-920},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {The scale of data sets used to infer phylogenies has grown dramatically
   in the last decades, providing researchers with an enormous amount of
   information with which to draw inferences about evolutionary history.
   However, standard approaches to assessing confidence in those inferences
   (e.g., nonparametric bootstrap proportions {[}BP] and Bayesian posterior
   probabilities {[}PPs]) are still deeply influenced by statistical
   procedures and frameworks that were developed when information was much
   more limited. These approaches largely quantify uncertainty caused by
   limited amounts of data, which is often vanishingly small with modern,
   genome-scale sequence data sets. As a consequence, today's phylogenomic
   studies routinely report near-complete confidence in their inferences,
   even when different studies reach strongly conflicting conclusions and
   the sites and loci in a single data set contain much more heterogeneity
   than our methods assume or can accommodate. Therefore, we argue that BPs
   and marginal PPs of bipartitions have outlived their utility as the
   primary means of measuring phylogenetic support for modern phylogenomic
   data sets with large numbers of sites relative to the number of taxa.
   Continuing to rely on these measures will hinder progress towards
   understanding remaining sources of uncertainty in the most challenging
   portions of the Tree of Life. Instead, we encourage researchers to
   examine the ideas and methods presented in this special issue of
   Systematic Biology and to explore the area further in their own work.
   The papers in this special issue outline strategies for assessing
   confidence and uncertainty in phylogenomic data sets that move beyond
   stochastic error due to limited data and offer promise for more
   productive dialogue about the challenges that we face in reaching our
   shared goal of understanding the history of life on Earth.{[}Big data;

Abstract = {Species are crucial to most branches of biological research, yet remain
   controversial in terms of definition, delimitation, and reality. The
   difficulty of resolving the ``species problem{''} stems from the tension
   between their theoretical concept as groups of evolving and highly
   variable organisms and the practical need for a stable and comparable
   unit of biology. Here, we suggest that treating species as a heuristic
   can be consistent with a theoretical definition of what species are and
   with the practical means by which they are identified and delimited.
   Specifically, we suggest that theoretically species are heuristic since
   they comprise clusters of closely related individuals responding in a
   similar manner to comparable sets of evolutionary and ecological forces,
   whilst they are practically heuristic because they are identifiable by
   the congruence of contingent properties indicative of those forces. This
   reconciliation of the theoretical basis of species with their practical
   applications in biological research allows for a loose but relatively
   consistent definition of species based on the strategic analysis and
   integration of genotypic, phenotypic, and ecotypic data. {[}Cohesion;

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that cause heterogeneity among gene trees can
   increase the accuracy of species trees. Discordant signals across the
   genome are commonly produced by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and
   introgression, which in turn can result in reticulate evolution. Species
   tree inference using the multispecies coalescent is designed to deal
   with ILS and is robust to low levels of introgression, but extensive
   introgression violates the fundamental assumption that relationships are
   strictly bifurcating. In this study, we explore the phylogenomics of the
   iconic Liolaemus subgenus of South American lizards, a group of over 100
   species mostly distributed in and around the Andes mountains. Using
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and genome-wide restriction site-associated
   DNA sequencing (RADseq; nDNA hereafter), we inferred a time-calibrated
   mtDNA gene tree, nDNA species trees, and phylogenetic networks. We found
   high levels of discordance between mtDNA and nDNA, which we attribute in
   part to extensive ILS resulting from rapid diversification. These data
   also reveal extensive and deep introgression, which combined with rapid
   diversification, explain the high level of phylogenetic discordance. We
   discuss these findings in the context of Andean orogeny and glacial
   cycles that fragmented, expanded, and contracted species distributions.
   Finally, we use the new phylogeny to resolve long-standing taxonomic
   issues in one of the most studied lizard groups in the New
   World.{[}Andes; ddRADSeq; introgression; lizards; mtDNA; reptiles;

Title = {Concordance-Based Approaches for the Inference of Relationships and

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 AUG 18},
Abstract = {Gene tree conflict is common and finding methods to analyze and
   alleviate the negative effects that conflict has on species tree
   analysis is a crucial part of phylogenomics. This study aims to expand
   the discussion of inferring species trees and molecular branch lengths
   when conflict is present. Conflict is typically examined in two ways:
   inferring its prevalence and inferring the influence of the individual
   genes (how strongly one gene supports any given topology compared to an
   alternative topology). Here, we examine a procedure for incorporating
   both conflict and the influence of genes in order to infer evolutionary
   relationships. All supported relationships in the gene trees are
   analyzed and the likelihood of the genes constrained to these
   relationships is summed to provide a likelihood for the relationship.
   Consensus tree assembly is conducted based on the sum of likelihoods for
   a given relationship and choosing relationships based on the most likely
   relationship assuming it does not conflict with a relationship that has
   a higher likelihood score. If it is not possible for all most likely
   relationships to be combined into a single bifurcating tree then
   multiple trees are produced and a consensus tree with a polytomy is
   created. This procedure allows for more influential genes to have a
   greater influence on an inferred relationship, does not assume conflict
   has arisen from any one source and does not force the data set to
   produce a single bifurcating tree. Using this approach, on three
   empirical data sets, we examine and discuss the relationship between
   influence and prevalence of gene tree conflict. We find that in one of
   the data sets, assembling a bifurcating consensus tree solely composed
   of the most likely relationships is impossible. To account for conflict
   in molecular rate analysis we also introduce a concordance-based
   approach to the summary and estimation of branch lengths suitable for
   downstream comparative analyses. We demonstrate through simulation that
   even under high levels of stochastic conflict, the mean and median of
   the concordant rates recapitulate the true molecular rate better than
   using a supermatrix approach. Using a large phylogenomic data set, we
   examine rate heterogeneity across concordant genes with a focus on the
   branch subtending crown angiosperms. Notably, we find highly variable
   rates of evolution along the branch subtending crown angiosperms. The
   approaches outlined here have several limitations, but they also
   represent some alternative methods for harnessing the complexity of
   phylogenomic data sets and enrich our inferences of both species
   relationships and evolutionary processes.{[}Branch length estimation;

Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of genomic data provide a powerful means of
   reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among organisms, yet such
   analyses are often hindered by conflicting phylogenetic signals among
   loci. Identifying the signals that are most influential to species-tree
   estimation can help to inform the choice of data for phylogenomic
   analysis. We investigated this in an analysis of 30 phylogenomic data
   sets. For each data set, we examined the association between several
   branch-length characteristics of gene trees and the distance between
   these gene trees and the corresponding species trees. We found that the
   distance of each gene tree to the species tree inferred from the full
   data set was positively associated with variation in root-to-tip
   distances and negatively associated with mean branch support. However,
   no such associations were found for gene-tree length, a measure of the
   overall substitution rate at each locus. We further explored the
   usefulness of the best-performing branch-based characteristics for
   selecting loci for phylogenomic analyses. We found that loci that yield
   gene trees with high variation in root-to-tip distances have a
   disproportionately distant signal of tree topology compared with the
   complete data sets. These results suggest that rate variation across
   lineages should be taken into consideration when exploring and even
   selecting loci for phylogenomic analysis.{[}Branch support; data

Title = {Inferring the Total-Evidence Timescale of Marattialean Fern Evolution in

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic divergence-time estimation has been revolutionized by two
   recent developments: 1) total-evidence dating (or ``tip-dating{''})
   approaches that allow for the incorporation of fossils as tips in the
   analysis, with their phylogenetic and temporal relationships to the
   extant taxa inferred from the data and 2) the fossilized birth-death
   (FBD) class of tree models that capture the processes that produce the
   tree (speciation, extinction, and fossilization) and thus provide a
   coherent and biologically interpretable tree prior. To explore the
   behavior of these methods, we apply them to marattialean ferns, a group
   that was dominant in Carboniferous landscapes prior to declining to its
   modest extant diversity of slightly over 100 species. We show that tree
   models have a dramatic influence on estimates of both divergence times
   and topological relationships. This influence is driven by the strong,
   counter-intuitive informativeness of the uniform tree prior, and the
   inherent nonidentifiability of divergence-time models. In contrast to
   the strong influence of the tree models, we find minor effects of
   differing the morphological transition model or the morphological clock
   model. We compare the performance of a large pool of candidate models
   using a combination of posterior-predictive simulation and Bayes
   factors. Notably, an FBD model with epoch-specific speciation and
   extinction rates was strongly favored by Bayes factors. Our best-fitting
   model infers stem and crown divergences for the Marattiales in the
   mid-Devonian and Late Cretaceous, respectively, with elevated speciation
   rates in the Mississippian and elevated extinction rates in the
   Cisuralian leading to a peak diversity of similar to 2800 species at the
   end of the Carboniferous, representing the heyday of the Psaroniaceae.
   This peak is followed by the rapid decline and ultimate extinction of
   the Psaroniaceae, with their descendants, the Marattiaceae, persisting
   at approximately stable levels of diversity until the present. This
   general diversification pattern appears to be insensitive to potential
   biases in the fossil record; despite the preponderance of available
   fossils being from Pennsylvanian coal balls, incorporating
   fossilization-rate variation does not improve model fit. In addition, by
   incorporating temporal data directly within the model and allowing for
   the inference of the phylogenetic position of the fossils, our study
   makes the surprising inference that the Glade of extant Marattiales is
   relatively young, younger than any of the fossils historically thought
   to be congeneric with extant species. This result is a dramatic
   demonstration of the dangers of node-based approaches to divergence-time
   estimation, where the assignment of fossils to particular Glades is made
   a priori (earlier node-based studies that constrained the minimum ages
   of extant genera based on these fossils resulted in much older age
   estimates than in our study) and of the utility of explicit models of
   morphological evolution and lineage diversification.},

Abstract = {European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is a highly polymorphic
   species, but the wider scale diversity and distribution of sympatric
   morphs in subarctic lakes of northwestern Russia has not been recently
   studied and analyzed. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   diversity and distribution of whitefish morphs in different sized lakes
   and watercourses of Murmansk region. Our study of the water bodies in
   four major river basins of Murmansk region revealed the presence of two
   whitefish morphs: sparsely rakered (sr) and medium rakered (mr). The mr
   morph is less common and observed only alongside the sr whitefish. In
   general, in sr whitefish the number of gill rakers ranges between 15 and
   31, and in mr whitefish between 27 and 44. Among whitefishes with 27 to
   31 gill rakers, both sr and mr morphs were observed and distinguishable
   by the shape of the rakers. In the studied sr whitefish populations,
   relatively long and short rakered whitefish morphs were found. In Lake
   Kuetsyarvi (Pasvik River basin), the sr and mr whitefish formed
   additional slow- and fast-growing ecological morphs. The four whitefish
   morphs in and behavioral differences. The observed diversity and
   distribution of whitefish in the Murmansk region requires genetic
   studies of the population to assess the origins of divergence.},

Title = {An Efficient Coalescent Epoch Model for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 25},
Abstract = {We present a two-headed approach called Bayesian Integrated Coalescent
   Epoch PlotS (BICEPS) for efficient inference of coalescent epoch models.
   Firstly, we integrate out population size parameters, and secondly, we
   introduce a set of more powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   proposals for flexing and stretching trees. Even though population sizes
   are integrated out and not explicitly sampled through MCMC, we are still
   able to generate samples from the population size posteriors. This
   allows demographic reconstruction through time and estimating the timing
   and magnitude of population bottlenecks and full population histories.
   Altogether, BICEPS can be considered a more muscular version of the
   popular Bayesian skyline model. We demonstrate its power and correctness
   by a well-calibrated simulation study. Furthermore, we demonstrate with
   an application to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data that some analyses that have
   trouble converging with the traditional Bayesian skyline prior and
   standard MCMC proposals can do well with the BICEPS approach. BICEPS is
   available as open-source package for BEAST 2 under GPL license and has a
   user-friendly graphical user interface.{[}Bayesian phylogenetics; BEAST

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Distinguishing coral species is not only crucial for physiological,
   ecological, and evolutionary studies but also to enable effective
   management of threatened reef ecosystems. However, traditional
   hypotheses that delineate coral species based on morphological traits
   from the coral skeleton are frequently at odds with tree-based molecular
   approaches. Additionally, a dearth of species-level molecular markers
   has made species delimitation particularly challenging in species-rich
   coral genera, leading to the widespread assumption that interspecific
   hybridization might be responsible for this apparent conundrum. Here, we
   used three lines of evidence-morphology, breeding trials, and molecular
   approaches-to identify species boundaries in a group of ecologically
   important tabular Acropora corals. In contrast to previous studies, our
   morphological analysis yielded groups that were congruent with
   experimental crosses as well as with coalescent-based and allele
   sharing-based multilocus approaches to species delimitation. Our results
   suggest that species of the genus Acropora are reproductively isolated
   and independently evolving units that can be distinguished
   morphologically. These findings not only pave the way for a taxonomic
   revision of coral species but also outline an approach that can provide
   a solid basis to address species delimitation and provide conservation
   support to a wide variety of keystone organisms. {[}Acropora; coral

Title = {Empirical and Methodological Challenges to the Model-Based Inference of

Volume = {71},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Changes in speciation and extinction rates are key to the dynamics of
   clade diversification, but attempts to infer them from phylogenies of
   extant species face challenges. Methods capable of synthesizing
   information from extant and fossil species have yielded novel insights
   into diversification rate variation through time, but little is known
   about their behavior when analyzing entirely extinct clades. Here, we
   use empirical and simulated data to assess how two popular methods,
   PyRate and Fossil BAMM, perform in this setting. We inferred the first
   tip-dated trees for ornithischian dinosaurs and combined them with
   fossil occurrence data to test whether the clade underwent an
   end-Cretaceous decline. We then simulated phylogenies and fossil records
   under empirical constraints to determine whether macroevolutionary and
   preservation rates can be teased apart under paleobiologically realistic
   conditions. We obtained discordant inferences about ornithischian
   macroevolution including a long-term speciation rate decline (BAMM),
   mostly flat rates with a steep diversification drop (PyRate) or without
   one (BAMM), and episodes of implausibly accelerated speciation and
   extinction (PyRate). Simulations revealed little to no conflation
   between speciation and preservation, but yielded spuriously correlated
   speciation and extinction estimates while time-smearing tree-wide shifts
   (BAMM) or overestimating their number (PyRate). Our results indicate
   that the small phylogenetic data sets available to vertebrate
   paleontologists and the assumptions made by current model-based methods
   combine to yield potentially unreliable inferences about the
   diversification of extinct clades. We provide guidelines for
   interpreting the results of the existing approaches in light of their
   limitations and suggest how the latter may be mitigated.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {273-285},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Introgression and hybridization are major impediments to genomic-based
   species delimitation because many implementations of the multispecies
   coalescent framework assume no gene flow among species. The sunfish
   genus Lepomis, one of the world's most popular groups of freshwater
   sport fish, has a complicated taxonomic history. The results of ddRAD
   phylogenomic analyses do not provide support for the current taxonomy
   that recognizes two species, Lepomis megalotis and Lepomis peltastes, in
   the L. megalotis complex. Instead, evidence from phylogenomics and
   phenotype warrants recognizing six relatively ancient evolutionary
   lineages in the complex. The introgressed and hybridizing populations in
   the L. megalotis complex are localized and appear to be the result of
   secondary contact or rare hybridization events between nonsister
   species. Segregating admixed populations from our multispecies
   coalescent analyses identifies six species with moderate to high
   genealogical divergence, whereas including admixed populations drives
   all but one lineage below the species threshold of genealogical
   divergence. Segregation of admixed individuals also helps reveal
   phenotypic distinctiveness among the six species in morphological traits
   used by ichthyologists to discover and delimit species over the last two
   centuries. Our protocols allow for the identification and accommodation
   of hybridization and introgression in species delimitation.
   Genomic-based species delimitation validated with multiple lines of
   evidence provides a path towards the discovery of new biodiversity and
   resolving long-standing taxonomic problems.{[}ddRAD; genealogical

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Detecting the signature of selection in coding sequences and associating
   it with shifts in phenotypic states can unveil genes underlying complex
   traits. Of the various signatures of selection exhibited at the
   molecular level, changes in the pattern of selection at protein-coding
   genes have been of main interest. To this end, phylogenetic branch-site
   codon models are routinely applied to detect changes in selective
   patterns along specific branches of the phylogeny. Many of these methods
   rely on a prespecified partition of the phylogeny to branch categories,
   thus treating the course of trait evolution as fully resolved and
   assuming that phenotypic transitions have occurred only at speciation
   events. Here, we present TraitRELAX, a new phylogenetic model that
   alleviates these strong assumptions by explicitly accounting for the
   uncertainty in the evolution of both trait and coding sequences. This
   joint statistical framework enables the detection of changes in
   selection intensity upon repeated trait transitions. We evaluated the
   performance of TraitRELAX using simulations and then applied it to two
   case studies. Using TraitRELAX, we found an intensification of selection
   in the primate SEMG2 gene in polygynandrous species compared to species
   of other mating forms, as well as changes in the intensity of purifying
   selection operating on sixteen bacterial genes upon transitioning from a
   free-living to an endosymbiotic lifestyle.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Six-state amino acid recoding strategies are commonly applied to combat
   the effects of compositional heterogeneity and substitution saturation
   in phylogenetic analyses. While these methods have been endorsed from a
   theoretical perspective, their performance has never been extensively
   tested. Here, we test the effectiveness of six-state recoding approaches
   by comparing the performance of analyses on recoded and non-recoded data
   sets that have been simulated under gradients of compositional
   heterogeneity or saturation. In our simulation analyses, non-recoding
   approaches consistently outperform six-state recoding approaches. Our
   results suggest that six-state recoding strategies are not effective in
   the face of high saturation. Furthermore, while recoding strategies do
   buffer the effects of compositional heterogeneity, the loss of
   information that accompanies six-state recoding outweighs its benefits.
   In addition, we evaluate recoding schemes with 9, 12, 15, and 18 states
   and show that these consistently outperform six-state recoding. Our
   analyses of other recoding schemes suggest that under conditions of very
   high compositional heterogeneity, it may be advantageous to apply
   recoding using more than six states, but we caution that applying any
   recoding should include sufficient justification. Our results have
   important implications for the more than 90 published papers that have
   incorporated six-state recoding, many of which have significant bearing
   on relationships across the tree of life.},

Abstract = {A simple graphical device, the simplex plot of quartet concordance
   factors, is introduced to aid in the exploration of a collection of gene
   trees on a common set of taxa. A single plot summarizes all gene tree
   discord and allows for visual comparison to the expected discord from
   the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) of incomplete lineage sorting on
   a species tree. A formal statistical procedure is described that can
   quantify the deviation from expectation for each subset of four taxa,
   suggesting when the data are not in accord with the MSC, and thus that
   either gene tree inference error is substantial or a more complex model
   such as that on a network may be required. If the collection of gene
   trees is in accord with the MSC, the plots reveal when substantial
   incomplete lineage sorting is present. Applications to both simulated
   and empirical multilocus data sets illustrate the insights provided.

Abstract = {Seasonal variations of the isotopic and chemical compositions of
   snowpits can provide useful tools for dating the age of the snowpit and
   examining the sources of aerosol. Based on the seasonal layers with SD
   and delta O-18 maxima and minima, it was determined that the snowpit,
   conducted in the vicinity of the Jang Bogo Station in Antarctica,
   contained snow deposited over a three-year period (2008-2010). Distinct
   seasonal variations of stable water isotopes were observed, with a slope
   of 8.2 from the linear isotopic relationship between oxygen and
   hydrogen, which indicates that the snow accumulated during three years
   without a significant post-depositional process. The positive
   correlations (r > 0.85) between Na+ and other ions in the winter period
   and the positive relationship with the concentrations of the
   methanesulphonic acid (MSA) and non-sea salt sulfate (nssSO(4)(2-)) in
   the warm period (r = 0.6, spring to summer) indicate the significant
   contributions of an oceanic source to the snowpit. Based on principal
   component analysis, the isotopic and chemical variables were classified
   into species representing input of sea-salt aerosol and suggesting
   potential seasonal markers. This study will support further
   investigations using ice cores in this region.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The coexistence of two congeneric amphipods, boreal Gammarus oceanicus,
   and arctic G. setosus, was studied during the summer seasons of
   2017-2019 in the region of Isfjorden, Forlandsundet, and Prins Karl
   Forland island in the west-central part of the Svalbard archipelago
   (Arctic). Across the study area species distribution often overlapped,
   but the domination patterns mirrored environmental conditions preferred
   by each species. Both species, however, were able to survive in
   suboptimal conditions. On a small spatial scale (in one sample) the
   species were separated, which may suggest an antagonistic relationship
   between them. The ongoing changes in the environment of Svalbard will
   likely affect these two species differently. The increasing intrusion of
   Atlantic waters will probably favor the further expansion of G.
   oceanicus along the Svalbard coasts. This will be due to the gradual
   advance of the existing population, as an influx of individuals from the
   Nordic seas seems unlikely. G. setosus will remain the dominant species
   in cold-water areas such as the inner fjords and the northeastern coast
   of Svalbard and may find new suitable habitats in lagoons or estuaries
   fed by melting glaciers. Despite predicted changes in the distribution
   range of both species, their future coexistence should still be possible
   due to the wide range of environmental tolerance and the heterogeneity
   of the Svalbard coastal habitats.},

Title = {Predicting Long Pendant Edges in Model Phylogenies, with Applications to

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {575-589},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {In the simplest phylogenetic diversification model (the pure-birth Yule
   process), lineages split independently at a constant rate lambda for
   time t. The length of a randomly chosen edge (either interior or
   pendant) in the resulting tree has an expected value that rapidly
   converges to 1/2 lambda as t grows and thus is essentially independent
   of t. However, the behavior of the length L of the longest pendant edge
   reveals remarkably different behavior: L converges to t/2 as the
   expected number of leaves grows. Extending this model to allow an
   extinction rate mu (where mu < lambda), we also establish a similar
   result for birth-death trees, except that t/2 is replaced by
   t/2.(1-mu/lambda). This ``complete{''} tree may contain subtrees that
   have died out before time t; for the ``reduced tree{''} that just
   involves the leaves present at time t and their direct ancestors, the
   longest pendant edge length L again converges to t/2. Thus, there is
   likely to be at least one extant species whose associated pendant branch
   attaches to the tree approximately half-way back in time to the origin
   of the entire clade. We also briefly consider the length of the shortest
   edges. Our results are relevant to phylogenetic diversity indices in
   biodiversity conservation, and to quantifying the length of aligned
   sequences required to correctly infer a tree. We compare our theoretical
   results with simulations and with the branch lengths from a recent
   phylogenetic tree of all mammals.},

Abstract = {The complex island archipelagoes of Wallacea and Melanesia have provided
   empirical data behind integral theories in evolutionary biology,
   including allopatric speciation and island biogeography. Yet, questions
   regarding the relative impact of the layered biogeographic barriers,
   such as deep-water trenches and isolated island systems, on faunal
   diversification remain underexplored. One such barrier is Wallace's
   Line, a significant biogeographic boundary that largely separates
   Australian and Asian biodiversity. To assess the relative roles of
   biogeographic barriers-specifically isolated island systems and
   Wallace's Line-we investigated the tempo and mode of diversification in
   a diverse avian radiation, Corvides (Crows and Jays, Birds-of-paradise,
   Vangas, and allies). We combined a genus-level data set of thousands of
   ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and a species-level, 12-gene Sanger
   sequence matrix to produce a well-resolved supermatrix tree that we
   leveraged to explore the group's historical biogeography and the effects
   of the biogeographic barriers on their macroevolutionary dynamics. The
   tree is well resolved and differs substantially from what has been used
   extensively for past comparative analyses within this group. We
   confirmed that Corvides, and its major constituent clades, arose in
   Australia and that a burst of dispersals west across Wallace's Line
   occurred after the uplift of Wallacea during the mid-Miocene. We found
   that dispersal across this biogeographic barrier was generally rare,
   though westward dispersals were two times more frequent than eastward
   dispersals. Wallacea's central position between Sundaland and Sahul no
   doubt acted as a bridge for island-hopping dispersal out of Australia,
   across Wallace's Line, to colonize the rest of Earth. In addition, we
   found that the complex island archipelagoes east of Wallace's Line
   harbor the highest rates of net diversification and are a substantial
   source of colonists to continental systems on both sides of this
   biogeographic barrier. Our results support emerging evidence that island
   systems, particularly the geologically complex archipelagoes of the
   Indo-pacific, are drivers of species diversification. {[}Historical

Abstract = {Oenothera sect. Calylophus is a North American group of 13 recognized
   taxa in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) with an evolutionary
   history that may include independent origins of bee pollination, edaphic
   endemism, and permanent translocation heterozygosity. Like other groups
   that radiated relatively recently and rapidly, taxon boundaries within
   Oenothera sect. Calylophus have remained challenging to circumscribe. In
   this study, we used target enrichment, flanking noncoding regions, gene
   tree/species tree methods, tests for gene flow modified for
   target-enrichment data, and morphometric analysis to reconstruct
   phylogenetic hypotheses, evaluate current taxon circumscriptions, and
   examine character evolution in Oenothera sect. Calylophus. Because sect.
   Calylophus comprises a clade with a relatively restricted geographic
   range, we were able to extensively sample across the range of
   geographic, edaphic, and morphological diversity in the group. We found
   that the combination of exons and flanking noncoding regions led to
   improved support for species relationships. We reconstructed potential
   hybrid origins of some accessions and note that if processes such as
   hybridization are not taken into account, the number of inferred
   evolutionary transitions may be artificially inflated. We recovered
   strong evidence for multiple evolutionary origins of bee pollination
   from ancestral hawkmoth pollination, edaphic specialization on gypsum,
   and permanent translocation heterozygosity. This study applies newly
   emerging techniques alongside dense infraspecific sampling and
   morphological analyses to effectively reconstruct the recalcitrant
   history of a rapid radiation. {[}Gypsum endemism; Oenothera sect.

Title = {Species Tree Inference Methods Intended to Deal with Incomplete Lineage
   Sorting Are Robust to the Presence of Paralogs},

Pages = {367-381},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Many recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring
   species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete
   lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for
   phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus are assumed to
   consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in
   more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from
   the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for
   analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: what happens
   if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy
   is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through
   simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we
   show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide
   accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are
   based directly on the multispecies coalescent model, and some of which
   have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat
   the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as
   paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases, the
   inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using
   single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the
   use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not
   have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase
   the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.{[}Gene

Title = {Accelerated Diversification Explains the Exceptional Species Richness of

Abstract = {The Neotropics harbor the most species-rich freshwater fish fauna on the
   planet, but the timing of that exceptional diversification remains
   unclear. Did the Neotropics accumulate species steadily throughout their
   long history, or attain their remarkable diversity recently? Biologists
   have long debated the relative support for these museum and cradle
   hypotheses, but few phylogenies of megadiverse tropical clades have
   included sufficient taxa to distinguish between them. We used 1288
   ultraconserved element loci spanning 293 species, 211 genera, and 21
   families of characoid fishes to reconstruct a new, fossil-calibrated
   phylogeny and infer the most likely diversification scenario for a clade
   that includes a third of Neotropical fish diversity. This phylogeny
   implies paraphyly of the traditional delimitation of Characiformes
   because it resolves the largely Neotropical Characoidei as the sister
   lineage of Siluriformes (catfishes), rather than the African
   Citharinodei. Time-calibrated phylogenies indicate an ancient origin of
   major characoid lineages and reveal a much more recent emergence of most
   characoid species. Diversification rate analyses infer increased
   speciation and decreased extinction rates during the Oligocene at around
   30 Ma during a period of mega-wetland formation in the
   proto-Orinoco-Amazonas. Three species-rich and ecomorphologically
   diverse lineages (Anostomidae, Serrasalmidae, and Characidae) that
   originated more than 60 Ma in the Paleocene experienced particularly
   notable bursts of Oligocene diversification and now account collectively
   for 68\% of the approximately 2150 species of Characoidei. In addition
   to paleogeographic changes, we discuss potential accelerants of
   diversification in these three lineages. While the Neotropics
   accumulated a museum of ecomorphologically diverse characoid lineages
   long ago, this geologically dynamic region also cradled a much more
   recent birth of remarkable species-level diversity.},

Volume = {70},

Pages = {340-359},

Abstract = {The analysis of time-resolved phylogenies (timetrees) and geographic
   location data allows estimation of dispersal rates, for example, for
   invasive species and infectious diseases. Many estimation methods are
   based on the Brownian Motion model for diffusive dispersal on a 2D
   plane; however, the accuracy of these methods deteriorates substantially
   when dispersal occurs at global scales because spherical Brownian motion
   (SBM) differs from planar Brownian motion. No statistical method exists
   for estimating SBM diffusion coefficients from a given timetree and tip
   coordinates, and no method exists for simulating SBM along a given time
   tree. Here, I present new methods for simulating SBM along a given
   timetree, and for estimating SBM diffusivity from a given timetree and
   tip coordinates using a modification of Felsenstein's independent
   contrasts and maximum likelihood. My simulation and fitting methods can
   accommodate arbitrary time-dependent diffusivities and scale efficiently
   to trees with millions of tips, thus enabling new analyses even in cases
   where planar BM would be a sufficient approximation. I demonstrate these
   methods using a timetree of marine and terrestrial Cyanobacterial
   genomes, as well as timetrees of two globally circulating Influenza B
   clades. My methods are implemented in the R package ``castor.{''}},

Abstract = {The supergroup Holomycota, composed of Fungi and several related
   lineages of unicellular organisms (Nucleariida, Rozellida,
   Microsporidia, and Aphelida), represents one of the major branches in
   the phylogeny of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, except for the
   well-established position of Nucleariida as the first holomycotan branch
   to diverge, the relationships among the other lineages have so far
   remained unresolved largely owing to the lack of molecular data for some
   groups. This was notably the case aphelids, a poorly known group of
   endobiotic phagotrophic protists that feed on algae with cellulose
   walls. The first molecular phylogenies including aphelids supported
   their sister relationship with Rozellida and Microsporidia which,
   collectively, formed a new group called Opisthosporidia (the
   ``Opisthosporidia hypothesis{''}). However, recent phylogenomic analyses
   including massive sequence data from two aphelid genera, Paraphelidium
   and Amoeboaphelidium, suggested that the aphelids are sister to fungi
   (the ``Aphelida + Fungi hypothesis{''}). Should this position be
   confirmed, aphelids would be key to understanding the early evolution of
   Holomycota and the origin of Fungi. Here, we carry out phylogenomic
   analyses with an expanded taxonomic sampling for aphelids after
   sequencing the transcriptomes of two species of the genus Aphelidium
   (Aphelidium insulamus and Aphelidium tribonematis) in order to test
   these competing hypotheses. Our new phylogenomic analyses including
   species from the three known aphelid genera strongly rejected the
   Opisthosporidia hypothesis. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses
   further supported the Aphelida + Fungi hypothesis via the identification
   of 19 orthologous genes exclusively shared by these two lineages. Seven
   of them originated from ancient horizontal gene transfer events
   predating the aphelid-fungal split and the remaining 12 likely evolved
   de novo, constituting additional molecular synapomorphies for this lade.
   Ancestral trait reconstruction based on our wellresolved phylogeny of
   Holomycota suggests that the progenitor of both fungi and rozellids, was
   aphelid-like, having an amoeboflagellate state and likely preying
   endobiotically on cellulose-containing, cell-walled organisms. Two
   lineages, which we propose to call Phytophagea and Opisthophagea,
   evolved from this ancestor. Phytophagea, grouping aphelids and classical
   fungi, mainly specialized in endobiotic predation of algal cells. Fungi
   emerged from this lineage after losing phagotrophy in favor of
   osmotrophy. Opisthophagea, grouping rozellids and Microsporidia, became
   parasites, mostly of chitin-containing hosts. This lineage entered a
   progressive reductive process that resulted in a unique lifestyle,
   especially in the highly derived Microsporidia.},

Title = {Towards Large-Scale Integrative Taxonomy (LIT): Resolving the Data
   Conundrum for Dark Taxa},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1404-1422},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {New, rapid, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective species discovery and
   delimitation methods are needed for tackling ``dark taxa,{''} here
   defined as groups for which <10\% of all species are described and the
   estimated diversity exceeds 1,000 species. Species delimitation for
   these taxa should be based on multiple data sources ({''}integrative
   taxonomy{''}) but collecting multiple types of data risks impeding a
   discovery process that is already too slow. We here develop large-scale
   integrative taxonomy (LIT), an explicit method where preliminary species
   hypotheses are generated based on inexpensive data that can be obtained
   quickly and cost-effectively. These hypotheses are then evaluated based
   on a more expensive type of ``validation data{''} that is only obtained
   for specimens selected based on objective criteria applied to the
   preliminary species hypotheses. We here use this approach to sort 18,000
   scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) into 315 preliminary species
   hypotheses based on next-generation sequencing barcode (313 bp) clusters
   (using objective clustering {[}OC] with a 3\% threshold). These clusters
   are then evaluated with morphology as the validation data. We develop
   quantitative indicators for predicting which barcode clusters are likely
   to be incongruent with morphospecies by randomly selecting 100 clusters
   for in-depth validation with morphology. A linear model demonstrates
   that the best predictors for incongruence between barcode clusters and
   morphology are maximum p-distance within the cluster and a newly
   proposed index that measures cluster stability across different
   clustering thresholds. A test of these indicators using the 215
   remaining clusters reveals that these predictors correctly identify all
   clusters that are incongruent with morphology. In our study, all
   morphospecies are true or disjoint subsets of the initial barcode
   clusters so that all incongruence can be eliminated by varying
   clustering thresholds. This leads to a discussion of when a third data
   source is needed to resolve incongruent grouping statements. The
   morphological validation step in our study involved 1,039 specimens
   (5.8\% of the total). The formal LIT protocol we propose would only have
   required the study of 915 (5.1\%: 2.5 specimens per species), as we show
   that clusters without signatures of incongruence can be validated by
   only studying two specimens representing the most divergent haplotypes.
   To test the generality of our results across different barcode
   clustering techniques, we establish that the levels of incongruence are
   similar across OC, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Poisson Tree
   Processes (PTP), and Refined Single Linkage (RESL) (used by Barcode of
   Life Data System to assign Barcode Index Numbers {[}BINS]). OC and ABGD
   achieved a maximum congruence score with the morphology of 89\% while
   PTP was slightly less effective (84\%). RESL could only be tested for a
   subset of the specimens because the algorithm is not public. BINs based
   on 277 of the original 1,714 haplotypes were 86\% congruent with
   morphology while the values were 89\% for OC, 74\% for PTP, and 72\% for
   ABGD.},

Title = {Detecting Phylogenetic Signal and Adaptation in Papionin Cranial Shape
   by Decomposing Variation at Different Spatial Scales},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic reconstruction based on morphometric data is hampered by
   homoplasies. For example, many similarities in cranial form between
   primate taxa more strongly reflect ecological similarities rather than
   phylogenetic relatedness. However, the way in which the different
   cranial bones constitute cranial form is, if at all, of less functional
   relevance and thus largely hidden from selection. We propose that these
   ``constructional details{''} are better indicators of phylogenetic
   history than any large-scale shape feature or raw form variable. Within
   a geometric morphometric context, we show how to analyze the relative
   extent of bones independently of differences in overall shape. We also
   show how to decompose total shape variation into small-scale and
   large-scale shape variation. We apply both methods to the midsagittal
   cranial morphology of papionin monkeys, which are well known for the
   discrepancy between morphological similarities and phylogenetic
   relationships. We study phylogenetic signal and functional adaptation
   using a molecular phylogeny and contextual data on feeding ecology and
   locomotor behavior. As expected, total cranial shape, bone outline
   shape, and large-scale shape features were only weakly associated with
   phylogenetic distance. But the relative bone contributions and
   small-scale shape features were both highly correlated with phylogenetic
   distances. By contrast, the association with ecological and behavioral
   variables was strongest for the outline shape and large-scale shape
   features. Studies of morphological adaptation and phylogenetic history
   thus profit from a decomposition of shape variation into different
   spatial scales.},

Title = {Ultraconserved Elements Improve the Resolution of Difficult Nodes within
   the Rapid Radiation of Neotropical Sigmodontine Rodents (Cricetidae:
   Sigmodontinae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1090-1100},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sigmodontine rodents (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae) represent the second
   largest muroid subfamily and the most species-rich group of New World
   mammals, encompassing above 410 living species and ca. 87 genera. Even
   with advances on the clarification of sigmodontine phylogenetic
   relationships that have been made recently, the phylogenetic
   relationships among the 12 main groups of genera (i.e., tribes) remain
   poorly resolved, in particular among those forming the large Glade
   Oryzomyalia. This pattern has been interpreted as consequence of a rapid
   radiation upon the group entrance into South America. Here, we attempted
   to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Sigmodontinae using target
   capture and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements
   (UCEs). We enriched and sequenced UCEs for 56 individuals and collected
   data from four already available genomes. Analyses of distinct data
   sets, based on the capture of 4634 loci, resulted in a highly resolved
   phylogeny consistent across different methods. Coalescent
   species-tree-based approaches, concatenated matrices, and Bayesian
   analyses recovered similar topologies that were congruent at the
   resolution of difficult nodes. We recovered good support for the
   intertribal relationships within Oryzomyalia; for instance, the tribe
   Oryzomyini appears as the sister taxa of the remaining oryzomyalid
   tribes. The estimates of divergence times agree with the results of
   previous studies. We inferred the crown age of the sigmodontine rodents
   at the end of the Middle Miocene, while the main lineages of Oryzomyalia
   appear to have radiated in a short interval during the Late Miocene.
   Thus, the collection of a genomic-scale data set with a wide taxonomic
   sampling provided resolution for the first time of the relationships
   among the main lineages of Sigmodontinae. We expect the phylogeny
   presented here will become the backbone for future systematic and
   evolutionary studies of the group.},

Title = {On the Effect of Asymmetrical Trait Inheritance on Models of Trait
   Evolution},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {376-388},

Abstract = {Current phylogenetic comparative methods modeling quantitative trait
   evolution generally assume that, during speciation, phenotypes are
   inherited identically between the two daughter species. This, however,
   neglects the fact that species consist of a set of individuals, each
   bearing its own trait value. Indeed, because descendent populations
   after speciation are samples of a parent population, we can expect their
   mean phenotypes to randomly differ from one another potentially
   generating a ``jump{''} of mean phenotypes due to asymmetrical trait
   inheritance at cladogenesis. Here, we aim to clarify the effect of
   asymmetrical trait inheritance at speciation on macroevolutionary
   analyses, focusing on model testing and parameter estimation using some
   of the most common models of quantitative trait evolution. We developed
   an individual-based simulation framework in which the evolution of
   phenotypes is determined by trait changes at the individual level
   accumulating across generations, and cladogenesis occurs then by
   separation of subsets of the individuals into new lineages. Through
   simulations, we assess the magnitude of phenotypic jumps at cladogenesis
   under different modes of trait inheritance at speciation. We show that
   even small jumps can strongly alter both the results of model selection
   and parameter estimations, potentially affecting the biological
   interpretation of the estimated mode of evolution of a trait. Our
   results call for caution when interpreting analyses of trait evolution,
   while highlighting the importance of testing a wide range of alternative
   models. In the light of our findings, we propose that future
   methodological advances in comparative methods should more explicitly
   model the intraspecific variability around species mean phenotypes and
   how it is inherited at speciation.},

Abstract = {The common ancestor of spiders likely used silk to line burrows or make
   simple webs, with specialized spinning organs and aerial webs
   originating with the evolution of the megadiverse ``true spiders{''}
   (Araneomorphae). The base of the araneomorph tree also concentrates the
   greatest number of changes in respiratory structures, a character system
   whose evolution is still poorly understood, and that might be related to
   the evolution of silk glands. Emphasizing a densesampling of multiple
   araneomorph lineages where tracheal systems likely originated, we
   gathered genomic-scale data and reconstructed a phylogeny of true
   spiders. This robust phylogenomic framework was used to conduct maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian character evolution analyses for respiratory
   systems, silk glands, and aerial webs, based on a combination of
   original and published data. Our results indicate that in true spiders,
   posterior book lungs were transformed into morphologically similar
   tracheal systems six times independently, after the evolution of novel
   silk gland systems and the origin of aerial webs. From these comparative
   data, we put forth a novel hypothesis that early-diverging web-building
   spiders were faced with new energetic demands for spinning, which
   prompted the evolution of similar tracheal systems via convergence; we
   also propose tests of predictions derived from this hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Antarctica features one of the most ancient, largest glacier reserves
   and the most pristine environment left on the earth. However, in the
   last few decades disturbances due to industrialization and release of
   greenhouse gases have led to serious consequences such as melting of
   polar ice sheets, changing atmospheric chemistry and ozone depletion.
   Here, we use high-throughput sequencing to understand the impact of
   subtle changes in environmental parameters on bacterial communities. We
   observed dominance of Cyanobacteria (41.93\%) followed by Bacteroidetes
   (14.8\%), Acidobacteria (13.35\%), Proteobacteria (9.67\%),
   Actinobacteria (7.79\%), Firmicutes (3.46\%) among all the samples
   collected every alternate day for 20 days. Additionally, metagenomic
   imputations revealed a higher abundance of gene families associated with
   DNA repair and carotenoid biosynthesis enabling bacterial communities to
   resist and function under the high UV radiations. We further observed
   bacterial communities are dependent on the single carbon metabolism as a
   strategy for nutrient uptake in such nutrient deprived conditions.},

Abstract = {African cichlids (subfamily: Pseudocrenilabrinae) are among the most
   diverse vertebrates, and their propensity for repeated rapid radiation
   has made them a celebrated model system in evolutionary research.
   Nonetheless, despite numerous studies, phylogenetic uncertainty
   persists, and riverine lineages remain comparatively underrepresented in
   higher-level phylogenetic studies. Heterogeneous gene histories
   resulting from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization are
   likely sources of uncertainty, especially during episodes of rapid
   speciation. We investigate the relationships of Pseudocrenilabrinae and
   its close relatives while accounting for multiple sources of genetic
   discordance using species tree and hybrid network analyses with hundreds
   of single-copy exons. We improve sequence recovery for distant
   relatives, thereby extending the taxonomic reach of our probes, with a
   hybrid reference guided/de novo assembly approach. Our analyses provide
   robust hypotheses for most higher-level relationships and reveal
   widespread gene heterogeneity, including in riverine taxa. ILS and past
   hybridization are identified as the sources of genetic discordance in
   different lineages. Sampling of various Blenniiformes (formerly
   Ovalentaria) adds strong phylogenomic support for convict blennies
   (Pholidichthyidae) as sister to Cichlidae and points to other
   potentially useful protein-coding markers across the order. A reliable
   phylogeny with representatives from diverse environments will support
   ongoing taxonomic and comparative evolutionary research in the cichlid
   model system. {[}African cichlids; Blenniiformes; Gene tree

Title = {Stabilized Morphological Evolution of Spiders Despite Mosaic Changes in

Abstract = {A prominent question in animal research is how the evolution of
   morphology and ecology interacts in the generation of phenotypic
   diversity. Spiders are some of the most abundant arthropod predators in
   terrestrial ecosystems and exhibit a diversity of foraging styles. It
   remains unclear how spider body size and proportions relate to foraging
   style, and if the use of webs as prey capture devices correlates with
   changes in body characteristics. Here, we present the most extensive
   data set to date of morphometric and ecological traits in spiders. We
   used this data set to estimate the change in spider body sizes and
   shapes over deep time and to test if and how spider phenotypes are
   correlated with their behavioral ecology. We found that phylogenetic
   variation of most traits best fitted an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, which
   is a model of stabilizing selection. A prominent exception was body
   length, whose evolutionary dynamics were best explained with a Brownian
   Motion (free trait diffusion) model. This was most expressed in the
   araneoid clade (ecribellate orb-weaving spiders and allies) that showed
   bimodal trends toward either miniaturization or gigantism. Only few
   traits differed significantly between ecological guilds, most
   prominently leg length and thickness, and although a multivariate
   framework found general differences in traits among ecological guilds,
   it was not possible to unequivocally associate a set of morphometric
   traits with the relative ecological mode. Long, thin legs have often
   evolved with aerial webs and a hanging (suspended) locomotion style, but
   this trend is not general. Eye size and fang length did not differ
   between ecological guilds, rejecting the hypothesis that webs reduce the
   need for visual cue recognition and prey immobilization. For the
   inference of the ecology of species with unknown behaviors, we propose
   not to use morphometric traits, but rather consult (micro-)morphological
   characters, such as the presence of certain podal structures. These
   results suggest that, in contrast to insects, the evolution of body
   proportions in spiders is unusually stabilized and ecological
   adaptations are dominantly realized by behavioral traits and extended
   phenotypes in this group of predators. This work demonstrates the power
   of combining recent advances in phylogenomics with trait-based
   approaches to better understand global functional diversity patterns
   through space and time. {[}Animal architecture; Arachnida; Araneae;

Abstract = {An unprecedented amount of evidence now illuminates the phylogeny of
   living mammals and birds on the Tree of Life. We use this tree to
   measure the phylogenetic value of data typically used in paleontology
   (bones and teeth) from six data sets derived from five published
   studies. We ask three interrelated questions: 1) Can these data
   adequately reconstruct known parts of the Tree of Life? 2) Is accuracy
   generally similar for studies using morphology, or do some morphological
   data sets perform better than others? 3) Does the loss of
   non-fossilizable data cause taxa to occur in misleadingly basal
   positions? Adding morphology to DNA data sets usually increases
   congruence of resulting topologies to the well-corroborated tree, but
   this varies among morphological data sets. Extant taxa with a high
   proportion of missing morphological characters can greatly reduce
   phylogenetic resolution when analyzed together with fossils. Attempts to
   ameliorate this by deleting extant taxa missing morphology are prone to
   decreased accuracy due to long-branch artifacts. We find no evidence
   that fossilization causes extinct taxa to incorrectly appear at or near
   topologically basal branches. Morphology comprises the evidence held in
   common by living taxa and fossils, and phylogenetic analysis of fossils
   greatly benefits from inclusion of molecular and morphological data
   sampled for living taxa, whatever methods are used for phylogeny
   estimation. {[}Concatenation; fossilization; morphology; parsimony;

Title = {Uncertainty in Divergence Time Estimation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {855-861},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding and representing uncertainty is crucial in academic
   research because it enables studies to build on the conclusions of
   previous studies, leading to robust advances in a particular field.
   Here, we evaluate the nature of uncertainty and the manner by which it
   is represented in divergence time estimation, a field that is
   fundamental to many aspects of macroevolutionary research, and where
   there is evidence that uncertainty has been seriously underestimated. We
   address this issue in the context of methods used in divergence time
   estimation, and with respect to the manner by which time-calibrated
   phylogenies are interpreted. With respect to methods, we discuss how the
   assumptions underlying different methods may not adequately reflect
   uncertainty about molecular evolution, the fossil record, or
   diversification rates. Therefore, divergence time estimates may not
   adequately reflect uncertainty and may be directly contradicted by
   subsequent findings. For the interpretation of time-calibrated
   phylogenies, we discuss how the use of time-calibrated phylogenies for
   reconstructing general evolutionary timescales leads to inferences about
   macroevolution that are highly sensitive to methodological limitations
   in how uncertainty is accounted for. By contrast, we discuss how the use
   of time-calibrated phylogenies to test specific hypotheses leads to
   inferences about macroevolution that are less sensitive to
   methodological limitations. Given that many biologists wish to use
   time-calibrated phylogenies to reconstruct general evolutionary
   timescales, we conclude that the development of methods of divergence
   time estimation that adequately account for uncertainty is necessary.},

Abstract = {The insect order Psocodea is a diverse lineage comprising both parasitic
   (Phthiraptera) and nonparasitic members (Psocoptera). The extreme age
   and ecological diversity of the group may be associated with major
   genomic changes, such as base compositional biases expected to affect
   phylogenetic inference. Divergent morphology between parasitic and
   nonparasitic members has also obscured the origins of parasitism within
   the order. We conducted a phylogenomic analysis on the order Psocodea
   utilizing both transcriptome and genome sequencing to obtain a data set
   of 2370 orthologous genes. All phylogenomic analyses, including both
   concatenated and coalescent methods suggest a single origin of
   parasitism within the order Psocodea, resolving conflicting results from
   previous studies. This phylogeny allows us to propose a stable ordinal
   level classification scheme that retains significant taxonomic names
   present in historical scientific literature and reflects the evolution
   of the group as a whole. A dating analysis, with internal nodes
   calibrated by fossil evidence, suggests an origin of parasitism that
   predates the K-Pg boundary. Nucleotide compositional biases are detected
   in third and first codon positions and result in the anomalous placement
   of the Amphientometae as sister to Psocomorpha when all nucleotide sites
   are analyzed. Likelihood-mapping and quartet sampling methods
   demonstrate that base compositional biases can also have an effect on
   quartet-based methods.},

Abstract = {The origin of plastids was a major evolutionary event that paved the way
   for an astonishing diversification of photosynthetic eukaryotes.
   Plastids originated by endosymbiosis between a heterotrophic eukaryotic
   host and cyanobacteria, presumably in a common ancestor of the primary
   photosynthetic eukaryotes (Archaeplastida). A single origin of primary
   plastids is well supported by plastid evidence but not by nuclear
   phylogenomic analyses, which have consistently failed to recover the
   monophyly of Archaeplastida hosts. Importantly, plastid monophyly and
   nonmonophyletic hosts could be explained under scenarios of independent
   or serial eukaryote-to-eukaryote endosymbioses. Here, we assessed the
   strength of the signal for the monophyly of Archaeplastida hosts in four
   available phylogenomic data sets. The effect of phylogenetic
   methodology, data quality, alignment trimming strategy, gene and taxon
   sampling, and the presence of outlier genes were investigated. Our
   analyses revealed a lack of support for host monophyly in the shorter
   individual data sets. However, when analyzed together under rigorous
   data curation and complex mixture models, the combined nuclear data sets
   supported the monophyly of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes
   (Archaeplastida) and recovered a putative association with
   plastid-lacking Picozoa. This study represents an important step toward
   better understanding deep eukaryotic evolution and the origin of
   plastids.},

Title = {Ecological Opportunity from Innovation, not Islands, Drove the Anole
   Lizard Adaptive Radiation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Islands are thought to facilitate adaptive radiation by providing
   release from competition and predation. Anole lizards are considered a
   classic example of this phenomenon: different ecological specialists
   ({''}ecomorphs{''}) evolved in the Caribbean Greater Antilles (Cuba,
   Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), resulting in convergent
   assemblages that are not observed in mainland Latin America. Yet, the
   role of islands in facilitating adaptive radiation is more often implied
   than directly tested, leaving uncertain the role of biogeography in
   stimulating diversification. Here, we assess the proposed ``island
   effect{''} on anole diversification using Bayesian phylogenetic
   comparative methods that explicitly incorporate rate heterogeneity
   across the tree and demonstrate two cases of would be false positives.
   We discovered that rates of speciation and morphological evolution of
   island and mainland anoles are equivalent, implying that islands provide
   no special context for exceptionally rapid diversification. Likewise,
   rates of evolution were equivalent between island anoles that arose via
   in situ versus dispersal-based mechanisms, and we found no evidence for
   island-specific rates of speciation or morphological evolution.
   Nonetheless, the origin of Anolis is characterized by a speciation pulse
   that slowed over time-a classic signature of waning ecological
   opportunity. Our findings cast doubt on the notion that islands
   catalyzed the anole adaptive radiation and instead point to a key
   innovation, adhesive toe pads, which facilitated the exploitation of
   many arboreal niches sparsely utilized by other iguanian lizards. The
   selective pressures responsible for arboreal niche diversification
   differ between islands and the mainland, but the tempo of
   diversification driven by these discordant processes is
   indistinguishable.},

Title = {Mapping Africa's Biodiversity: More of the Same Is Just Not Good Enough},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {623-633},

Abstract = {Species distribution data are fundamental to the understanding of
   biodiversity patterns and processes. Yet, such data are strongly
   affected by sampling biases, mostly related to site accessibility. The
   understanding of these biases is therefore crucial in systematics,
   biogeography, and conservation. Here we present a novel approach for
   quantifying sampling effort and its impact on biodiversity knowledge,
   focusing on Africa. In contrast to previous studies assessing sampling
   completeness (percentage of species recorded in relation to predicted),
   we investigate whether the lack of knowledge of a site attracts
   scientists to visit these areas and collect samples of species. We then
   estimate the time required to sample 90\% of the continent under a
   Weibull distributed biodiversity sampling rate and the number of
   sampling events required to record 50\% of the species. Using linear and
   spatial regression models, we show that previous sampling has been
   strongly influencing the resampling of areas, attracting repeated
   visits. This bias has existed for over two centuries, has increased in
   recent decades, and is most pronounced among mammals. It may take
   between 172 and 274 years, depending on the group, to achieve at least
   one sampling event per grid cell in the entire continent. Just one visit
   will, however, not be enough: in order to record 50\% of the current
   diversity, it will require at least 12 sampling events for amphibians,
   13 for mammals, and 27 for birds. Our results demonstrate the importance
   of sampling areas that lack primary biodiversity data and the urgency
   with which this needs to be done. Current practice is insufficient to
   adequately classify and map African biodiversity; it can lead to
   incorrect conclusions being drawn from biogeographic analyses and can
   result in misleading and self-reinforcing conservation priorities.},

Title = {Impact of Pleistocene Eustatic Fluctuations on Evolutionary Dynamics in
   Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots},

Abstract = {Pleistocene climatic fluctuations (PCF) are frequently highlighted as
   important evolutionary engines that triggered cycles of biome expansion
   and contraction. Although there is ample evidence of the impact of PCF
   on biodiversity of continental biomes, the consequences in insular
   systems depend on the geology of the islands and the ecology of the taxa
   inhabiting them. The idiosyncratic aspects of insular systems are
   exemplified by the islands of the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia
   (Sundaland), where PCF-induced eustatic fluctuations had complex
   interactions with the geology of the region, resulting in high species
   diversity and endemism. Emergent land in Southeast Asia varied
   drastically with sealevel fluctuations during the Pleistocene.
   Climate-induced fluctuations in sea level caused temporary connections
   between insular and continental biodiversity hotspots in Southeast Asia.
   These exposed lands likely had freshwater drainage systems that extended
   between modern islands: the Paleoriver Hypothesis. Built upon the
   assumption that aquatic organisms are among the most suitable models to
   trace ancient river boundaries and fluctuations of landmass coverage,
   the present study aims to examine the evolutionary consequences of PCF
   on the dispersal of freshwater biodiversity in Southeast Asia.
   Time-calibrated phylogenies of DNA-delimited species were inferred for
   six species-rich freshwater fish genera in Southeast Asia (Clarias,
   Channa, Glyptothorax, Hemirhamphodon, Dermogenys, Nomorhamphus). The
   results highlight rampant cryptic diversity and the temporal
   localization of most speciation events during the Pleistocene, with 88\%
   of speciation events occurring during this period. Diversification
   analyses indicate that sea-level-dependent diversification models poorly
   account for species proliferation patterns for all clades excepting
   Channa. Ancestral area estimations point to Borneo as the most likely
   origin for most lineages, with two waves of dispersal to Sumatra and
   Java during the last 5 myr. Speciation events are more frequently
   associated with boundaries of the paleoriver watersheds, with 60\%, than
   islands boundaries, with 40\%. In total, one-third of speciation events
   are inferred to have occurred within paleorivers on a single island,
   suggesting that habitat heterogeneity and factors other than allopatry
   between islands substantially affected diversification of Sundaland
   fishes. Our results suggest that species proliferation in Sundaland is
   not wholly reliant on Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations isolating
   populations on different islands.},

Abstract = {Bayesian inference of phylogeny with Markov chain Monte Carlo plays a
   key role in the study of evolution. Yet, this method still suffers from
   a practical challenge identified more than two decades ago: designing
   tree topology proposals that efficiently sample tree spaces. In this
   article, I introduce the concept of adaptive tree proposals for unrooted
   topologies, that is, tree proposals adapting to the posterior
   distribution as it is estimated. I use this concept to elaborate two
   adaptive variants of existing proposals and an adaptive proposal based
   on a novel design philosophy in which the structure of the proposal is
   informed by the posterior distribution of trees. I investigate the
   performance of these proposals by first presenting a metric that
   captures the performance of each proposal within a mixture of proposals.
   Using this metric, I compare the performance of the adaptive proposals
   to the performance of standard and parsimony-guided proposals on 11
   empirical data sets. Using adaptive proposals led to consistent
   performance gains and resulted in up to 18-fold increases in mixing
   efficiency and 6-fold increases in convergence rate without increasing
   the computational cost of these analyses.},

Abstract = {Studies of isotopic ages were conducted for rock samples of the Keller,
   Visca Anchorage and Domeyko Glacier formations. Together they form a
   part of the Martel Inlet Group, a terrestrial calc-alkaline volcanic and
   volcanoclastic suite and they crop out along the Keller Peninsula on
   King George Island. The U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotope data from the Keller
   Peninsula lava flows, although differing in quality, made it possible to
   obtain reliable age intervals. The stratified volcanogenic rocks of
   Keller Peninsula, Visca Anchorage and Domeyko Glacier formations of the
   Keller Peninsula were emplaced there near the Early/ Late Palaeocene
   boundary (ca. 62.11 +/- 0.66 Ma ago), in the Early Eocene (ca. 56.351.9
   Ma) and near the Early/Middle Eocene boundary (ca. 49.9-47.9 Ma),
   respectively. A certain difference in the ages of Eocene volcanogenic
   formations, in particular tectonic blocks of King George Island, may
   indicate a migration of centres of volcanic activity over time, from

Title = {ARPIP: Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction with Insertions and Deletions

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Modern phylogenetic methods allow inference of ancestral molecular
   sequences given an alignment and phylogeny relating present-day
   sequences. This provides insight into the evolutionary history of
   molecules, helping to understand gene function and to study biological
   processes such as adaptation and convergent evolution across a variety
   of applications. Here, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm for
   fast joint likelihood-based reconstruction of ancestral sequences under
   the Poisson Indel Process (PIP). Unlike previous approaches, our method,
   named ARPIP, enables the reconstruction with insertions and deletions
   based on an explicit indel model. Consequently, inferred indel events
   have an explicit biological interpretation. Likelihood computation is
   achieved in linear time with respect to the number of sequences. Our
   method consists of two steps, namely finding the most probable indel
   points and reconstructing ancestral sequences. First, we find the most
   likely indel points and prune the phylogeny to reflect the insertion and
   deletion events per site. Second, we infer the ancestral states on the
   pruned subtree in a manner similar to FastML. We applied ARPIP
   (Ancestral Reconstruction under PIP) on simulated data sets and on real
   data from the Betacoronavirus genus. ARPIP reconstructs both the indel
   events and substitutions with a high degree of accuracy. Our method
   fares well when compared to established state-of-the-art methods such as
   FastML and PAML. Moreover, the method can be extended to explore both
   optimal and suboptimal reconstructions, include rate heterogeneity
   through time and more. We believe it will expand the range of novel
   applications of ancestral sequence reconstruction. {[}Ancestral

Title = {A Linear Time Solution to the Labeled Robinson-Foulds Distance Problem},

Year = {2022},

Pages = {1391-1403},

Abstract = {A large variety of pairwise measures of similarity or dissimilarity have
   been developed for comparing phylogenetic trees, for example, species
   trees or gene trees. Due to its intuitive definition in terms of tree
   clades and bipartitions and its computational efficiency, the
   Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is the most widely used for trees with
   unweighted edges and labels restricted to leaves (representing the
   genetic elements being compared). However, in the case of gene trees, an
   important information revealing the nature of the homologous relation
   between gene pairs (orthologs, paralogs, and xenologs) is the type of
   event associated to each internal node of the tree, typically
   speciations or duplications, but other types of events may also be
   considered, such as horizontal gene transfers. This labeling of internal
   nodes is usually inferred from a gene tree/species tree reconciliation
   method. Here, we address the problem of comparing such event-labeled
   trees. The problem differs from the classical problem of comparing
   uniformly labeled trees (all labels belonging to the same alphabet) that
   may be done using the Tree Edit Distance (TED) mainly due to the fact
   that, in our case, two different alphabets are considered for the leaves
   and internal nodes of the tree, and leaves are not affected by edit
   operations. We propose an extension of the RF distance to event-labeled
   trees, based on edit operations comparable to those considered for TED:
   node insertion, node deletion, and label substitution. We show that this
   new Labeled Robinson-Foulds (LRF) distance can be computed in linear
   time, in addition of maintaining other desirable properties: being a
   metric, reducing to RF for trees with no labels on internal nodes and
   maintaining an intuitive interpretation. The algorithm for computing the
   LRF distance enables novel analyses on event-label trees such as
   reconciled gene trees. Here, we use it to study the impact of taxon
   sampling on labeled gene tree inference and conclude that denser taxon
   sampling yields trees with better topology but worse labeling.

Title = {The Implications of Incongruence between Gene Tree and Species Tree
   Topologies for Divergence Time Estimation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1124-1146},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses are increasingly being performed with data sets
   that incorporate hundreds of loci. Due to incomplete lineage sorting,
   hybridization, and horizontal gene transfer, the gene trees for these
   loci may often have topologies that differ from each other and from the
   species tree. The effect of these topological incongruences on
   divergence time estimation has not been fully investigated. Using a
   series of simulation experiments and empirical analyses, we demonstrate
   that when topological incongruence between gene trees and the species
   tree is not accounted for, the temporal duration of branches in regions
   of the species tree that are affected by incongruence is underestimated,
   whilst the duration of other branches is considerably overestimated.
   This effect becomes more pronounced with higher levels of topological
   incongruence. We show that this pattern results from the erroneous
   estimation of the number of substitutions along branches in the species
   tree, although the effect is modulated by the assumptions inherent to
   divergence time estimation, such as those relating to the fossil record
   or among-branch-substitution-rate variation. By only analyzing loci with
   gene trees that are topologically congruent with the species tree, or
   only taking into account the branches from each gene tree that are
   topologically congruent with the species tree, we demonstrate that the
   effects of topological incongruence can be ameliorated. Nonetheless,
   even when topologically congruent gene trees or topologically congruent
   branches are selected, error in divergence time estimates remains. This
   stems from temporal incongruences between divergence times in species
   trees and divergence times in gene trees, and more importantly, the
   difficulty of incorporating necessary assumptions for divergence time
   estimation. {[}Divergence time estimation; gene trees; species tree;

Abstract = {Integrative taxonomy is central to modern taxonomy and systematic
   biology, including behavior, niche preference, distribution,
   morphological analysis, and DNA barcoding. However, decades of use
   demonstrate that these methods can face challenges when used in
   isolation, for instance, potential misidentifications due to phenotypic
   plasticity for morphological methods, and incorrect identifications
   because of introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, and horizontal
   gene transfer for DNA barcoding. Although researchers have advocated the
   use of integrative taxonomy, few detailed algorithms have been proposed.
   Here, we develop a convolutional neural network method
   (morphology-molecule network {[}MMNet]) that integrates morphological
   and molecular data for species identification. The newly proposed method
   (MMNet) worked better than four currently available alternative methods
   when tested with 10 independent data sets representing varying genetic
   diversity from different taxa. High accuracies were achieved for all
   groups, including beetles (98.1\% of 123 species), butterflies (98.8\%
   of 24 species), fishes (96.3\% of 214 species), and moths (96.4\% of 150
   total species). Further, MMNet demonstrated a high degree of accuracy
   (>98\%) in four data sets including closely related species from the
   same genus. The average accuracy of two modest subgenomic (single
   nucleotide polymorphism) data sets, comprising eight putative subspecies
   respectively, is 90\%. Additional tests show that the success rate of
   species identification under this method most strongly depends on the
   amount of training data, and is robust to sequence length and image
   size. Analyses on the contribution of different data types (image vs.
   gene) indicate that both morphological and genetic data are important to

Abstract = {Compared to other regions, the drivers of diversification in Africa are
   poorly understood. We studied a radiation of insects with over 100
   species occurring in a wide range of habitats across the Afrotropics to
   investigate the fundamental evolutionary processes and geological events
   that generate and maintain patterns of species richness on the
   continent. By investigating the evolutionary history of Bicyclus
   butterflies within a phylogenetic framework, we inferred the group's
   origin at the Oligo-Miocene boundary from ancestors in the Congolian
   rainforests of central Africa. Abrupt climatic fluctuations during the
   Miocene (ca. 19-17 Ma) likely fragmented ancestral populations,
   resulting in at least eight early-divergent lineages. Only one of these
   lineages appears to have diversified during the drastic climate and
   biome changes of the early Miocene, radiating into the largest group of
   extant species. The other seven lineages diversified in forest
   ecosystems during the late Miocene and Pleistocene when climatic
   conditions were more favorable-warmer and wetter. Our results suggest
   changing Neogene climate, uplift of eastern African orogens, and biotic
   interactions have had different effects on the various subclades of
   Bicyclus, producing one of the most spectacular butterfly radiations in
   Africa. {[}Afrotropics; biodiversity; biome; biotic interactions; Court

Abstract = {Introgression is an important biological process affecting at least 10\%
   of the extant species in the animal kingdom. Introgression significantly
   impacts inference of phylogenetic species relationships where a strictly
   binary tree model cannot adequately explain reticulate net-like species
   relationships. Here, we use phylogenomic approaches to understand
   patterns of introgression along the evolutionary history of a unique,
   nonmodel insect system: dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). We
   demonstrate that introgression is a pervasive evolutionary force across
   various taxonomic levels within Odonata. In particular, we show that the
   morphologically ``intermediate{''} species of Anisozygoptera (one of the
   three primary suborders within Odonata besides Zygoptera and
   Anisoptera), which retain phenotypic characteristics of the other two
   suborders, experienced high levels of introgression likely coming from
   zygopteran genomes. Additionally, we find evidence for multiple cases of
   deep inter-superfamilial ancestral introgression. {[}Gene flow; Odonata;

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Next-generation-sequencing genotype callers are commonly used in studies
   to call variants from newly sequenced species. However, due to the
   current availability of genomic resources, it is still common practice
   to use only one reference genome for a given genus, or even one
   reference for an entire Glade of a higher taxon. The problem with
   traditional genotype callers, such as the one from GATK, is that they
   are optimized for variant calling at the population level. However, when
   these callers are used at the phylogenetic level, the consequences for
   downstream analyses can be substantial. Here, we performed simulations
   to compare the performance between the genotype callers of GATK and
   ATLAS, and present their differences at various phylogenetic scales. We
   show that the genotype caller of GATK substantially underestimates the
   number of variants at the phylogenetic level, but not at the population
   level. We also found that the accuracy of heterozygote calls declines
   with increasing distance to the reference genome. We quantified this
   decline and found that it is very sharp in GATK, while ATLAS maintains
   high accuracy even at moderately divergent species from the reference.
   We further suggest that efforts should be taken towards acquiring more
   reference genomes per species, before pursuing high-scale phylogenomic
   studies.},

Title = {Segmental Series and Size: Clade-Wide Investigation of Molar Proportions
   Reveals a Major Evolutionary Allometry in the Dentition of Placental
   Mammals},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1101-1109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Iterative segments such as teeth or limbs are a widespread
   characteristic of living organisms. While their proportions may be
   governed by similar developmental rules in vertebrates, there is no
   emerging pattern as regards their relation to size. Placental mammals
   span eight orders of magnitude in body size and show a wide spectrum of
   dietary habits associated with size and reflected in their dentitions,
   especially molars. Although variation in size constitutes an important
   determinant for variation in biological traits, few major allometric
   trends have been documented on placental molars so far. Molar
   proportions have been intensively explored in placentals in relation to
   developmental models, but often at a small phylogenetic scale. Here, we
   analyzed the diversity of upper molar proportions in relation to
   absolute size in a large sample of placental species (n =299)
   encompassing most of the group's dental diversity. Our phylogenetically
   informed analyses revealed a 2-fold pattern of evolutionary integration
   among upper molars: while molars covary in size with each other, their
   proportions covary with the absolute size of the entire molar field.
   With increasing absolute size, posterior molars increase in size
   relative to anterior ones, meaning that large-sized species have
   relatively large rear molars while the opposite is true for small-sized
   species. The directionality of proportional increase in the molar row
   exhibits a previously unsuspected allometric patterning among
   placentals, showing how large-scale variations in size may have
   influenced variation in dental morphology. This finding provides new
   evidence that processes regulating the size of individual molars are
   integrated with overall patterns of growth and calls for further testing
   of allometric variation in the dentition and in other segmental series
   of the vertebrate body.},

Title = {Modeling Phylogenetic Biome Shifts on a Planet with a Past},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-107},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of biomes has changed considerably over deep
   time, so the geographical opportunity for an evolutionary lineage to
   shift into a new biome may depend on how the availability and
   connectivity of biomes has varied temporally. To better understand how
   lineages shift between biomes in space and time, we developed a
   phylogenetic biome shift model in which each lineage shifts between
   biomes and disperses between regions at rates that depend on the
   lineage's biome affinity and location relative to the spatial
   distribution of biomes at any given time. To study the behavior of the
   biome shift model in an empirical setting, we developed a
   literature-based representation of paleobiome structure for three mesic
   forest biomes, six regions, and eight time strata, ranging from the Late
   Cretaceous (100 Ma) through the present. We then fitted the model to a
   time-calibrated phylogeny of 119 Viburnum species to compare how the
   results responded to various realistic or unrealistic assumptions about
   paleobiome structure. Ancestral biome estimates that account for
   paleobiome dynamics reconstructed a warm temperate (or tropical) origin
   of Viburnum, which is consistent with previous fossil-based estimates of
   ancestral biomes. Imposing unrealistic paleobiome distributions led to
   ancestral biome estimates that eliminated support for tropical origins,
   and instead inflated support for cold temperate ancestry throughout the
   warmer Paleocene and Eocene. The biome shift model we describe is
   applicable to the study of evolutionary systems beyond Viburnum, and the
   core mechanisms of our model are extensible to the design of richer
   phylogenetic models of historical biogeography and/or lineage
   diversification. We conclude that biome shift models that account for
   dynamic geographical opportunities are important for inferring ancestral
   biomes that are compatible with our understanding of Earth history.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing accurate historical relationships within a species poses
   numerous challenges, not least in many plant groups in which gene flow
   is high enough to extend well beyond species boundaries. Nonetheless,
   the extent of tree-like history within a species is an empirical
   question on which it is now possible to bring large amounts of genome
   sequence to bear. We assess phylogenetic structure across the geographic
   range of the saguaro cactus, an emblematic member of Cactaceae, a clade
   known for extensive hybridization and porous species boundaries. Using
   200 Gb of whole genome resequencing data from 20 individuals sampled
   from 10 localities, we assembled two data sets comprising 150,000
   biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from protein coding
   sequences. From these, we inferred within-species trees and evaluated
   their significance and robustness using five qualitatively different
   inference methods. Despite the low sequence diversity, large census
   population sizes, and presence of wide-ranging pollen and seed dispersal
   agents, phylogenetic trees were well resolved and highly consistent
   across both data sets and all methods. We inferred that the most likely
   root, based on marginal likelihood comparisons, is to the east and south
   of the region of highest genetic diversity, which lies along the coast
   of the Gulf of California in Sonora, Mexico. Together with striking
   decreases in marginal likelihood found to the north, this supports
   hypotheses that saguaro's current range reflects postglacial expansion
   from the refugia in the south of its range. We conclude with
   observations about practical and theoretical issues raised by
   phylogenomic data sets within species, in which SNP-based methods must
   be used rather than gene tree methods that are widely used when sequence
   divergence is higher. These include computational scalability, inference
   of gene flow, and proper assessment of statistical support in the
   presence of linkage effects. {[}Phylogenomics; phylogeography; rooting;

Abstract = {The use of information criteria to distinguish between phylogenetic
   models has become ubiquitous within the field. However, the variety and
   complexity of available models are much greater now than when these
   practices were established. The literature shows an increasing
   trajectory of healthy skepticism with regard to the use of information
   theory-based model selection within phylogenetics. We add to this by
   analyzing the specific case of comparison between partition and mixture
   models. We argue from a theoretical basis that information criteria are
   inherently more likely to favor partition models over mixture models,
   and we then demonstrate this through simulation. Based on our findings,
   we suggest that partition and mixture models are not suitable for
   information-theory based model comparison. {[}AIC, BIC; information

Abstract = {Understanding variation in rates of evolution and morphological
   disparity is a goal of macroevolutionary research. In a phylogenetic
   comparative methods framework, we present three explicit models for
   linking the rate of evolution of a trait to the state of another
   evolving trait. This allows testing hypotheses about causal influences
   on rates of phenotypic evolution with phylogenetic comparative data. We
   develop a statistical framework for fitting the models with generalized
   least-squares regression and use this to discuss issues and limitations
   in the study of rates of evolution more generally. We show that the
   power to detect effects on rates of evolution is low in that even strong
   causal effects are unlikely to explain more than a few percent of
   observed variance in disparity. We illustrate the models and issues by
   testing if rates of beak-shape evolution in birds are influenced by
   brain size, as may be predicted from a Baldwin effect in which
   presumptively more behaviorally flexible large-brained species generate
   more novel selection on themselves leading to higher rates of evolution.
   From an analysis of morphometric data for 645 species, we find evidence
   that both macro- and microevolution of the beak are faster in birds with
   larger brains, but with the caveat that there are no consistent effects
   of relative brain size.{[}Baldwin effect; beak shape; behavioral drive;

Title = {DNA Barcodes Combined with Multilocus Data of Representative Taxa Can
   Generate Reliable Higher-Level Phylogenies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {382-395},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Taxa are frequently labeled incertae sedis when their placement is
   debated at ranks above the species level, such as their subgeneric,
   generic, or subtribal placement. This is a pervasive problem in groups
   with complex systematics due to difficulties in identifying suitable
   synapomorphies. In this study, we propose combining DNA barcodes with a
   multilocus backbone phylogeny in order to assign taxa to genus or other
   higher-level categories. This sampling strategy generates molecular
   matrices containing large amounts of missing data that are not
   distributed randomly: barcodes are sampled for all representatives, and
   additional markers are sampled only for a small percentage. We
   investigate the effects of the degree and randomness of missing data on
   phylogenetic accuracy using simulations for up to 100 markers in
   1000-tips trees, as well as a real case: the subtribe Polyommatina
   (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), a large group including numerous species with
   unresolved taxonomy. Our simulation tests show that when a strategic and
   representative selection of species for higher-level categories has been
   made for multigene sequencing (approximately one per simulated genus),
   the addition of this multigene backbone DNA data for as few as 5-10\% of
   the specimens in the total data set can produce high-quality
   phylogenies, comparable to those resulting from 100\% multigene
   sampling. In contrast, trees based exclusively on barcodes performed
   poorly. This approach was applied to a 1365-specimen data set of
   Polyommatina (including ca. 80\% of described species), with nearly 8\%
   of representative species included in the multigene backbone and the
   remaining 92\% included only by mitochondrial COI barcodes, a phylogeny
   was generated that highlighted potential misplacements, unrecognized
   major clades, and placement for incertae sedis taxa. We use this
   information to make systematic rearrangements within Polyommatina, and
   to describe two new genera. Finally, we propose a systematic workflow to
   assess higher-level taxonomy in hyperdiverse groups. This research
   identifies an additional, enhanced value of DNA barcodes for
   improvements in higher-level systematics using large data sets.

Abstract = {Phylogenies are increasingly being used as a basis to provide insight
   into macroevolutionary history. Here, we use simulation experiments and
   empirical analyses to evaluate methods that use phylogenies as a basis
   to make estimates of divergence times and rates of diversification. This
   is the first study to present a comprehensive assessment of the key
   variables that underpin analyses in this field-including substitution
   rates, speciation rates, and extinction, plus character sampling and
   taxon sampling. We show that in unrealistically simplistic cases (where
   substitution rates and speciation rates are constant, and where there is
   no extinction), increased character and taxon sampling lead to more
   accurate and precise parameter estimates. By contrast, in more complex
   but realistic cases (where substitution rates, speciation rates, and
   extinction rates vary), gains in accuracy and precision from increased
   character and taxon sampling are far more limited. The lack of accuracy
   and precision even occurs when using methods that are designed to
   account for more complex cases, such as relaxed clocks, fossil
   calibrations, and models that allow speciation rates and extinction
   rates to vary. The problem also persists when analyzing genomic scale
   data sets. These results suggest two interrelated problems that occur
   when the processes that generated the data are more complex. First,
   methodological assumptions are more likely to be violated. Second,
   limitations in the information content of the data become more
   important.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {389-407},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The branching patterns of molecular phylogenies are generally assumed to
   contain information on rates of the underlying speciation and extinction
   processes. Simple birth-death models with constant, time-varying, or
   diversity-dependent rates have been invoked to explain these patterns.
   They have one assumption in common: all lineages have the same set of
   diversification rates at a given point in time. It seems likely,
   however, that there is variability in diversification rates across
   subclades in a phylogenetic tree. This has inspired the construction of
   models that allow multiple rate regimes across the phylogeny, with
   instantaneous shifts between these regimes. Several methods exist for
   calculating the likelihood of a phylogeny under a specified mapping of
   diversification regimes and for performing inference on the most likely
   diversification history that gave rise to a particular phylogenetic
   tree. Here, we show that the likelihood computation of these methods is
   not correct. We provide a new framework to compute the likelihood
   correctly and show, with simulations of a single shift, that the correct
   likelihood indeed leads to parameter estimates that are on average in
   much better agreement with the generating parameters than the incorrect
   likelihood. Moreover, we show that our corrected likelihood can be
   extended to multiple rate shifts in time-dependent and
   diversity-dependent models. We argue that identifying shifts in
   diversification rates is a nontrivial model selection exercise where one
   has to choose whether shifts in now-extinct lineages are taken into
   account or not. Hence, our framework also resolves the recent debate on
   such unobserved shifts.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are a radiation of morphologically cryptic
   primates distributed throughout Madagascar for which the number of
   recognized species has exploded in the past two decades. This taxonomic
   revision has prompted understandable concern that there has been
   substantial oversplitting in the mouse lemur clade. Here, we
   investigatemouse lemur diversity in a region in northeastern Madagascar
   with high levels of microendemism and predicted habitat loss. We
   analyzed RADseq data with multispecies coalescent (MSC) species
   delimitation methods for two pairs of sister lineages that include three
   named species and an undescribed lineage previously identified to have
   divergent mtDNA. Marked differences in effective population sizes,
   levels of gene flow, patterns of isolation-by-distance, and species
   delimitation results were found among the two pairs of lineages. Whereas
   all tests support the recognition of the presently undescribed lineage
   as a separate species, the species-level distinction of two previously
   described species, M. mittermeieri and M. lehilahytsara is not
   supported-a result that is particularly striking when using the
   genealogical discordance index (gdi). Nonsister lineages occur
   sympatrically in two of the localities sampled for this study, despite
   an estimated divergence time of less than 1 Ma. This suggests rapid
   evolution of reproductive isolation in the focal lineages and in the
   mouse lemur clade generally. The divergence time estimates reported here
   are based on the MSC calibrated with pedigree-based mutation rates and
   are considerably more recent than previously published fossil-calibrated
   relaxed-clock estimates. We discuss the possible explanations for this
   discrepancy, noting that there are theoretical justifications for
   preferring the MSC estimates in this case.},

Title = {The Comparative Method is Not Macroevolution: Across-Species Evidence
   for Within-Species Process},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {It is common for studies that employ the comparative method for the
   study of adaptation, that is, documentation of potentially adaptive
   across-species patterns of trait-environment or trait-trait correlation,
   to be designated as ``macroevolutionary.{''} Authors are justified in
   using ``macroevolution{''} in this way by appeal to definitions such as
   ``evolution above the species level.{''} I argue that regarding the
   comparative method as ``macroevolutionary{''} is harmful because it
   hides in serious ways the true causal content of hypotheses tested with
   the comparative method. The comparative method is a means of testing
   hypotheses of adaptation and their alternatives. Adaptation is a
   population-level phenomenon, involving heritable interindividual
   variation that is associated with fitness differences. For example,
   given heritable intrapopulational variation, more streamlined
   individuals in populations of fast-moving aquatic animals have higher
   locomotory efficiency and thus better survivorship and more resources
   directed to reproduction than less streamlined ones. Direct evidence
   consistent with this population-level scenario includes the observation
   that many unrelated species of fast-moving aquatic animals have similar
   streamlined shapes, an example of the comparative method. Crucial to
   note in this example is that although the data are observed across
   species, the comparative method for studying adaptation tests hypotheses
   regarding standard population-level natural selection with no content
   that can be construed as ``macro.{''} Even less ``macro,{''}
   individual-level developmental dynamics can limit or bias the range of
   variants available for selection. Calling any of these studies
   ``macroevolutionary{''} implies that some additional process is at work,
   shrouding the need to test adaptation hypotheses and study the range of
   variants that can be produced in development.},

Title = {Diversification, Introgression, and Rampant Cytonuclear Discordance in

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Evidence from natural systems suggests that hybridization between animal
   species is more common than traditionally thought, but the overall
   contribution of introgression to standing genetic variation within
   species remains unclear for most animal systems. Here, we use targeted
   exon capture to sequence thousands of nuclear loci and complete
   mitochondrial genomes from closely related chipmunk species in the
   Tamias quadrivittatus group that are distributed across the Great Basin
   and the central and southern Rocky Mountains of North America. This
   recent radiation includes six overlapping, ecologically distinct species
   (Tamias canipes, Tamias cinereicollis, Tamias dorsalis, T.
   quadrivittatus, Tamias rufus, and Tamias umbrinus) that showevidence for
   widespread introgression across species boundaries. Such evidence has
   historically been derived from a handful of markers, typically focused
   on mitochondrial loci, to describe patterns of introgression;
   consequently, the extent of introgression of nuclear genes is less well
   characterized. We conducted a series of phylogenomic and species-tree
   analyses to resolve the phylogeny of six species in this group. In
   addition, we performed several population-genomic analyses to
   characterize nuclear genomes and infer coancestry among individuals.
   Furthermore, we used emerging quartets-based approaches to
   simultaneously infer the species tree (SVDquartets) and identify
   introgression (HyDe). We found that, in spite of rampant introgression
   of mitochondrial genomes between some species pairs (and sometimes
   involving up to three species), there appears to be little to no
   evidence for nuclear introgression. These findings mirror other genomic
   results where complete mitochondrial capture has occurred between
   chipmunk species in the absence of appreciable nuclear gene flow. The
   underlying causes of recurrent massive cytonuclear discordance remain
   unresolved in this group but mitochondrial DNA appears highly misleading
   of population histories as a whole. Collectively, it appears that
   chipmunk species boundaries are largely impermeable to nuclear gene flow
   and that hybridization, while pervasive with respect to mtDNA, has
   likely played a relatively minor role in the evolutionary history of
   this group.},

Abstract = {How can we best learn the history of a protein's evolution? Ideally, a
   model of sequence evolution should capture both the process that
   generates genetic variation and the functional constraints determining
   which changes are fixed. However, in practical terms the most suitable
   approach may simply be the one that combines the convenience of easily
   available input data with the ability to return useful parameter
   estimates. For example, we might be interested in a measure of the
   strength of selection (typically obtained using a codon model) or an
   ancestral structure (obtained using structural modeling based on
   inferred amino acid sequence and side chain configuration).
   But what if data in the relevant state-space are not readily available?
   We show that it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of the outputs
   of interest using an established method for handling missing data.
   Encoding observed characters in an alignment as ambiguous
   representations of characters in a larger state-space allows the
   application of models with the desired features to data that lack the
   resolution that is normally required. This strategy is viable because
   the evolutionary path taken through the observed space contains
   information about states that were likely visited in the ``unseen{''}
   state-space. To illustrate this, we consider two examples with amino
   acid sequences as input. We show that., a parameter describing the
   relative strength of selection on nonsynonymous and synonymous changes,
   can be estimated in an unbiased manner using an adapted version of a
   standard 61-state codon model. Using simulated and empirical data, we
   find that ancestral amino acid side chain configuration can be inferred
   by applying a 55-state empirical model to 20-state amino acid data.
   Where feasible, combining inputs from both ambiguity-coded and fully
   resolved data improves accuracy. Adding structural information to as few
   as 12.5\% of the sequences in an amino acid alignment results in
   remarkable ancestral reconstruction performance compared to a benchmark
   that considers the full rotamer state information. These examples show
   that our methods permit the recovery of evolutionary information from
   sequences where it has previously been inaccessible.},

Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},

Number = {4},
Pages = {249-268},
Abstract = {In this article we investigate diatom assemblages in surface sediments
   of the subarctic Lake Imandra. We examine taxonomic composition and
   ecological structure and describe spatial variations of diatoms over the
   lake area. The diatom flora described here are characterized by
   abundance of planktonic centric species. The habitats of diatoms in the
   different stretches of Lake Imandra reflect local environmental
   conditions and are determined by the type and intensity of the
   anthropogenic impact. Stephanodiscus minutulus, S. alpinus, Aulacoseira
   islandica are the most abundant species in the area of the lake affected
   by industrial effluents and eutrophication, while Pantocsekiella
   comensis is most typical in the background sites of the lake. Diatoms
   taxonomic diversity is high in shallow bays where aquatic vegetation is
   common. Abundance of diatoms in areas affected by anthropogenic
   eutrophication reflects the high intensity of plankton primary
   production. Differences in the ecological structure of the diatom
   assemblages in different parts of Lake Imandra are caused by significant
   hydrochemical heterogeneity of the water quality.},

Abstract = {The South Sandwich Trench located eastward of the Drake Passage in the
   Scotia Sea between Antarctica and South America is one of the least
   studied deep-sea trenches. Its geomorphological formation and present

   to link the geological and geophysical setting of the Scotia Sea with
   individual geomorphological features of the South Sandwich Trench in the
   context of the phenomena of its formation and evolution. Linking several
   datasets (GEBCO, ETOPO1, EGM96, GlobSed and marine free-air gravity
   raster grids, geological vector layers) highlights correlations between
   various factors affecting deep-sea trench formation and development,

Abstract = {In the Central Caucasus region, the intense process of deglaciation is
   identified as caused by cryoconite formation and accumulation. The fine
   earth materials were collected on the surfaces of Skhelda and Garabashi
   glaciers as well as from zonal soils of Baksan Gorge and were studied in
   terms of chemical, particle-size, and micromorphological features.
   Supraglacial sediments are located at the glacial drift area of material
   and, thus, due to transfer of these sediments to the foothill area,
   their fine earth material can affect micromorphological and chemical
   characteristics of adjacent zonal soils. Thin sections of mineral and
   organo-mineral micromonoliths were analyzed by classic
   micromorphological methods. Data obtained showed that the weathering
   rates of cryoconite and soil minerals are different. The cryoconite
   material on the debris-covered Skhelda Glacier originated from local
   massive crystalline rocks and moraines, while for Garabashi Glacier the
   volcanic origin of cryoconite is more typical. Soils of Baksan Gorge are
   characterized by more developed microfabric and porous media, but their
   mineralogical composition is essentially inherited from sediments of
   glacial and periglacial soils. These new data could be useful for
   understanding the process of evolution of the mineral matrix of
   cryoconite to the soil matrix formed at the foot of the mountain.},

Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The chemical composition of recent sediments of the Vygozero Reservoir,
   located in the North of Europe, in the Republic of Karelia (the
   catchment of Arctic Ocean), has been analysed. The level of enrichment
   and depletion of chemical elements, including trace elements, of the
   sediments relative to the Clarke numbers for the continental crust has
   been estimated. Elevated levels of Sb, Pb, Sn, Bi, W, Cu, and other
   elements in the sediments of the Vygozero Reservoir have been revealed
   in comparison with the concentrations of these elements in the
   background layers of the reservoir's sediments and their content in the
   sediments of small lakes of the south of the Republic of Karelia. It has
   been established that the main factor in the accumulation of these
   metals in the lake is the long-distance transport of pollutants from
   local anthropogenic sources located in Karelia, and from sources in
   neighbouring regions. In the vicinity of the town of Segezha, elevated V
   and Ni contents were revealed in the cores of the studied sediments,
   which indicates the impact on the reservoir of emissions from the
   fuel-oil thermal power plant. Based on the calculation of the
   geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and pollution load index (PLI), the level
   of pollution of the Vygozero Reservoir in the study areas was estimated.
   It was found that the northern part of the waterbody, where the
   settlements Segezha and Nadvoitsy and industrial enterprises associated
   with these towns are located, are subject to the greatest load.},

Title = {DEPP: Deep Learning Enables Extending Species Trees using Single Genes},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 29},
Abstract = {Placing new sequences onto reference phylogenies is increasingly used
   for analyzing environmental samples, especially microbiomes. Existing
   placement methods assume that query sequences have evolved under
   specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. For example, they
   assume single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) have evolved under
   the GTR model on a gene tree. Placement, however, often has a more
   ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from
   individual genes without knowing the evolutionary model. Addressing this
   challenging problem requires new directions. Here, we introduce
   Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that
   learns to extend species trees using single genes without prespecified
   models. In simulations and on real data, we show that DEPP can match the
   accuracy of model-based methods without any prior knowledge of the
   model. We also show that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial
   tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further
   demonstrate that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single
   tree, enabling community structure analyses that take advantage of both
   sources of data. {[}Deep learning; gene tree discordance; metagenomics;

Abstract = {Whole genome sequences are beginning to revolutionize our understanding
   of phylogenetic relationships. Yet, even whole genome sequences can fail
   to resolve the evolutionary history of the most rapidly radiating
   lineages, where incomplete lineage sorting, standing genetic variation,
   introgression, and other factors obscure the phylogenetic history of the
   group. To overcome such challenges, one emerging strategy is to
   integrate results across different methods. Most such approaches have
   been implemented on reduced representation genomic data sets, but whole
   genomes should provide the maximum possible evidence approach. Here, we
   test the ability of single nucleotide polymorphisms extracted from whole
   genome resequencing data, implemented in an integrative genomic
   approach, to resolve key nodes in the phylogeny of the mbuna,
   rock-dwelling cichlid fishes of Lake Mala \&\#x175;i, which epitomize
   the phylogenetic intractability that often accompanies explosive lineage
   diversification. This monophyletic radiation has diversified at an
   unparalleled rate into several hundred species in less than 2 million
   years. Using an array of phylogenomic methods, we consistently recovered
   four major clades of mbuna, but a large basal polytomy among them.
   Although introgression between clades apparently contributed to the
   challenge of phylogenetic reconstruction, reduction of the data set to
   nonintrogressed sites still did not help to resolve the basal polytomy.
   On the other hand, relationships among six congeneric species pairs were
   resolved without ambiguity, even in one case where existing data led us
   to predict that resolution would be difficult. We conclude that the
   bursts of diversification at the earliest stages of the mbuna radiation
   may be phylogenetically unresolvable, but other regions of the tree are
   phylogenetically clearly supported. Integration of multiple phylogenomic
   approaches will continue to increase confidence in relationships
   inferred from these and other whole-genome data sets. {[}Incomplete

Title = {Maximum Parsimony Inference of Phylogenetic Networks in the Presence of
   Polyploid Complexes},
Journal = {SYSTEMIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {706-720},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic networks provide a powerful framework for modeling and
   analyzing reticulate evolutionary histories. While polyploidy has been
   shown to be prevalent not only in plants but also in other groups of
   eukaryotic species, most work done thus far on phylogenetic network
   inference assumes diploid hybridization. These inference methods have
   been applied, with varying degrees of success, to data sets with
   polyploid species, even though polyploidy violates the mathematical
   assumptions underlying these methods. Statistical methods were developed
   recently for handling specific types of polyploids and so were parsimony
   methods that could handle polyploidy more generally yet while excluding
   processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. In this article, we
   introduce a new method for inferring most parsimonious phylogenetic
   networks on data that include polyploid species. Taking gene tree
   topologies as input, the method seeks a phylogenetic network that
   minimizes deep coalescences while accounting for polyploidy. We
   demonstrate the performance of the method on both simulated and
   biological data. The inference method as well as a method for evaluating
   evolutionary hypotheses in the form of phylogenetic networks are
   implemented and publicly available in the PhyloNet software package.

Title = {Accuracy in Near-Perfect Virus Phylogenies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {426-438},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees from real-world data often include short edges with
   very few substitutions per site, which can lead to partially resolved
   trees and poor accuracy. Theory indicates that the number of sites
   needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate
   proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge.
   However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges,
   ``accuracy{''} should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits
   (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus,
   accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a
   ``near-perfect{''} parameter space in which trees are large, the tree
   length (the sum of all edge lengths) is small, and rate variation is
   minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than /3; the exact
   value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false
   positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small and often
   well below 5\% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this
   result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to
   maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing,
   we show that measures of split ``support{''} that rely on bootstrap
   resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the
   false positive rates in nearperfect trees. The near-perfect parameter
   space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus
   diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus,
   Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative
   to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {The tea family (Theaceae) has a highly unusual amphi-Pacific disjunct
   distribution: most extant species in the family are restricted to
   subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in East Asia, while a handful of
   species occur exclusively in the subtropical and tropical Americas.
   Here, we used an approach that integrates the rich fossil evidence of
   this group with phylogenies in biogeographic analysis to study the
   processes behind this distribution pattern. We first combined
   genome-skimming sequencing with existing molecular data to build a
   robust species-level phylogeny for c.130 Theaceae species, resolving
   most important unclarified relationships. We then developed an empirical
   Bayesian method to incorporate distribution evidence from fossil
   specimens into historical biogeographic analyses and used this method to
   account for the spatiotemporal history of Theaceae fossils. We compared
   our method with an alternative Bayesian approach and show that it
   provides consistent results while significantly reduces computational
   demands which allows analyses of much larger data sets. Our analyses
   revealed a circumboreal distribution of the family from the early
   Cenozoic to the Miocene and inferred repeated expansions and retractions
   of the modeled distribution in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting that
   the current Theaceae distribution could be the remnant of a larger
   continuous distribution associated with the boreotropical forest that
   has been hypothesized to occupy most of the northern latitudes in the
   early Cenozoic. These results contradict with studies that only
   considered current species distributions and showcase the necessity of
   integrating fossil and molecular data in phylogeny-based parametric
   biogeographic models to improve the reliability of inferred
   biogeographical events.},

Title = {Investigating Morphological Complexes Using Informational Dissonance and
   Bayes Factors: A Case Study in Corbiculate Bees},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {295-306},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is widely recognized that different regions of a genome often have
   different evolutionary histories and that ignoring this variation when
   estimating phylogenies can be misleading. However, the extent to which
   this is also true for morphological data is still largely unknown.
   Discordance among morphological traits might plausibly arise due to
   either variable convergent selection pressures or else phenomena such as
   hemiplasy. Here, we investigate patterns of discordance among 282
   morphological characters, which we scored for 50 bee species
   particularly targeting corbiculate bees, a group that includes the
   well-known eusocial honeybees and bumblebees. As a starting point for
   selecting the most meaningful partitions in the data, we grouped
   characters as morphological modules, highly integrated trait complexes
   that as a result of developmental constraints or coordinated selection
   we expect to share an evolutionary history and trajectory. In order to
   assess conflict and coherence across and within these morphological
   modules, we used recently developed approaches for computing Bayesian
   phylogenetic information allied with model comparisons using Bayes
   factors. We found that despite considerable conflict among morphological
   complexes, accounting for among-character and among-partition rate
   variation with individual gammadistributions, rate multipliers, and
   linked branch lengths can lead to coherent phylogenetic inference using
   morphological data. We suggest that evaluating information content and
   dissonance among partitions is a useful step in estimating phylogenies
   from morphological data, just as it is with molecular data. Furthermore,
   we argue that adopting emerging approaches for investigating dissonance
   in genomic datasets may provide new insights into the integration and
   evolution of anatomical complexes.},

Title = {Phylogeny Estimation Given Sequence Length Heterogeneity},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {268-282},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phylogeny estimation is a major step in many biological studies, and has
   many well known challenges. With the dropping cost of sequencing
   technologies, biologists now have increasingly large datasets available
   for use in phylogeny estimation. Here we address the challenge of
   estimating a tree given large datasets with a combination of full-length
   sequences and fragmentary sequences, which can arise due to a variety of
   reasons, including sample collection, sequencing technologies, and
   analytical pipelines. We compare two basic approaches: (1) computing an
   alignment on the full dataset and then computing a maximum likelihood
   tree on the alignment, or (2) constructing an alignment and tree on the
   full length sequences and then using phylogenetic placement to add the
   remaining sequences (which will generally be fragmentary) into the tree.
   We explore these two approaches on a range of simulated datasets, each
   with 1000 sequences and varying in rates of evolution, and two
   biological datasets. Our study shows some striking performance
   differences between methods, especially when there is substantial
   sequence length heterogeneity and high rates of evolution. We find in
   particular that using UPP to align sequences and RAxML to compute a tree
   on the alignment provides the best accuracy, substantially outperforming
   trees computed using phylogenetic placement methods. We also find that
   FastTree has poor accuracy on alignments containing fragmentary
   sequences. Overall, our study provides insights into the literature
   comparing different methods and pipelines for phylogenetic estimation,
   and suggests directions for future method development.},

Abstract = {Coca is the natural source of cocaine as well as a sacred and medicinal
   plant farmed by South American Amerindians and mestizos. The coca crop
   comprises four closely related varieties classified into two species
   (Amazonian and Huanuco varieties within Erythroxylum coca Lam., and
   Colombian and Trujillo varieties within Erythroxylum novogranatense (D.
   Morris) Hieron.) but our understanding of the domestication and
   evolutionary history of these taxa is nominal. In this study, we use
   genomic data from natural history collections to estimate the geographic
   origins and genetic diversity of this economically and culturally
   important crop in the context of its wild relatives. Our phylogeographic
   analyses clearly demonstrate the four varieties of coca comprise two or
   three exclusive groups nested within the diverse lineages of the
   widespread, wild species Erythroxylum gracilipes; establishing a new and
   robust hypothesis of domestication wherein coca originated two or three
   times from this wild progenitor. The Colombian and Trujillo coca
   varieties are descended from a single, ancient domestication event in
   northwestern South America. Huanuco coca was domesticated more recently,
   possibly in southeastern Peru. Amazonian coca either shares a common
   domesticated ancestor with Huanuco coca, or it was the product of a
   third and most recent independent domestication event in the western
   Amazon basin. This chronology of coca domestication reveals different
   Holocene peoples in South America were able to independently transform
   the same natural resource to serve their needs; in this case, a workaday
   stimulant.},

Title = {Sexual Signals Persist over Deep Time: Ancient Co-option of
   Bioluminescence for Courtship Displays in Cypridinid Ostracods},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {72},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Although the diversity, beauty, and intricacy of sexually selected
   courtship displays command the attention of evolutionists, the longevity
   of these traits in deep time is poorly understood. Population-based
   theory suggests sexual selection could either lower or raise extinction
   risk, resulting in high or low persistence of lineages with sexually
   selected traits. Furthermore, empirical studies that directly estimate
   the longevity of sexually selected traits are uncommon. Sexually
   selected signals-including bioluminescent courtship-originated multiple
   times during evolution, allowing the empirical study of their longevity
   after careful phylogenetic and divergence time analyses. Here, we
   estimate the first transcriptome-based molecular phylogeny and
   divergence times of Cypridinidae. We report extreme longevity of
   bioluminescent courtship, a trait important in mate choice and probably
   under sexual selection. Our relaxed-clock estimates of divergence times
   coupled with stochastic character mapping show luminous courtship
   evolved only once in Cypridinidae-in a Sub-Tribe, we name Luxorina-at
   least 151 millions of years ago from cypridinid ancestors that used
   bioluminescence only in antipredator displays, defining a Tribe we name
   Luminini. This time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of cypridinids will
   serve as a foundation for integrative and comparative studies on the
   biochemistry, molecular evolution, courtship, diversification, and
   ecology of cypridinid bioluminescence. The persistence of luminous
   courtship for hundreds of millions of years suggests that sexual
   selection did not cause a rapid loss of associated traits, and that
   rates of speciation within the group exceeded extinction risk, which may
   contribute to the persistence of a diverse clade of signaling species.

Title = {How to Render Species Comparable Taxonomic Units Through Deep Time: A
   Case Study on Intraspecific Osteological Variability in Extant and
   Extinct Lacertid Lizards},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {4},
Pages = {875-900},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Generally, the species is considered to be the only naturally occurring
   taxon. However, species recognized and defined using different species
   delimitation criteria cannot readily be compared, impacting studies of
   biodiversity through Deep Time. This comparability issue is particularly
   marked when comparing extant with extinct species because the only
   available data for species delimitation in fossils are derived from
   their preserved morphology, which is generally restricted to osteology
   in vertebrates. Here, we quantify intraspecific, intrageneric, and
   intergeneric osteological variability in extant species of lacertid
   lizards using pairwise dissimilarity scores based on a data set of 253
   discrete osteological characters for 99 specimens referred to 24
   species. Variability is always significantly lower intraspecifically
   than between individuals belonging to distinct species of a single
   genus, which is in turn significantly lower than intergeneric
   variability. Average values of intraspecific variability and associated
   standard deviations are consistent (with few exceptions), with an
   overall average within a species of 0.208 changes per character scored.
   Application of the same methods to six extinct lacertid species
   (represented by 40 fossil specimens) revealed that intraspecific
   osteological variability is inconsistent, which can at least in part be
   attributed to different researchers having unequal expectations of the
   skeletal dissimilarity within species units. Such a divergent
   interpretation of intraspecific and interspecific variability among
   extant and extinct species reinforces the incomparability of the species

Abstract = {The charismatic trumpetfishes, goatfishes, dragonets, flying gurnards,
   seahorses, and pipefishes encompass a recently defined yet
   extraordinarily diverse Glade of percomorph fishes-the series
   Syngnatharia. This group is widely distributed in tropical and
   warm-temperate regions, with a great proportion of its extant diversity
   occurring in the Indo-Pacific. Because most syngnatharians feature
   long-range dispersal capabilities, tracing their biogeographic origins
   is challenging. Here, we applied an integrative phylogenomic approach to
   elucidate the evolutionary biogeography of syngnatharians. We built upon
   a recently published phylogenomic study that examined ultraconserved
   elements by adding 62 species (total 169 species) and one family
   (Draconettidae), to cover ca. 25\% of the species diversity and all 10
   families in the group. We inferred a set of time-calibrated trees and
   conducted ancestral range estimations. We also examined the sensitivity
   of these analyses to phylogenetic uncertainty (estimated from multiple
   genomic subsets), area delimitation, and biogeographic models that
   include or exclude the jump-dispersal parameter (j). Of the three
   factors examined, we found that the j parameter has the strongest effect
   in ancestral range estimates, followed by number of areas defined, and
   tree topology and divergence times. After accounting for these
   uncertainties, our results reveal that syngnatharians originated in the
   ancient Tethys Sea ca. 87 Ma (84-94 Ma; Late Cretaceous) and
   subsequently occupied the Indo-Pacific. Throughout syngnatharian
   history, multiple independent lineages colonized the eastern Pacific
   (6-8 times) and the Atlantic (6-14 times) from their center of origin,
   with most events taking place following an east-to-west route prior to
   the closure of the Tethys Seaway ca. 12-18 Ma. Ultimately, our study
   highlights the importance of accounting for different factors generating
   uncertainty in macroevolutionary and biogeographic inferences.},

Abstract = {In a recent paper, Poe et al. assert that scientists should abandon
   clade-based approaches, particularly those using named taxonomic ranks.
   Poe et al. attempt to demonstrate that clade selection can have effects
   on the results of evolutionary analyses but unfortunately fall short of
   making any robust conclusions. Here, we demonstrate that the assertions
   made by Poe et al. have two important flaws: (i) an erroneous view of
   modern phylogenetic comparative methods; and (ii) a lack of statistical
   rigor in their analyses. We repeat Poe et al.'s analysis but using
   appropriate phylogenetic comparative approaches. We demonstrate that
   results remain consistent regardless of the clade definition. We go on
   to discuss the value of taxonomic groupings and how they can provide
   meaningful units of comparison in evolutionary study. Unlike the
   disheartening suggestion to abandon the use of clades, scientists can
   instead continue to use phylogenetic ``corrections{''} that are already
   the standard for most comparative evolutionary analyses.},

Title = {Fossils Do Not Substantially Improve, and May Even Harm, Estimates of

Volume = {72},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The fossilized birth-death (FBD) model is a naturally appealing way of
   directly incorporating fossil information when estimating
   diversification rates. However, an important yet often overlooked
   property of the original FBD derivation is that it distinguishes between
   two types of sampled lineages. Here, we first discuss and demonstrate
   the impact of severely undersampling, and even not including fossils
   that represent samples of lineages that also had sampled descendants. We
   then explore the benefits of including fossils, generally, by
   implementing and then testing two types of FBD models, including one
   that converts a fossil set into stratigraphic ranges, in more complex
   likelihood-based models that assume multiple rate classes across the
   tree. Under various simulation scenarios, including a scenario that
   exists far outside the set of models we evaluated, including fossils
   rarely outperform analyses that exclude them altogether. At best, the
   inclusion of fossils improves precision but does not influence bias.
   Similarly, we found that converting the fossil set to stratigraphic
   ranges, which is one way to remedy the effects of undercounting the
   number of k-type fossils, results in turnover rates and extinction
   fraction estimates that are generally underestimated. Although fossils
   remain essential for understanding diversification through time, in the
   specific case of understanding diversification given an existing,
   largely modern tree, they are not especially beneficial.},

Title = {Impact of Ghost Introgression on Coalescent-Based Species Tree Inference
   and Estimation of Divergence Time},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-49},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {The species studied in any evolutionary investigation generally
   constitute a small proportion of all the species currently existing or
   that have gone extinct. It is therefore likely that introgression, which
   is widespread across the tree of life, involves ``ghosts,{''} that is,
   unsampled, unknown, or extinct lineages. However, the impact of ghost
   introgression on estimations of species trees has rarely been studied
   and is poorly understood. Here, we use mathematical analysis and
   simulations to examine the robustness of species tree methods based on
   the multispecies coalescent model to introgression from a ghost or
   extant lineage. We found that many results originally obtained for
   introgression between extant species can easily be extended to ghost
   introgression, such as the strongly interactive effects of incomplete
   lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression on the occurrence of anomalous
   gene trees. The relative performance of the summary species tree method
   (ASTRAL) and the full-likelihood method ({*}BEAST) varies under
   different introgression scenarios, with the former being more robust to
   gene flow between nonsister species, whereas the latter performing
   better under certain conditions of ghost introgression. When an outgroup
   ghost (defined as a lineage that diverged before the most basal species
   under investigation) acts as the donor of the introgressed genes, the
   time of root divergence among the investigated species generally was
   overestimated, whereas ingroup introgression, as commonly perceived, can
   only lead to underestimation. In many cases of ingroup introgression
   that may or may not involve ghost lineages, the stronger the ILS, the
   higher the accuracy achieved in estimating the time of root divergence,
   although the topology of the species tree is more prone to be biased by
   the effect of introgression. {[}Anomalous gene trees; divergence time;

Abstract = {Using time-reversible Markov models is a very common practice in
   phylogenetic analysis, because although we expect many of their
   assumptions to be violated by empirical data, they provide high
   computational efficiency. However, these models lack the ability to
   infer the root placement of the estimated phylogeny. In order to
   compensate for the inability of these models to root the tree, many
   researchers use external information such as using outgroup taxa or
   additional assumptions such as molecular clocks. In this study, we
   investigate the utility of nonreversible models to root empirical
   phylogenies and introduce a new bootstrap measure, the rootstrap, which
   provides information on the statistical support for any given root

Title = {Phylogenomic Species Delimitation Dramatically Reduces Species Diversity
   in an Antarctic Adaptive Radiation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Application of genetic data to species delimitation often builds
   confidence in delimitations previously hypothesized using morphological,
   ecological, and geographic data and frequently yields recognition of
   previously undescribed cryptic diversity. However, a recent critique of
   genomic data-based species delimitation approaches is that they have the
   potential to conflate population structure with species diversity,
   resulting in taxonomic oversplitting. The need for an integrative
   approach to species delimitation, in which molecular, morphological,
   ecological, and geographic lines of evidence are evaluated together, is
   becoming increasingly apparent. Here, we integrate phylogenetic,
   population genetic, and coalescent analyses of genome-wide sequence data
   with investigation of variation in multiple morphological traits to
   delimit species within the Antarctic barbeled plunderfishes
   (Artedidraconidae: Pogonophryne). Pogonophryne currently comprises 29
   valid species, most of which are distinguished solely by variation in
   the ornamentation of the mental barbel that projects from the lower jaw,
   a structure previously shown to vary widely within a single species.
   However, our genomic and phenotypic analyses result in a dramatic
   reduction in the number of distinct species recognized within the clade,
   providing evidence to support the recognition of no more than six
   species. We propose to synonymize 24 of the currently recognized species
   with five species of Pogonophryne. We find genomic and phenotypic
   evidence for a new species of Pogonophryne from specimens collected in
   the Ross Sea. Our findings represent a rare example in which the
   application of molecular data provides evidence of taxonomic
   oversplitting on the basis of morphology, clearly demonstrating the
   utility of an integrative species delimitation framework.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Dispersal-Driven Speciation and Divergence
   with Gene Flow in Lesser Sunda Flying Lizards (Genus Draco)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {71},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Lesser Sunda Archipelago offers exceptional potential as a model
   system for studying the dynamics of dispersal-driven diversification.
   The geographic proximity of the islands suggests the possibility for
   successful dispersal, but this is countered by the permanence of the
   marine barriers and extreme intervening currents that are expected to
   hinder gene flow. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses of
   flying lizards (genus Draco) using single mitochondrial genes, complete
   mitochondrial genomes, and exome-capture data sets identified 9-11
   deeply divergent lineages including single-island endemics, lineages
   that span multiple islands, and parapatrically distributed nonsister
   lineages on the larger islands. Population clustering and PCA confirmed
   these genetic boundaries with isolation-by-distance playing a role in
   some islands or island sets. While gdi estimates place most candidate
   species comparisons in the ambiguous zone, migration estimates suggest 9
   or 10 species exist with nuclear introgression detected across some
   intra-island contact zones. Initial entry of Draco into the archipelago
   occurred at 5.5-7.5 Ma, with most inter-island colonization events
   having occurred between 1-3 Ma. Biogeographical model testing favors
   scenarios integrating geographic distance and historical island
   connectivity, including an initial stepping-stone dispersal process from
   the Greater Sunda Shelf through the Sunda Arc as far eastward as Lembata
   Island. However, rather than reaching the adjacent island of Pantar by
   dispersing over the 15-km wide Alor Strait, Draco ultimately reached
   Pantar (and much of the rest of the archipelago) by way of a circuitous
   route involving at least five overwater dispersal events. These findings
   suggest that historical geological and oceanographic conditions heavily
   influenced dispersal pathways and gene flow, which in turn drove species
   formation and shaped species boundaries.},

Title = {A Total-Evidence Dated Phylogeny of Echinoidea Combining Phylogenomic
   and Paleontological Data},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-439},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phylogenomic and paleontological data constitute complementary resources
   for unraveling the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of
   lineages, yet few studies have attempted to fully integrate them.
   Several unique properties of echinoids (sea urchins) make them
   especially useful for such synthesizing approaches, including a
   remarkable fossil record that can be incorporated into explicit
   phylogenetic hypotheses. We revisit the phylogeny of crown group
   Echinoidea using a total-evidence dating approach that combines the
   largest phylogenomic data set for the clade, a large-scale morphological
   matrix with a dense fossil sampling, and a novel compendium of tip and
   node age constraints. To this end, we develop a novel method for
   subsampling phylogenomic data sets that selects loci with high
   phylogenetic signal, low systematic biases, and enhanced clock-like
   behavior. Our results demonstrate that combining different data sources
   increases topological accuracy and helps resolve conflicts between
   molecular and morphological data. Notably, we present a new hypothesis
   for the origin of sand dollars, and restructure the relationships
   between stem and crown echinoids in a way that implies a long stretch of
   undiscovered evolutionary history of the crown group in the late
   Paleozoic. Our efforts help bridge the gap between phylogenomics and
   phylogenetic paleontology, providing a model example of the benefits of
   combining the two.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to produce
   genome-scale data sets was expected to settle some long-standing
   controversies across the Tree of Life, particularly in areas where short
   branches occur at deep timescales. Instead, these data sets have often
   yielded many well-supported but conflicting topologies, and highly
   variable genetree distributions. A variety of branch-support metrics
   beyond the nonparametric bootstrap are now available to assess how
   robust a phylogenetic hypothesis may be, as well as new methods to
   quantify gene-tree discordance. We applied multiple branch-support
   metrics to a study of an ancient group of marine fishes (Teleostei:
   Pelagiaria) whose interfamilial relationships have proven difficult to
   resolve due to a rapid accumulation of lineages very early in its
   history. We analyzed hundreds of loci including published ultraconserved
   elements and newly generated exonic data along with their flanking
   regions to represent all 16 extant families for more than 150 out of 284
   valid species in the group. Branch support was typically lower at inter-
   than intra-familial relationships regardless of the type of marker used.
   Several nodes that were highly supported with bootstrap had a very low
   site and gene-tree concordance, revealing underlying conflict. Despite
   this conflict, we were able to identify four consistent interfamilial
   clades, each comprised of two or three families. Combining exons with
   their flanking regions also produced increased branch lengths at the
   deep branches of the pelagiarian tree. Our results demonstrate the
   limitations of employing current metrics of branch support and
   species-tree estimation when assessing the confidence of ancient
   evolutionary radiations and emphasize the necessity to embrace
   alternative measurements to explore phylogenetic uncertainty and
   discordance in phylogenomic data sets.},

Title = {Delayed Adaptive Radiation among New Zealand Stream Fishes: Joint
   Estimation of Divergence Time and Trait Evolution in a Newly Delineated
   Island Species Flock},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Adaptive radiations are generally thought to occur soon after a lineage
   invades a region offering high levels of ecological opportunity.
   However, few adaptive radiations beyond a handful of exceptional
   examples are known, so a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics
   is still lacking. Here, we present a novel case of an island species
   flock of freshwater fishes with a radically different tempo of adaptive
   history than that found in many popular evolutionary model systems.
   Using a phylogenomic data set combined with simultaneous Bayesian
   estimation of divergence times and trait-based speciation and extinction
   models, we show that the New Zealand Gobiomorphus gudgeons comprise a
   monophyletic assemblage, but surprisingly, the radiation did not fully
   occupy freshwater habitats and explosively speciate until more than 10
   myr after the lineage invaded the islands. This shift in speciation rate
   was not accompanied by an acceleration in the rate of morphological
   evolution in the freshwater crown clade relative to the other species,
   but is correlated with a reduction in head pores and scales as well as
   an increase in egg size. Our results challenge the notion that clades
   always rapidly exploit ecological opportunities in the absence of
   competing lineages. Instead, we demonstrate that adaptive radiation can
   experience a slow start before undergoing accelerated diversification
   and that lineage and phenotypic diversification may be uncoupled in
   young radiations.},

Title = {The Cumulative Indel Model: Fast and Accurate Statistical Evolutionary
   Alignment},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Pages = {236-257},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sequence alignment is essential for phylogenetic and molecular evolution
   inference, as well as in many other areas of bioinformatics and
   evolutionary biology. Inaccurate alignments can lead to severe biases in
   most downstream statistical analyses. Statistical alignment based on
   probabilistic models of sequence evolution addresses these issues by
   replacing heuristic score functions with evolutionary model-based
   probabilities. However, score-based aligners and fixed-alignment
   phylogenetic approaches are still more prevalent than methods based on
   evolutionary indel models, mostly due to computational convenience.
   Here, I present new techniques for improving the accuracy and speed of
   statistical evolutionary alignment. The ``cumulative indel model{''}
   approximates realistic evolutionary indel dynamics using differential
   equations. ``Adaptive banding{''} reduces the computational demand of
   most alignment algorithms without requiring prior knowledge of
   divergence levels or pseudo-optimal alignments. Using simulations, I
   show that these methods lead to fast and accurate pairwise alignment
   inference. Also, I showthat it is possible, with these methods, to align
   and infer evolutionary parameters from a single long synteny block
   (similar to 530 kbp) between the human and chimp genomes. The cumulative
   indel model and adaptive banding can therefore improve the performance
   of alignment and phylogenetic methods.},

Abstract = {Soil has become a major hotspot of biodiversity studies, yet the pattern
   and timing of the evolution of soil organisms are poorly known because
   of the scarcity of paleontological data. To overcome this limitation, we
   conducted a genome-based macroevolutionary study of an ancient,
   diversified, and widespread lineage of soil fauna, the elongate-bodied
   springtails (class Collembola, order Entomobryomorpha). To build the
   first robust backbone phylogeny of this previously refractory group, we
   sampled representatives of major higher taxa (6 out of 8 families, 11
   out of 16 subfamilies) of the order with an emphasis on the most
   problematic superfamily Tomoceroidea, applied whole-genome sequencing
   methods, and compared the performance of different combinations of data
   sets (universal single-copy orthologs {[}USCO] vs. ultraconserved
   elements]) and modeling schemes. The fossil-calibrated timetree was used
   to reconstruct the evolution of body size, sensory organs, and
   pigmentation to establish a time frame of the ecomorphological
   divergences. The resultant trees based on different analyses were
   congruent in most nodes. Several discordant nodes were carefully
   evaluated by considering method fitness, morphological information, and
   topology test. The evaluation favored the well-resolved topology from
   analyses using USCO amino acid matrices and complex site-heterogeneous
   models (CAT+GTR and LG-PPMSF (C60)). The preferred topology supports the
   monophyletic superfamily Tomoceroidea as an early-diverging lineage and
   a sister relationship between Entomobryoidea and Isotomoidea. The family
   Tomoceridae was recovered as monophyletic, whereas Oncopoduridae was
   recovered as paraphyletic, with Harlomillsia as a sister to Tomoceridae
   and hence deserving a separate family status as Harlomillsiidae Yu and
   Zhang fam. n. Ancestral Entomobryomorpha were reconstructed as
   surface-living, supporting independent origins of soil-living groups
   across the Paleozoic-Mesozoic, and highlighting the ancient evolutionary
   interaction between aboveground and belowground fauna.},

Abstract = {Morphology remains a primary source of phylogenetic information for many
   groups of organisms, and the only one for most fossil taxa. Organismal
   anatomy is not a collection of randomly assembled and independent
   ``parts{''}, but instead a set of dependent and hierarchically nested
   entities resulting from ontogeny and phylogeny. How do we make sense of
   these dependent and at times redundant characters? One promising
   approach is using ontologies-structured controlled vocabularies that
   summarize knowledge about different properties of anatomical entities,
   including developmental and structural dependencies. Here, we assess
   whether evolutionary patterns can explain the proximity of
   ontology-annotated characters within an ontology. To do so, we measure
   phylogenetic information across characters and evaluate if it matches
   the hierarchical structure given by ontological knowledge-in much the
   same way as across-species diversity structure is given by phylogeny. We
   implement an approach to evaluate the Bayesian phylogenetic information
   (BPI) content and phylogenetic dissonance among ontology-annotated
   anatomical data subsets. We applied this to data sets representing two
   disparate animal groups: bees (Hexapoda: Hymenoptera: Apoidea, 209
   chars) and characiform fishes (Actinopterygii: Ostariophysi:
   Characiformes, 463 chars). For bees, we find that BPI is not
   substantially explained by anatomy since dissonance is often high among
   morphologically related anatomical entities. For fishes, we find
   substantial information for two clusters of anatomical entities
   instantiating concepts from the jaws and branchial arch bones, but
   among-subset information decreases and dissonance increases
   substantially moving to higher-level subsets in the ontology. We further
   applied our approach to address particular evolutionary hypotheses with
   an example of morphological evolution in miniature fishes. While we show
   that phylogenetic information does match ontology structure for some
   anatomical entities, additional relationships and processes, such as
   convergence, likely play a substantial role in explaining BPI and
   dissonance, and merit future investigation. Our work demonstrates how
   complex morphological data sets can be interrogated with ontologies by
   allowing one to access how information is spread hierarchically across
   anatomical concepts, how congruent this information is, and what sorts
   of processes may play a role in explaining it: phylogeny, development,
   or convergence. {[}Apidae; Bayesian phylogenetic information;

Title = {Bayesian Inference of Clonal Expansions in a Dated Phylogeny},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Microbial population genetics models often assume that all lineages are
   constrained by the same population size dynamics over time. However,
   many neutral and selective events can invalidate this assumption and can
   contribute to the clonal expansion of a specific lineage relative to the
   rest of the population. Such differential phylodynamic properties
   between lineages result in asymmetries and imbalances in phylogenetic
   trees that are sometimes described informally but which are difficult to
   analyze formally. To this end, we developed a model of how clonal
   expansions occur and affect the branching patterns of a phylogeny. We
   show how the parameters of this model can be inferred from a given dated
   phylogeny using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to assess the
   probability that one or more clonal expansion events occurred. For each
   putative clonal expansion event, we estimate its date of emergence and
   subsequent phylodynamic trajectory, including its long-term evolutionary
   potential which is important to determine how much effort should be
   placed on specific control measures. We demonstrate the applicability of
   our methodology on simulated and real data sets. Inference under our
   clonal expansion model can reveal important features in the evolution
   and epidemiology of infectious disease pathogens. {[}Clonal expansion;

Abstract = {Species tree inference from gene family trees is a significant problem
   in computational biology. However, gene tree heterogeneity, which can be
   caused by several factors including gene duplication and loss, makes the
   estimation of species trees very challenging. While there have been
   several species tree estimation methods introduced in recent years to
   specifically address gene tree heterogeneity due to gene duplication and
   loss (such as DupTree, FastMulRFS, ASTRAL-Pro, and SpeciesRax), many
   incur high cost in terms of both running time and memory. We introduce a
   new approach, DISCO, that decomposes the multi-copy gene family trees
   into many single copy trees, which allows for methods previously
   designed for species tree inference in a single copy gene tree context
   to be used. We prove that using DISCO with ASTRAL (i.e., ASTRAL-DISCO)
   is statistically consistent under the GDL model, provided that
   ASTRAL-Pro correctly roots and tags each gene family tree. We evaluate
   DISCO paired with different methods for estimating species trees from
   single copy genes (e.g., ASTRAL, ASTRID, and IQ-TREE) under a wide range
   of model conditions, and establish that high accuracy can be obtained
   even when ASTRAL-Pro is not able to correctly roots and tags the gene
   family trees. We also compare results using MI, an alternative
   decomposition strategy from Yang Y. and Smith S.A. (2014), and find that
   DISCO provides better accuracy, most likely as a result of covering more
   of the gene family tree leafset in the output decomposition.

Volume = {71},

Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {In molecular phylogenetics, it is typically assumed that the
   evolutionary process for DNA can be approximated by independent and
   identically distributed Markovian processes at the variable sites and
   that these processes diverge over the edges of a rooted bifurcating
   tree. Sometimes the nucleotides are transformed from a 4-state alphabet
   to a 3- or 2-state alphabet by a procedure that is called recoding,
   lumping, or grouping of states. Here, we introduce a likelihood-ratio
   test for lumpability for DNA that has diverged under different Markovian
   conditions, which assesses the assumption that the Markovian property of
   the evolutionary process over each edge is retained after recoding of
   the nucleotides. The test is derived and validated numerically on
   simulated data. To demonstrate the insights that can be gained by using
   the test, we assessed two published data sets, one of mitochondrial DNA
   from a phylogenetic study of the ratites and the other of nuclear DNA
   from a phylogenetic study of yeast. Our analysis of these data sets
   revealed that recoding of the DNA eliminated some of the compositional
   heterogeneity detected over the sequences. However, the Markovian
   property of the original evolutionary process was not retained by the
   recoding, leading to some significant distortions of edge lengths in
   reconstructed trees.{[}Evolutionary processes; likelihood-ratio test;

   coalescent (MSC) and the fossilized birth-death (FBD) processes. Using
   this model, we reconstruct the phylogeny representing all extant and
   many fossil Caninae, recovering both the relative and absolute time of
   speciation events. We quantify known inaccuracy issues with divergence
   time estimates using the popular strategy of concatenating molecular
   alignments and show that the FBD-MSC solves them. Our new integrative
   method and empirical results advance the paradigm and practice of

Title = {Is Sexual Conflict a Driver of Speciation? A Case Study With a Tribe of
   Brush-footed Butterflies},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {413-420},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms governing the uneven
   distribution of species richness across the tree of life is a great
   challenge in biology. Scientists have long argued that sexual conflict
   is a key driver of speciation. This hypothesis, however, has been highly
   debated in light of empirical evidence. Recent advances in the study of
   macroevolution make it possible to test this hypothesis with more data
   and increased accuracy. In the present study, we use phylogenomics
   combined with four different diversification rate analytical approaches
   to test whether sexual conflict is a driver of speciation in
   brush-footed butterflies of the tribe Acraeini. The presence of a
   sphragis, an external mating plug found in most species among Acraeini,
   was used as a proxy for sexual conflict. Diversification analyses
   statistically rejected the hypothesis that sexual conflict is associated
   with shifts in diversification rates in Acraeini. This result contrasts
   with earlier studies and suggests that the underlying mechanisms driving
   diversification are more complex than previously considered. In the case
   of butterflies, natural history traits acting in concert with abiotic
   factors possibly play a stronger role in triggering speciation than does
   sexual conflict.},

Title = {The Importance of Contact Zones for Distinguishing Interspecific from
   Intraspecific Geographic Variation},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-371},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {With limited sampling, geographic variation within a single species can
   be difficult to distinguish from interspecific variation, confounding
   our ability to draw accurate species boundaries. We argue that thorough
   sampling and analysis of contact zones between putative taxa can
   determine if assortative mating or selection against hybrids exists
   (supporting the presence of two distinct species), or alternatively if
   mating is random among genotypes and admixture among adjacent
   populations is gradual and continuous (supporting geographic variation
   within a single species). Here, we test two alternative hypotheses for
   two pairs of named taxa at contact zones within the American milksnake
   (Lampropeltis triangulum) complex. A prior morphological analysis found
   areas of gradual intergradation among named taxa, and concluded that the
   taxa represented geographical races of a single polytypic species. In
   contrast, a subsequent analysis of gene sequence data, but with limited
   sampling near the contact zones, hypothesized distinct boundaries
   between species at the contact zones. At the contact zone between
   proposed species L. triangulum and Lampropeltis gentilis, we examined a
   similar to 700 km-wide transect across the states of Kansas and
   Missouri, with thorough sampling and reduced-representation
   genomic-level sequencing, to test the two opposing taxonomic hypotheses.
   Our transect analyses included examinations of population structure,
   fixed differences, dine-fitting, and an admixture index analysis. These
   analyses all supported a gradual and continuous geographic dine across a
   broad intergrade zone between two geographic forms of L. Iriangulum,
   thus providing strong support for a single species in this region (and
   no support for the recognition of L. gentilis as a distinct species). At
   a second contact zone between proposed species L. triangulum and
   Lampropeltis elapsoides (but variously treated as species or subspecies
   by different researchers) in Kentucky and Tennessee, we re-evaluated
   morphological data. In this case, the contact zone analysis indicated
   sympatry and reproductive isolation of the two taxa, and thus strongly
   supported L. triangulum and L. elapsoides as distinct species. We
   conclude that detailed studies of contact zones, based on either genetic
   or morphological data, are essential for distinguishing intraspecific
   from interspecific variation in the case of widely and continuously
   distributed taxa.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {1271-1280},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Gastropods have survived several mass extinctions during their
   evolutionary history resulting in extraordinary diversity in morphology,
   ecology, and developmental modes, which complicate the reconstruction of
   a robust phylogeny. Currently, gastropods are divided into six
   subclasses: Caenogastropoda, Heterobranchia, Neomphaliones,
   Neritimorpha, Patellogastropoda, and Vetigastropoda. Phylogenetic
   relationships among these taxa historically lack consensus, despite
   numerous efforts using morphological and molecular information. We
   generated sequence data for transcriptomes derived from 12 taxa
   belonging to clades with little or no prior representation in previous
   studies in order to infer the deeper cladogenetic events within
   Gastropoda and, for the first time, infer the position of the deep-sea
   Neomphaliones using a phylogenomic approach. We explored the impact of
   missing data, homoplasy, and compositional heterogeneity on the inferred
   phylogenetic hypotheses. We recovered a highly supported backbone for
   gastropod relationships that is congruent with morphological and
   mitogenomic evidence, in which Patellogastropoda, true limpets, are the
   sister lineage to all other gastropods (Orthogastropoda) which are
   divided into two main clades 1) Vetigastropoda s.l. (including
   Pleurotomariida + Neomphaliones) and 2) Neritimorpha + (Caenogastropoda
   + Heterobranchia). As such, our results support the recognition of five
   subclasses (or infraclasses) in Gastropoda: Patellogastropoda,
   Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda, and Heterobranchia.

Title = {Rapid Parallel Morphological and Mechanical Diversification of South

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-133},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Explosive bouts of diversification are one of the most conspicuous
   features of the tree of life. When such bursts are repeated in similar
   environments, it suggests some degree of predictability in the
   evolutionary process. We assess parallel adaptive radiation of South
   American pike cichlids (Crenicichla) using phylogenomics and
   phylogenetic comparative methods. We find that species flocks in the
   Uruguay and Iguazu River basins rapidly diversified into the same set of
   ecomorphs that reflect feeding ecology. Both adaptive radiations involve
   expansion of functional morphology, resulting in unique jaw phenotypes.
   Yet, form and function were decoupled such that most ecomorphs share
   similar mechanical properties of the jaws (i.e., jaw motion during a
   feeding strike). Prey mobility explained 6- to 9-fold differences in the
   rate of morphological evolution but had no effect on the rate of
   mechanical evolution. We find no evidence of gene flow between species
   flocks or with surrounding coastal lineages that may explain their rapid
   diversification. When compared with cichlids of the East African Great
   Lakes and other prominent adaptive radiations, pike cichlids share many
   themes, including the rapid expansion of phenotypic diversity,
   specialization along the benthic-to-pelagic habitat and soft-to-hard
   prey axes, and the evolution of conspicuous functional innovations. Yet,
   decoupled evolution of form and function and the absence of
   hybridization as a catalyzing force are departures from patterns
   observed in other adaptive radiations. Many-to-one mapping of morphology
   to mechanical properties is a mechanism by which pike cichlids attain a
   diversity of feeding ecologies while avoiding exacerbating underlying
   mechanical trade-offs. {[}Adaptive radiation; ecological opportunity;

Title = {nQMaker: Estimating Time Nonreversible Amino Acid Substitution Models},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Amino acid substitution models are a key component in phylogenetic
   analyses of protein sequences. All commonly used amino acid models
   available to date are time-reversible, an assumption designed for
   computational convenience but not for biological reality. Another
   significant downside to time-reversible models is that they do not allow
   inference of rooted trees without outgroups. In this article, we
   introduce a maximum likelihood approach nQMaker, an extension of the
   recently published QMaker method, that allows the estimation of time
   nonreversible amino acid substitution models and rooted phylogenetic
   trees from a set of protein sequence alignments. We show that the
   nonreversible models estimated with nQMaker are a much better fit to
   empirical alignments than pre-existing reversible models, across a wide
   range of data sets including mammals, birds, plants, fungi, and other
   taxa, and that the improvements in model fit scale with the size of the
   data set. Notably, for the recently published plant and bird trees,
   these nonreversible models correctly recovered the commonly estimated
   root placements with very high-statistical support without the need to
   use an outgroup. We provide nQMaker as an easy-to-use feature in the
   IQ-TREE software (http://www.iqtree.org), allowing users to estimate
   nonreversible models and rooted phylogenies from their own protein data
   sets.},

Title = {The Frequency and Topology of Pseudoorthologs},

Abstract = {Phylogenetics has long relied on the use of orthologs, or genes related
   through speciation events, to infer species relationships. However,
   identifying orthologs is difficult because gene duplication can obscure
   relationships among genes. Researchers have been particularly concerned
   with the insidious effects of pseudoorthologs-duplicated genes that are
   mistaken for orthologs because they are present in a single copy in each
   sampled species. Because gene tree topologies of pseudoorthologs may
   differ from the species tree topology, they have often been invoked as
   the cause of counterintuitive results in phylogenetics. Despite these
   perceived problems, no previous work has calculated the probabilities of
   pseudoortholog topologies or has been able to circumscribe the regions
   of parameter space in which pseudoorthologs are most likely to occur.
   Here, we introduce a model for calculating the probabilities and branch
   lengths of orthologs and pseudoorthologs, including concordant and
   discordant pseudoortholog topologies, on a rooted three-taxon species
   tree. We show that the probability of orthologs is high relative to the
   probability of pseudoorthologs across reasonable regions of parameter
   space. Furthermore, the probabilities of the two discordant topologies
   are equal and never exceed that of the concordant topology, generally
   being much lower. We describe the species tree topologies most prone to
   generating pseudoorthologs, finding that they are likely to present
   problems to phylogenetic inference irrespective of the presence of
   pseudoorthologs. Overall, our results suggest that pseudoorthologs are
   unlikely to mislead inferences of species relationships under the
   biological scenarios considered here.{[}Birth-death model; orthologs;

Title = {Phylogenomics of Bony-Tongue Fishes (Osteoglossomorpha) Shed Light on
   the Craniofacial Evolution and Biogeography of the Weakly Electric Clade
   (Mormyridae)},

Pages = {1032-1044},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Bonytongues (Osteoglossomorpha) constitute an ancient clade of teleost
   fishes distributed in freshwater habitats throughout the world. The
   group includes well-known species such as arowanas, featherbacks,
   pirarucus, and the weakly electric fishes in the family Mormyridae.
   Their disjunct distribution, extreme morphologies, and electrolocating
   capabilities (Gymnarchidae and Mormyridae) have attracted much
   scientific interest, but a comprehensive phylogenetic framework for
   comparative analysis is missing, especially for the species-rich family
   Mormyridae. Of particular interest are disparate craniofacial
   morphologies among mormyrids which might constitute an exceptional model
   system to study convergent evolution. We present a phylogenomic analysis
   based on 546 exons of 179 species (out of 260), 28 out of 29 genera, and
   all six families of extant bonytongues. Based on a recent reassessment
   of the fossil record of osteoglossomorphs, we inferred dates of
   divergence among transcontinental clades and the major groups. The
   estimated ages of divergence among extant taxa (e.g., Osteoglossomorpha,
   Osteoglossiformes, and Mormyroidea) are older than previous reports, but
   most of the divergence dates obtained for clades on separate continents
   are too young to be explained by simple vicariance hypotheses.
   Biogeographic analysis of mormyrids indicates that their high species
   diversity in the Congo Basin is a consequence of range reductions of
   previously widespread ancestors and that the highest diversity of
   craniofacial morphologies among mormyrids originated in this basin.
   Special emphasis on a taxon-rich representation for mormyrids revealed
   pervasive misalignment between our phylogenomic results and mormyrid
   taxonomy due to repeated instances of convergence for extreme
   craniofacial morphologies. Estimation of ancestral phenotypes revealed
   contingent evolution of snout elongation and unique projections from the
   lower jaw to form the distinctive Schnauzenorgan. Synthesis of
   comparative analyses suggests that the remarkable craniofacial
   morphologies of mormyrids evolved convergently due to niche
   partitioning, likely enabled by interactions between their exclusive
   morphological and electrosensory adaptations. {[}Africa; ancestral state

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Gonyleptoidea, largely restricted to the Neotropics, constitutes the
   most diverse superfamily of Opiliones and includes the largest and
   flashiest representatives of this arachnid order. However, the
   relationships among its main lineages (families and subfamilies) and the
   timing of their origin are not sufficiently understood to explain how
   this tropical Glade has been able to colonize the temperate zone. Here,
   we used transcriptomics and divergence time dating to investigate the
   phylogeny of Gonyleptoidea. Our results support the monophyly of
   Gonyleptoidea and all of its families with more than one species
   represented. Resolution within Gonyleptidae s.s. is achieved for many
   clades, but some subfamilies are not monophyletic (Gonyleptinae,
   Mitobatinae, and Pachylinae), requiring taxonomic revision. Our data
   show evidence for one colonization of today's temperate zone early in
   the history of Gonyleptidae, during the Paleogene, at a time when the
   Neotropical area extended poleward into regions now considered
   temperate. This provides a possible mechanism for the colonization of
   the extratropics by a tropical group following the Paleocene-Eocene
   Thermal Maximum, explaining how latitudinal diversity gradients can be
   established. Taxonomic acts: Ampycidae Kury 2003 is newly ranked as
   family; Neosadocus Mello-Leitao is transferred to Progonyleptoidellinae
   (new subfamilial assignment).},

Abstract = {The phylogenetic bootstrap is the most commonly used method for
   assessing statistical confidence in estimated phylogenies by
   non-Bayesian methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood
   (ML). It is observed that bootstrap support tends to be high in large
   genomic data sets whether or not the inferred trees and clades are
   correct. Here, we study the asymptotic behavior of bootstrap support for
   the ML tree in large data sets when the competing phylogenetic trees are
   equally right or equally wrong. We consider phylogenetic reconstruction
   as a problem of statistical model selection when the compared models are
   nonnested and misspecified. The bootstrap is found to have qualitatively
   different dynamics from Bayesian inference and does not exhibit the
   polarized behavior of posterior model probabilities, consistent with the
   empirical observation that the bootstrap is more conservative than
   Bayesian probabilities. Nevertheless, bootstrap support similarly shows
   fluctuations among large data sets, with no convergence to a point
   value, when the compared models are equally right or equally wrong.
   Thus, in large data sets strong support for wrong trees or models is
   likely to occur. Our analysis provides a partial explanation for the
   high bootstrap support values for incorrect clades observed in empirical
   data analysis.},

Title = {Novel Tests of the Key Innovation Hypothesis: Adhesive Toepads in
   Arboreal Lizards},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {139-152},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolution of key innovations-unique features that enable a lineage
   to interact with the environment in a novel way-may drive broad patterns
   of adaptive diversity. However, traditional tests of the key innovation
   hypothesis, those which attempt to identify the evolutionary effect of a
   purported key innovation by comparing patterns of diversity between
   lineages with and without the key trait, have been challenged on both
   conceptual and statistical grounds. Here, we explore alternative,
   untested hypotheses of the key innovation framework. In lizards,
   adhesive toepad structures increase grip strength on vertical and smooth
   surfaces such as tree trunks and leaves and have independently evolved
   multiple times. As such, toepads have been posited as a key innovation
   for the evolution of arboreality. Leveraging a habitat use data set
   applied to a global phylogeny of 2692 lizard species, we estimated
   multiple origins of toepads in three major clades and more than 100
   origins of arboreality widely across the phylogeny. Our results suggest
   that toepads arise adaptively in arboreal lineages and are subsequently
   rarely lost while maintaining arboreal ecologies. Padless lineages
   transition away from arboreality at a higher rate than those with
   toepads, and high rates of invasion of arboreal niches by nonarboreal
   padbearing lineages provide further evidence that toepads may be a key
   to unlocking evolutionary access to the arboreal zone. Our results and
   analytical framework provide novel insights to understand and evaluate
   the ecological and evolutionary consequences of key innovations.},

Abstract = {Hybridization may often be an important source of adaptive variation,
   but the extent and long-term impacts of introgression have seldom been
   evaluated in the phylogenetic context of a radiation. Hares (Lepus)
   represent a widespread mammalian radiation of 32 extant species
   characterized by striking ecological adaptations and recurrent
   admixture. To understand the relevance of introgressive hybridization
   during the diversification of Lepus, we analyzed whole exome sequences
   (61.7 Mb) from 15 species of hares (1-4 individuals per species),
   spanning the global distribution of the genus, and two outgroups. We
   used a coalescent framework to infer species relationships and
   divergence times, despite extensive genealogical discordance. We found
   high levels of allele sharing among species and show that this reflects
   extensive incomplete lineage sorting and temporally layered
   hybridization. Our results revealed recurrent introgression at all
   stages along the Lepus radiation, including recent gene flow between
   extant species since the last glacial maximum but also pervasive ancient
   introgression occurring since near the origin of the hare lineages. We
   show that ancient hybridization between northern hemisphere species has
   resulted in shared variation of potential adaptive relevance to highly
   seasonal environments, including genes involved in circadian rhythm
   regulation, pigmentation, and thermoregulation. Our results illustrate
   how the genetic legacy of ancestral hybridization may persist across a
   radiation, leaving a long-lasting signature of shared genetic variation
   that may contribute to adaptation.},

Title = {Genomic Characterization and Curation of UCEs Improves Species Tree
   Reconstruction},

Abstract = {Ultraconserved genomic elements (UCEs) are generally treated as
   independent loci in phylogenetic analyses. The identification pipeline
   for UCE probes does not require prior knowledge of genetic identity,
   only selecting loci that are highly conserved, single copy, without
   repeats, and of a particular length. Here, we characterized UCEs from 11
   phylogenomic studies across the animal tree of life, from birds to
   marine invertebrates. We found that within vertebrate lineages, UCEs are
   mostly intronic and intergenic, while in invertebrates, the majority are
   in exons. We then curated four different sets of UCE markers by genomic
   category from five different studies including: birds, mammals, fish,
   Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees), and Coleoptera (beetles). Of genes
   captured by UCEs, we find that many are represented by two or more UCEs,
   corresponding to nonoverlapping segments of a single gene. We considered
   these UCEs to be nonindependent, merged all UCEs that belonged to a
   particular gene, constructed gene and species trees, and then evaluated
   the subsequent effect of merging cogenic UCEs on gene and species tree
   reconstruction. Average bootstrap support for merged UCE gene trees was
   significantly improved across all data sets apparently driven by the
   increase in loci length. Additionally, we conducted simulations and
   found that gene trees generated from merged UCEswere more accurate than
   those generated by unmerged UCEs. As loci length improves gene tree
   accuracy, this modest degree of UCE characterization and curation
   impacts downstream analyses and demonstrates the advantages of
   incorporating basic genomic characterizations into phylogenomic
   analyses.},

Title = {Temperature-Dependent Evolutionary Speed Shapes the Evolution of
   Biodiversity Patterns Across Tetrapod Radiations},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {2},
Pages = {341-356},

Abstract = {Biodiversity varies predictably with environmental energy around the
   globe, but the underlaying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
   The evolutionary speed hypothesis predicts that environmental kinetic
   energy shapes variation in speciation rates through temperature- or life
   history-dependent rates of evolution. To test whether variation in
   evolutionary speed can explain the relationship between energy and
   biodiversity in birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, we simulated
   diversification over 65 myr of geological and climatic change with a
   spatially explicit eco-evolutionary simulation model. We modeled four
   distinct evolutionary scenarios in which speciation-completion rates
   were dependent on temperature (M1), life history (M2), temperature and
   life history (M3), or were independent of temperature and life-history
   (M0). To assess the agreement between simulated and empirical data, we
   performed model selection by fitting supervised machine learning models
   to multidimensional biodiversity patterns. We show that a model with
   temperature-dependent rates of speciation (M1) consistently had the
   strongest support. In contrast to statistical inferences, which showed
   no general relationships between temperature and speciation rates in
   tetrapods, we demonstrate how process-based modeling can disentangle the
   causes behind empirical biodiversity patterns. Our study highlights how
   environmental energy has played a fundamental role in the evolution of
   biodiversity over deep time. {[}Biogeography; diversification; machine

Title = {Phylogenetic Diversity Rankings in the Face of Extinctions: The
   Robustness of the Fair Proportion Index},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {606-615},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Planning for the protection of species often involves difficult choices
   about which species to prioritize, given constrained resources. One way
   of prioritizing species is to consider their ``evolutionary
   distinctiveness,{''} (ED) that is, their relative evolutionary isolation
   on a phylogenetic tree. Several evolutionary isolation metrics or
   phylogenetic diversity indices have been introduced in the literature,
   among them the so-called Fair Proportion (FP) index (also known as the
   ED score). This index apportions the total diversity of a tree among all
   leaves, thereby providing a simple prioritization criterion for
   conservation. Here, we focus on the prioritization order obtained from
   the FP index and analyze the effects of species extinction on this
   ranking. More precisely, we analyze the extent to which the ranking
   order may change when some species go extinct and the FP index is
   recomputed for the remaining taxa. We show that for each phylogenetic
   tree, there are edge lengths such that the extinction of one leaf per
   cherry completely reverses the ranking. Moreover, we show that even if
   only the lowest-ranked species goes extinct, the ranking order may
   drastically change. We end by analyzing the effects of these two
   extinction scenarios (extinction of the lowest-ranked species and
   extinction of one leaf per cherry) for a collection of empirical and
   simulated trees. In both cases, we can observe significant changes in
   the prioritization orders, highlighting the empirical relevance of our
   theoretical findings.},

Abstract = {Birth-death stochastic processes are the foundations of many
   phylogenetic models and are widely used to make inferences about
   epidemiological and macroevolutionary dynamics. There are a large number
   of birth-death model variants that have been developed; these impose
   different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and
   about the sampling process. As each of these variants was individually
   derived, it has been difficult to understand the relationships between
   them as well as their precise biological and mathematical assumptions.
   Without a common mathematical foundation, deriving new models is
   nontrivial. Here, we unify these models into a single framework, prove
   that many previously developed epidemiological and macroevolutionary
   models are all special cases of a more general model, and illustrate the
   connections between these variants. This unification includes both
   models where the process is the same for all lineages and those in which
   it varies across types. We also outline a straightforward procedure for
   deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex
   birth-death(-sampling) models that will hopefully allow researchers to
   explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible. By
   rederiving existing single-type birth-death sampling models, we clarify
   and synthesize the range of explicit and implicit assumptions made by
   these models.},

Abstract = {In cryptic amphibian complexes, there is a growing trend to equate high
   levels of genetic structure with hidden cryptic species diversity.
   Typically, phylogenetic structure and distance-based approaches are used
   to demonstrate the distinctness of clades and justify the recognition of
   new cryptic species. However, this approach does not account for gene
   flow, spatial, and environmental processes that can obfuscate
   phylogenetic inference and bias species delimitation. As a case study,
   we sequenced genome-wide exons and introns to evince the processes that
   underlie the diversification of Philippine Puddle Frogs-a group that is
   widespread, phenotypically conserved, and exhibits high levels of
   geographically based genetic structure. We showed that widely adopted
   tree- and distance-based approaches inferred up to 20 species, compared
   to genomic analyses that inferred an optimal number of five distinct
   genetic groups. Using a suite of clustering, admixture, and phylogenetic
   network analyses, we demonstrate extensive admixture among the five
   groups and elucidate two specific ways in which gene flow can cause
   overestimations of species diversity: 1) admixed populations can be
   inferred as distinct lineages characterized by long branches in
   phylograms; and 2) admixed lineages can appear to be genetically
   divergent, even from their parental populations when simple measures of
   genetic distance are used. We demonstrate that the relationship between
   mitochondrial and genome-wide nuclear-distances is decoupled in admixed
   clades, leading to erroneous estimates of genetic distances and,
   consequently, species diversity. Additionally, genetic distance was also
   biased by spatial and environmental processes. Overall, we showed that
   high levels of genetic diversity in Philippine Puddle Frogs
   predominantly comprise metapopulation lineages that arose through
   complex patterns of admixture, isolation-by-distance, and
   isolation-by-environment as opposed to species divergence. Our findings
   suggest that speciation may not be the major process underlying the high
   levels of hidden diversity observed in many taxonomic groups and that
   widely adopted tree- and distance-based methods overestimate species
   diversity in the presence of gene flow.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic trees based on genome-wide sequence data may not always
   represent the true evolutionary history for a variety of reasons. One
   process that can lead to incorrect reconstruction of species phylogenies
   is gene flow, especially if interspecific gene flow has affected large
   parts of the genome. We investigated phylogenetic relationships within a
   clade comprising eight species of passerine birds (Phylloscopidae,
   Phylloscopus, leafwarblers) using one de novo genome assembly and 78
   resequenced genomes. Onthe basis of hypothesis-exclusion trials based on
   D-statistics, phylogenetic network analysis, and demographic inference
   analysis, we identified ancient gene flow affecting large parts of the
   genome between one species and the ancestral lineage of a sister species
   pair. This ancient gene flow consistently caused erroneous
   reconstruction of the phylogeny when using large amounts of genome-wide
   sequence data. In contrast, the true relationships were captured when
   smaller parts of the genome were analyzed, showing that the
   ``winner-takes-all democratic majority tree{''} is not necessarily the
   true species tree. Under this condition, smaller amounts of data may
   sometimes avoid the effects of gene flow due to stochastic sampling, as
   hidden reticulation histories are more likely to emerge from the use of
   larger data sets, especially whole-genome data sets. In addition, we
   also found that genomic regions affected by ancient gene flow generally
   exhibited higher genomic differentiation but a lower recombination rate
   and nucleotide diversity. Our study highlights the importance of
   considering reticulation in phylogenetic reconstructions in the genomic
   era.},

Title = {A New Method for Integrating Ecological Niche Modeling with
   Phylogenetics to Estimate Ancestral Distributions},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1033-1045},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ancestral range estimation and projection of niche models into the past
   have both become common in evolutionary studies where the ancient
   distributions of organisms are in question. However, these methods are
   hampered by complementary hurdles: discrete characterization of areas in
   ancestral range estimation can be overly coarse, especially at shallow
   timescales, and niche model projection neglects evolution. Phylogenetic
   niche modeling accounts for both of these issues by incorporating
   knowledge of evolutionary relationships into a characterization of
   environmental tolerances. We present a new method for phylogenetic niche
   modeling, implemented in R. Given past and present climate data, taxon
   occurrence data, and a time-calibrated phylogeny, our method constructs
   niche models for each extant taxon, uses ancestral character estimation
   to reconstruct ancestral niche models, and projects these models into
   paleoclimate data to provide a historical estimate of the geographic
   range of a lineage. Models either at nodes or along branches of the
   phylogeny can be estimated. We demonstrate our method on a small group
   of dendrobatid frogs and show that it can make inferences given species
   with restricted ranges and little occurrence data. We also use
   simulations to showthat our method can reliably reconstruct the niche of
   a known ancestor in both geographic and environmental space. Our method
   brings together fields as disparate as ecological niche modeling,
   phylogenetics, and ancestral range estimation in a user-friendly
   package.},

Title = {MAMMALIAN DIVERSITY AND MATSES ETHNOMAMMALOGY IN AMAZONIAN PERU PART 4:
   BATS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {451},
Pages = {1-199},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {In this report, the fourth of our monographic series on mammalian
   diversity and Matses ethnomammalogy in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial
   region of northeastern Peru, we document the occurrence of 98 species of
   bats, including 11 emballonurids, 2 noctilionids, 66 phyllostomids, 1
   furipterid, 4 thyropterids, 7 vespertilionids, and 7 molossids. New
   species based on specimens collected in this region (Peropteryx
   pallidoptera, Micronycteris matses, Hsunycteris dashe, Sturnira giannae,
   and Thyroptera wynneae) have already been described elsewhere, but
   noteworthy distributional and taxonomic results newly reported here
   include the first specimen of Diclidurus isabella from Peru and the
   diagnosis of Glossophaga bakeri as a species distinct from G.
   commissarisi. Lists of examined voucher specimens, identification
   criteria, essential taxonomic references, and summaries of natural
   history observations are provided for all species. Original natural
   history information reported herein includes numerous observations of
   roosting behavior obtained by indigenous Matses collaborators.
   We assess the Yavari-Ucayali bat inventory for completeness and conclude
   that more species remain to be discovered in the region, where as many
   as 116 species might be expected. Most of the ``missing{''} species
   (those expected based on geographic criteria but not actually observed)
   are aerial insectivores, a guild that is notoriously difficult to sample
   by mistnetting. Of the 98 species in the observed regional fauna, only
   71 are known to occur sympatrically at Jenaro Herrera, by far the
   best-sampled locality between the Yavari and Ucayali rivers. Faunal
   comparisons with extralimital inventories (e.g., from Brazil, Ecuador,
   and French Guiana) suggest that frugivorous bats are substantially more
   speciose in western Amazonia than in eastern Amazonia, a result that is
   consistent with previous suggestions of an east-to-west gradient in the
   trophic structure of Amazonian mammal faunas.
   As previously reported, the Matses have only a single name for
   ``bat,{''} but they recognize the existence of many unnamed local
   species, which they distinguish on the basis of morphology and behavior.
   However, by contrast with the well-documented accuracy of Matses
   observations about primates and other game species, recorded Matses
   monologs about bat natural history contain numerous factual errors and
   ambiguities. Linguistic underdifferentiation of bat diversity and
   inaccurate natural history knowledge are both explained by cultural
   inattention to small, inedible, and inoffensive nocturnal fauna.},

Abstract = {Living opossums (Didelphidae) comprise 125 species in 18 genera and 4
   subfamilies. This synopsis lists all the didelphid taxa (subfamilies,
   tribes, genera, subgenera, and species) currently recognised as valid,
   summarizes information about typification, synonyms, and geographic
   distributions, remarks noteworthy recent changes in usage, and comments
   on still outstanding problems. A concluding discussion rejects the
   notion that the almost twofold increase in opossum species from 1993 to
   the present is ``taxonomic inflation{''} and considers the impact of new
   kinds of data and new methods of data analysis on species delimitation.},
