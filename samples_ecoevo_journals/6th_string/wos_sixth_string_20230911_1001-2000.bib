Title = {EVOLUTION IN THE GENUS RHINELLA: A TOTAL EVIDENCE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
   OF NEOTROPICAL TRUE TOADS (ANURA: BUFONIDAE)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {447},
Pages = {1-155},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {True toads of the genus Rhinella are among the most common and diverse
   group of Neotropical anurans. These toads are widely distributed
   throughout South America, inhabiting a great diversity of environments
   and ecoregions. Currently, however, the genus is defined solely on the
   basis of molecular characters, and it lacks a proper diagnosis. Although
   some phenetic species groups have traditionally been recognized within
   Rhinella, the monophyly of some of them have been rejected in previous
   phylogenetic analyses, and many species remain unassigned to these
   poorly defined groups. Additionally, the identity and taxonomy of
   several species are problematic and hinder the specific recognition and
   description of undescribed taxa. In this work, we first perform
   phylogenetic analyses of separate mitochondrial and nuclear datasets to
   test the possible occurrence of hybridization and/or genetic
   introgression in the genus. The comparative analysis of both datasets
   revealed unidirectional mitochondrial introgressions of an unknown
   parental species into R. horribilis ({''}ghost introgression{''}) and of
   R. dorbignyi into R. bernardoi; therefore, the mitochondrial and nuclear
   datasets of these species were considered separately in subsequent
   analyses. We performed total-evidence phylogenetic analyses that
   included revised molecular (four mitochondrial and five nuclear genes)
   and phenotypic (90 characters) datasets for 83 nominal species of
   Rhinella, plus several undescribed and problematic species and multiple
   outgroups. Results demonstrate that Rhinella was nonmonophyletic due to
   the position of R. ceratophrys, which was recovered as the sister taxon
   of Rhaebo nasicus with strong support. Among our outgroups, the strongly
   supported Anaxyrus + Incilius is the sister clade of all other species
   of Rhinella. Once R. ceratophrys is excluded, the genus Rhinella is
   monophyletic, well supported, and composed of two major clades. One of
   these is moderately supported and includes species of the former R.
   spinulosa Group (including R. gallardoi); the monophyletic R. granulosa,
   R. crucifer, and R. marina Groups; and a clade composed of the
   mitochondrial sequences of R. horribilis. The other major clade is
   strongly supported and composed of all the species from the
   non-monophyletic R. veraguensis and R. margaritifera Groups, the former
   R. acrolopha Group, and R. sternosignata. Consistent with these results,
   we define eight species groups of Rhinella that are mostly diagnosed by
   phenotypic synapomorphies in addition to a combination of morphological
   character states. Rhinella sternosignata is the only species that
   remains unassigned to any group. We also synonymize nine species, treat
   three former subspecies as full species, and suggest that 15 lineages
   represent putative undescribed species. Lastly, we discuss the
   apparently frequent occurrence of hybridization, deep mitochondrial
   divergence, and ``ghost introgression{''}; the incomplete phenotypic
   evidence (including putative character systems that could be used for
   future phylogenetic analyses); and the validity of the known fossil
   record of Rhinella as a source of calibration points for divergence
   dating analyses.},

Title = {CRANIODENTAL MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY OF MARSUPIALS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {457},

Abstract = {The current literature on marsupial phylogenetics includes numerous
   studies based on analyses of morphological data with limited sampling of
   Recent and fossil taxa, and many studies based on analyses of molecular
   data with dense sampling of Recent taxa, but few studies have combined
   both data types. Another dichotomy in the marsupial phylogenetic
   literature is between studies focused on New World taxa and those
   focused on Sahulian taxa. To date, there has been no attempt to assess
   the phylogenetic relationships of the global marsupial fauna based on
   combined analyses of morphology and molecular sequences for a dense
   sampling of Recent and fossil taxa. For this report, we compiled
   morphological and molecular data from an unprecedented number of Recent
   and fossil marsupials. Our morphological data consist of 180
   craniodental characters that we scored for 97 terminals representing
   every currently recognized Recent genus, 42 additional ingroup
   (crown-clade marsupial) terminals represented by well-preserved fossils,
   and 5 outgroups (nonmarsupial metatherians). Our molecular data comprise
   24.5 kb of DNA sequences from whole-mitochondrial genomes and six
   nuclear loci (APOB, BRCA1, GHR, RAG1, RBP3 and VWF) for 97 marsupial
   terminals (the same Recent taxa scored for craniodental morphology) and
   several placental and monotreme outgroups. The results of separate and
   combined analyses of these data using a wide range of phylogenetic
   methods support many currently accepted hypotheses of ingroup
   (marsupial) relationships, but they also underscore the difficulty of
   placing fossils with key missing data (e.g., dagger Evolestes), and the
   unique difficulty of placing others that exhibit mosaics of
   plesiomorphic and autapomorphic traits (e.g., +Yalkaparidon). Unique
   contributions of our study are (1) critical discussions and
   illustrations of marsupial craniodental morphology including features
   never previously coded for phylogenetic analysis; (2) critical
   assessments of relative support for many suprageneric clades; (3)
   estimates of divergence times derived from tip-and-node dating based on
   uniquely taxon-dense analyses; and (4) a revised, higher-order
   classification of marsupials accompanied by lists of supporting
   craniodental synapomorphies. Far from the last word on these topics,
   this report lays the foundation for future research that may be enabled
   by the discovery of new fossil taxa, better-preserved material of
   previously described taxa, novel morphological characters (e.g., from
   the postcranium), and improved methods of phylogenetic analysis.},

Title = {Behavioral and Demographic Responses of Mule Deer to Energy Development
   on Winter Range},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat modification is a major driver of global
   biodiversity loss. In North America, one of the primary sources of
   habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for
   and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which
   has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife
   species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has
   become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation
   practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties
   involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population
   responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development
   predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these
   responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant
   assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to
   gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective
   mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and
   behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas
   development on winter range in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, USA, from
   2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined
   from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity
   (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule
   deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels
   of hydrocarbon development within the Piceance Basin.
   We assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development
   features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining
   habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule
   deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological
   effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and
   overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, December fawn mass,
   adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal
   counts, and lactation rates in December between the 2 study areas.
   Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were
   apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development
   during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for
   foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat
   presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree.
   Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more
   well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these
   areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in
   use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the
   phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human
   presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite
   divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development
   on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any
   of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population
   level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher
   in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations
   did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs
   measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below
   winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density
   between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our
   study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in
   habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival;
   however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these
   mechanisms.
   Given our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high
   densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly
   lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient
   vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are
   below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling
   phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this
   activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were
   directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced
   footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral
   responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation
   efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic,
   light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that
   attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final
   development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system,
   minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning
   would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria).
   Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments
   of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of
   how wildlife respond to habitat modification. (c) 2021 The Wildlife

Title = {FOURTEEN NEW, ENDEMIC SPECIES OF SHREW (GENUS CROCIDURA) FROM SULAWESI
   REVEAL A SPECTACULAR ISLAND RADIATION},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {454},
Pages = {1-108},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {After nearly a decade of field inventories in which we preserved voucher
   specimens of the small terrestrial mammals of Sulawesi, we combined
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of morphological traits with
   molecular phylogenetics to better understand the diversity of shrews
   (Soricidae: Crocidura) on the island. We examined the morphology of 1368
   specimens and obtained extensive molecular data from many of them,
   including mitochondrial DNA sequences from 851 specimens, up to five
   nuclear exons from 657 specimens, and thousands of ultraconserved
   elements from 90 specimens. By iteratively testing species limits using
   distinct character datasets and appropriate taxon sampling, we found
   clear, mostly consistent evidence for the existence of 21 species of
   shrews on Sulawesi, only seven of which were previously recognized. We
   divide these 21 species into five morphogroups, provide emended
   diagnoses of the seven previously named species, and describe 14 new
   species. The Long-Tailed Group contains Crocidura caudipilosa, C.
   elongata, C. microelongata, new species, and C. quasielongata, new
   species; the Rhoditis Group contains C. rhoditis, C. pseudorhoditis, new
   species, C. australis, new species, and C. pallida, new species; the
   Small-Bodied Group contains C. lea, C. levicula, C. baletei, new
   species, C. mediocris, new species, C. parva, new species, and C.
   tenebrosa, new species; the Thick-Tailed Group contains C. brevicauda,
   new species and C. caudicrassa, new species; and the Ordinary Group
   contains C. musseri, C. nigripes, C. normalis, new species, C.
   ordinaria, new species, and C. solita, new species. Documenting these
   endemic species reveals a local radiation (20 of the 21 species are
   members of an endemic clade) in which elevational gradients played a
   prominent role in either promoting speciation, or at a minimum,
   fostering the cooccurrence of phenotypically similar species. As now
   understood, the species-level diversity of Crocidura on Sulawesi is
   nearly three times the known diversity of any other insular shrew fauna.
   This study highlights the fact that if we wish to understand the true
   extent of biodiversity on Earth, large-scale, vouchered organismal
   inventories followed up with thorough examinations of genetic,
   morphological, and geographic traits are sorely needed in montane
   tropical regions, even for purportedly well-studied groups such as
   mammals.},

Abstract = {Leptohyphes Eaton is one of the most species-rich American genera in
   Ephemeroptera, with 45 valid species distributed from south-central USA
   to Patagonia. Most species are distributed in central and northern
   Andes. Nymphs are frequent and abundant in mountain streams. We present
   a parsimony-based morphological phylogeny for the genus. Specific
   geographic records were studied using Hovenkamp's protocol (barrier
   biogeography). Leptohyphes was recovered as a monophyletic group. The
   most ancient disjunction found in Leptohyphes separated Tepui-area from
   the rest of the Americas. Other interesting vicariant events were found,
   including the separation of eastern Atlantic mountains (Mata Atlantica)
   from the Andes; oriental and occidental slopes of the Andes; northern
   from central Andes; and northern Andes from Central and North America.
   An ancient tropical South American origin for the genus is supported,
   with a more recent diversification due to Andean orogeny. Clades and
   terminals reaching North America include few independent events of more
   recent range expansions.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis and trait evolution of ant cocoons},

Abstract = {Most ant species have lost the ability to spin cocoons. To explore the
   evolution of cocoon loss within Formicidae, we perform an ancestral
   state reconstruction of cocooned pupae across a genus-level phylog-eny
   and use a sister clade analysis to determine the impact of cocoon
   evolution on ant speciation. Then, we fit models of correlated evolution
   between cocoon status and several other organismal traits. We find that
   the re-emergence of cocoons is rare and that ``naked{''} lineages
   display an increased rate of speciation in 5 out of 9 sister group
   comparisons. Models of correlated evolution with cocoon status were
   favored for metapleural gland and worker polymorphism. Metapleural gland
   favored rates of evolution were incon-clusive, while worker polymorphism
   displayed a higher transition rate towards polymorphism coupled with
   cocoon loss. These results suggest that cocoon loss may allow for other
   complex traits to develop and may represent a novel example of relaxed
   selection.},

Title = {Methane release from open leads and new ice following an Arctic winter
   storm event},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We examine an Arctic winter storm event, which led to ice break-up, the
   formation of open leads, and the subsequent freezing of these leads. The
   methane (CH4) concentration in under-ice surface water before and during
   the storm event was 8-12 nmol L-1, which resulted in a potential
   sea-to-air CH4 flux ranging from +0.2 to +2.1 mg CH4 m- 2 d-1 in open
   leads. CH4 ventilation between seawater and atmosphere occurred when
   both open water fraction and wind speed increased. Over the nine days
   after the storm, sea ice grew 27 cm thick. Initially, CH4 concentrations
   in the sea ice brine were above the equilibrium with the atmosphere. As
   the ice grew thicker, most of the CH4 was lost from upper layers of sea
   ice into the atmosphere, implying continued CH4 evasion after the leads
   were ice-covered. This suggests that wintertime CH4 emissions need to be
   better constrained.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variations of recent shipping along the Northern
   Sea Route},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations of shipping along Russia?s Northern Sea
   Route (NSR) were investigated to better understand the possible drivers
   of traffic levels and future trends. Daily information for ships sailing
   along the NSR were collected, and voyage-based analyses were conducted
   for a period from March 2013 to December 2018. Annual total dead weight
   tonnage (DWT) increased significantly from 3.95 million tons in 2013 to
   24.61 million tons in 2018, and most of this was carried by dry cargo
   ships, oil tankers and LNG carriers between Europe and the Kara Sea.
   Annual total DWT was relatively high during 2015?2017 for dry cargo
   ships, whereas annual total DWT increased rapidly for oil tankers from
   2016 and for LNG carriers in 2018. The relatively high level of shipping
   for dry cargo ships during 2015?2017 is attributable to the Yamal LNG
   project construction, while the rapidly increased annual total DWT for
   oil tankers and LNG carriers is due to the transportation of crude oil
   from the Novy Port project, and LNG from the Yamal LNG project. Recent
   NSR shipping is mainly driven by development and marine transportation
   of Russian Arctic natural resources, and this increasing trend should
   become faster in the near future as operation of the Arctic LNG-2,
   Taymyr coal and other projects are commissioned.},

Abstract = {Environments along the coast of Greenland are rapidly changing under the
   influence of a warming climate in the Arctic. To better understand the
   changes in the coastal environments, we performed researches in the
   Qaanaaq region in northwestern Greenland as a part of the ArCS (Arctic
   Challenge for Sustainability) Project. Mass loss of ice caps and
   marine-terminating outlet glaciers were quantified by field and
   satellite observations. Measurements and sampling in fjords revealed the
   important role of glacial meltwater discharge in marine ecosystems.
   Flooding of a glacial stream in Qaanaaq and landslides in a nearby
   settlement were investigated to identify the drivers of the incidents.
   Our study observed rapid changes in the coastal environments, and their
   critical impact on the society in Qaanaaq. We organized workshops with
   the residents to absorb local and indigenous knowledge, as well as to
   share the results and data obtained in the project. Continuous effort
   towards obtaining long-term observations requiring involvement of local
   communities is crucial to contribute to a sustainable future in
   Greenland.},

Title = {Estimation of CH4 emissions from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf based on

   2012 to 2017},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Atmospheric CH4 mole fractions were observed aboard the R/V Mirai
   sailing in waters off Alaska in the Arctic Ocean in September 2012-2017
   to investigate the CH4 emissions from the surrounding region, especially
   from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). The synoptic-scale increases
   of CH4 were compared with simulated increases based on a Lagrangian
   Particle Dispersion Model and monthly CH4 flux maps determined by a
   global atmospheric inversion system. There were good agreements between
   the observed and simulated CH4 increases, suggesting the validity of CH4
   fluxes from the surrounding areas of the cruise experiments. The CH4
   emissions from the ESAS in September were further optimized in order to
   minimize the root mean square of the differences between the observed
   and simulated CH4 increases. The average (+/- 1s) of the resulting
   emission rates was 0.58 +/- 0.47 TgCH(4) yr(-1), which was much smaller
   than previously reported estimates. The individual optimized CH4
   emissions varied from 0.1 +/- 0.3 to 1.3 +/- 0.4 TgCH(4) yr(-1), showing
   a positive correlation with the sea surface temperature and a negative
   correlation with the ice concentration of the ESAS area in September.
   These results suggest a possible enhancement of the CH4 emissions from
   the ESAS in a warmer future.},

Title = {Debris-cover impact on glacier melting in the Upper Indus Basin},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Out of 4530 glaciers covering similar to 4770 km(2) in the Upper Indus
   Basin, viz., Chenab, Zanaskar and Suru sub-basins, we selected
   topographically and morphologically homogeneous set of 98 glaciers; 56
   debris-covered and 42 clean to assess the impact of debris-cover on
   glacier melting. Satellite data analysis from 2000 to 2017 showed that
   the debris-covered glaciers have melted slower (2.49 +/- 0.05\%;
   0.15\%a(-1)) than the clean glaciers (4.07 +/- 0.03\%; 0.24\%a(-1)). The
   intra-basin analysis revealed that clean and debris-covered glaciers in
   the Chenab have melted 2.34 +/- 0.17\% and 1.1 +/- 0.30\% (0.14\%a(-1)
   and 0.06\%a(-1)) and retreated 8.82 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 5.7 +/-
   2.67ma(-1) respectively. Similarly, clean and debris-covered glaciers in
   the Zanaskar have melted at similar rates of 4.58 +/- 0.07\% and 4.55
   +/- 0.21\% (0.27\%a(-1) and 0.25\%a(-1)) and retreated 10.0 +/-
   2.67ma(-1) and 8.4 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Clean and debris-covered
   glaciers in the Suru have melted 5.56 +/- 0.09\% and 4.53 +/- 0.14\%
   (0.33\%a(-1) and 0.27\%a(-1)) and retreated 9.6 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 7.0
   +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Extensive debris-cover of similar to 32.3\%
   modulates glacier loss in the Chenab and sparse debris-cover of 11.4\%
   and 6.4\% in the Suru and Zanaskar enhances the melting of the
   debris-covered glaciers. Overall, debris-covered glaciers melted slower
   than the clean glaciers, with inter- and intra-basin variations,
   suggesting that debris-cover plays a complex but significant role in
   modulating glacier melting under climate change.},

Title = {Comparison of underwater noise at the Chukchi Plateau under open-water
   and ice-covered conditions},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A comparison study on underwater noise at the Chukchi plateau with and
   without ice cover helps to understand the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean,
   especially in the context of global warming. Underwater noise recorded
   at a receiving depth of 519.5 m, from September 9, 2017 to March 8,
   2018, on the Chukchi Plateau had been investigated. When the sea surface
   was ice-free, underwater noise on the Chukchi Plateau was dominated by
   wind-generated noise for high wind speed and there was no significant
   shipping in this sea area. When the sea surface was ice-covered,
   underwater noise was dominated by ice-generated noise. Under open-water
   conditions, the noise spectrum means and percentiles were greater than
   those under ice-covered conditions. The differences of mean and median
   levels between open-water and ice-covered conditions were all almost
   less than 3 dB in the range 20-100 Hz; whereas, they were greater than 3
   dB in the 100 Hz-2 kHz band and increased with increasing frequency.
   Although the transient signals generated by sea ice activities would
   cause the noise spectrum level to increase suddenly under ice-covered
   conditions, the underwater noise was still shown relatively quiet
   compared with that under open-water conditions.},

Title = {The ozone hole measurements at the Indian station Maitri in Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Stratospheric ozone is a trace gas of great importance as it filters
   harmful ultraviolet radiations reaching the earth surface. Since ozone
   influences temperature and dynamics of the stratosphere, it is also a
   climate-relevant gas by modifyimg the tropospheric temperature.
   Significant changes in the stratospheric ozone are, therefore, a concern
   for human health and climate. India has a dedicated polar research
   programme with two stations in Antarctica; Maitri (70.4 degrees 5, 11.4
   degrees E, since 1989) and Bharati (69.2 degrees 5, 76.2 degrees E,
   since 2012). Semi-regular measurements of total column ozone (TCO) are
   carried out to monitor the changes in the ozone layer there. Here, we
   use the available TCO measurements from Maitri in the winters of
   1999-2003 and 2006, to estimate the chemical ozone depletion for the
   first time there. We estimate the largest ozone loss (59\% or 180 DU) in
   2006, and smallest in 2002 and 1999 (44\% or 160 DU) among the winters;
   consistent with the meteorology, as the winter 2006 was the coldest and
   2002 was the warmest with the first-ever major sudden stratospheric
   warming over Antarctica. The Maitri ozone loss analysis is found to be
   representative for the whole Antarctica as assessed from the comparisons
   with the average TCO from all Antarctic stations and satellite overpass
   TCO observations. The study, henceforth, demonstrates the value and
   significance of continuous monitoring of the ozone hole at Maitri to
   assist the policy decisions such as the Montreal Protocol and its
   amendments and adjustments.},

Title = {The stratospheric QBO affects antarctic sea ice through the tropical
   convection in early austral winter},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We found a statistically significant relationship between the
   stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and Antarctic sea ice
   concentration (SIC) in austral winter. SIC differences between the
   easterly phase of the QBO (EQBO) and westerly phase of the QBO (WQBO)
   show positive anomalies of SIC in the following regions: over the Ross
   Sea, Weddell Sea, and around 90 degrees E. This wave-3 pattern is
   clearly seen in June and July, and decays in August. The increased SIC
   regions correspond to anomalous offshore wind regions, and the reduced
   SIC regions correspond to onshore wind regions, indicating the
   atmospheric circulation anomaly produced the SIC anomaly. The
   atmospheric circulation anomaly is barotropic and closely related with
   the upper atmospheric flow. The upper circulation anomaly shows a
   stationary Rossby wave train propagating from Indian Ocean. We show the
   enhanced convection in the tropical Indian Ocean in EQBO can excite the
   Rossby wave train. In summary, the stratospheric QBO affects the
   tropical convection, then generating the Rossby wave train which
   propagates into southern high latitude, and finally affecting Antarctic
   sea ice. There exists a possibility to predict winter sea ice in
   one-year advance, because the QBO is a quasi-regular oscillation.},

Title = {REVISION OF THE NEARCTIC SPECIES OF THE GENUS AMIOTA LOEW (DIPTERA:
   DROSOPHILIDAE)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {458},
Pages = {1-177},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Thorough biotic inventories are still needed even in families with
   paradigm organisms like Drosophilidae, including well-studied areas such
   as North America. This work presents a taxonomic revision of the species
   of the genus Amiota Loew in North America and the Nearctic portion of
   Mexico. Amiota steganoptera Malloch is currently excluded from the
   Nearctic and Amiota setigera Malloch is synonymized under Amiota
   humeralis Loew. Specimens of Amiota subtusradiata Duda were not
   encountered during this study along with its synonym Amiota quadrata
   Takada and Toda; however, based on previous descriptions we include A.
   subtusradiata in the Nearctic fauna. All other previously described
   species from the Nearctic are redescribed. Thirty-six species are
   described as new: Amiota amputata, A. antitormentum, A. avipes, A.
   biacuminis, A. brayi, A. byersi, A. cervites, A. cruciatum, A. didens,
   A. durangoensis, A. elsaltoensis, A. floridiensis, A. forceps, A.
   fulvitibia, A. hyalou, A. imperator, A. incurva, A. laevifurca, A.
   latilabrum, A. mcalpinei, A. multiplex, A. nanonigrescens, A.
   occidentalis, A. onyx, A. oviraptor, A. pseudominor, A. raripennis, A.
   sinaloensis, A. subnebojsa, A. tessae, A. texas, A. tibialis, A.
   tormentum, A. uniacuminis, A. wheeleri, and A. zaliskoi. This increases
   the total species known in the Nearctic from 13 to 49. All species in
   the Nearctic are illustrated, adult diagnostic features are discussed,
   and distributions are provided.
   A cladogram based on parsimony analysis of 46 morphological characters
   established species groups in the genus. Most of the Nearctic species
   were accommodated into 10 species groups. Three species groups were
   previously erected for species in China and Europe. Seven species groups
   are newly established: the avipes, cervites, hsui, mariae, nebojsa,
   nigrescens, and subtusradiata groups.
   Diversity in Amiota appears to be partially dependent on elevation and
   latitude in the Nearctic, with high diversity found in southern Ontario,
   the Appalachians, the Ozarks, mountain forests of Arizona and New
   Mexico, and the Sierra Madre of central Mexico. The taxonomic history of
   the Nearctic species is reviewed, and various aspects of their biology
   is presented. Males of species in the A. mariae species group are
   polymorphic for mirror-image, asymmetric genitalia, called chiral
   variants. Besides morphology, larval saproxyly, adult lachryphagy, and
   biogeography are reviewed. Challenges to the study of Amiota and future
   prospects are discussed.},

   with this project. At the AMNH: Steve Davis helped organize and plan
   laboratory work. A large part of this study would not have gone as
   smoothly without him. His friendship is appreciated, as well as the
   untold number of annoying questions, favors, and conversations
   (scientific and not) asked of him by L.E.J. Other AMNH colleagues
   include Courtney Richenbacher and Suzanne Rab Green, who fielded too
   many requests and questions to remember. Mary Knight offered
   nomenclatural assistance on all things Latin and Greek. Charlotte
   Holden, illustrator extraordinaire, rendered the shading for the
   genitalic plates from D.A.G.'s pencil sketches and line drawings. Lee
   Herman offered advice to L.E.J. on the nitty gritty of nomenclature and
   procedural taxonomy. Lance's brother, Jessten Hughes, accompanied him on
   two large collecting trips. In total, 15 states were visited with him in
   this study from California to Mississippi. Over approximately 7000 of
   miles of driving, Jesse managed to collect nearly five species, one new
   to science. Christian Liriano accompanied a trip in upstate New York.
   KeyLyn Song accompanied several trips around Florida. Lin Li accompanied
   many trips around the New York Botanical Garden. Kitty Sopow accompanied
   trips in southern Illinois. Ryan Mannion generously laid out, labeled,
   and sized all the figures in this study. In addition, he accompanied
   Lance on a trip to Maine and New Hampshire. He also looked over parts of
   the manuscript. His kind attitude for the intense nature over the past
   five years of this project is appreciated. Amy Berkov (City College of
   New YorkCUNY) is thanked for her help over the last five years. Amy
   served on the master's committee of the first author when this study was
   a thesis topic. Her patience, guidance, and encouragement pushed this
   study along in many ways. She imparted a love of urban and suburban
   biodiversity to a student who originally thought natural areas were the
   only places worthy of study. Amy's insight was prescient: insect
   taxonomy projects always end up becoming larger than one anticipates.
   Staff at the AMNH Southwest Research Station (Michele Lanan), Black Rock
   Forest Consortium (William Schuster), and the New York Botanical Garden
   (Jessica Arcate-Schuler) are thanked for assistance and permissions for
   L.E.J. to conduct fieldwork. The American Museum of Natural History is
   greatly appreciated for their financial assistance of fieldwork through
   generous funding by a Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Fund Grant to L.E.J.
   The Williston Diptera Fund at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History
   provided funds for L.E.J. to attend Fly School in California in 2017,
   where more collections of Amiota were made. Countless collectors and
   their specimens form the foundation for this study, among them Marshall
   R. Wheeler, William B. Heed, Stephen Marshall, James F. McAlpine, and
   Donald M. Wood. Marshall R. Wheeler deserves special appreciation. His
   collections throughout the United States formed a significant proportion
   of all museum collections consulted for this study. Combined with his
   papers, his contributions to this study are huge-and would have been
   woefully incomplete without them. When the late George Steyskal learned
   of D.A.G.'s study on drosophilids, beginning 40 years ago, he offered up
   all his notes and drawings. Thomas Werner and John Jaenike graciously
   donated valuable series of specimens for study.; The Museum of
   Comparative Zoology at Harvard (MCZC) provided photographs of Loew's
   type specimens and permitted their use in this text.},

Abstract = {Scorpions of the genus Buthacus Birula, 1908 (Buthidae C.L. Koch, 1837),
   commonly known as ``sand scorpions,{''} are widespread in the sandy
   deserts of the Palearctic, from West Africa to India. Although many new
   species of Buthacus were described in recent years, no modern revision
   exists for the genus and the limits of many infrageneric taxa remain
   unclear. The present contribution addresses the species of Buthacus
   recorded from the Levant, defined here as the region of the Middle East
   including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories,
   and the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt). Prior to this study, five species and
   subspecies, including several synonyms, were recognized from the region.
   Based on extensive new collections, a reassessment of the morphology
   (including multivariate statistical analysis), and a phylogenetic
   analysis of morphological and DNA sequence data, published elsewhere,
   seven species of Buthacus are now recognized from the Levant, raising
   the number of species in the genus to 30. Three new species are
   described: Buthacus amitaii, sp. nov., endemic to Israel; Buthacus
   arava, sp. nov., endemic to Israel and Jordan; and Buthacus levyi, sp.
   nov., endemic to Egypt, Israel, and perhaps Libya. Buthacus arenicola
   (Simon, 1885) is redescribed and restricted to northeastern Algeria and
   central Tunisia, and Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg, 1829) redescribed
   and restricted to Egypt, Sudan, and perhaps Libya. Buthacus armasi
   Lourenco, 2013, stat. rev., from southern Algeria, and Buthacus spatzi
   (Birula, 1911), stat. rev., from southern Tunisia and western Libya, are
   revalidated, and Buthacus fuscata Pallary, 1929, stat. nov. et stat.
   rev., from southern Algeria, revalidated and elevated to the rank of
   species. Buthacus nitzani Levy et al., 1973, stat. nov., currently
   restricted to Israel but probably present in the Sinai Peninsula
   (Egypt), is elevated to the rank of species. Buthacus tadmorensis
   (Simon, 1892), stat. rev., recorded from Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and
   Turkey, and Buthacus yotvatensis Levy et al., 1973, stat. rev., endemic
   to Israel and Jordan, are redescribed and revalidated. Three new
   synonyms are presented: Androctonus (Leiurus) macrocentrus Ehrenberg,
   1828 = Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg, 1829), syn. nov.; Buthus
   pietschmanni Penther, 1912 = Buthacus tadmorensis (Simon, 1892), syn.
   nov.; Buthacus granosus Borelli, 1929 = Buthacus leptochelys (Ehrenberg,
   1829), syn. nov. Buthacus arenicola and the seven species of Buthacus
   occurring in the Levant are diagnosed and illustrated to modern
   standards, with updated distribution maps. A list of the currently
   recognized species of Buthacus, and a key to identification of the
   species occurring in the Levant are also presented.},

Abstract = {Identifying microorganisms and defining the community compositions are
   important for better understanding of the marine ecosystem and
   biochemical cycles. This study describes microbial community
   compositions of coastal surface waters of the Western Antarctic
   Peninsula (WAP). The V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes were PCRamplified,
   and sequencing libraries were constructed to characterize the microbial
   community. A total of 157 bacteria species were identified and
   classified into 6 phyla, 50 families, and 91 genera. Whereas only two
   Archaea taxa of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, the first report from
   surface water of the WAP in summer, were identified. Our data showed a
   prevalence of ubiquitous bacterial phyla of Proteobacteria and
   Bacteroidetes. The dominant bacterial families across all water samples
   were mostly affiliated with Pseudoalteromonadaceae, and followed by
   Rhodobacteraceae, Moraxellaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae, which
   collectively accounted for almost 94\% of all the generated sequences.
   Taxonomic compositions of the sampling sites were similar. However, the
   relative abundances of bacterial families were considerably varied.
   Bacterial communities in polar marine environments show strong spatial
   and temporal variation.},

Title = {Investigation of complement system activation and regulation during
   Indian Antarctic expedition},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Antarctica is one of the most effective sites to measure the impact of
   human isolation, sleep deprivation, light-dark period and harsh
   environmental conditions. In the present study we address several
   aspects of the activation and regulation of the complement system.
   Alterations in the body systems mainly related to immunology, physiology
   and psychology, during expeditions to the Antarctica, leads to various
   complexities. In the present study the research findings are based on
   two group members from 34th Indian Scientific Expedition to the
   Antarctic. The first group-included members from ``summer{''}
   expedition, while the second group-included members subjected to the
   Antarctic environment for the ``winter{''} expedition. Blood samples
   were collected from both the groups and evaluated for various activation
   and regulatory complement protein. Serum levels of C3, C4 \& C5a were
   analysed. Anaphylatoxin C3a was up regulated significantly in both the
   teams. However, C5a, another anaphylatoxin was also increased in both
   teams though not significantly during winter expedition. Complement
   regulatory proteins C1-Inhibitor, Factor D, Factor H were unregulated
   significantly during summer and winter exposures. However, Factor D
   levels increased significantly only in the month of April (W2) of summer
   exposure. Thus, this indicates that harsh Antarctic conditions could be
   detrimental factor for activation of complement system in both the
   teams. However, the effect of activated complement system during the
   expedition was regulated in positive manner and could not be correlated
   with clinical manifestations due to the multiple stressors and small
   population size during Antarctic expedition.},

Title = {Observing drift compressional waves in the nightside ionosphere using
   the Ekaterinburg radar},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A review of researches related to ultra low frequency (ULF) waves
   studied using a midlatitude coherent decameter radar located near
   Ekaterinburg (EKB), Russia is presented. The radar was constructed
   similar to SuperDARN radars. During the experiment conducted in
   2013-2015 three of its beams were surveyed successively with the
   integration time of 6 s providing time resolution of 18 s at each beam.
   In a few cases, data received in the nighttime ionosphere showed
   signatures of the drift compressional mode. In one of them, the wave
   exhibited clear dependence of frequency on azimuthal wave number m,
   which corresponds with the theory of drift compressional waves. In
   another case, merging of the drift compressional and Alfv \& eacute;n
   modes at some critical value of m was shown. A number of the observed
   waves' frequencies were compared with the Alfv \& eacute;n ones inferred
   from the spacecraft data. The results showed that in a large part of
   cases waves had subAlfv \& eacute;nic frequencies. This finding complies
   with the assumption that at least a part of the waves observed with the
   radar should be identified with the drift compressional mode, whose
   frequency can be lower than frequency of field line resonance (FLR).
   Additionally, a case of simultaneous spacecraft and radar wave
   observation was presented. As the wave had poloidal structure,
   diamagnetic properties, and its frequency was considerably lower than
   the minimal frequency of the FLR, it was assumed that it was some kind
   of compressional mode, apparently the drift compressional wave.},

Abstract = {The sediments of shallow marine waters and lakes around Antarctica
   provide valuable records of sea-level changes. Understanding the timing
   and amplitude of Antarctic Ice Sheet changes during the last
   deglaciation is essential to assess the effect of glacial isostatic
   adjustments on the present ice-sheet mass balance. However, the
   difficulty in accessing Antarctica makes it challenging to obtain
   field-based evidence of ice-sheet and sea-level change during the last
   deglaciation. We used a portable sonar system to measure bathymetry and
   water column profiles (sea temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and
   turbidity) in Lake Nurume and shallow marine waters of Langhovde, East
   Antarctica, to collect baseline data for sea-level reconstruction from
   the Last Glacial Maximum (-20 ka). The bathymetry data reveals the
   surveyed shallow marine waters of Langhovde have basins of 100 m water
   depth with approximately -67 and -92 m sills, in which sediments provide
   a potentially useful sea-level archive for the last deglaciation. The
   water column profile in Lake Nurume reveals a chemocline at -11 m water
   depth and anoxic condition below that depth. These baseline data will be
   useful to reconstruct sea-level and ice-sheet changes in East
   Antarctica.},

Title = {Temporal and spatial variations of GPS TEC and phase during auroral

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Temporal and spatial changes of GPS total electron content (TEC) and
   phase variation, called phase scintillation, during auroral substorms
   and breakups are investigated in the context of horizontal equivalent
   ionospheric currents and estimated vertical current amplitudes derived
   from ground magnetometer network using the spherical elementary current
   method. GPS phase scintillation is computed for sampling rate of 50 Hz
   by specialized GPS scintillation receivers from the Canadian High Arctic
   Ionospheric Network (CHAIN). A proxy phase scintillation index is
   obtained from dual frequency measurements of geodetic-quality GPS
   receivers sampling at 1 Hz, which include globally distributed receivers
   of RT-IGS network that are monitored by the Canadian Geodetic Survey in
   near-real-time. Based on analysis of four cases, it is shown that GPS
   phase scintillation maps to regions of strong westward electrojet and to
   the poleward edge of the eastward electrojet. For substorm onsets,
   auroral breakups and substorm intensifications, the ionospheric pierce
   points with moderate to strong phase scintillation associated with TEC
   enhancements map to regions of intense westward electrojet interfacing
   with the eastward electrojet near the boundaries between downward Region
   1 and upward Region 1/ Region 2 currents in the Harang discontinuity
   region, where intense auroral emission was observed for some of the
   cases studied. Energetic particle precipitation in this dynamic region
   results in steep electron density gradients and drifting irregularities
   that are the cause of GPS phase variation.},

   1890, bark scorpions (Buthidae C.L. Koch, 1837) is revised, using a
   novel approach to species delimitation. A phylogenetic analysis, based
   on 112 morphological characters and 1078 aligned DNA nucleotides from
   the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (COI) gene, provided
   the framework for placing singletons from geographically disparate
   localities (and often with suboptimal preservation) using COI
   minibar-codes, thereby enlarging the taxon sample for diagnosis and
   delimitation of morphological species. Six new species are described,
   tripling the known diversity in the Glade to nine: Centruroides
   berstoni, sp. nov.; Centruroides catemacoensis, sp. nov.; Centruroides
   chanae, sp. nov.; Centruroides cuauhmapan, sp. nov.; Centruroides

Abstract = {The relationships among the genera of fungus gnats in the mycetophilid
   subfamily Leiinae are unclear, and the monophyly of this group is
   questionable. This monograph provides an extensive phylogenetic study of
   the Leiinae based on morphological data from a large taxonomic sample,
   including all genera that have ever been assigned to the subfamily and a
   wide outgroup sampling to properly test subfamilial monophyly. A data
   matrix with 128 morphological features of 117 terminal taxa was carried
   out under parsimony using different implicit weight schemes. All
   recovered topologies support a monophyletic Leiinae that is more
   restricted than the usual delimitation of the subfamily. We found no
   consistent evidence that a Glade with Docosia Winnertz, Novakia Strobl,
   Ectrepesthoneura Enderlein, and Tetragoneura Winnertz group together
   with the remaining genera of Leiinae. A name with subfamily
   rank-Tetragoneurinae, already present in the literature-is used here to
   refer to this group. The allactoneurine genera Sticholeia Soli and
   Allactoneura de Meijere form a Glade with the leiine genus Leiella and
   the genera of Manotinae, which is deeply nested within the Leiinae. The
   male terminalia patterns found within the subfamily are analyzed and
   illustrated. A classification for the Leiinae is proposed grouping 33
   genera in seven clades ranked as tribes: Selkirkiini Enderlein,
   Megophthalmidiini, trib. nov., Rondaniellini, trib. nov., Cycloneurini
   Shaw and Shaw, Manotini Edwards, Anomalomyiini, trib. nov., and Leiini
   Edwards. A key for the world genera of Leiinae is also provided. The
   Cretaceous mycetophilid fossil record is revisited and the biogeographic
   evolution of the Leiinae is discussed.},

Title = {Mixotrophic plankton and Synechococcus distribution in waters around
   Svalbard, Norway during June 2019},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to understand the influence of summer conditions (extended
   daylight, warmer temperature, increased meltwater, increased suspended
   load and nutrient chemistry) on the distribution of phytoplankton
   (diatoms \& flagellates) and picoplankton community in the surface
   waters off Svalbard, samples were collected from 6 locations around
   Svalbard onboard National Geographic Explorer vessel. Additionally,
   satellite data was obtained for surface temperature, chlorophyll a (chl
   a) and total suspended mass (TSM). Stations GnModden (S1), Bellsund
   (S4), Open Ocean (S5), and Magdalenefjorden (S6) were along the western
   coast while stations Storfjorden (S2) and Western Storfjorden (S3) were
   on the eastern side of Svalbard and open to Barents Sea.
   Phytoplankton abundance ranged from 4 to 49 x 10(3) cells L-1 and were
   dominated by dinoflagellates such as Perdinium, Protoperidinium,
   Dynophysis, Gyrodinium, Gymnodinium and Torodinium species while diatoms
   (Navicula) were found only in colder polar waters (S5 and 6).
   Flowcytometry data showed the predominance of Synechococcus sp. and its
   abundance varied from 0.8 x 10(5) cells L-1 (S5) to 4.3 x 10(5) cells
   L-1 (S4). The distribution of Synechococcus was positively correlated to
   nitrate (r = 0.838) and chl a (r = 0.915) while phytoplankton abundance
   had no correlation with chl a or nitrate. A weak positive linear
   relation between Synechococcus and TSM suggests that melting of glaciers
   and influx of land run-off may be playing some role in increasing the
   picoplankton load in these waters. The predominance of mixotrophic
   dinoflagellates alongwith ciliates like Strombidium in these waters
   suggests that grazing of picoplankton as well as bacteria might fuel
   their carbon demand. Our data reflected post-spring bloom conditions
   wherein Synechococcus were the dominant primary producers and microbial
   loop might play an important role in sustaining the mixotroph
   population.},

   Antarctica during austral summer 2016-17},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding of the coastal waters of Antarctica is crucial in
   determining the ocean-ice system response to climate change. In this
   study, using hydmgraphy data we have provided the observational evidence
   of anomalous warming (>1 degrees C) in the Prydz Bay during austral
   summer. Even though the warming was centred at 68 degrees S, 74 degrees
   E, the presence of warmer waters were also noticed close to the Amery
   Ice Shelf. The study further explored the causes and impact of this
   anomalous warming using satellite and re-analysis data. It was suggested
   that the advection of warmer waters towards the shelf region of the
   Prydz Bay between 72 degrees E and 75 degrees E was the main driver for
   the mixed layer warming. The surface heat flux played a weak role in the
   observed warming. The warm water advection and surface circulation
   during the observation period were anomalous compared to the normal
   pattern. The analysis further confirmed that warming caused a drastic
   reduction in sea-ice and chlorophyll in the Prydz Bay region. The study
   ascertains that regional oceanographic processes have significant
   implications on the sea-ice and biological productivity of the coastal
   waters of Antarctica.},

Abstract = {This study documents multi-proxy data representing surface water
   productivity and AMS 14C dates of box (BC3) and gravity (GC2) cores in
   the Central Basin of the northwestern Ross Sea. Based on AMS 14C dates,
   a comparison of sediment properties between BC3 and GC2 reveals that BC3
   records the complete Holocene (i.e., interglacial) history, which is
   correlated to the uppermost part of GC2. The lithostratigraphic
   succession of GC2 consists of the repetition of contrasting layers
   distinguished by the productivity proxies. In contrast to the uppermost
   sediment layer (i.e., interglacial), the subsurface sediment layer
   (i.e., deglacial) is distinctly characterized by very high biogenic
   components. Such pronounced biogenic remnants in the deglacial sediments
   are not explained exclusively by in situ enhanced productivity in the
   surface water. Our results, thus, suggest that eroded and reworked shelf
   sediments from a previous interglacial period enriched in biogenic
   components by the advancing ice sheet might be transported through the
   melt-water plumes from the grounding line to the Central Basin, to
   provide high geochemical properties of deglacial sediments. Thus, growth
   and retreat of the grounded ice sheet played an important role in
   glaciomarine sedimentation change in the Central Basin of the
   northwestern Ross Sea.},

Title = {Influences of size structure and post-bloom supply of phytoplankton on
   body size variations in a common Pacific Arctic bivalve (Macoma
   calcarea)},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The substantial loss of Arctic sea ice will alter marine ecosystems in
   many ways. Recent studies have reported a distributional shift in
   benthic macrofaunal biomass in the Pacific Arctic, likely caused by
   changes in food availability for benthic organisms. Here, we assessed
   the influence of differences in post-bloom supply of phytoplankton to
   the sediment on the growth of a common Pacific Arctic bivalve (Macoma
   calcarea) based on field and satellite observations, and feeding
   experiments. Among the sampling stations examined, the spatial
   distribution of M. calcarea body size showed clear variations and was
   associated with phytoplankton size structure during the post-bloom
   period. In addition, our feeding experiment exposing M. calcarea to
   different feeding treatments suggest that the continuous settlement of
   fresh phytoplankton is more important for the bivalve?s growth than the
   total amount of phytoplankton settlement. This could explain the
   significant linkage between M. calcarea body size and phytoplankton size
   structure during the post-bloom period, because the larger phytoplankton
   represent an influx of fresh phytoplankton to the sediment and hereby
   support better growth and/ or longevity of bivalves. Our study provides
   novel insights into a variety of processes related to the growth of M.
   calcarea and its relationship with the phytoplankton community.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal variability of sea-ice and ocean parameters over the
   Arctic Ocean in response to a warming climate},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The fast receding sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean (AO) has
   implications for the global climate. Changes in the sea-ice dynamics
   cause variations in ocean physical and biogeochemical parameters. An
   ensemble of simulations from the `Community Earth System Model'
   (CESM2-WACCM), part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), is utilized for years 1850-2100. The
   regional differences in sea-ice parameters are highlighted over seven
   marginal seas in the AO. The maximum difference in sea-ice heat content
   (similar to 4.5 x 10(8) J m(-2)) is obtained in the East Siberian Sea,
   central AO, and along the east coast of Greenland in March. The sea
   surface temperature has higher temporal variability in the Barents Sea,
   Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea in September, which confines the Fram
   Strait and the Barents Sea regions in March. In September, the sea-ice
   concentration shows large (>30\%) temporal variations in the East
   Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, Beaufort Sea, and along the coast of
   Greenland. Sea surface temperature is projected to increase by 6 degrees
   C over the Chukchi Sea by the year 2100. In response to sea-ice melting,
   a decline in sea-ice thickness and reduction of sea surface salinity up
   to 2.5 psu is observed in the future relative to the present in some
   parts of the AO. The advection of Atlantic water and its wind-driven
   mixing causes maximum winter-time warming in the Svalbard region over
   the eastern Greenland Sea. The future projections indicate the ice-free
   surface during September in the AO by the year 2050.},

Abstract = {The natural system in the Arctic has been under rapid changes, such as
   warmer atmosphere, shrinking sea ice cover, deteriorating ice sheet and
   thawing permafrost for several decades. Various feedback mechanisms with
   the global system may accelerate the changes both in the Arctic and the
   global earth. The Arctic changes have been giving influences on local
   residents, while many nations have economic and political concerns with
   the Arctic. Hence, multidisciplinary approaches are encouraged so that
   the discernment gained from the Arctic research may activate
   decision-makers and also the global citizens. The Sixth International
   Symposium on Arctic Research, held online from March to April 2020,
   addressed the importance of interdisciplinary approach with special
   emphasis on research from the social sciences and humanities. This
   special issue collected papers which span many disciplines to identify
   changes in the Arctic environment and society, and to discuss possible
   future sustainable development.},

Title = {Green spaces as an indicator of urban sustainability in the Arctic
   cities: Case of Nadym},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Green spaces have recently received wide acknowledgement for urban
   sustainability benefits and are mentioned in the Sustainable Development
   Goals SDGs Target 11.7. The article aims to address the knowledge gap on
   indicators used for assessment of green spaces for urban sustainability
   in the Arctic using an example of Nadym, Russia which is illustrative of
   compact cities built during the Soviet time using a system of
   microrayons. Different indicators implemented by international
   organizations for assessment of green spaces are compared with
   indicators used in Russia. Utilizing very high-resolution WorldView-3
   satellite image and open source data, the quantity and quality of green
   spaces are estimated with high accuracy. In addition to traditionally
   used indicators of share of green space per capita, share of public
   spaces for common use within walking distance to assess availability and
   accessibility of green spaces, the paper suggests importance of taking
   into account governance, distribution, and composition using analysis of
   historic legacies, municipal budget allocation for green space
   maintenance, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values. Such
   detailed view can enrich discussions about green spaces as sources for
   resilience both at the local and global levels, in comparison with other
   cities and across countries.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The polar region is the gateway of the magnetospheric processes induced
   due to the solar events; through which Sun-illuminated plasma enter into
   the polar ionosphere. In this paper we are presenting the comparative
   study of the South Pole B-spline ionospheric scintillation model and
   ionospheric scintillation/total electron content (TEC) comparison tool
   (that uses only observed data) associated with the three famous
   geomagnetic storm case studies over Antarctica during the year 2013, 17
   March, 07 June, and 02 October respectively. A few significant
   Antarctica research studies related to the geomagnetic storm time
   scintillation investigations and their outcomes are also reviewed. Our
   results show weak phase scintillation and almost no amplitude
   scintillation occurs during the dark winter month in Antarctica and the
   scintillations mostly appear due to the irregularities generated through
   cusp/auroral precipitation. We have observed significant phase
   scintillation in the dusk sector and premagnetic-midnight sectors during
   the winter storm. However, during the summer geomagnetic storms, we have
   observed both the amplitude and phase scintillation in the pre and post
   magnetic noon sectors over Antarctica. The discussed comparative case
   studies corroborate the available research literature to date and
   presents additional information on the storm time ionospheric
   scintillation in Antarctica due to geomagnetic storms.},

Title = {Near-tropopause bias in the Russian radiosonde-observed air temperature
   during the YOPP special observing periods in 2018},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Taking advantage of a unique configuration of upper-atmospheric
   observing stations, we used enhanced radiosonde observations acquired
   during the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP) at Ice Base Cape Baranova in
   2018 to quantify the observational bias of a nearby station, i.e., GMO
   IM. E. K. Fedorova located 184 km to the southeast. Radiosonde
   observations from Fedorova are transmitted to the Global
   Telecommunications System and thus assimilated into numerical forecast
   products; however, those from Baranova are not, providing a situation
   favorable for quantifying observational bias. In comparison with the
   background field of the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, the Fedorova
   temperature profile exhibited cold bias in the lower stratosphere during
   the cold season in addition to a periodic warm/cold bias dipole in the
   upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. It is concluded that such bias
   is the product of both radiosonde sensor error and radar inaccuracies at
   Russian observational stations, given a similar result found at the
   Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk station.},

Title = {Submarine landforms and seismic facies in Borgen Bay, Anvers Island:
   Imprints of the past glacial behaviour and climate influence in the
   Western Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The glacimarine processes in the Western Antarctic Peninsula have been
   intensified since the ``Little Ice Age{''}. These have been recorded in
   the distribution and shape of glacial submarine landforms and glacial
   sub-bottom stratigraphy. In this study, the dominant factors of the past
   ice flow behaviour and glacimarine sedimentary processes in Bo spacing
   diaeresis rgen Bay, Anvers Island, are identified and analyzed. The
   results indicate that the outer bay linear features are associable to
   the past ice flow during the Last Glacial Maximum. After that, a general
   deglaciation period occurred, with some readvances and short stillstand,
   interpreted by the presence of moraines and small transverse ridges. The
   presence of ``pinning points{''} on the coast, could affect the glacier
   movements and favour the generation of moraines. Differences in the ice
   flow behaviour between the bay arms, are due to factors such as
   bathymetry, and the size of the drainage basin and glacier front. Main
   sedimentary processes are ice-rafting and subglacial flows, marked by
   chaotic seismic facies, and gravity flows identified by monticulated and
   transparent seismic facies, and also sediment plumes contribution,
   creating laminated facies in the proximal area basins. Those sedimentary
   mechanisms and landforms agree with a wet polar climate, but some of
   them would indicate a warmer climate shifting, that is necessary to
   prove with systematic future measurements.},

Title = {Dog and human from Raven's perspective: An interpretation of Raven myths
   of Alaskan Athabascans},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Raven appears as an important character in many Alaskan Athabascan
   myths. He is depicted as a powerful shaman who transforms the world
   through magic. In this paper, I analyze an often-neglected motif of
   Alaskan Athabascan Raven stories: Raven as Dog-eaters. I use
   mythological texts and ethnographic data collected in prior studies and
   from my fieldwork in the community of Nikolai, Alaska. In some Alaskan
   Athabascan myths, Raven has a strong appetite for dog meat and assists
   his neighbors who slaughter their dogs for him. This motif seems to
   describe a sacrificial practice whereby Raven, as a transformer,
   receives gifts of food in exchange for providing spiritual services and
   protection. However, in real life, Northern Athabascans do not practice
   typical animal sacrifice involving domestic animals. In addition, they
   do not regard dogs as being suitable for human consumption. This raises
   several questions. What is the significance of dogs in Alaskan
   Athabascan societies? Why is Raven thought to be fond of dog meat in
   traditional Alaskan Athabascan stories? How can we explain this motif of
   ``Dog as Raven's Delicacy{''} through an ethnography of human-dog-raven
   relations in Alaskan Athabascan societies? This paper addresses these
   questions from the perspectives of comparative mythology, ethology and
   the storytelling strategy.},

Title = {Development of remote HF wave receiver in the backlobe direction of the
   SuperDARN Hokkaido East radar: Initial observations},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We have been operating remote high frequency (HF) wave receivers for the
   SuperDARN Hokkaido East radar in Nagoya (1092 km away from the radar)
   and Rikubetsu (a few tens of m away from the radar antenna) since 2014
   to monitor the ionospheric environment and its changes. One receiver set
   consists of a USRP-N210 receiver unit, Ubuntu Linux PC and dipole/loop
   antenna. Using the remote receiver data it is possible to monitor the
   upward/ downward motion of the ionosphere at the ionospheric reflection
   point of the HF radar backlobe beams emitted toward the Nagoya area. The
   usage of the SuperDARN (backlobe) beams has the following advantages
   over other instruments such as HF Doppler systems: (1) SuperDARN
   Backlobe beams also have high directivity, so that it is possible to
   observe strong echoes at the remote area more than 1000 km away from the
   radar. (2) Since the SuperDARN radars emit pulse waves instead of
   continuous waves, it is possible to identify the travel time from the
   radar to the receiver. The initial results of the observation of
   ionospheric perturbations using the remote HF wave receiver of the
   SuperDARN Hokkaido East radar are described.},

Title = {Differences in local perceptions about climate and environmental changes

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study aims to deepen the understanding of the impact of climate
   change on human societies in arctic areas, and to consider the
   adaptations made by these societies. Previous studies have focused on
   local perceptions, which should be key to developing processes and
   solutions, by taking into consideration all stakeholders in order to
   integrate their views with scientific knowledge. We aim to discern the
   appropriate quality of perceptions: in other words, what range of
   perception is needed to ascertain adaptation strategies. This study
   clarified different perceptions of climate change among local residents
   in a small community in eastern Siberia where various environmental
   changes, such as permafrost thaw, have occurred in recent years or are
   in progress. Structured questionnaire surveys and unstructured
   interviews were conducted in Khayakhsyt Village, Sakha Republic. The
   results showed that drought is a serious, focal climatic event in this
   area, and that local residents have historically adapted to this event
   by increasing the number of artificial ponds extant using their
   developed ethnogeographical knowledge of the thawing water stream. Thus,
   even under the recent precipitation increase, not all participants
   mentioned the observed climate trends, while the memory of drought
   persisted within and influenced community perceptions.},

   species: Acanthischium maculatum Amyot \& Serville, 1843 (with ten color
   varieties proposed by Stal {[}1872]), Acanthischium haglundi Stal, 1866,
   Acanthischium superbum Haviland, 1931, and Acanthischium invium Elkins,
   1961. A taxonomic revision and a morphological phylogenetic analysis
   were carried out to test species limits and to propose a hypothesis of
   evolutionary relationships. As a result of the phylogenetic analysis,
   Acanthischium is characterized on its external morphology by the
   elongate postocular region, posterior margin of the pronotum with
   spines, ventral surface of protrochanter with apical and basal
   protuberances, profemur wider than mesofemur, and protibia strongly
   curved. After the taxonomic revision we propose nine valid species,
   taking into consideration characters of external morphology, male and
   female genitalia, and color patterns: Acanthischium dimidiatum Stal,
   1859 stat. rev.; Acanthischium flaviceps Stal, 1872 stat. rev.;
   Acanthischium haglundi Stal, 1866; Acanthischium kuna sp. nov. from
   Panama and Colombia; Acanthischium maculatum Amyot \& Serville, 1843;
   Acanthischium meloae sp. nov. from Suriname; Acanthischium nigrum Stal,
   1872 stat. rev.; Acanthischium semiflavum Stal,1872 stat. rev.; and
   Acanthischium superbum Haviland, 1931. We further synonymize A. invium
   Elkins, 1961 with A. superbum. All but one of the species - A. flaviceps
   - were included in the phylogenetic analysis, in which Acanthischium was
   found to be monophyletic, with the following set of relationships: (A.
   haglundi + (A. nigrum + (A. dimidiatum (A. maculatum, A. semiflavum, A.
   kuna, A. meloae, A. superbum)))). The resulting phylogenetic pattern
   indicate a body color transition from drab to more vivid ones, such as
   orange or red. The species exhibiting red and orange colorations are
   found in a clade, suggesting an underlying biological phenomenon, such
   as wasp mimetism.},

Title = {SYSTEMATICS OF THE RELICTUAL ASIAN SCORPION FAMILY PSEUDOCHACTIDAE
   GROMOV, 1998, WITH A REVIEW OF CAVERNICOLOUS, TROGLOBITIC, AND
   TROGLOMORPHIC SCORPIONS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Abstract = {The first integrative systematic revision of the relictual Asian
   scorpion family Pseudochactidae Gromov, 1998, making use of an
   unprecedented collection of material acquired during several expeditions
   to most of the type localities, is presented. The subfamilies, genera
   and species of Pseudochactidae are revised based on a phylogenetic
   analysis of 140 morphological characters and 8608 nucleotide base pairs
   of concatenated DNA sequence from two nuclear and three mitochondrial
   gene loci, and a multivariate statistical analysis of 22 ratios and 8
   counts for 60 specimens. Three subfamilies, four genera and six species
   are recognized in the family. Troglokhammouaninae, subfam. nov., is
   created to restore the monophyly of the nominotypical subfamily
   Pseudochactinae Gromov, 1998. Aemngvantom, gen. nov., is created to
   accommodate Aemngvantom lao (Lourenco, 2012), comb. nov., and
   Aemngvantom thamnongpaseuam gen. et sp. nov. Four new synonyms are
   presented: Troglokhammouanus louisanneorum Lourenco, 2017 =
   Troglokhammouanus steineri Lourenco, 2007, syn. nov.; Vietbocap
   thienduongensis Lourenco and Pham, 2012 = Vietbocap canhi Lourenco and
   Pham, 2010, syn. nov.; Vietbocap aurantiacus Lourenco et al., 2018 = V.
   canhi, syn. nov.; Vietbocap quinquemilia Lourenco et al., 2018 = V.
   canhi, syn. nov. Revised diagnoses of the subfamilies, genera and
   species, with comparative images, a key and distribution maps are
   provided, along with a summary of available data on ecology and
   conservation status, where applicable. Among the Southeast Asian
   pseudochactids, all of which appear to be obligately cavernicolous, the
   three species of Vietbocapinae Lourenco, 2012, are highly troglomorphic
   whereas the sole species of Troglokhammouaninae is barely so. Applying
   recently revised definitions of the Schiner-Racovitza system for the
   classification of subterranean organisms, only Vietbocapinae can be
   considered troglobitic. The global diversity of cavernicolous,
   troglomorphic and troglobitic scorpions is similarly revisited and a key
   to ecological classification of cavernicolous and troglomorphic
   scorpions presented. The world totals of troglomorphic vs. troglobitic
   scorpions are currently 58 vs. 28 species, in 29 vs. 17 genera and 15
   vs. 13 families, respectively.},

Title = {SYSTEMATICS OF THE ``GIANT{''} RICINULEI (RICINOIDIDAE: RICINOIDES) OF
   WEST AFRICA, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF FIVE NEW SPECIES AND COMPARATIVE
   MORPHOLOGY OF THE MALE COPULATORY APPARATUS},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Abstract = {The Ricinulei Thorell, 1876, or ``hooded tick-spiders,{''} are among the
   rarest and least studied arachnid orders. Ricinoides Ewing, 1929, the
   only Old World genus of extant ricinuleids, with 11 species described
   from tropical West Africa, is the most neglected of the three genera
   currently recognized. A lack of attention to the systematics of
   Ricinoides has created a disparity between its taxonomic diversity and
   that of the New World genera, Cryptocellus Westwood, 1874, and
   Pseudocellus Platnick, 1980, in which many new species have been
   described in recent decades. The present contribution provides a revised
   diagnosis of Ricinoides, which includes two new, putative synapomorphies
   for the genus and addresses the systematics and morphology of a group of
   West African species, which includes the world's largest ricinuleids and
   the type species of the genus. This group of nine species, referred to
   as the ``giant{''} Ricinulei, shares a unique combination of characters,
   many of which appear to be unique to the group, and appears to be
   monophyletic. Four species of this group are redescribed, with revised
   diagnoses, based on reexamination of the type material: Ricinoides
   afzelii (Thorell, 1892), from Sierra Leone; Ricinoides atewa Naskrecki,
   2008, from Ghana; Ricinoides feae (Hansen, 1921), from Guinea-Bissau;
   and Ricinoides westermannii (Guerin-Meneville, 1838), from Togo. Five
   new species are described, raising the number of species in the genus to
   16: Ricinoides eburneus, sp. nov., and Ricinoides taii, sp. nov., from
   Cote d'Ivoire; Ricinoides iita, sp. nov., from Nigeria; Ricinoides
   kakum, sp. nov., from Ghana; and Ricinoides nzerekorensis, sp. nov.,
   from Guinea. Comparative illustrations of the adult morphology are
   presented for all nine species. The male copulatory apparatus is
   described and illustrated in detail, and new terminology and characters
   presented. The female spermathecae are described and illustrated for six
   species in which the females are known, representing the first
   illustrated comparison of these structures in African ricinuleids.
   Geographical distribution records are revised and updated for the
   different species, and their distributions mapped.},

Title = {Revisiting Antarctic sea-ice decadal variability since 1980},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sea-ice extent (SIE) satellite data has been stored and studied over the
   past four decades. Antarctica's SIE has recently attained both its
   maximum (2014) and its minimum (2017) values, which raised questions
   regarding how SIE variability is evolving. Here we discuss a new
   approach to improve our understanding of SIE variability for the
   1982-1993 and 2006-2017 periods. Using a probability density function
   and examining the mean and standard deviation of SIE distributions as a
   function of seasonality. Results show that the whole Southern Ocean
   presented both mean and standard deviation growth in all seasons. The
   largest SIE distribution difference for Southern Ocean between 1982-1993
   and 2006-2017 periods was observed in July, August and September (JAS),
   during which all individual Sea sectors presented growth of the SIE
   mean. Not only different Sea sectors showed different variations, but
   the SIE data distributions from the same Sea sector yielded different
   changes with differing seasons. January, February and March (JFM)
   together with April, May and June were the seasons with the largest SIE
   decadal variability for Weddell, Indian, Amundsen and West Pacific Sea
   Sectors, while the Ross Sea showed greater SIE variability during JAS
   and October November, December. This methodology showed consistent
   results with the traditional SIE trend calculation and introduced a new
   quantification index for evaluating the differences between two
   distributions not necessarily connected in time.},

Abstract = {Fungi have been recognized as a prolific source of bioactive compounds
   with a wide spectrum of bioactivities, nevertheless, the information
   about marine polar fungi is scarce. Due to this fact, the purpose of
   this study was to investigate the antiproliferative activity and
   antioxidant capacity of the extracts of three fungal strains isolated
   from the White Sea (Coprinellus diseminatus, Simplicillium lamellicola
   and Akanthomyces muscarius). The anti proliferative activity test was
   carried out by the SRB method and the cell lines tested were A549,
   HBL-100, HeLa, SW1573, T-47D and WiDr. The antioxidant capacity was
   measured employing the ABTS and galvinoxyl methods. The strain that
   showed the most antiproliferative activity was A. muscarius; it
   demonstrated activity in all the extracts tested, at least against two
   of the six tested cell lines, also the biomass ethanolic extract and the
   culture broth ethyl acetate extract of Coprinellus diseminatus showed
   antiproliferative activity against some of the tested cell lines. In the
   antioxidant capacity test, the ethyl acetate extracts of the culture
   broth of the three strains showed more activity. This indicates that
   arctic marine-derived fungi are capable to produce bioactive metabolites
   with antiproliferative activity and antioxidant capacity, comparable to
   other marine-derived fungi, and in some cases even more active than
   known medicinal mushrooms.},

Title = {Comparison of interferometer calibration techniques for improved
   SuperDARN elevation angles},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The high frequency radars in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network
   (SuperDARN) estimate the elevation angles of returned backscatter using
   interferometric techniques. These elevation angles allow the ground
   range to the scattering point to be estimated, which is crucial for the
   accurate geolocation of ionospheric measurements. For elevation angles
   to be accurately estimated, it is important to calibrate the
   interferometer measurements by determining the difference in the signal
   time delays caused by the difference in the electrical path lengths from
   the main array and the interferometer array to the point at which the
   signals are correlated. This time delay is known as i(diff). Several
   methods have been proposed to estimate i(diff) using historical
   observations; these methods are summarised in this paper. Comparisons of
   the t(diff) estimates from the different calibration methods are
   presented and sources of uncertainty discussed. The effect of errors in
   the estimated i(diff) value on the accuracy of geolocation is evaluated
   and discussed. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for
   both scientific SuperDARN data users and SuperDARN radar operators.},

Title = {Review of forecast skills for weather and sea ice in supporting Arctic
   navigation},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Uncertainties in weather and sea-ice forecasts must be taken into
   consideration in Arctic shipping. The changing Arctic Ocean is
   characterized by diminishing sea-ice extent. Extremely developed
   cyclones, unexpectedly high ocean waves, and rapid sea-ice drift make
   navigation difficult. How state-of-the-art forecasts produced by
   operational weather centers can be used correctly and effectively by end
   users (e.g., ship crews and operation companies) is an emerging issue.
   In this synthesis paper, characteristics of the predictabilities of
   weather, sea ice, and ocean waves under extreme atmospheric conditions
   over the Arctic Ocean are presented, with particular focus on the impact
   of additional radiosonde observations on reducing uncertainties in
   forecasts. The usefulness of an onboard tool to share forecasting
   information with ship crew and researchers is also demonstrated, and is
   recognized as an achievement of the Japanese Arctic research project.
   Finally, remaining issues with respect to a sustainable Arctic observing
   network are discussed.},

Title = {On the coagulated pancake ice formation: Observation in the refreezing
   Chukchi Sea and comparison to the Antarctic consolidated pancake ice},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Emergence of pancake ice in the western Arctic Ocean is understood to be
   an effect of the increasing wave activity. During the 2018 R/V Mirai
   field campaign in the refreezing Chukchi Sea, we obtained observational
   evidence of sea ice formation that resembled the pancake
   cycle?frazil/pancake/consolidated pancake ice?first discovered and known
   to be ubiquitous in the Antarctic. Apparently, R/V Mirai encountered a
   sequence of environmental conditions that were conducive to producing
   coagulated pancake ice, of which the formation process was relatable to
   the Antarctic consolidated pancake ice. We investigate how pancake ice
   form in two different environments: the Antarctic marginal ice zone
   (MIZ) is adjacent to the vigorous Antarctic Circumpolar region whereas
   the western Arctic Ocean is surrounded by sea ice and land. We found
   that a key distinction between the two regimes is that rafting is less
   likely in the western Arctic Ocean due to its wave climate, meaning the
   coagulated pancake ice is thinner than the Antarctic consolidated
   pancake ice. As the sea ice extent declines, thinner coagulated pancake
   ice may dominate the refreezing ocean, which affects the melting and
   possibly the broader Arctic climate.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The sea ice coverage in the summer Arctic Ocean from the Beaufort to
   Laptev Seas continues to decrease, and the largest waves in the western
   Arctic open waters are increasing year by year. By looking into the
   historical wave events in the ERA-Interim reanalysis data, we discovered
   that more than half of the extreme events are caused by cyclones that
   are originating in the Arctic Ocean as well as in the mid-latitudes.
   During September, when the icefree water area becomes largest each year,
   the percentage of extreme events caused by cyclones has increased from
   around 50\% to almost 80\% in the last four decades. Moreover, the
   locations of these extreme events are spreading from the Chukchi Sea to
   the east and west along the coasts and towards the central Arctic Ocean
   as depicted in the characteristic changes of the probability of sea
   states over the past decades. These findings are pertinent for safe
   navigation along the Northern Sea Route.},

Title = {Distance sampling surveys: using components of detection and total error
   to select among approaches},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {210},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wildlife population estimators often require formal adjustment for
   imperfect detection of individuals during surveys. Conventional distance
   sampling (CDS) and its extensions (mark-recapture distance sampling
   {[}MRDS], temporary emigration distance sampling {[}TEDS]) are popular
   approaches for producing unbiased estimators of wildlife abundance.
   However, despite extensive discussion and development of distance
   sampling theory in the literature, deciding which of these alternatives
   is most appropriate for a particular scenario can be confusing. Some of
   this confusion may stem from an incomplete understanding of how each
   approach addresses the components of the detection process. Here we
   describe the proper application of CDS, MRDS, and TEDS approaches and
   use applied examples to help clarify their differing assumptions with
   respect to the components of the detection process. To further aid the
   practitioner, we summarize the differences in a decision tree that can
   be used to identify cases where a more complex alternative (e.g., MRDS
   or TEDS) may be appropriate for a given survey application. Although the
   more complex approaches can account for additional sources of bias, in
   practical applications one also must consider estimator precision.
   Therefore, we also review the concept of total estimator error in the
   context of comparing competing methods for a given application to aid in
   the selection of the most appropriate distance sampling approach.
   Finally, we detail how the use of more advanced techniques (i.e.,
   informed priors, open-population distance sampling models, and
   integrated modeling approaches) can further reduce total estimator error
   by leveraging information from existing and ongoing data collection. By
   synthesizing the existing literature on CDS, MRDS, TEDS and their
   extensions, in conjunction with the concepts of total estimator error
   and the components of the detection process, we provide a comprehensive
   guide that can be used by the practitioner to more efficiently,
   effectively, and appropriately apply distance sampling in a variety of
   settings.},

Abstract = {We present herein the first phylogenetic analysis of the genus Chelidura
   and the taxonomic revision of the genus Chelidurella, stat. restit.,
   based on DNA sequences. The results confirm the generic status of
   Chelidurella Verhoeff, 1902 and Mesochelidura Verhoeff, 1902, and they
   are removed from the synonymy with Chelidura and reinstated as valid
   genera. Many individual Chelidurella species are defined based on the
   combination of a few variable characters on the pygidium and forceps,
   and the systematics and phylogeny of this genus are unclear. The
   validity of most of the species is revisited here by molecular
   phylogenetic analyses, and individual morphological characters are
   evaluated for their relevance in the identification of all described
   species. We describe two new species to science, Chelidurella galvagnii
   Kirstova \& Kocarek, sp. nov. from Austria, and C. pseudovignai Kocarek
   \& Kirstova, sp. nov. from Italy and Austria; two species, C. guentheri
   Galvagni, 1994 and C. tatrica Chladek, 2017 are newly synonymized.
   Critical diagnostic characters are illustrated, and an identification
   key for males of Chelidurella is provided.},

Abstract = {The Southern Ocean is widely recognized for its unique benthic
   ecosystems, but benthic sampling has been largely restricted to
   shallower continental zones and much remains to be learned about the
   biodiversity in the bathyal and abyssal zones. In this study, we
   collected and investigated the deep-sea benthic habitat using geological
   dredges, a multiple corer, and a bait trap on-board the R/V Hakuho Maru
   in bathyal to abyssal depths between the latitude of 39 degrees 38.16 `
   S-66 degrees 36.03 ` S and the longitude of 62 degrees 19.55 ` W-67
   degrees 37.95 ` E in the Southern Ocean and the surrounding subantarctic
   region, focusing on West Antarctica. We carried out 20 geological
   dredges, 14 multiple corers, and a bait trap survey. Here, we present
   the taxonomic and distributional records of 180 species of Annelida,
   Mollusca, Ostracoda, Decapoda, and Echinodermata identified from our
   samples, including species-level identifications and detailed occurrence
   information where possible. Although West Antarctica is a highly
   investigated area for benthic biodiversity around Antarctica, our
   collection includes the annelid Flabelligena hakuhoae Jimi et al. 2020
   which was new to science at the time of collection, and other
   potentially undescribed species of Annelida, Ostracoda, Asteroidea, and

Title = {Differences between in-situ ozonesonde observations and satellite
   retrieved ozone vertical profiles across Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In situ ozonesonde observations across nine Antarctic stations were used
   to validate the vertical profiles retrieved by the satellite-based
   Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument from 2004 to 2019. Intra-annual
   variations in the ozone concentration, along with the shape of the
   vertical profiles are well reproduced by the MLS with differences in the
   range of +/- 20\%, although seasonally the differences were as high as
   60\%. The largest differences were also observed during the spring
   (September-October-November), when largescale ozone depletion takes
   place over Antarctica, with MLS overestimating concentrations at almost
   all the stations, except the northernmost stations of Marambio and
   Dumont d'Urville. This has implications for the estimations of ozone
   recovery over Antarctica based on MLS. The under-estimation or
   over-estimation in the MLS data caused differences up to +/- 1 K day(-1)
   in the estimated heating rate. For the whole dataset, a good correlation
   (R-2 > 0.9, p < 0.001) was seen at all the stations except at Maitri,
   where the correlation coefficient was lower but still significant (R-2 =
   0.77, p < 0.001). These results show that although the MLS data match
   the in-situ observations over longer averaging periods, for individual
   profiles the discrepancies are much higher and need to be considered
   when computing the ozone impacts using MLS data.},

Abstract = {High-resolution data on spatial variations in the productivity of
   bryophytes and the mass of the organic layer are important components in
   geochemical models for northern forests. We investigated spatial
   variations in growth rates of the feather moss Hylocomium splendens and
   the thickness of the organic layer in relation to environmental factors
   on a north-facing slope in Interior Alaska. The forest floor on the 600
   m x 600 m slope was classified into four types, i.e., Classes I-IV,
   characterized mainly by the dominance of leaf litter, H. splendens,
   Pleurozium schreberi, and Sphagnum spp., respectively. Spatial
   autocorrelation analyses showed clustering patterns for some tree and
   forest floor variables, which were associated with the distribution of
   the four classes on the slope. Mean growth (length) rates of H.
   splendens were high in Class II, while growth rates by weight were high
   in Class I due to a high weight-to-length ratio of shoots. The thickness
   of the organic layer in bryophyte patches ranged from 6.0 to 40.7 cm and
   was also controlled by slope orientation. The presence of large trees,
   particularly Betula neoalaskana, mediated the relationship between
   topography and forest floor characteristics.},

Abstract = {Ocean observation research theme under ArCS project, ?Theme 4:
   Observational research on Arctic Ocean environmental changes?, aimed to
   elucidate the status and trends of ongoing Arctic Ocean environmental
   changes and to evaluate their impacts on Arctic marine ecosystem and the
   global climate system. For these purposes, we conducted field
   observations, mooring observations, laboratory experiments, numerical
   modeling, and international collaborative research focusing on the
   Pacific Arctic Region (PAR) and from Pan-Arctic point of views. As a
   result, we have published several scientific studies on environmental
   changes and their impact on the climate and ecosystem. In this
   manuscript, we compiled these results with some concluding remarks. We
   found physical environmental changes of water cycle, sea-ice and ocean
   conditions, heat transport, and ocean mixing in the Arctic Ocean and
   surrounding areas. We also examined chemical properties, carbon, cycle,
   and ocean acidification in the Arctic Ocean. In addition, new findings
   regarding impacts of sea-ice reduction to primary productivities were
   published. For public outreach of Arctic research, we were able to
   develop an educational tool (a board game named ?The Arctic?) in
   collaboration with Themes 6 and 7.},

Title = {Observation of on-ice wind waves under grease ice in the western Arctic
   Ocean},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The significant reduction of the sea ice extent in the western Arctic
   has been observed by the sustained satellite observations since 1979.
   The opening ocean is now allowing waves to evolve and propagate under
   the presence of the Arctic sea ice. A better understanding of the
   wave-ice interaction is necessary for the safe shipping over the sea ice
   covered Arctic Ocean and to improve the Arctic climate projection.
   During R/V Mirai Arctic Expedition in October 2019, two drifting
   wave-buoys were concurrently deployed in the open ocean and the Arctic
   marginal ice zone (MIZ) with grease ice and pancake ice. The wave and
   sea ice conditions at the time of the deployments were documented in
   detail. Based on the wave buoy data and the sea ice edge estimated by a
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image, attenuation rates of waves under
   the grease ice are estimated. Good agreement in the frequency dependency
   of the wave attenuation rate is presented between the observational
   results and the theoretical prediction from the viscous model of Weber
   (1987). The agreement implies that the observed surface waves were
   attenuated by the viscous damping beneath grease ice. It is also found
   that the observed attenuation rates were generally lower than the
   previous studies. Several possible factors are discussed, such as the
   sea ice type, wind energy input, and uncertainties in the estimation of
   the attenuation rate.},

Title = {NARR-based analysis of changes in the mesoscale wind and temperature
   over the Hudson Bay Lowlands and their impact on the surface energy
   balance: 1979-2018},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Hudson Bay exerts a strong advective influence on the surface energy
   balance of the adjacent Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of Canada. The onshore
   winds are relatively cold and moist compared to the warmer and drier
   offshore winds. The contrasting thermal and humidity properties of these
   two air masses affect the partitioning of net radiation between the
   various heat fluxes over the HBL. We show that global warming has been
   accompanied by significant changes in the mesoscale wind regimes and the
   advective role of the Hudson Bay on the surface energy balance over the
   HBL. On average, we found a significant increasing trend in onshore wind
   frequency during the growing season of about 7\% over the past 40 years.
   The most pronounced increase in onshore winds of 17\% occurred in June
   during which ice cover on Hudson Bay has remained highly persistent over
   the past 40 years. The resulting shift from offshore to onshore winds
   dominance over the region has resulted in an enhancement of convective
   heat transfer to the atmosphere and a reduction of conductive heat
   transfer into the ground.},

Title = {Chondritic breccias: An optical microscopic classification},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Numerous meteorites are breccias, indicating asteroid collisions. Herein
   we systematically investigate brecciated chondrites to efficiently and
   quickly classify large numbers of breccias that are housed in
   organizations such as the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR).
   We observed 1024 chondrites in the NIPR collection only by using optical
   microscopy. Many terms have been proposed to describe breccias. In order
   to classify breccias in a short time, we propose a determinative chart
   only by optical microscopy from terminology previously proposed and our
   observations. Fragmental breccias consist of primordial lithology as a
   clast or a host among fragmental fine-grained minerals. If the lithology
   is apparently consistent throughout, it is considered a monomict
   breccia. Otherwise, it is provisionally called a fragmental breccia.
   Breccias can be classified according to evidence of in situ melting.
   Melt breccias contain unmelted clasts, which preserve the original
   chondritic textures, whereas melt rocks do not contain such clasts and
   represent nearly total melting.},

   velocities over Zhongshan Station, Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study, ion drift velocities measured by Digisonde instruments
   over Zhongshan Station (ZHS, geog. 69.38S, 76.38E), Antarctica, are
   compared with measurements from Super Dual Auroral Radar Network
   (SuperDARN) HF radars. For SuperDARN Syowa East (SYE) and Kerguelen
   (KER) radars that intersect with ZHS, a data set comprised of adjacent
   range gates from nearest radar beams is used. Digisonde ion drift
   measurements were projected onto the direction of co-located and
   concurrent line-of-sight SuperDARN velocities. A comparison of the
   velocities shows a clear correlation (R = 0.92) between the two data
   sets. Projected Digisonde velocity was found to be, on average, larger
   than the line-of-sight SuperDARN radar velocities by a factor of 1.7.
   Time dependence distributions of Digisonde-SuperDARN SYE radars showed
   that the larger velocity discrepancies are more located at the dawnside
   convection cell. Considering the known features of the high-latitude
   convection patterns at cusp latitude, the statistical results imply the
   velocity discrepancies are related to the differences in the temporal
   and spatial evolution of plasma structures.},

   2165 m deep). The petrography, geochemistry, and geochronology of these
   plutonic rocks were analyzed. Ar-Ar dating of biotite in the plutonic
   rocks yielded early Paleozoic ages of approximately 475 and 490 Ma,
   indicating that these rocks are likely related to Antarctic orogenies
   during the late Neo-proterozoic to early Paleozoic. In addition, the
   samples exhibited trace element compositions and low initial epsilon Nd
   values (-8 and -12) similar to those of rocks from western Dronning Maud
   Land and the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. Such similarities
   suggest that these plutonic rocks from the off-ridge portion of the
   Southwest Indian ridge were derived from western Dronning Maud Land or
   the Transantarctic Mountains and deposited by melting icebergs as
   dropstones.},

Abstract = {The method for calibrating elevation measurements at EKB ISTP SB RAS
   radar obtained for the period 20/09/2019-18/11/2019 is presented. The
   calibration method is a modernization of the method for calibrating
   radar by meteor trails. The main difference of the method is the use of
   not a statistically processed FitACF data, but the full waveform of the
   signals scattered on the meteor trails. Using the full waveform makes it
   possible to more reliably distinguish meteor scattering from other
   possible scattered signal sources, and to determine meteor heights from
   the trail lifetime using the NRLMSIS-00 model. A comparison of the
   results with the results of E-layer calibration method shows a good
   agreement. The first examples of regular elevation observations at the
   EKB ISTP SB RAS radar are presented, and their preliminary
   interpretation is given.},

Title = {Lessons learned from more than a decade of greenhouse gas flux
   measurements at boreal forests in eastern Siberia and interior Alaska},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We summarized our recently-published papers on greenhouse gas exchanges
   at two important boreal regions underlain by permafrost: eastern Siberia
   and interior Alaska. Relevant literatures were also referred to, and
   future research directions on the high-latitude terrestrial processes
   were suggested. Long-term monitoring of CO2 fluxes at the boreal forests
   revealed that anomalous weather and disturbances changed the CO2
   balance. More than a decade is required to return to a CO2 sink at
   burned forests in interior Alaska. Anomalous high precipitation altered
   the forest structure in eastern Siberia, shifting the
   overstory/understory contributions to the CO2 balance. The CH4 emissions
   were higher in the two boreal forests than in the other boreal forests.
   Upscaling the in-situ observations and comparisons with top-down
   approaches revealed considerable inconsistencies exist among the
   approaches. We recommend the following directions in future research.
   First, long-term monitoring is indispensable to detect the effect of
   climate change on ecosystems. Second, disturbance impacts, including
   fire, thermokarst, and wet spells, need to be quantified. Third, further
   observations are necessary for constraining CH4 exchange models.
   Finally, reconciling top-down and bottom-up approaches is required to
   reduce uncertainty. Prompt sharing of observed data and model products
   is crucial to improve our understanding of high-latitude processes.},

Title = {SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ISLAND-DWELLING KOGAIONIDAE
   (MAMMALIA, MULTITUBERCULATA) IN THE UPPERMOST CRETACEOUS OF TRANSYLVANIA
   (WESTERN ROMANIA)},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {456},
Pages = {1-109},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The latest Cretaceous kogaionid multituberculates from Transylvania
   (western Romania) were part of an endemic European clade of mammals that
   underwent an insular radiation at the end of the Cretaceous and then
   survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction that extinguished many
   groups of contemporary therians. Transylvanian kogaionids lived on what
   was an island during the latest Cretaceous-{''}Hateg Island{''}-and
   their fossils are found in the uppermost Campanian to upper
   Maastrichtian deposits of the Hateg, Rusca Montana, and southwestern
   Transylvanian basins. This fossil record has improved dramatically over
   the past several decades, in part resulting from our decade-long joint
   Romanian-American-Scottish fieldwork, and comprises one of the most
   impressive and complete archives of Mesozoic mammals, including not only
   jaws and teeth but several incomplete skulls and partial skeletons.
   We here review the fossil record of kogaionids from Transylvania. We
   report four new occurrences from the Hateg Basin, update information on
   previously described ones, and use our database to reassess the
   chronostratigraphical and geographical distribution of kogaionids and
   their evolutionary patterns.
   Although it was previously suggested that large and small kogaionids had
   largely mutually exclusive spatial distributions, we recognize the
   cooccurrence of small and large taxa in various units, suggesting a
   sympatric distribution across their entire chronostratigraphic range. We
   also identify a novel pattern: small kogaionids appear somewhat earlier
   than their larger relatives in all well-sampled sedimentary successions,
   suggesting that kogaionid colonizations of Hateg Island and component
   regions took place at small body size and that body size increased only
   later through local evolution. We find correlations between body size,
   preservation style, and sedimentary context, which give insight into
   kogaionid paleobiology and diversity. Larger kogaionids are represented
   more often by partial skulls and occasionally skeletons compared with
   small kogaionids, which are usually represented only by isolated teeth,
   regardless of provenance. Larger kogaionids currently have a higher
   recognized local taxic diversity than their smaller relatives. We
   hypothesize that this may be in part a consequence of preservational
   bias related to body size, as more complete specimens may be more easily
   diagnosed as distinct taxa than those that are represented by more
   fragmentary and/or incomplete fossils. If true, the taxic diversity of
   smaller kogaionids may currently be underestimated. Finally, we identify
   correspondence between sedimentary facies and preservation style.
   Red-colored fine-grained rocks, suggestive of well-drained, oxidized
   floodplain paleoenvironments, yield more complete specimens than drab,
   greenish or grayish sediments deposited in more poorly drained parts of
   the floodplain. This pattern may suggest habitat preferences for
   better-drained floodplain environments and a semifossorial lifestyle for
   some taxa.
   As the kogaionid fossil record improves, we can further test the
   hypotheses and patterns outlined above. The pace of new kogaionid
   discoveries by our team and others indicates that a more complete
   picture of kogaionid distribution, paleobiology, and evolution will
   emerge in the coming years, contributing to a more profound
   understanding of this peculiar group of island-dwelling Mesozoic
   mammals.},

Title = {THE OSTEOLOGY OF HAYA GRIVA (DINOSAURIA: ORNITHISCHIA) FROM THE LATE

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Abstract = {Haya griva is an early-diverging neornithischian
   ({''}hypsilophodontid{''}) dinosaur known from several well-preserved
   skulls and articulated postcranial skeletons, in addition to dozens of
   partial or isolated finds from the Upper Cretaceous Khugenetslavkant and
   Zos Canyon localities (Javkhlant Formation and equivalent beds) in the
   Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Collectively, nearly the entire skeletal
   anatomy of Haya is known, including partial growth series of skulls and
   femora. Detailed description and comparisons with other ornithischians,
   including novel anatomical information about the palate and braincase
   gleaned through high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, reveals
   a wealth of osteological data for understanding the growth and
   relationships of this key taxon. Though the Haya specimens span a wide
   size range, bone histology reveals that all are likely perinatal to
   subadult individuals, with specimens of intermediate age the most
   common, and skeletally mature specimens absent. Phylogenetic analyses
   place Haya as one of the few Asian members of Thescelosauridae, an
   important noncerapodan neornithischian group of the Late Cretaceous.},

Abstract = {Brazil has the longest coastline in South America with more than 7491 km
   of hydrologically and topologically complex continental margin. Despite
   its extensive coast, the sea anemone fauna of the country is sparsely
   known with only 54 species recorded. Difficulties of accessing Brazil's
   highly diversified coast and the historical small number of dredging
   expeditions and sea anemone taxonomists have contributed to the limited
   knowledge of its sea anemone diversity particularly in deep waters. Most
   species recorded from Brazil correspond to large, conspicuous intertidal
   species and only five species have been recorded from depths greater
   than 200 m: two small burrowing edwardslids and three hormathiids from
   the southern coast of Brazil. Here, we provide complete descriptions,
   images of external and internal anatomy, microanatomy, cnidae, and
   geographic distribution for 10 species, six off the coast of Brazil and
   four from the southern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, one of which
   is also present in the Southern Ocean. Four of the six species found in
   Brazil represent new records of geographically widespread species for
   the country and the remaining two endemic species have their geographic
   and bathymetric ranges significantly extended northward. As a result,
   the number of species known for the Brazilian coast is raised to 63
   species, 14 of which are known from the deep sea. We also recorded four
   deep-sea species in the south Mid-Atlantic Ridge (SMAR), including
   Actinernus mercedae, sp. nov., and two new records for the South
   Atlantic. We found that the deep-sea fauna of Brazil shares two deep-sea
   species with Argentina and two with the North Atlantic. Thus, La Plata
   River acts as a filter for shallow water species between Brazil and
   Argentina but is less effective for deep-sea anemones. The diversity of
   sea anemones recorded for SMAR shows similarities to the southwestern
   Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Finally, our finding of representatives of
   Bolocera in the SMAR and Actinoscyphia off the Brazilian coast suggests
   that they are bipolar genera with tropical emergence.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) is a seasonal
   migrator that feeds mainly on Antarctic krill at higher latitudes during
   the summer and travels to lower latitudes to breed in winter. A previous
   study using delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of baleen plates showed
   that pregnant Antarctic minke whales feed on Antarctic krill in the
   foraging season, with less feeding during the breeding season. However,
   long-term changes in the habitat use and diet of males remain unknown.
   In this study, we estimated the foraging habits of nine mature male
   Antarctic minke whales using the stable isotope signatures of baleen
   plates. From Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, it was found that
   Antarctic krill was the predominant prey of male whales, and prey
   species in lower latitudes were rarely incorporated into the baleen
   plates. This result is consistent with that of female Antarctic minke
   whales. Eight whales showed at least one oscillation in delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values, whereas one whale (AM246) showed no variation in
   delta N-15 values. This possibly indicates that AM246 remained in the
   Antarctic water year-round. Our results suggest multiple migration
   patterns of male Antarctic minke whales.},

Title = {Influence of the height of Antarctic ice sheet on its climate},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The influence of the height of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) on its
   climate is investigated through numerical modeling, using
   NCAR-CESM-CAM5, which is found to be one of the best performing models
   over the region. The investigation reveals that on the reduction of its
   height, the troposphere over Antarctica will become warmer and wetter,
   annual precipitation and snow accumulation would enhance, and there will
   be a net enhancement in southward energy transport towards the Antarctic
   from the lower latitudes. The response will be opposite if the height of
   the AIS increases. The effect is found to be driven by the radiation
   imbalance developed from the changes in the outgoing longwave radiation
   at the top of the atmosphere due to perturbations in the ice sheet's
   elevation. An increase (decrease) in precipitation will occur on
   reduction (enhancement) of the AIS, which will try to stabilize its
   height, but this will be accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the
   surface temperature, which would have an opposite effect. A significant
   influence of the AIS elevation was also felt on the surface winds,
   stationary waves, and the eddy-driven jet around the continent,
   highlighting the impact that changes in the height of AIS have on the
   surrounding atmospheric circulation.},

Abstract = {Arctic ecosystems are altered profoundly by climate changes. However,
   the responses of Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as
   their biodiversity to global warming remain largely unknown. This
   article provides comprehensive insights into the results and major
   findings from the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project ?
   an Arctic region research program initiated in Japan, which aims to
   address and advance our understanding of these uncertainties. Marine
   ecosystem studies have identified several biogeochemical processes that
   are associated with sea ice decline and northward transport and shift of
   marine species across multiple trophic levels over the Bering and
   Chukchi Sea shelves. Studies of the terrestrial ecosystem have
   identified factors that are important for the understanding of
   terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, including Arctic lakes, under
   the presence of global warming. Novel fungal species from the Arctic
   terrestrial ecosystem have also been isolated and described. Overall,
   these results could contribute to the conservation and sustainable
   management of the Arctic ecosystem services.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of meso- and macro-zooplankton in the Bransfield
   Strait and around Elephant Island, Antarctic Peninsula, during the
   2019-2020 austral summer},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is a region of the world where drastic impacts
   of climate change have been observed over the past few years, leading
   the communities inhabiting this area to adapt to new conditions. This is
   reflected in changes to the composition and abundance of pelagic
   species, especially zooplankton, which constitute the main food source
   for the trophic web supporting the ecosystem in this region. In this
   study, we compared the composition, abundance, and spatial distribution
   of meso-and macro-zooplankton and how they relate to the oceanographic
   conditions of the Bransfield Strait and the area surrounding Elephant
   Island, Antarctic Peninsula, during the 2019-2020 austral summer. The
   community was represented by three groups: small-sized copepods such as
   Oithona similis and Ctenocalanus citer, salps such as Salpa thompsoni,
   and the Euphausiacea. Euphausiacea showed an important decrease in
   composition and abundance and was only represented by Euphausia superba
   and Thysanoessa macrura. An increase in the abundance and distribution
   of S. thompsoni was observed over the entire study area, as well as
   positive SST anomalies, which possibly favored the increase in the S.
   thompsoni population, as well as the decrease and displacement of
   Euphausiacea adults and juveniles. If, as climate models predict,
   increases in temperatures keep occurring, our results reflect the
   scenario that will prevail for zooplankton in the Antarctic Peninsula,
   with effects on distribution and abundance that will lead to the
   dominance of species that are more successful in warmer conditions.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Interpretations of Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd data from the Grunehogna Granite
   demonstrate that anatexis of and mixing with Flugfonna Formation
   sedimentary rocks, caused by hot basic sills of similar to 1100 Ma
   Borgmassivet Suite, are consistent, with the granite epsilon Nd epsilon
   Sr-100Ma data, partially overlapping Borgmassivet Suite data and are
   marginally displaced toward published data from the Flugfonna Formation.
   Upper intercept LA-ICPMS U-Pb data from the Grunehogna Granite and
   Borgmassivet Suite zircons are within error at 1088 +/- 17Ma and 1088
   +/- 68Ma, and are consistent with with unpublished data for the gabbro
   of 1107Ma. Interpretations of syn-depositional anatexis of
   semi-consolidated sediments under, high pH(2)O, are consistent with
   deposition at similar to 1130-1107Ma for the Flugfonna Formation. Sm-Nd
   data define an age of 3058 +/- 116Ma for the Annandagstoppane Granite,
   consistent with a reported U-Pb zircon age of 3067 +/- 8Ma. Rb-Sr data
   for the Annandagstoppane Granite define an errorchron of 2252 +/- 82Ma.
   Differences between Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd data suggest that Rb-Sr systematics
   in many samples from all units have experienced open system behaviour in
   contrast to Sm-Nd systematics from which no disturbance is apparent.
   Localised tonalitic partial melts of gabbro yield an upper intercept
   LA-ICPMS U-Pb age from zircon of 1114 +/- 47Ma.},

Title = {Microcosm studies on the survival of Escherichia coli in the
   Kongsfjorden, an Arctic fjord},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microcosm experiments were conducted to study the relative survival of
   two Escherichia colt strains in the Kongsfjorden water during 2017
   Arctic summer. One of the E. coli strain was from the migratory bird
   Branta leucopis (Barnacle goose), to represent the allochthonous E. coli
   from migratory bird community, and the other strain was from the
   reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), which is a native animal. We observed that
   both B. leucopis and R. tarandus feed on the tundra and the faecal
   indicator bacteria (E. coli) in the faecal entrapments find their way to
   the Kongsfjorden along with the melt water from tundra during the Arctic
   summer. Survival is evaluated in terms of the self-contained biotic
   factors in the fjord water, chemical composition of the fjord water and
   solar radiation impinging on the water during Arctic summer. Results
   revealed that biotic factors and solar radiation were most effective in
   the removal of E. coli from the Kongsfjorden water, while chemical
   composition of the fjord water supported extended survival of E. coli
   T-90 (time required for the removal of 90\% of the cells) was reached in
   less than 24 h in the test solutions to study the effect of biotic
   factors while T-90 as a function of sunlight and chemical composition of
   fjord water reached in less than 2 days. No significant difference (p >
   0.05) in the survival of E. coli from the autochthonous and
   allochthonous sources. Studies on survival of mesophilic intruders
   should be carried out for a systematic risk assessment of microbial
   contamination.},

Title = {Multi-model ensemble mean of global climate models fails to reproduce
   early twentieth century Arctic warming},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Arctic climate system is very sensitive to external perturbations,
   which results in more rapid surface air temperature (SAT) changes in the
   Arctic compared to lower latitudes. This study aims at assessing the
   performance of global climate models from the phases 5 and 6 of the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) in reproducing
   the periods of Arctic warming and cooling known from the observations.
   Two experiments are considered for 9 CMIP5 models, and one experiment is
   used for the 108 ensemble members from 32 CMIP6 models. The ensemble
   mean of unforced Arctic amplification variability in the CMIP5
   pre-industrial control experiment suggests a crucial role of external
   forcings in the present Arctic amplification. The ensemble mean of the
   same models in the historical experiment shows a century-long upward
   trend and clearly reproduces the present-day Arctic amplification.
   However, there is no consistent response of increasing Arctic
   amplification in the early twentieth century warming period during the
   1920s-1940s in the CMIP5 models. This indicates the 1920s-1940s Arctic
   warming was unlikely to happen due to external forcings. Using the large
   CMIP6 ensemble in the historical experiment we show that the multi-model
   ensemble mean in the new generation of high-resolution CMIP6 models does
   not reproduce that warming either, thus posing questions how well the
   models capture internal climate variability and distinguish it from
   natural and anthropogenic forcings. This issue ultimately affects the
   reliability of future Arctic climate projections.},

Title = {Compensation fund as a tool for sustainable development of the Arctic

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper examines the approaches to the formation of compensation funds
   for the indigenous peoples during Arctic industrial development. The key
   challenge is the technical problem-solving of reconciling the rights of
   indigenous peoples and the interests of the mining company. The
   compensation fund allows harmonizing the interests of stakeholders. In
   2020, Russia adopted the Arctic Development Strategy that supposes the
   implementation of investment projects, social and economic development,
   improving the quality of life of the local population as well as a
   creation of stable financial basis for traditional lands. The case-study
   of Yakutia is analyzed in the paper. The authors consider the
   possibilities to develop compensation funds on the base of economic,
   social and cultural impact assessment to fulfill them by the costs of
   extractive companies. The proposed mechanisms help generate additional
   income and accumulate financial capital for future generations. The
   mathematical tools and methods allow problem-solving on assessment of
   the priority compensation projects, the development of procedure for
   their implementation and the investment approach for the indigenous
   participation in the projects of extractive companies. The data for
   calculations was collected by the authors during field work on the
   impact assessment of mining projects in the Arctic Yakutia in 2016-2020.},

Title = {Seasonal variations in carbon dioxide exchange fluxes at a taiga-tundra
   boundary ecosystem in Northeastern Siberia},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Arctic and boreal permafrost ecosystems in Eastern Siberia, considered
   crucial to the climate system and global carbon cycle, are particularly
   vulnerable to climate change. This study investigates carbon dioxide
   (CO2) exchange fluxes over northeastern Siberia from 2013 to 2015 in a
   taiga-tundra boundary ecosystem for which such measurements are scarce.
   The growing season (May-September) net CO2 exchange flux (NEE) was -39.4
   (-60.1 to -20.2) gCm-2, with ecosystem respiration (RE) = 306.2
   (288.1-317.9) gCm-2 and gross primary production (GPP) = -345.5 (-372.5
   to -317.7) gCm-2. Microclimatic factors determining these CO2 exchange
   fluxes change seasonally. These fluxes are significantly affected by the
   timing of the onset of C uptake, which is reflected by changes in the
   soil temperature in spring and early summer, following which fluxes
   respond well to the photosynthetic photon flux density, especially for
   NEE. These CO2 exchange fluxes at the northeastern Siberian taiga-tundra
   boundary ecosystem are significantly smaller than those previously
   reported at southern-taiga forest sites. Spring snow meltwater-rich soil
   moisture conditions render southern-taiga sites as stronger CO2 sinks in
   June than taiga-tundra boundary ecosystem, which may be largely
   responsible for the pronounced north-south gradient in growing season
   NEE.},

Title = {The digital beam forming technique in AgileDARN high-frequency radar},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An all-digital agile dual auroral radar network (AgileDARN) was
   developed by the National Space Science Center, Chinese Academic of
   Sciences (NSSC, CAS). AgileDARN can achieve higher performance and
   greater flexibility based on highly digitized hardware and its
   distributed digital signal processing system. Multiple receiving beams
   can be created within the transmitting beam pattern better to determine
   the direction of arrival (DOA). In each beam, seven real-time azimuthal
   sub-beams are synthesized simultaneously with 16 main digital receiver
   channels. Each sub-beam detects the echo around the transmitting
   boresight with an angular separation of 0.46 degrees. Comparing the
   echoes from different sub-beams, the azimuthal geolocation of the
   irregularities can be improved when their volume is smaller than the
   beamwidth. Furthermore, the Chebyshev window enables the control of the
   sidelobes and antenna pattern, effectively suppressing interference. To
   implement multi-beam forming, extra processing resources of the
   field-programmable gate array (FGPA) are required. This paper introduces
   the signal processing procedure and analyzes the requirements on the
   FPGA resources,and the technique is validated with meteor echoes
   received by the AgileDARN radar. The azimuthal geolocation of echoes
   increases by seven times compared with the single beamforming SuperDARN
   radar.},

Title = {CRANIAL MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF TRIGONOSTYLOPS
   WORTMANI, AN EOCENE SOUTH AMERICAN NATIVE UNGULATE},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {In 1933 George G. Simpson described a remarkably complete skull of
   Trigonostylops, an Eocene South American native ungulate (SANU) whose
   relationships were, in his mind, quite uncertain. Although some
   authorities, such as Florentino Ameghino and William B. Scott, thought
   that a case could be made for regarding Trigonostylops as an
   astrapothere, Simpson took a different position, emphasizing what would
   now be regarded as autapomorphies. He pointed out a number of features
   of the skull of Trigonostylops that he thought were not represented in
   other major clades of SANUs, and regarded these as evidence of its
   phyletic uniqueness. Arguing that the lineage that Trigonostylops
   represented must have departed at an early point from lineages that gave
   rise to other SANU orders, Simpson reserved the possibility that
   Astrapotheriidae might still qualify (in modern terms) as its sister
   group. Even so, he argued that the next logical step was to place
   Trigonostylops and its few known allies in a separate order,
   Trigonostylopoidea, coordinate with Astrapotheria, Notoungulata,
   Litopterna, and Pyrotheria. Simpson's classification was not favored by
   most later authors, and in recent decades trigonostylopids have been
   almost universally assigned to Astrapotheria. However, his evaluation of
   the allegedly unique characters of Trigonostylops and its allies has
   never been systematically treated, which is the objective of this paper.
   Using computed tomography, the skull of Trigonostylops is compared,
   structure by structure, to a variety of representative SANUs as well as
   extant perissodactylans (which together comprise the clade
   Panperissodactyla) and the ``condylarthran{''} Meniscotherium. In
   addition to placing Simpson's character evaluations in a comparative
   context, we also provide detailed assessments of many vascular and
   pneumatization-related features of panperissodactylans never previously
   explored. Overall, we found that this new assessment strengthened the
   placement of Trigonostylops within a monophyletic group that includes
   Astrapotherium and Astraponotus, to the exclusion of other SANU clades.
   Although Trigonostylops cannot be considered as morphologically distinct
   or unusual as Simpson thought, our comparative and phylogenetic analyses
   have helped to generate a number of hypotheses about character evolution
   and function in SANUs that may now be fruitfully tested using other
   taxon combinations.},

Abstract = {The results of major and trace elements investigation in snow and fresh
   water on Dismal and Horseshoe Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic
   Peninsula are presented. Samples of newly fallen snow, old snow, as well
   as water from lakes, ponds and streams were collected during the 4th
   Turkish Antarctic Expedition in February-early March 2020. Determination
   of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni,
   Pb, Sb, Se, Th, Tl, U, V and Zn content was carried out using the ICP-MS
   method. Totally 39 samples were analyzed.It was established that,
   variability and average concentrations of major and trace elements are
   significantly higher in newly fallen snow compared to old snow. The
   lowest concentrations of major and a number of trace elements (Fe, Cr,
   Se, Ba, As and Tl) were recorded in samples of old snow, and the highest
   -in water of streams. All types of samples have the highest Na
   concentrations, that confirms sea aerosols as the source of their
   input.High enrichment factors EFc (>100) for Zn, Cd, Se and Sb
   (especially in newly fallen snow) indicate possible anthropogenic impact
   connected with long-range air mass transfer.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Antarctica is considered pristine despite the gradual emergence of
   certain pollutants (trace elements and PAHs) from various sources.
   Environmental matrices viz, soil, lichen, bryophytes, and epilithic mat
   were collected and analyzed for major and trace elements from Larsemann
   Hills, East Antarctica. The biotic community-identified up to genera
   were algae (21), bryophytes (3) and lichens (2). The average lowest and
   the highest concentration of trace elements recorded were Hg, Cr for
   soil; Cd, Zn for lichen; Cd, Sr for bryophyte and Hg, Sr for epilithic
   mat respectively. The ER and Igeo indicate that Se is highly
   contaminated in all sample types, whereas; Hg is moderately enriched in
   bryophytes and lichen. However, the source of contamination is natural.
   Principal component analyses and cluster analysis identified two natural
   metal contamination sources: ornithogenic and geogenic. The potential
   ecological risk index indicates a moderate level of contamination for
   As, Cr, Cu, and Zn. The element Cd and Hg are a matter of concern from
   their moderate to high ecological risk in some sites of the LH of
   Antarctica.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Scarcity of Carbon estimates from the biogeochemically important
   Southern Ocean (SO), if addressed better, can help in improving the
   present understanding of the Carbon (C) cycle of the region. We present
   estimates of standing stock of Carbon from every species, as well as the
   entire copepod community from this region during austral summer. Of the
   total copepod community, Rhincalanus gigas (13.397 mgC) contributed the
   most to C stock, followed by Calanus australis (5.269 mgC) and
   Calocalanus sp (1.027 mgC). The harpacticoid, Microsetella norvegica and
   poecilostomatoid, Oncaea curvata contributed more to C stock than the
   cyclopoids, Oithona similis and Oithona frigida. A total of 118.96 mgC
   was estimated from the copepod community. The trophic efficiency
   (Czoo/Cphyto) of 0.48 indicated a grazing pressure and exposure of
   copepods to a wide range of food sizes. Our findings highlight the
   necessity of regular spatiotemporal observations to better understand
   the fine ecological fluctuations and C cycle dynamics, given the
   accelerated changes in SO in the last few decades.},

Abstract = {We compare the sediment magnetic properties of two lakes in Schirmacher
   Oasis, East Antarctica and discuss the intensity of pedogenesis during
   the Late Quaternary. The magnetic minerals are land-derived with no
   obliteration of the signal due to bacterial or anthropogenic sources.
   The magnetic grains of Lake L-49 are much smaller in size compared to
   Lake Sandy's (low ratio values of IRM20mT/ARM and S-20). The iron oxide
   minerals in Lake Sandy's sediments are coarse stable single domain (SSD)
   and multi-domain (MD) grains with the SSD concentration increasing
   during the Holocene. Percentage frequency-dependent susceptibility, a
   marker for pedogenic iron oxide minerals shows a similar trend for Lake
   Sandy, with the values remaining low during the Last Glacial Stage (LGS)
   and increasing towards the Holocene. Such a pattern is not observed in
   the sediments of Lake L-49. Principal Component Analysis reveals a
   relatively stronger intensity of pedogenesis in the Lake Sandy catchment
   during the deglaciation. From the data, we observe that even though
   pedogenesis is active, the intensity is not strong enough to form
   superparamagnetic (SP) grains. The peaks in chi(fd) for both the lakes
   show a direct relationship with Antarctic Isotope Maximum events
   recorded in an ice-core data suggesting that chi(fd) can be used as a
   proxy for paleo-pedogenesis in Antarctica.},

Title = {Arctic sea ice and snow cover albedo variability and trends during the
   last three decades},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to assess the full effect on the albedo
   of both sea ice extent decrease and snowline retreat in the Arctic
   during the last three decades. Averaged over the globe, the overall
   warming effect due to Arctic land and ocean albedo change corresponds to
   adding about 44\% to the direct effect of human CO2 emissions during the
   same period. In fact, the area and thickness of Arctic sea ice have both
   been declining in this time frame. This has caused feedbacks affecting
   the whole global climate system. One such is albedo feedback of sea ice
   shrinking which was previously estimated (Pistone et al., 2014) to add
   about 25\% to the direct warming effect of anthmpogenic CO2 emissions.
   In this study, we demonstrate that the role of snowline retreat in
   albedo decrease is comparable to that of sea ice shrinking. To this aim,
   we estimate the radiative forcing (W/m(2)) due to snow and ice decrease
   during 34 years (1982-2015) from the analysis of changes of observed
   albedo based on the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy
   Balanced And Filled (CERES EBAF) dataset, paired with sea ice and snow
   cover data from the US National Snow \& Ice Data Center (NSIDC).},

Title = {Temporal and spatial variabilities in surface mass balance at the EGRIP

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Temporal variability in surface mass balance (SMB) on the Greenland ice
   sheet is important for understanding the mass balance of the ice sheet.
   Additionally, knowledge of the spatial variability in SMB at ice core
   drilling sites helps to interpret the spatial representativeness of SMB
   data obtained from a single ice core. In this study, to investigate the
   spatiotemporal variability in recent SMB in the East Greenland Ice Core
   Project (EGRIP) area in the northeastern Greenland ice sheet, pit
   observations were made at six sites in the summers of 2016?2018. In all
   pits, depth profiles of water isotope ratios showed clear seasonal
   variations. The annual SMB differed from site to site, which is probably
   due to post-depositional redistribution of snow caused by wind erosion
   and snowdrift. However, the multiple-site averages of annual SMBs, which
   ranged from 134 to 157 mm w. e. yr-1 (average 146 mm w. e. yr? 1) during
   2009?2017, were very similar. This indicates that annual SMBs in the
   EGRIP area were nearly constant in this period. The seasonal SMBs in the
   EGRIP area tended to be larger in the summer?winter period than in the
   winter?summer period.},

Abstract = {Patterns in the seasonal occurrence and abundance of gymnosome pteropods
   of the genus Clione are described from samples collected during routine
   monitoring in Mombetsu Harbor, northeastern Hokkaido, Japan, from 2004
   to 2012. In this study area of the southern Okhotsk Sea is a unique
   region where water masses are exchanged seasonally, driven by the East
   Sakhalin Current (ESC) in winter and the Soya Warm Current (SWC) in
   summer. Clione elegantissima adults were found between December and
   early April within a narrow temperature range of-1.79 to 3.78 C. Most
   (90.9\%) of these individuals occurred in the cold-water mass of the
   ESC. Veliger and polytrochous larval stages of Clione spp. were observed
   in all periods, except for late August to early October when the SWC
   dominated. A positive correlation was found between chlorophyll a
   concentration and larval abundance using 10-day averaged data. The
   results indicate that food availability was sufficient to support Clione
   spp. larval stages in the sampling region. Seasonal exchanges of water
   mass in the sampling area influence the occurrence of Clione species.},

Title = {Sediment sources and transport pathways on shelves of the Chukchi and

   geochemistry},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Study of sediment sources and transport pathways in the Chukchi and East
   Siberian Seas is vital for under-standing the interaction of fluvial,
   ocean, and sea-ice dynamics. In this study, 42 samples were analyzed for
   heavy minerals and 23 were analyzed for garnet geochemistry. These
   analyses suggest that the surface sediment is mainly sourced from the
   surrounding rivers. There are distinctive performances between the heavy
   minerals and garnet geochemistry of sediments in the Chukchi Sea and the
   East Siberian Sea. The content of hypersthene increased significantly on
   the outer shelf of the Chukchi Sea. The garnet was derived from volcanic
   rocks of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic province and transported from the
   Gulf of Anadyr by the Pacific inflow. Coastal erosion materials
   dominated in the inner shelf of the Chukchi Sea. A significant amount of
   river input occurred in the western, middle, and eastern parts of the
   East Siberian Sea. The inputs from the Indigirka River and Kolyma River
   tend to be distributed eastward. The garnet geochemistry shows that
   there was a mixed sedimentary zone located south of Wrangel Island. The
   sediments in the outer shelf of the East Siberian Sea show a stable
   mixed sedimentary environment.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, the usability and accuracy performance of the multi-GNSS
   kinematic real-time Precise Point Positioning (RT-PPP) technique in
   Antarctica, which has extreme atmospheric and topographic conditions,
   was investigated. In this context, the two-day GNSS dataset of the
   OHI300ATA reference station, which is a member of the IGS MGEX-RTS
   stations network, was used. In the test measurements, the real-time
   State Space Representation (SSR) formatted corrections produced by
   different IGS-RTS Analysis Centers were used and compared. As a result
   of the study, it is concluded that the achieved performance of the
   kinematic RT-PPP using IGS-RTS SSR products is found very promising with
   a cm level of 3D positioning accuracy after about 20-30 min convergence
   time. The overall results of the study show that the RT-PPP technique
   has become a strong alternative to differential real-time GNSS
   positioning techniques with the accuracy of it provides in the Antarctic
   region.},

Title = {Understanding the relationship between meltwater discharge and solute
   concentration by modeling solute transport in a snowpack in
   snow-dominated regions-A review},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The release of a disproportionately large fraction of solute into the
   earliest meltwater fraction, termed the ionic pulse, can be explained by
   the solute transport mechanisms. To this end, a classical standard
   advectiondispersion model was developed by Hibberd (1984), but it failed
   to simulate the long tail following the initial solute arrival. This
   limitation was overcome by the mobile-immobile water model (MIM) with a
   single rate exchange coefficient for the ionic pulse and the negative
   relationship between meltwater discharge and solute concentration, which
   was not successfully to reproduce the positive relationship. Hence, the
   present paper reviews the progress of MIM for describing the solute
   transport for the two relationships. In addition, the positive
   relationship has been reported in the snowpack, and this phenomenon was
   investigated by making the exchange rate constant corresponding to water
   saturation in the model. This flow-dependent model captured important
   features of tracer variations but it failed to simulate the magnitude of
   oscillation of the tracer concentrations, thus implying additional
   physical processes in immobile water. The characterization of the
   behavior of both immobile and mobile water in snowmelt calls for either
   a double-permeability model or a triple continuum model for solute
   transport through fractured-porous media in groundwater.},

Title = {Regional perspectives in Eurasian snow- Indian monsoon relationship: An
   observational study},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Relationship between Indian summer monsoon rainfall and Eurasian snow in
   the preceding seasons is studied extensively. However, the spatial
   structures of this snow-monsoon relation have rarely been investigated.
   The present study is aimed at diagnosing nature of observed linkage
   between Eurasian winter snow and spatial distribution of following
   summer monsoon rainfall over India. Eurasian snow association with
   spatial distribution of rainfall over India features a tri-polar pattern
   of significant negative-positive-negative correlations over the
   northern, east-central and peninsular regions of India respectively. The
   physical mechanism underlying snow-monsoon connection is envisaged
   through two pathways. One of the channels is through Eurasian winter
   snow directly affecting the monsoon by modulating large scale
   circulation, while the other way is indirectly through Tropical Eastern
   Pacific (TEP) Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs). Enhanced Eurasian
   wintertime snow is associated with warm TEP SSTs from preceding winter
   through to the following summer, leading to anomalous large scale zonal
   circulation during summer monsoon season, thereby affecting rainfall
   over India. The spatial facets of snow-monsoon relationship remain
   unaltered by Indian Ocean Dipole and North Atlantic Oscillation modes.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Biofabrication of metal nanoparticles via seaweeds is quite interesting
   as it make use of phytochemicals in the aqueous seaweed extract as sole
   bioreductant and stabilizing agent. Herein, we report for the first
   time, the utilization of a Polar seaweed Fucus gardeneri for the
   biosynthesis of well stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). As no
   harmful chemicals employed in the synthetic procedure, it is absolutely
   a green chemistry procedure. Distinct brown colour of the reaction
   mixture and typical absorption band at 410 nm in the UV-Visible spectrum
   gave evidence for the formation of AgNPs. The biosynthesized AgNPs
   showed almost spherical morphology in HR-TEM studies and their average
   size was about 19.39 nm. SAED pattern and XRD spectrum confirmed the
   crystallinity of the biogenic AgNPs. Characteristic peak for elemental
   silver was observed in energy dispersive X-ray analysis. FTIR studies
   revealed the role of phytochemicals in the seaweed extract as potential
   bioreductant and capping agent. In addition, catalytic activity of AgNPs
   was assessed spectroscopically by employing them in the hydrogenation
   reaction of 4-nitrophenol with the reductant NaBH4.},

Title = {Characteristics of stem respiration in black spruce (Picea mariana)
   stand, interior Alaska},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Boreal forests account for roughly one third of the carbon sequestered
   in terrestrial ecosystems, and the high latitude boreal ecosystem they
   make up has been consequently vulnerable to recent climate change. This
   study investigated stem respiration of Alaska dominant black spruce
   trees in interior Alaska during the growing season of 2007. The
   continuous measurement of stem respiration was conducted in black spruce
   trees of four different ages (4.3, 7.2, 9.8, and 13.5 cm in diameter at
   breast height (DBH)) in interior Alaska, using a CO2 analyzer, a 12-V
   pump, chambers, and a data-logger. Mean stem respiration is 0.014 +/-
   0.006 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (range 0.003-0.039 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) in
   different aged four black spruce trees, indicating remarkably temporal
   variations in stem respiration with temperatures in air and stem. We
   found that metabolism is 1.5-fold higher in the younger black spruce
   tree than in the older. Temperatures in air and stem are significant
   regulators in regulating stem respiration. The stand-level annual stem
   respiration simulated by Q(10) value based on air temperature is 73.9 g
   CO2 m(-2), corresponding to 5.0\% of the ecosystem respiration (Re)
   estimated by eddy covariance tower in 2007. Our findings demonstrate
   that stem respiration is a significant component in the scaleup of the
   regional carbon budget in a black spruce forest of interior Alaska.},

Title = {Surface moisture budget of tundra and boreal ecosystems in Alaska:
   Variations and drivers},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The trajectory of land surface wetness is one of the most consequential
   unknowns in the Arctic climate system. The present analysis is intended
   to (1) document seasonal and interannual variations of surface moisture
   fluxes, (2) clarify the drivers of P-ET variations among Arctic
   vegetative types, and (3) evaluate the effects of wildfire disturbance
   on ET. The analysis is based on field measurements from sites in boreal
   forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska. The surface moisture budget at
   boreal forest sites in permafrost areas generally shows a moisture
   deficit in late spring and early summer, followed by a moisture surplus
   from late summer into autumn. The annual net P-ET is generally positive
   but can vary interannually by more than an order of magnitude. The
   primary drivers of variations in evapotranspiration over weekly to
   monthly timescales are radiative fluxes, air temperature, relative
   humidity and wind speed. Overall, the ET at forest sites shows a
   stronger dependence on relative humidity and wind speed, while ET at
   tundra sites shows the stronger dependence on air temperature. These
   differences imply that tundra sites are more temperature-limited and
   forest sites are more humiditydependent. Relative to a nearby unburned
   site, a burned forest site in interior Alaska shows an increase in ET
   for nearly a decade following the fire, while the recovery time for ET
   at a burned tundra site is only about three years.},

Title = {How climate change is affecting the transitional natural zones of the
   Northern and Arctic regions of Russia},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Continued global warming and the increase in climate extremes have
   mostly been identified in Northern and Arctic areas of Russia.
   Investigation of natural and climatic conditions in these regions was
   conducted using the method of zoning that is based on the environmental
   conditions of human life. This method estimates the relatively slowly
   changing landscape component and the rapidly changing climate component
   of the discomfort. Transitional natural zones represent an open system
   for the impact of climatic changes. A positive trend in the number of
   active temperatures and a negative precipitation trend was observed in
   these regions. At present, the climate conditions of some areas in the
   tundra, forest-tundra, and northern taiga correspond to the more
   southerly landscape zones. This situation is conducive to changes in the
   landscape vegetation and could lead to a shift in the transitional
   landscape zone borders towards higher latitudes. The relevancy of the
   study results is that they help to establish the potential consequences
   of climate change for landscape structures, as well as for the
   environment and the population of the Northern and Arctic areas. They
   can be used for developing the regulatory documents that govern the
   population's life in the Northern and Arctic areas.},

   interests in berries in the Russian Far East?},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ripening berries are one of nature's important contributions to people
   in the Russian Far East. We examined the spatiotemporal variability of
   people's interests in 12 types of berries and their attributes by
   accessing Yandex statistics (Yandex) and Google Trends (GT) about these
   topics in the Russian Far East. On Yandex, time-series data for people's
   interests in many berries for all target regions showed clear seasonal
   changes, with an annual peak that occurs at the time of ripening.
   Interest in berries was observed in many cities and regions in the far
   east of Russia, where indigenous peoples and Sakha traditionally utilize
   berries for subsistence. The attributes of accessed terms were closely
   related to terms about berry varieties and edible berries, berry
   purchases, pho-tographs, and recipes. These results supported the
   usability of Yandex and GT data to evaluate the spatiotemporal
   variability of people's interests in berries. Despite systematic biases,
   such as in the Internet environment and user characteristics as well as
   limitations of spatial resolution and access period, the integrated use
   of Yandex and GT should be developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal
   variability of people's interests in berries, especially in areas that
   are difficult to access.},

Title = {Long-term changes in aerosol radiative properties over Ny-angstrom

Abstract = {Continuous long-term monitoring of black carbon (BC) mass concentration
   and aerosol light scattering coefficient (sigma(SCA)), supplemented by
   number size distribution and chemical composition, are utilized in this
   study to understand the temporal changes in aerosol properties,
   associated source processes and radiative effects at Ny-angstrom lesund
   (79 degrees N) in the Svalbard Archipelago. A statistically significant
   decreasing trend in BC (- 24.7 ng m(-3) decade(-1)) is observed during
   spring of 2010-2019. In contrast, sigma SCA depicted a general
   increasing trend (5.2 Mm(-1) decade(-1)) during 2011-2016. BC and
   sigma(SCA) were higher during winter and spring. Aerosol single
   scattering albedo was highest in May similar to 0.95 (during spring) and
   lowest in September similar to 0.87 (during summer). Fractional share of
   BC to total aerosol mass was higher in winter and summer. Anthropogenic
   SO42- and NO3- (after ssNa(+)) species dominated the summer, when total
   number and mass concentrations of aerosols were at their minimum.
   Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon (OC) showed higher
   concentrations in spring with EC-to-OC ratio similar to 0.08 - 0.22. The
   columnar AOD varied between 0.01 and 0.20 (annual mean similar to 0.09),
   resulting in aerosol radiative forcing (in the top of the atmosphere)
   similar to 0.15 - 2.69 Wm(-2) in the month of April (during spring).
   Potential source contribution function (PSCF) revealed the dominant
   source areas to be over Europe and Russia in terms of contributing to
   the seasonal high BC mass concentrations at Ny-angstrom lesund. Our
   study has also revealed an unusual impact of biomass burning aerosols
   (advected from the Alaska wildfire) during July 2015.},

Title = {Holocene sedimentology in an isolation basin in the Larsemann Hills,

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Holocene paleoenvironmental changes along the East Antarctic margin have
   been reconstructed using marine and lake sediment cores. Isolation
   basins in the coastal ice-free regions offer continuous sedimentary
   sequences to reconstruct marine-freshwater transitions and its
   environmental changes. In this study, we present the grain size
   (sand-silt-clay) and organic matter variations in a 51 cm
   radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Pup Lagoon, an isolation basin in
   Larsemann Hills (East Antarctica). The sediment core spans the last 6109
   years and provides information on environmental changes in two different
   settings, i.e., (a) under the marine influence, and (b) as an isolated
   lake. Three cluster zones were identified viz., LZ1 (6109-2427 y BP:
   marine environment), LZ2 (2427-2101 y BP: transition zone) and LZ3
   (2101-116 y BP: freshwater environment). Fine grain sediments (silt) are
   dominant in LZ1, indicating a strong hydrodynamic energy conditions
   affected by tidal currents with low organic matter. Higher sand content
   during the transition period (LZ2) indicates the strongest hydrodynamic
   condition and sediment deposition from sea ice. The increasing trend of
   OM (cyanobacterial benthic mat) beginning at similar to 2101 y BP
   suggests the isolation of the lake. The highest fine grained sediments
   (silt-clay) in LZ3 suggests lowered meltwater derived detritus in
   response to mild austral summer conditions during the Late Holocene.},

Title = {Extracellular polymeric substances in Antarctic environments: A review
   of their ecological roles and impact on glacier biogeochemical cycles},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Antarctic continent comprises diverse ecosystems like snow, glacier ice,
   sea ice, melt pools, glacial soils, supraglacial and subglacial lakes
   that accommodate numerous microbial and algal communities. These biotic
   groups secrete matrices of biomacromolecules called Extracellular
   Polymeric Substances (EPSs), which enhance their ability to withstand
   extreme environmental conditions. EPSs are mainly composed of
   exopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, and exhibit
   assorted activities due to diverse functionalities of matrix like
   spatial conformation, molecular weight, rheology, charge, size and
   affinity. Several protective and ecological functions such as
   cryoprotection, anti-desiccation, buffering against high salinity and
   pH, trace metal uptake and binding, sequestration of dissolved organic
   matter and nutrients, aggregate formation and biofilm production have
   been attributed to microbial EPSs. They also contribute to production of
   dissolved and particulate organic matter and hence can influence
   biogeochemical cycling of elements, especially carbon and iron. Further,
   they aid in aggregation of dust particles on the glacier surface,
   substantially reducing the albedo of the ice and thereby accelerate
   melting of glaciers. This study provides an overview of role of EPSs in
   Antarctic ecosystems, its ecological significance and chemical
   functionalities, and discusses the approach for a better understanding
   of relevance of EPSs in biogeochemistry of Antarctic environments.},

Title = {A review of the observed air temperature in the Antarctic Peninsula. Did
   the warming trend come back after the early 21st hiatus?},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent changes in the near-surface air temperature (nSAT) in the
   Antarctic Peninsula (AP) suggests that the absence of 21st century
   warming on Antarctic Peninsula may be coming to end. To examine this,
   the long-term annual and seasonal variability of the nSAT at eight
   Antarctic stations located in the AP are analyzed using available data
   from the SCAR Reader database, complemented with data from the Chilean
   Weather Service (Frei and O'Higgins). An exponential filter was applied
   to the original annual and seasonal mean series to obtain a decadal-like
   variation of the nSAT. A stacked and the standardized anomaly of the
   nSAT record was constructed to examine the average regional behavior in
   the AP. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) and changepoint analysis were applied
   through the stacked nSAT series to highlight significant changes caused
   by variation in weather and climate. The CUSUM and bootstrapping
   analysis revealed two statistically significant breaking points during
   the 1978-2020 period. The first one occurred in the late nineties ending
   a warming period and making the beginning of a cooling period; the
   second one may have taken place in the mid-2010s and could mark the end
   of the warming pause. These trends appear to be consistent with the
   changes observed in the large-scale climate modes (i.e., the Antarctic
   Annular Mode - AAO).},

Abstract = {We collected snow samples from two pits with depths of 4.02 and 3.18 m
   at the East Greenland Ice Core Project camp (75?37?N, 35?59?W),
   Greenland in the summer of 2016 to estimate recent annual snow
   deposition and examine seasonal variation in major ion species, stable
   isotopes of water and microparticles (dust). Dating based on clear
   seasonal variation in chemical components indicated that the 4.02- and
   3.18-m-deep pits included snow deposition corresponding to ten years
   from 2006 to 2016 and seven years from 2009 to 2016, respectively. The
   mean values for annual snow deposition for the 4.02-m-deep pit were 138
   and 145 mm yr? 1 in water equivalent (mm w.e. Yr? 1) in 2006?2016 and
   2009?2016, respectively. The average deposition for the 3.18-m-deep pit
   was 149 mm w.e. Yr? 1 between 2009 and 2016. Seasonal variation in
   concentrations of major ion species and dust were similar to those
   previously reported for Greenland. The maximum Cl-/Na+ concentration
   ratios in the summer were much higher than the ratios at other sites in
   Greenland.},

   Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Glacier Striations are the scratches and grooves formed by abrasion on
   the surface of bedrock over which a glacier moves. In the Schirmacher
   Oasis, central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica systematic
   observations were made to collect the orientation data of well-preserved
   glacial striations. Orientation data for 276 glacial striations at 20
   locations were collected and further analysed for quantification of the
   direction of past glacial movements. The majority of the data is
   unidirectional with few having bidirectional orientation suggesting
   changes in the movement of glaciers with time. The data shows NNW-NNE
   direction for the advance of palae-oglaciers which are in agreement with
   the present movement of glaciers deduced from the Global Positioning
   System reported earlier. The Moving Average Rose Diagram (MARD)
   calculated resultant direction for the flow of glacier in the
   Schirmacher Oasis deduced at 15 degrees E. It is also in concordance
   with the earlier reported subsurface geo-electrical structural trend
   inferred from magnetotelluric (MT) study and hence hints towards the
   possible link between the subsurface structures and processes as guiding
   control for the movement of glaciers.},

Title = {A 145 kyr record of upstream changes in Indian monsoon circulation and
   its link to southern high-latitude climate},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The influence of northern high latitude climate variability on the South
   Asian Summer Monsoon has been extensively studied using both
   instrumental and proxy based climate data. In comparison, only a few
   studies have attempted to explore the southern high latitude association
   of the South Asian Summer Monsoon. Here we present a 145 kyr long new
   data (oxygen and carbon isotopic abundance of two depth-stratified
   species of foraminifera viz. Globigerinoides ruber and Globorotalia
   menardii) from a sediment core on sub-millennial to millennial scale
   resolution from the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean - a region swept
   by the southeasterly wind during boreal summer (referred to as `summer'
   hereafter), which transforms to the southwest monsoon wind after
   crossing the equator. The available records of past summer monsoon
   variability are predominantly based on reconstruction of downstream
   hydrology, which is identifiable with the thermodynamics of the system.
   The present study is a reconstruction of the dynamics of the summer
   monsoon circulation from an upstream region which is ideally suited for
   exploring its link with the southern high-latitude climate. We
   identified several occurrences of interchanging intense and weak monsoon
   circulation events during the 145 kyr period. We further find that warm
   (cold) conditions in Antarctica show a near one-to-one coupling with
   weak (strong) monsoon phases, suggesting a strong mechanistic link
   between them during the period.},

Title = {Optical properties of aerosol particles in the atmospheric boundary
   layer in regions with and without sea ice},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The optical properties of aerosol particles must be clearly understood
   to reduce uncertainty in the prediction of the global climate change.
   Simultaneous measurements of scattering and absorption coefficients of
   aerosol particles were conducted in the atmospheric boundary layer over
   the western North Pacific and the Southern Ocean. For the scattering
   coefficient, total scattering and backscattering coefficients were
   measured at three different wavelengths. Over the western North Pacific,
   significant differences in the angstrom ngstro center dot m exponent and
   absorption coefficient were found between polluted and pristine air
   masses. Over the parts of the Southern Ocean free of sea ice, the
   angstrom ngstro center dot m exponent and the ratio of the back-to
   total-scattering coefficients were uniform. However, over the sea-ice
   regions, the scattering coefficients were an order of magnitude lower,
   and the angstrom ngstro center dot m exponent an order of magnitude
   higher, than over the parts of the ocean free of sea ice. These
   differences appear to be due to the fact that the emission of aerosol
   precursors and sea salt particles is suppressed by sea ice. This study
   represents the difference in aerosol optical properties as a function of
   source region and sea condition. These results will contribute to
   improving the accuracy of estimates of the direct radiative forcing
   effects due to aerosol particles.},

Abstract = {Reported data on the diversity and physiological capabilities of fungi
   inhabiting ice-free outcrops of continental Antarctica are limited. The
   present study aimed at investigating the occurrence of fungi on
   fragments of microbial mats on the lakeshore and lake water and compared
   it with fungal occurrence on terrestrial moss, using a culture-dependent
   method. Another purpose was to evaluate the responses of hyphal growth
   to temperature and the profiles of substrate utilization of fungal
   isolates under pure culture conditions. A total of 46 fungal isolates
   were obtained and grouped into eight taxa, with Phoma herbarum being the
   most frequent taxon, the occurrence of which was closely related to the
   nitrogen level of the substrata. The colony diameter growth rates of
   most fungal isolates under pure culture conditions increased linearly
   with temperature to reach the maximum at 20-25 degrees C, indicating
   that these fungi were mesophilic. Moreover, fungal isolates exhibited
   diversity and redundancy in their utilization of 71 carbon sources,
   having potentials to utilize an array of substrates including sugars,
   sugar alcohols, hexose-phosphates, amino acids, hexose acids, and
   carboxylic acids.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study created a regional budget for methane (CH4) for Northern
   Europe, Siberia, and northern North America, based on a mission
   inventories, biogeochemical models, and land-surface satellite data.
   Natural sink and sources (wetlands, termites, wildfires, soil oxidation,
   and geological sources) and anthropogenic sources (fossil fuel
   extraction, industry and transportation, waste, agriculture, and
   livestock) were included. During 2000-2015, the region was estimated to
   be a net source of 57.2 Tg CH4 yr(-1), 40.8\% of which was contributed
   by anthropogenic sources. Wetland emissions (33.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) were
   the largest sources in the region, followed by fossil fuel extraction,
   waste, and geological emissions. Comparisons with other estimates
   indicated an uncertainty of +/- 16.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for wetland emissions
   and +/- 6.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for anthropogenic emissions. Regional
   emissions reached a peak in 1988, troughs in 1996 and 2000, and then
   gradually increased to a maximum in 2015. The temporal patterns was
   attributable to variations of both anthropogenic and natural emissions.
   Spatial maps of CH4 sources, sinks, and net emissions were constructed
   to identify ``hot spots{''} of emissions and their variations.
   Theanalyses revealed a need for further clarification of emissions from
   freshwater, permafrost thawing, biomass burning, and fossil fuel
   exploitation.},

Title = {Studies of SLCPs, greenhouse gases, and their interaction with the
   terrestrial ecosystem during the ArCS project},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Black carbon (BC) aerosols and methane are considered as a part of
   short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), and the uncertainty of the
   emission, removal processes, and its impact on global change is quite
   large. This paper reviews studies of SLCPs and CO2 performed during the
   Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) project focusing on the Asian
   influx into the Arctic. For a more detailed understanding of the
   characteristics of BC particles, ground-based continuous observation for
   BC has been newly started at two sites in the Arctic region. An accurate
   BC observation was also repeatedly conducted on R/V Mirai until 2019. At
   the cruise in 2014, we found that a notable fraction (similar to 20\%)
   of the rBC particles had a ``noncore/nonshell structure,{''} meaning
   that there was rBC located on/near the surface of the particles.
   Continuous measurement of the terrestrial ecosystem and CO2
   concentration was also carried out at the Poker Flat in Alaska. By using
   data at PFRR, the data of the year 2013 (with an unusually dry summer)
   implied the possible response of the terrestrial ecosystem to global
   warming. We have also developed forward and backward models to estimate

Title = {Joint effects of sea ice melt, freshwater discharge and tidal currents
   on zooplankton abundance in the Sea of Okhotsk: 2004 and 2013},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The foremost flooding event of the past century happened in 2013 on the
   Amur River, which flows into the Sea of Okhotsk. Concurrently, the
   winter of 2012-2013 was a year of heavy sea ice and delayed onset of
   melting in this region. To examine the joint effects of these major,
   regional-scale hydrological freshening events on oceanographic
   processes, we compared physical (CTD, tides and currents) and biological
   (zooplankton) data measured in 2004 and 2013 in Academy Bay, Sea of
   Okhotsk. Our results indicate that the difference in sea water
   temperature between the two years played a primary role in shaping
   zooplankton variability. Data collected in 2013 showed that water
   temperature was colder and that the upper layer was substantially
   fresher (\~{}4-5 ps mu) than in 2004. This decrease in water temperature
   and salinity reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in the
   abundance of some key zooplankton species including Calanus glacialis,
   Pseudocalanus spp. and Sagitta elegans and a corresponding increase in
   the abundance of Limacina helicina. Delayed melting of sea ice in 2013
   potentially triggered a mismatch in pelagic production that may have
   impacted the recruitment of calanoid copepods. Variation in tidal and
   subtidal advection of cold and highly saline Okhotsk Sea shelf water
   appears to be an important process influencing regional variation in
   zooplankton abundance. The occurrence of such hydrological events has
   the potential to trigger cascading effects through the food web.},

Title = {Mercuric reductase gene (merA) activity in a mercury tolerant sulphate
   reducing bacterium isolated from the Kongsfjorden, Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The bacterial reduction of mercury is one of the transformation
   processes where ionic form (Hg2+) converts into elemental form (Hg-0).
   The biological reduction of mercury is facilitated by the mercuric
   reductase (merA) gene. The significance of understanding the role of
   microbial mercury reduction in the Arctic during the changing climate
   conditions is high as it acts as the sink as well as a source of
   mercury. The present study was carried out to assess the prevalence of
   mercury tolerant bacteria and to know the distribution of merA in the
   Arctic bacterial communities. Citrobacter freundii strain MM7, a
   psychrotrophic, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, non-traditional
   sulphate-reducing bacterium, isolated from the sediments of Kongsfjorden
   showed tolerance to mercury up to 10.0 mg/L in vitro. Mercury removal
   experiment confirmed the removal of similar to 80\% of mercury mediated
   by plasmid-borne merA gene. Studies using Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) showed the metabolic changes incited by mercury, and the
   spectroscopic differences reflected that the functional groups like
   alkynes, aromatic phosphates, organic phosphates, methyl, methylene, and
   amide groups present in the bacterial surface owe a significant part in
   Hg biosorption and removal. The present study provides insights on the
   mercury resistance in an Arctic bacterial strain and suggests the
   potential application of Citrobacter freundii strain MM7 in the
   bioremediation of mercury from the natural environment.},

Title = {P-T-t-d evolution of Brattnevet Peninsula, Larsemann Hills, East
   Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Brattnevet Peninsula, Larsemann Hills, comprises metamorphosed acidic
   rocks, sedimentary rocks and basic igneous suite belonging to timespan
   of 920-478 Ma and have experienced three phases of deformation and
   metamorphism. The first and second phase of deformation gave rise to
   moderately plunging isoclinal and open to closed folds, respectively and
   the third phase resulted into broad warping. M-1 prograde (amphibolite)
   and M-2 peak (granulite) and M-3 retrograde (decompression) events have
   been inferred. In pyroxene granulite, inclusion assemblage of quartz,
   biotite, plagioclase and ilmenite in hornblende correspond to the relict
   M-1 amphibolite grade event associated with D-1-D-2 deformation events
   (occurred at similar to 920 Ma; 538-692 degrees C at similar to 6kb).
   However, the presence of enstatite, diopside, quartz, biotite, ilmenite
   and plagioclase in pyroxene granulite and sillimanite, biotite and
   almandine garnet and plagioclase in metapelite indicates granulite
   facies during M-2 event (similar to 530 Ma; 868-920 degrees C at similar
   to 6.7 kb). The retrograde M-3 event (500-480 Ma; similar to 620 degrees
   C at similar to 5kb) is largely depicted in pyroxene granulite and
   metapelite by coronal and symplectite cooling textures. The study shows
   a clockwise P-T path and suggests the crustal evolution of Larsemann
   Hills area have commenced at the wanning stages of Grenvillian Orogeny
   and imprinted by the Pan-African orogenic event in the terrane.},

Title = {Winter CH4 oxidation in cold-temperate grassland soils of northern
   Japan: Rn-222 as a proxy for the validation of CH4 diffusivity},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Amidst changing seasonal snow-covered periods and extents in northern
   high latitude regions, winter CH4 oxidation is susceptible to drastic
   climate change, all of which modulates an accurate assessment of
   regional carbon balance. The importance of winter CH4 oxidation to the
   soils in these regions has previously been recognized; in this study,
   concentrations of CH4 and Rn-222 were observed in the snowpack and
   underlying cold temperate soils during the winters of 1995/96 and
   1996/97. These observations were carried out in order to 1) validate the
   Rn-222 tracer as a proxy for variations in CH4 diffusivity within a
   snowpack containing many seasonal ice lenses, and to 2) estimate winter
   CH4 oxidation through the snowpack to the soils. Winter CH4 oxidations
   estimated by snow density (method 1); using the Rn-222 tracer under
   steady (method 2) and non-steady (method 3) conditions; and using a
   static chamber (method 4) during the winter of 1996/97 yielded 16.7 +/-
   6.3; 8.2 +/- 2.9; 9.8 +/- 7.4; and 4.5 +/- 2.5 mg CH4-C m(-2),
   respectively. These results suggest that contributions from average CH4
   oxidation represent 23.3\% (range: 12.7-35.1\%) of the annual CH4
   oxidation into cold temperate soils. Wintertime CH4 oxidation
   significantly reflects temporal variation in the snowpack, demonstrating
   that soil temperature depends on snow cover, and that a threshold snow
   depth of 40 cm does not prevent, but rather promotes, atmospheric CH4
   oxidation through snowpack to the soils. These findings demonstrate that
   the Rn-222 tracer was useful for estimating winter CH4 diffusivity and
   oxidation, using a one-dimensional vertical diffusion box model in cold
   temperate soils in Japan during multiple snow-covered seasons.},

Title = {Mining noise data for monitoring Arctic permafrost by using GNSS
   interferometric reflectometry},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ground surface elevation changes are closely linked to the dynamics of
   the active layer and near-surface permafrost. GNSS interferometric
   reflectometry (GNSS-IR), a technique utilizing reflected signals
   regarded as noise in the GNSS applications, such as positioning and
   navigation, can measure surface elevation changes in permafrost areas.
   In this study, we screen seven major open-data GNSS networks to identify
   the sites which are suitable for using GNSS-IR to study the permafrost
   areas in the Arctic. We identify 23 usable sites and obtain their
   surface elevation changes. As for the unusable sites in the permafrost
   areas, 68\% and 25\% of them are due to undulated reflecting surface and
   obstructions (e.g., buildings and trees), respectively. And 7\% of the
   unsuitable sites are due to insufficient usable observations, though
   open and relatively smooth areas can be found in their surroundings.
   This study provides usable sites in the Arctic permafrost areas, which
   can fill some spatial gaps of the existing permafrost monitoring
   programs and provide complementary measurements to active layer
   thickness and permafrost temperature. The GNSS-IR measurements can
   provide new perspectives into permafrost studies and contribute to
   assessing the potential hazards of permafrost degradation to
   infrastructures and residential communities.},

Abstract = {We quantified the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of
   fungi associated with dead moss tissues and conifer needles in a
   forest-tundra ecotone in a sub-Arctic region, Quebec, Canada. We
   detected 615 operational taxonomic units, in total, of fungi in 84
   families with 97\% sequence similarity by metabarcoding the internal
   transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Saprotrophs
   were the dominant functional guild. The results indicated the effects of
   host plant species and local environmental heterogeneity on fungal
   diversity in the cold region. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity
   indices of fungal communities were significantly greater in moss than in
   conifers. The greater phylogenetic diversity in moss was mainly
   attributable to the presence of families in Mucoromycota, compared to
   those in conifers, in which relatively closely related families of
   Dikarya were present. The taxonomic diversity was also related to local
   variations in vegetation and soil properties, suggesting that the local
   colonization and establishment of vegetation and the concomitant
   development of soil contributed to the taxonomic diversity of fungi. In
   contrast, functional diversity was not significantly affected by the
   host, vegetation, or soil properties, indicating that the fungal
   community members were relatively redundant in terms of the evaluated
   functional traits.},

Title = {Morphometry and unusual internal structure of ice ridge investigated at
   Barneo ice camp in April 2013},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {First-year ice ridge has been examined with respect to geometry and
   morphology at the Barneo ice camp in April 2013. Its characteristics are
   discussed in the paper. The sail height was 4.7 m, the keel depth was
   8.6 m. The keel depth to sail height ratio was equal to 1.8. Structure
   of the keel of the examined ice ridge was too heterogeneous in its
   composition. Significant fragment in the keel of ice ridge is fully
   consolidated, its draft reaches to 5.8 m but the fragment's upper
   boundary is located at the sea level. This indicates the presence of
   hydrostatic unbalance. Away from the point of maximum keel draft on the
   cross-section, the average porosity of the unconsolidated part of the
   keel tends to increase, but again decreases at the periphery of the
   keel. The distribution of ice fraction in sea ice versus depth for the
   ice ridge is presented. Increased ice fraction corresponds to the
   consolidated layer. The depth of the lower boundary of consolidated
   layer is confirmed by distributions of ice temperature versus depth.},

Title = {Theoretical and experimental research to remove hot water out of drill
   hose of deep hot-water drilling system},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To date, hot-water drilling with its fast penetration rate is the most
   advanced technology to access rapidly subglacial environments through
   the thick ice in the Antarctica and Greenland. During deep hot-water
   drilling, it is important to remove the residual hot water from the
   drill hose when drilling stops; otherwise, the residual hot water in the
   hose will quickly cool down and be frozen in less than 1 h at -20
   degrees C if no mitigation measures taken. The frost heaving force
   generated during the freezing will expand the hose and easily cause the
   hose to rupture. Based on prior experience and practice of water removal
   systems for deep hot water drilling, this study makes method choice and
   system design of removing hot-water from the drill hose, and
   theoretically calculates the minimum pressure of air pumping system
   needed to overcome pressure loss in the drill hose. Moreover, the indoor
   and outdoor tests are made to verify the calculations and provide a
   robust drill hose dewatering procedure.},

Abstract = {This article proposes the mapping of the concentration of sea ice in the
   oceanic region of the western Antarctic Peninsula using backscatter
   coefficients and textural features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   C-band, horizontal single polarization (HH) images obtained by the
   Sentinel 1 A satellite sensor. Pure samples of open water and sea ice
   were obtained from SAR images with the aid of PlanetScope optical images
   during the austral winter. The statistical technique of logistic
   regression was applied to identify the best textural features to
   discriminate the two sampled targets. These selected textural features
   were used with the backscatter coefficients of SAR images in a maximum
   likelihood supervised classifier to analyze the images. With sea ice
   classified in the time series between 2016 and 2019 during winter and
   austral spring, the concentration of sea ice in the study region was
   calculated and mapped. The textural features statistically indicated by
   the logistic regression were gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) Mean
   and GLCM Variance, resulting in the supervised classification having an
   accuracy of 86\% and precision ranging from 86\% to 98\% in the
   validation stage.},

   ``Variations in the ice sheet, glaciers, and the environment in the

   Project (EGRIP) led by Denmark, conducted snow pit observations near the
   coring site and reconstructed the surface mass balance over the past 10
   years. Analyses of an ice core from Northwest Greenland revealed
   temporal variability in black carbon concentration over the past 350
   years and in mineral dust over the past 100 years. To understand the
   mechanisms of ice-sheet flow, which is necessary for accurate
   predictions of sea level rise, we conducted laboratory experiments using
   artificial ice and derived an improved flow law for ice containing
   impurities. Ice sheet modeling was improved by including effects of
   impurities and ice stream dynamics. As part of the Ice Sheet Model
   Intercomparison Project for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 6 (ISMIP6), we simulated ice sheet mass loss and contribution to
   sea level rise over the 21st century and beyond. Furthermore, we
   developed a Glacial Isostatic Adjustment model to better constrain ice

Title = {The Alaskan Arctic regime shift since 2017: A harbinger of years to
   come?},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent fingerprints of Alaskan Arctic climate change include new weather
   patterns whose impacts propagate through the Alaskan marine ecosystem.
   Multiple lines of observational evidence draw attention to the last five
   years (2017-2021) as a remarkable period of change. Bering Sea winter
   and spring ice coverage was remarkably low in 2018 and 2019 associated
   with a shifted Aleutian Low (AL) into the western Bering Sea, and
   ridging of the overlying polar jet stream (PJS) that supported southerly
   winds and reduced ice growth. The climatological Beaufort High and
   associated Beaufort Gyre saw multiple winter-long collapses (2017 and
   2020), the only two such events of the modern reanalysis era. In
   contrast, from 2012 to 2016 the AL and PJS were located southeastward
   across the Gulf of Alaska, which supported sea ice growth. The recent
   collocation of the exposed ocean surface and atmospheric anomalies
   supports the emergence of a regional atmospheric circulation response to
   seaice loss. We propose that the regional system shift after 2017
   foreshadows the beginning of a period with an increasing frequency of
   major sea-ice loss events and associated impacts - floods, delayed
   spring blooms, and marine food chain disruptions - which is sooner than
   projected by climate models.},

Title = {A review of Antarctic ice sheet fluctuations records during Cenozoic and
   its cause and effect relation with the climatic conditions},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Antarctic cryosphere has significant impact on the global climate system
   by influencing the ocean currents, the atmosphere, and the sea level for
   long term durations. Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has evolved from
   temporary to permanent ice sheet during Oligocene (-32 Ma). Throughout
   its evolution, it witnessed severe climatic conditions leading to
   several phases of retreat and advancements. Major climatic events were
   directly associated with the evolution of AIS. Paleocene Eocene Thermal
   Maximum (PETM), Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO,-44.9 Ma), Eocene
   Oligocene Boundary (Oi1 event,-34 Ma), Oligocene-Miocene Boundary (Mi1
   event-25Ma), Mid Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO; -15Ma),
   Miocene-Pliocene Boundary (-3Ma) and Mid-late Pleistocene Transition
   (MPT, after-1.25 Ma) are the major reported global climatic events. This
   work summarises these events and critically reviews the role of various
   factors in the advancement and retreat of AIS and its coupled response
   to the global climate change including future global challenges.
   Existing knowledge gaps and challenges are outlined for each of the
   climatic events and priorities for future research are suggested.},

Title = {Association between Antarctic Sea ice, Pacific SST and the Indian summer
   monsoon: An observational study},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper, results of diagnostic analysis for the period 1983-2015,
   demonstrate a robust relationship between Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall
   (ISMR) and sea ice area (SIA) over the two sectors of Antarctica namely,
   Western Pacific Ocean (WPO) and Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas (BAS).
   A significant direct (inverse) relationship is observed between ISMR and
   SIA over the WPO (BAS) sector. Further, plausible physical mechanism
   governing this relationship is proposed. El Nino Modoki exhibit direct
   (inverse) relation with SIA over BAS (WPO) sector during summer monsoon
   season, which has prompted investigation of SIA-El Nino Modoki-ISMR
   connection. The linkage between southern polar sea ice and the Indian
   summer monsoon has been demonstrated through the Pacific Ocean, wherein
   above normal SIA over the BAS (WPO) sector is associated with concurrent
   warm equatorial central (western) Pacific Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
   anomalies. Associated meridional circulations supplemented by above
   normal BAS (WPO) SIA extremes is accompanied by an ascending motion over
   the equatorial central (western) Pacific. In turn, through large-scale
   zonal circulation, ascending branch of circulation over the central
   (western) Pacific Ocean contemporaneously impacts ISMR adversely
   (favourably). Large-scale atmospheric circulation modulated by
   equatorial Pacific SST signature is suggested as a possible link between
   Antarctic sea ice and ISMR.},

Title = {Estimation of the value of buildings and structures in the context of
   permafrost degradation: The case of the Russian Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {According to modern scientific forecasts, global climate change will
   lead to permafrost degradation in a significant part of the Russian
   Arctic by the second half of the 21st century. Permafrost thaw will
   cause massive deformation and destruction of fixed assets. The purpose
   of this research is to estimate the value of buildings and structures
   located in the Russian Arctic permafrost zone, an important baseline for
   further direct damage prediction. Currently, there is no reliable and
   comprehensive information about the value of buildings and structures in
   the risk area. Making such an estimate would require not only
   determining the current value of existing buildings and structures, but
   also forecasting what will happen between now and the second half of the
   21st century. This paper uses an original method to assess the value of
   buildings and structures in different Russian Arctic municipalities that
   takes into account the value of housing stock, existing and future
   buildings and structures by economic sector. According to our
   calculations, the total value of buildings and structures in the Russian
   Arctic permafrost zone will be about US\$133.5 billion by the second
   half of the 21st century. Of this, about US\$94.5 billion will be
   located in areas of maximum predicted permafrost thaw.},

   calibrations of different relative gravimeters},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {We conducted gravity observations in Antarctica at Jang Bogo Station
   (JBS) during the 2019-2020 Austral summer season using an FG5-210
   absolute gravimeter (AG) and a LaCoste \& Romberg (LCR) Model D-58
   relative gravimeter. Absolute gravity measurements were successfully
   made at reference gravity point JBSAG1 and newly established gravity
   point JBSAG2, yielding about 19,000 and 14,400 drops of data,
   respectively, with measurement precisions better than 0.4 mu Gal (1 mu
   Gal = 10(-8) m s(-2)). In addition, relative gravity measurements were
   conducted at 10 other newly established gravity points, with accuracies
   better than 10 mu Gal, to supplement the absolute gravity data.
   Superconducting gravimeter (SG) observation with an iGrav-021 instrument
   has been underway at JBS since 2016. Since an SG is a relative
   gravimeter, the calibration of the scale factor is essential for
   long-term gravity monitoring. In addition, the D-58 instrument was
   required for scale factor calibration. To calibrate the scale factors of
   these gravimeters, we first estimated a value for the iGrav-021 using
   parallel observations with the FG5-210 instrument. The D-58 scale factor
   was then estimated indirectly from parallel observations with the
   iGrav-021. These calibrations should ensure accurate gravity monitoring
   in future work.},

Abstract = {Antarctic carbonaceous chondrite (CC) meteorite chip samples in the
   Japanese and US collections have been studied by an ultraviolet (UV),
   visible (Vis), and near-infrared (NIR) (UVVNIR) spectrometer and a
   Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, targeting small areas of
   about 2-6 mm in diameter. UVVNIR and FTIR reflectance spectra of 169
   spots on 148 CC chips were measured on their naturally broken surfaces
   with no sample preparation. Among them, 83 spectra were accepted as
   reasonably free of terrestrial weathering or surface texture effects.
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR measurements of a weathered sample
   revealed that gypsum likely formed on its surface after recovery from
   Antarctica. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the UVVNIR-FTIR
   combined spectra allowed distinguishing powder and chip or surface
   texture and identifying their class and thermal metamorphism. Gaussian
   fitting of the 3 mu m absorption band of hydrous CC samples allowed for
   removal of the spectral effects of adsorbed H2O and for the extraction
   of structural absorption bands which are characteristic of CC classes
   and degree of aqueous alteration. These results suggest that CC-like
   rocks on small asteroids without fine regolith can be identified through
   spectral reflectance measurements by spacecraft, landers, or rovers.},

Title = {Identification of Dalapon degrading bacterial strain, Psychrobacter sp.
   TaeBurcu001 isolated from Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Extreme microorganism has gained interest because of their special
   contribution to the environmental and industrial biotechnology,
   particularly psychrophilic microorganisms which can live and thrive at
   lower temperatures. They produce enzymes with great potential to adapt
   to extreme conditions. In this study, a novel psychrophilic bacterial
   strain designated as TaeBurcu001 grew (optimally at 5.C) on a chemically
   defined medium containing dalapon (refer to as 2,2-dichloropropionic
   acid, 2,2-DCP) as the sole carbon source. TaeBurcu001 was isolated from
   Galindez Island, Antarctica. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA
   gene sequence (GeneBank ID MN061637) showed that TaeBurcu001 was closely
   related to members of the genus Psychrobacter (99\%). Comparisons of
   phenotypic and biochemical characteristics between the isolate and the
   other known Psychrobacter species showed that they are very similar.
   Chloride ion release was detected using colorimetric assay with maximum
   value recorded at 0.27 mmol/L in 30 mM of 2,2-DCP. Furthermore, the
   partial dehalogenase sequence of Psychrobacter TaeBurcu001 (GeneBank ID
   MW311072) showed a very high similarity (88\%) to the previously
   reported 2-haloacid dehalogenase (DehE) from Rhizobium sp. (GeneBank ID
   CAA75671). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   reporting on the isolation and characterisation of psychrophilic
   bacteria able to grow on halogenated compounds as a carbon source.
   Results are expected to gain new insight for further studies to uncover
   the full potential of these microorganisms to be applied in
   environmental processes and the remediation of contaminated ecosystems.},

   permafrost},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Drilling fluid in Arctic permafrost needs to have good ultra-low
   temperature rheology, shale inhibition, hydrate inhibition and
   environmental protection performance. In this work, the properties of
   ultra-low temperature drilling fluid and additives have been evaluated
   by using rheology and fluid filtration tests, shale inhibition tests,
   hydrate inhibition tests, thermal conductivity measurements and
   biotoxicity tests. Thereafter, the key additives have been optimized and
   the ultra-low temperature water-based drilling fluid formula was
   developed. The results show that the base fluid, which combined NaC1 and
   ethylene glycol (EG), can meet the requirement of freezing point in
   Arctic drilling, and it also has low thermal conductivity and good
   hydrate inhibition. Xanthan gum (XC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)
   have been selected as viscosifiers, carboxymethyl starch (CMS) as
   filtrate reducer and polyetheramine as shale inhibitor. The drilling
   fluid has good ultra-low temperature rheology with the freezing point of
   -32 degrees C. Furthermore, it has low thermal conductivity, and can
   inhibit shale dispersion, expansion and collapse, which is conducive to
   the stability of wellbore in Arctic permafrost. In addition, it can
   effectively inhibit hydrate formation and has good environmental
   protection performance. The drilling fluid invented in this study can
   provide technical support for ultra-low temperature drilling in Arctic
   permafrost.},

Abstract = {We studied the concentrations, characteristics, ecological risk, and
   health risk of 12 probably carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) in KGI soils of Antarctica. Measured concentrations of 12 PAHs
   ranged from 1.83 to 32.9 ng g(-1) with an average of 11.9 +/- 8.13 ng
   g(-1). The assessment of ecological risks used methods that were based
   on total toxicity equivalency concentrations (TEQs) and a risk quotient
   (RQ), which can be used to sensitively and accurately assess Sigma PAHs.
   The results indicated that PAHs in the soils of KGI presented a low risk
   level to living organisms in the soil and to plants. The low molecular
   weight PAHs presented a much greater ecological risk than high molecular
   weight PAHs in KGI soils, and the levels of these ecological risks were
   classified as low compared to those of previous studies in other areas.
   The total values of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for children
   and adults were 2.34 x 10(-8) and 1.73 x 10(-8), respectively. Soil
   samples from KGI that were contaminated with PAHs still exhibited risks
   that were much lower than that of the baseline value. The results of
   this investigation provide a database for contamination evaluation, risk
   assessment of ecological and human health in PAH-contaminated sites.},

Abstract = {Mineralogy of fine-grained matrix (FGM), fine-grained rim (FGR),
   chondrule rim, and altered mesostasis of a chondrule from the Asuka (A)
   12169 CM3.0 chondrite was investigated by field emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FE-SEM), synchrotron radiation-based X-ray
   nano-tomography (SR-XCT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   SR-XCT and TEM observations revealed that both FGM and FGR contain
   abundant amorphous silicate embedding nano-inclusions (most are Fe-Ni
   sulfide). Although the amorphous silicate is more or less hydrated based
   on the analysis of the X-ray linear attenuation coefficients in SR-XCT,
   there are no areas filled by abundant phyllosilicate even in three
   dimensions. However, FGM and FGR contain similar to 2-10 mu m-sized
   aggregates composed of tochilinite, nano-inclusions of possible
   magnetite, and poorly crystalline serpentine without sharp boundaries
   with the surroundings. It is unlikely that the heterogeneity resulted
   from brecciation and mixing of materials that experienced different
   degrees of aqueous alteration, but more likely from a very early stage
   of aqueous alteration that proceeded heterogeneously depending on
   locally different chemistry. Chondrule mesostasis near the surface of a
   chondrule was altered to saponite with tochilinite-rich aggregates.
   These observations indicate that the degree aqueous alteration of A
   12169 is very low and that it is comparable with that of Acfer 094, ALH
   77307, and the least altered areas of Paris.},

   Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) project; especially
   focusing on the initial stage of SENSU (Syowa South and East HF Radars
   of NIPR for SUperDARN) project. The SENSU Syowa South HF radar operated
   by NIPR was one of the starting members of the initial SuperDARN radar
   operating at Syowa Station in Antarctica in 1995. It provided
   bi-directional common-volume observations with the Halley radar. In 1997
   the SENSU Syowa East radar was installed. The King Salmon radar
   organized by NICT was installed in Alaska, USA in 2001. The Hokkaido
   East radar organized by Nagoya University was installed in Hokkaido,
   Japan in 2006, and the Hokkaido West radar began operation in 2014. The
   Japanese group has also contributed to SuperDARN by hosting three
   SuperDARN workshops in Japan namely: 1) in Tokyo in 1998 hosted by NIPR,
   2) in Hokkaido in 2007 hosted by Nagoya University and 3) at Yamanashi
   in 2019 hosted by NICT.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {An isolate of a novel fungus and an isolate of a novel fungus-like
   microbe were obtained during field research conducted in
   Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui, Quebec, in subarctic Canada, located on the
   southeastern coast of Hudson Bay, from August to September 2016. The
   isolates were identified as a Typhula sp. and Globisporangium sp. (syn.
   Pythium sp.), respectively. Mycelia with clamps connections were
   isolated from small sclerotia (0.2-0.7 x 0.5-1.2 mm in size) collected
   from dead leaves of sea pea (Lathyrus japonicus) on the banks of the
   Great Whale River in Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui. The isolate was found
   to be closely related with T. japonica based on sclerotium morphology
   and hyphal growth under different temperatures. The Globisporangium sp.
   isolate was found to be most closely related to G. okanoganense based on
   phylogenetic analyses using rDNAITS. G. okanoganense is known as an
   important pathogen causing snow rot on wheat and other winter crops.
   Further investigation is needed to determine whether the novel fungus
   and fungus-like microbe found in Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui are
   phytopathogenic like the snow rot pathogens to which they are closely
   related.},

Title = {Direct sampling and bioanalyses of atmospheric bioaerosols using a

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To determine whether the microorganisms in the Antarctica ice core are a
   result of evolution or long-range transport, there is a need to sample
   and analyze atmospheric bioaerosols within the air mass at high
   altitudes in Antarctica; however, reports providing such data are
   limited. In this study, direct sampling of atmospheric bioaerosol was
   performed at an altitude of 1000 m using a tethered balloon over Syowa
   Station in east Antarctica, from 15:18 to 16:18 (local time) on January
   3, 2013. Meteorological data indicate that the sampled air mass was in a
   high mixed layer and/or the low free troposphere. Backward air mass
   trajectories indicated that the air moved from the coastal area in west
   Antarctica to the midcontinent. By bioanalyzing the air mass at an
   altitude of 1000 m, the air mass near the ground, puddle water, and sand
   near the sampling point, microorganisms in the class of Bacilli and
   Chloroplast were found to have been transported over a long range from
   western Antarctica over Syowa Station in eastern Antarctica.},

Title = {Spatial and seasonal variations of black carbon over the Arctic in a
   regional climate model},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Black Carbon (BC) absorbs the radiation and alters snow/ice albedo,
   which influences the Earth-Atmosphere radiation balance over the Arctic
   region. BC masses are estimated using Weather Research and Forecasting
   with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model over the Arctic region during the boreal
   winter and summer seasons of 2018. The meteorological parameters such as
   near surface temperature and relative humidity in WRF-CHEM are found to
   agree well with the observations. BC masses are found between 5-20 ng
   m(-3) during boreal winter over most parts of the Arctic, while BC
   values are double in summer. Siberian and Canadian regions exhibit
   higher BC concentrations (> 30 ng m(-3)) owing to the fire activities.
   BC produced by fires in the Alaska and Canadian regions of Arctic have
   lesser spread than BC form Siberian fires as the winds are mostly from
   east to west in winter. The model simulated BC is lower and higher than
   the observed BC during winter and summer respectively over Ny-Alesund.
   However, the day to day variations can be captured by the model. The
   vertical profile of BC shows two peaks in winter, one at 1 km and the
   other strong peak at higher altitude of 12.5 km associated with
   long-range transport from mid-latitude and tropical regions, while in
   summer one peak at lower altitude is found. BC has large spatial
   variations in the Arctic which can significantly impact the Arctic as
   well as global climate.},

Abstract = {Scientific results should contribute to society. To enable effective use
   of valuable results, scientists join the groups of communities or
   citizens and exchange knowledge and data about target subjects,
   especially subjects associated with environmental issues and a
   sustainable society. The symposium organizations or the academic society
   offer opportunities for exchanging knowledge, opinions, and data among
   scientists, regional society, and citizens. Such opportunities must be
   continuous and systematic. The University of the Arctic (UArctic) Course
   in Greenland received participants from the government, local
   communities, and UArctic. Based on knowledge from lectures, the
   participants discussed many themes such as subjects associated with a
   sustainable society in this era of global warming. Although this Course
   may be in the early stage, this kind of activity must continue for the
   Arctic life. The International Symposium in Mombetsu has a long history
   of communication between scientists from the Symposium and local
   communities, which benefits systematic fishery, sightseeing of sea ice,
   and environmental education for children.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The early Alpine glaciation is known from few sources detailing initial
   growth of ice either during the late Oligocene or early Miocene,
   localities limited to high summits of East Antarctica. The Ant-831
   paleosol, developed in moraine emplaced during the Alpine event, has
   been studied with respect to its pedogenesis and to rinds recovered from
   its pebble pavement. This pedostratigraphic section is assigned a late
   Oligocene/early Miocene age on the basis of its fossil Coleoptera fauna
   and tundra vegetation, Fe/Al relative-age-dating parameters, and
   extensive pebble clast weathering. SEM, XRD and XRF analyses of rind
   specimens from the pebble pavement yield new information on the
   weathering history of the Beacon sandstone and its link to a juxtaposed
   paleosol. The paleosol provides a mirror image to weathering zones in
   pavement clasts, the salt-rich zones interpreted to have formed during
   the cold-dry paleoclimate of the post-Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum
   (MMCO -15 Ma) following a stronger oxidizing paleoclimate of the earlier
   cold-wet phase of the Alpine glaciation. Essentially this database
   provides a 30-Myr window into the weathering progression from inception
   of the Alpine glaciation, through the warmer MMCO dated to -15 Ma, to
   the onset of cold-dry conditions that brought on the later development
   of the Inland Ice Sheet.},

   NyAlesund using Sentinel-1 SAR},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A total of 15 glaciers in the Ny-Alesund region were studied for their
   glacier radar zones vis-a-vis ELA over the period 2016-2020, using the
   multi-seasonal SAR data. All the glaciers were comprised of three zones,
   namely middle percolation/wet snow, lower percolation/wet snow, and
   clean ice. Using the anomalies of temperature and precipitation derived
   from Ny Alesund meteorological station, it is observed that the ELA for
   most of the glaciers shifted to a higher altitude during 2016-2018 when
   the temperature was slightly high as compared to the long term mean,
   while it shifted down the glacier due to heavy accumulation and low
   temperature during 2019-20. The maximum shift of +/- 25 (with an
   uncertainty of +/- 6.85 m arising out of remote sensing data) in ELA,
   was detected during 2016-2020. These results obtained using geospatial
   technology-based analysis are provided for assessing the impact of
   climate change on the behaviour of the glaciers.},

Title = {Role of polar vortex weakening in cold events in central Asia during
   late winter},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The cause of cold events over central Asia was investigated. Since 1958,
   surface air temperature (SAT) has gradually increased over central Asia,
   but SAT has shown very strong multidecadal fluctuations, with cooling
   dominant in the 1960s-1970s and recent decades but warming dominant in
   the 1990s. SAT in February in central Asia has decreased by more than 7
   degrees C compared to that in normal years. Analysis indicates that cold
   events over central Asia are related to the weakening of the polar
   vortex, which is indicated by the increase in polar cap height (PCH) and
   weaker zonal-mean zonal winds. The increase in PCH begins in January in
   the stratosphere and propagates down to the troposphere in February; it
   is well reflected in the weakening of zonal-mean zonal winds in the
   stratosphere in January, which extends to the troposphere in February.
   The January increase in PCH anomaly is associated with surface
   conditions in the Arctic region, especially the Barents-Kara seas, where
   sea level pressure increases substantially in January; high pressure
   then expands to the southeastern (downstream) branch of the Siberian
   high in February, bringing cold eastern Siberian air to central Asia.},

Title = {The Far-Eastern Hectare Law and land in the Sakha Republic (Russia)},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Sakha Republic is the largest region of the Russian Federation by
   territory. At the same time, it is also considered one of the most
   sparsely populated regions. Because of the Republic's size and
   relatively small population, the Russian government included the
   Republic in the Far-Eastern Hectare Law (FEHL) in 2016 in order to
   repopulate and render productive the region. According to this law, any
   Russian citizen can apply for and receive a 1-ha land plot in the Sakha
   Republic for free. Expectedly, the Far Eastern Hectare Law caused mass
   discontent amongst Sakha residents and has led to ongoing protests. This
   article examines the contested understandings of land and property in
   the text of the FEHL and the daily practices of Sakha residents, as well
   as the demands and rhetoric of Sakha's protesters. Turning land into
   property through FEHL is a form of land and territorial dispossession
   (Harvey, 2004; Coulthard, 2014). This article argues that the FEHL
   violates the rights of the Sakha people to use their native lands. The
   land conflict between the federal government and the inhabitants of the
   Sakha Republic resulted in the emergence of a new concept in the social
   and political space of the Republic: ancestral lands. In turn, this new
   concept has led to a reexamination of the definition of Indigenous
   peoples in the Sakha Republic.},

Title = {The origin of driftwood on eastern and south-western Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Arctic is one of the regions where the effect of global change is
   most evident. Associated with warming are changes in snow, sea ice and
   hydroclimate, all which have significant impacts on environments and
   society. However, due to short observational records, it is difficult to
   set the current climate in a long-term context. Arctic driftwood (DW),
   available throughout the Holocene, is a paleoclimate resource that may
   shed information on past sea-ice, ocean current and atmospheric
   conditions because it is transported by sea ice across the Arctic.
   Moreover, DW tree-ring data can be used to interpret climate in the
   boreal forests where the trees grew. Here we present a study of 380 DW
   samples collected on eastern and south-western Svalbard. Combining
   species identification and dendrochronology, it was found that the DW
   mainly consisted of Pinus sylvestris, Picea sp. and Larix sp. (87\% of
   all samples), mainly originating from northern Russia. In total, 60\% of
   the DW could be dated and their provenance determined, and four
   tree-ring width chronologies representing Yenisei and Dvina-Pechora were
   constructed, facilitating extension and improvement of the existing
   chronologies representing those regions. Moreover, DW from relict
   beaches that can be subjected to dendrochronological analyses, provides
   possibilities to extend pan-Arctic tree-ring data even further back in
   time. Because there are several processes governing the temporal
   patterns of wood deposition in the Arctic, using DW as an indicator of
   sea-ice variations needs further investigation.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This research note describes how the Japanese five-year Arctic research
   program ?Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS)? was implemented,
   focusing on its activities that supported the research, with a brief
   introduction of the background of Japan?s Arctic research. There were
   two shifts in the style of Japan?s Arctic research during the last 10?15
   years: from small research projects by individual scientists to a large
   national program, and from a purely scientific program to a
   comprehensive Arctic research program. Governmental policy played a
   crucial role in these shifts. As a national program, ArCS was required
   to expand Japanese Arctic research capabilities, and to deliver research
   results to multiple stakeholders. It was to meet these requirements that
   several supporting activities were included in addition to the research
   itself: establishing research and observation platforms, sending young
   researchers to overseas institutions, sending experts to the Arctic
   Council working groups, and enhancing outreach activities targeting both
   the general public in Japan and the international Arctic research
   community. Objectives, design, and outcomes of these supporting
   activities are described respectively.},

Title = {Features of Late Pleistocene massive ice formation in the central Yamal
   Peninsula based on isotopic signature (O-18, H-2) of ice},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {On Yamal Peninsula massive ice is widespread cryogenic object, lying
   close to the surface in different sediments, often in a combination with
   ice wedges. This study is dedicated to tabular massive ground ice
   exposed in the outcrop of the thermocirque of the third sea terrace in
   the Central Yamal Peninsula to establish the mechanism of ice formation
   and the source of water based on the isotopic signature of ice. The
   tabular massive ground ice body was opened with visual thickness of 2.5
   m and a length of 300 m. It had formed from 43 to 37 cal ka BP according
   to C-14 AMS-data. A white ice body was found under the visible lower
   boundary of the studied tabular massive ground ice. Tabular massive
   ground ice yielded values of delta(18)? from -19.9 to -23.1 parts per
   thousand and delta H-2 from -151.8 to -164.7 parts per thousand, with
   variations in deuterium excess from 6.5 to 20.4 parts per thousand
   (average d(exc) = 13 parts per thousand). The delta(18)? and delta H-2
   values of white ice vary from -17.5 to -22.5 parts per thousand, and
   from -132.6 to -165.3 parts per thousand respectively. The delta
   H-2-delta(18)? relationship for white ice indicating the injection of
   water and its freezing in a closed system condition. The study shows
   that the tabular massive ground ice is an intra-ground ice formed under
   sub-aquatic conditions from lake water. During syngenetic accumulation
   of segregated massive ice unstable freezing took place, widespread
   feature of cold regions, which led to intrusion of water under pressure
   and form injection ice.},

   Diversity, abundance and chromosomal distribution},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Deschampsia antarctica is one of the two native vascular plants present
   in the Antarctic continent. More than half of its genome is composed of
   repetitive DNA. The present work aims to study the amount, composition
   and chromosomal localization of the main retroelements in the genome of
   D. antarctica, via a bioinformatic analysis and cytogenetic approach in
   two Antarctic localities. The retroelements are the largest fraction of
   genomic repetitive DNA. Ty3-Gypsy superfamily was more abundant than
   Ty1-Copia in D. antarctica's genome. However, Ty1-Copia was more
   diverse. Angela, SIRE, TatV and Tekay families were the most abundant in
   the studied genome. The hybridization signals showed that the four
   retrotransposon families have dispersal distributions in both Antarctic
   localities studied. However, some differences in the chromosomal
   distribution were observed among families and between localities. This
   study contributes to the understanding of the diversity and distribution
   of repetitive DNA in D. antarctica.},

Abstract = {The soil temperature within the Arctic coasts within the continuous
   permafrost is not widely measured; the temporal and spatial resolutions
   of the measured temperature observations are relatively high. In this
   study, we examined the methods to interpolate, hindcast and forecast
   temperature measurements within the active layer and shallow permafrost
   when the temperature measurements at the surface or near the surface are
   available. The temperature variations along the year are periodic, and
   hence attempts are made to express the seasonal variations with a
   combination of periodic function (Fourier components); which are used as
   boundary conditions to reach the analytical solutions. The temperature
   measurements from surface to about 10 metre of depths at the
   Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea are available. We adopted a data-driven
   model based on simplified analytical closed-form solution derived from
   the boundary conditions. The parameters of the solution are calibrated
   from the field measurements and validated with field observations. The
   model then can be used to hindcast and forecast temperature at any
   points within the soil.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Shrub encroachment and soil respiration (SR) are predicted to increase
   in the tundra ecosystem under climate warming, but little is known
   regarding potential causal relationships between shrubs and SR at a
   local scale. Multiple and complex belowground processes exist between
   the two phenomena, and consolidation is logistically difficult. Our
   study aimed to identify and integrate multiple belowground processes to
   elucidate the impact of shrub coverage on SR, using structural equation
   modeling (SEM). Results indicated that shrub coverage enhanced SR
   through root biomass, fungal community composition and soil temperature.
   SEM also revealed a potential indirect effect via interactions among
   those soil factors. Soil factors relating heterotrophic respiration
   affected on SR through more complex interaction among the factors.
   However, total effect sizes on SR were similar between factors relating
   autotrophic respiration and that relating heterotrophic respiration,
   suggesting that SR increases with shrub coverage would be unlikely to
   result from decreases in soil organic matter.},

Title = {Long-term consequences of goose exclusion on nutrient cycles and plant
   communities in the High-Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Geese can profoundly affect arctic ecosystems directly (e.g., by grazing
   vegetation) and indirectly (e.g. by changing nutrient cycling resulting
   from faces inputs and by reducing plant litter). In the Arctic, behavior
   and abundance of geese have changed due to climate and land-use change.
   While the short-term effects of increased goose populations on tundra
   ecosystems are known, there is a knowledge gap for long-term
   consequences of goose population changes on nutrient cycling and plant
   communities, especially in the High-Arctic. Here, we compared wetland
   sites where geese have been almost absent for at least 50 years (Pond
   Inlet), and nearby sites where geese are abundant or sites where they
   have been excluded experimentally by cages and where the ground has been
   experimentally fertilized for over 16 years (Bylot Island). Long-term
   goose disappearance increased inorganic nutrients in wetlands through
   increased plant litter decomposition and changed community composition,
   likely by altering competitive relationships between three dominant
   vascular plant species that are different in terms of nutrient
   acquisition and use. In experimentally fertilized sites, inorganic
   nutrients were similarly increased, but fertilization had contrast
   effects on plant community composition compared with herbivory, released
   plant species from the nutrient limitation and converted wetland
   habitats to a dryer state. Overall, our results suggest that the direct
   effects of goose herbivory on vegetation are more profound than their
   indirect effects through an alternation of nutrient cycling even in
   nutrient-limited wetlands of the Arctic. These findings emphasize the
   need to assess long-term direct impacts of herbivores on vegetation.},

Abstract = {We examined fragmentary human skeletal remains from Escalon Cave near
   Surigao City, northeastern Mindanao, the Philippines, with respect to
   the morphology of bones and teeth, radiocarbon dating, and mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. These remains contained parts of the left
   temporal bone, the right humerus, the right femur, the upper right first
   and second premolars, and the first molar. They are presumed to belong
   to an early-middle adult male, whom we named the Escalon Man. Using the
   femur sample, we estimated the C-14 date of the individual at 2692 +/-
   39 years BP (uncalibrated). His stature, estimated from the maximum
   femur length, was about 170 cm this makes him much taller than the Aeta
   and the Mamanwa, who are indigenous negrito hunter-gatherers of the
   Philippines. The femur is sturdy and shows well-developed muscle
   markings. Numerous narrow grooves on the humerus were found in close
   proximity to each other, but we could not prove whether these are
   artificial cut marks made by humans with sharp-edged tools or scratches
   from some non-human entity. The mesiodistal crown diameters of the molar
   and premolars are large and resemble those of native Oceanians. Analysis
   of mtDNA haplogroup was carried out using a DNA sample extracted from a
   molar. A next-generation sequencer was used to determine the nucleotide
   sequences of the mtDNA genome. The results indicated that the Escalon
   Man belongs to the haplogroup Elal a, which is known to be the marker of
   Austronesian-speaking agriculturist populations that originated in
   Taiwan and spread southwards through the Philippines to the Western
   Pacific, since about 4000 BR. Thus, the Escalon Man was likely a member
   of the late Neolithic or early Metal Age agriculturist peoples who
   settled in northeastern Mindanao and who may be the ancestors of the
   territory's present-day occupants, such as the Manobo.},

Abstract = {Domesticated camelids spread to Peru's Northern Highlands by 500 BC. The
   complexity and development of the society that then developed in the
   region have been explained by social networks enabled by the use of the
   llama as a cargo animal. However, the actual use of domesticated
   camelids in the Formative Period remains unclear. This study analyzed
   camelid skeletal remains excavated from the Pacopampa site (1200-400 BC)
   to provide information on the actual use of these animals. Osteometry
   determined the camelid to be llama; alpaca was not identified in the
   samples. Body part frequency, butchering mark distribution, and
   mortality profile revealed ritual consumption of the meaty part of young
   individuals. Four sacrificed immature llamas were detected. In contrast
   to the great similarity with the consumption process of artiodactyls'
   only llamas were sacrificed, while deer were not targeted. Although them
   were no features in the animal bone material indicating the use of
   secondary products, the increasing number of artifacts related to
   textile production suggest the fiber might be the result of llama
   herding.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal patterns in arctic fox (Vulpes alopex) diets revealed by
   molecular analysis of scats from Northeast Greenland},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is endemic to the Arctic where it holds
   a central position in the trophic interactions. The diet of the species
   has previously been described as being highly flexible, but whether this
   flexibility is a constant trait through time, or merely reflects fast
   temporal changes in abundance among prey taxa, has so far been poorly
   resolved. Using molecular analyses of arctic fox scats from Northeast
   Greenland, we first examined the temporal dynamics of arctic fox diets
   during the short snow-free season, and then examined whether local food
   availability at different sites affected arctic fox dependence on
   lemmings. Arctic fox diets included most terrestrial vertebrate species
   found in the region, and exhibited substantial temporal changes,
   generally reflecting the dynamic changes in prey availability from late
   winter through autumn. This dietary flexibility was also reflected
   geographically, with arctic foxes consuming a variety of local prey
   (mainly waterfowl and lemmings) in summer. Moreover, the dietary
   response of arctic foxes to changes in lemming abundance depended on
   access to non-lemming prey. Based on these findings, we discuss whether
   varying degrees of lemming-dependency, combined with geographical
   differences in winter food availability, may explain previously
   published differences in arctic fox breeding patterns in high arctic
   Greenland.},

Title = {Antibiotic resistance and cold-adaptive enzymes of antarctic culturable
   bacteria from King George Island},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cryotolerance in microorganisms from polar regions provides their
   survival through alternating freezing and thawing cycles. Our research
   was aimed at biodiversity analysis of culturable bacteria from the King
   George Island near Antarctica including their antibiotic resistance and
   cold-adaptive enzymes. Average bacterial density was estimated as 3 x
   10(6) cells/mL but the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was
   essentially lower -(3.2-9.2)x10(3) cells/mL. Totally, 83 stable strains
   were isolated and identified using phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA
   gene nucleotide sequences and phenotypic traits. Main groups were the
   Gram-negative Pseudomonas and Duganella species as well as Gram-positive
   Arthrobacter spp. Besides, eubacteria Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium,
   Clavibacter, Aquaspirillum, Polaromonas, Actinibacterium, Shewanella,
   Kocuria and families Comamonadacea, Actinobacteridae were found. Genetic
   diversity of the bacteria was elevated with plasmids of different
   lengths in 33 strains but no correlation between the plasmids content
   and antibiotic resistance was found. Among cold-adapted enzymes
   antioxidant catalases (91.5\%), peroxidases (57.5\%), alkaline
   phosphatases (42.2\%) prevailed; unspecific exonucleases were revealed
   in 16.9\% strains and restriction endonucleases of type II -in 8.4\%
   strains only. Lypases were detected in 24 strains (28.9\%) and could
   facilitate membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Despite the antibiotic
   resistance the Antarctic cultivable eubacteria are mainly not pathogenic
   and may serve as sources of plasmids and cold-adapted enzymes for
   biotechnology.},

Title = {Responses of various types of antennas to the globally distributed
   air-earth current monitored at Maitri, Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The role of antennas in the detection of atmospheric conduction current
   has been discussed since the beginning of the 20th century. Propriety of
   the antenna design needs to be reviewed from time to time as the
   measurements experience different problems on various terrains. The
   present work deals with such issues and brings out a suitable antenna
   design to detect the conduction current observed at the Indian
   Scientific Research Station at Maitri (70.8 degrees 5 11.7 degrees E),
   Antarctica. Two long wire antennas and two plate antennas are
   simultaneously used to monitor the air-Earth current in the open space
   at this station. The experiments reveal that the currents recorded by
   the long-wire antenna and plate antenna display similar characteristics
   but differ in the magnitude and the response to the varying current. On
   a fair-weather day the mean current density obtained by 41 m long-wire
   antenna is similar to 0.4 pA m(-2), 10 m long-wire antenna is 2.5 pA
   m(-2), 0.25 m(2) plate antenna is 3.5 pA m(-2,) and 1 m(2) plate antenna
   is 4.2 pA m(-2). The current sensed by 1 s and 1000 s R-C time constant
   do not show any significant difference in the hourly mean diurnal
   variation as well as in the magnitude. The study reveals that a plate
   antenna is a better option for the long term monitoring of air-Earth
   current. The simultaneously monitored potential gradient at this station
   and Vostok (78.4 degrees 5, 106.8 degrees E) are used to identify the
   local and global electric signals.},

Abstract = {We investigated the transport and heat loss of the Pacific Summer Water
   (PSW) along the Chukchi Sea northern slope using the temperature,
   salinity, and velocity data of the mooring time series obtained in
   2003-2005 (Period 1) and 2015-2019 (Period 2). The PSW at Stations
   HSN/NHC on the Chukchi Sea northern slope was warmer and fresher in
   Period 2 than in Period 1. Results from a lag correlation analysis of
   the temperature time series provide quantitative evidence to suggest
   that the PSW was transported from Barrow Canyon to Stations HSN/NHC by
   the northwestward Chukchi Slope Current. The advection time was 7-61days
   in the layer of 30-60 m. The tem-perature and salinity mostly decreased
   during PSW transport. Vertical mixing with the surface cold water could
   be a potential factor for temperature decrease. This decrease in Period
   2 were higher than that in Period 1. This large decrease was probably
   influenced by stratification rather than wind conditions.},

   peak of the directional derivative of SuperDARN convection flow. In this
   paper these effects have been considered when identifying the OCB in the
   night sector, calculated using the directional derivatives of SuperDARN
   convection flow during the active substorm interval which occurred on
   October 14, 2001. Statistical comparison of the latitudes of the OCB, as
   estimated from the peaks of the directional derivative of the SuperDARN
   convection flow, determined with and without considering the relative
   maxima and minima vorticity, and as provided by images taken by the two
   Far Ultraviolet (FUV) Spectral Imagers onboard the IMAGE spacecraft
   (SI-12 and SI-13) indicates that the modified approach of the
   directional derivative of the SuperDARN convection flow may be used as
   an OCB proxy during active geomagnetic activity.},

Title = {Ice drilling system with near-bottom hot water circulation},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ice drilling systems with near-bottom hot water circulation can be used
   for many challenging scientific tasks in the study of ice sheets,
   glaciers, and subglacial environments. These systems melt ice using
   water jets heated directly at the bottom of the hole, thus eliminating
   the use of long heavy hoses and surface pumps. To investigate the
   influence of the drill tip shape and nozzle diameter on the drilling
   process, a simplified laboratory prototype of the drill was designed and
   tested. The rated power of the downhole electric heater was 5.5 kW. A
   total of six melting tips in two groups were tested: three tips having a
   conical shape with different heights/angles and three parabolic tips
   with different focal parameters. In general, the conical tips provided a
   more stable drilling process. The experimental results showed that the
   rate of penetration (ROP) was highest when the specific load on the
   thermal tip was -0.5 N cm-2 or 30\% of the total drill prototype weight.
   The highest ROP of 2.5-3.1 m h- 1was achieved with a nozzle diameter of
   3.0 mm (at a flow rate of 3.0 L min-1). At the same time, the higher the
   flow rate, the faster the drilling speed was.},

Title = {Increasing dust emission from ice free terrain in southeastern Greenland
   since 2000},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mineral dust plays a key role in both local and global climates. At high
   latitudes, atmospheric dust can affect icenuclei formation, and surface
   dust can reduce the albedo as well as increase subsequent ice melting.
   As a proxy for past climate, mineral dust is preserved in ice cores, but
   few studies have examined deposited dust in ice cores during the
   Anthropocene, especially after 2000. We measured dust concentrations in
   an ice core at the southeastern dome in Greenland (SE-Dome), and
   reconstructed the annual and seasonal dust fluxes during 1960?2014. We
   find the annual average flux during 1960?2014 to be 34.8 ? 13.5 mg m- 2
   yr-1, a value about twice that of ice cores further inland. The more
   recent part of that period, 2000?2014, has the higher annual flux of
   46.6 ? 16.2 mg m- 2 yr-1. The annual and autumn dust fluxes highly
   correlate with air temperature in Tasiilaq (r = 0.61 and 0.50,
   respectively), a coastal location in southeastern Greenland. Our results
   suggest that the local dust emissions at the coastal region are
   increasing due to a decreasing seasonal snow-cover area arising from
   coastal Greenland warming after 2000.},

   forcing},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The author reconstructed in-situ volume transport (VT) through the
   Bering Strait using the NNW wind component, the gradient of dynamic
   ocean topography (DOT) across the strait and DOT in the East Siberian
   Sea (RMSE = 0.2 Sv). The difference between in-situ VT and reconstructed
   VT (diffVT) was correlated with DOT in the northern Bering Sea shelf
   (DOTBER) during fall and winter. DOTBER was then introduced to the
   multiple linear regression model. The reconstructed VT shows the
   improved accuracy of reconstruction (RMSE = 0.16). Also, the author
   found DOTBER contributes to constant northward transport rather than the
   variability of in-situ VT. Those suggest that DOTBER represents a part
   of the pressure head forcing. EOF 1st mode of DOT (DOT-EOF1) was
   correlated with diffVT during fall season. SVD analysis revealed EOF 2nd
   mode of DOT is related to the Aleutian Low pressure pattern, but
   DOT-EOF1 is not related to the atmospheric circulation. The author found
   that positive correlation (R = 0.46) between DOT-EOF1 and the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Those suggest that the variability of DOT in
   the Bering Sea shelf related to the pressure head forcing is considered
   to be resulted from steric variability.},

Title = {Breeding together, wintering an ocean apart: Foraging ecology of the

   contrasting sea-ice conditions},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Assessing impacts of environmental change on Arctic-breeding seabirds
   requires a better understanding of their year-round movement and
   foraging ecology. Here we examined the post-breeding movements and
   diving behavior of thick-billed (Uria lomvia) and common murres (U.
   aalge) breeding on St. Lawrence Island, northern Bering Sea, by using
   geolocators deployed in 2016 (n = 3, per species). During 2016?2019, we
   examined foraging niches and exposure to nutritional stress by using
   stable isotope signatures and corticosterone titers of blood and feather
   tissues (n = 60?96, per species). We found that thick-billed murres
   migrated to the Chukchi Sea in the fall and wintered in the western
   North Pacific, whereas common murres stayed in the eastern Bering Sea in
   the fall and wintered in the eastern North Pacific. Nutritional stress
   levels of breeding common murres were higher in 2017?2019, the period of
   historic low winter sea-ice extent, than in 2016. Higher nutritional
   stress levels of post-breeding thick-billed murres were associated with
   lower fall sea-ice extent in the Chukchi Sea. These results indicate
   that the loss of sea-ice might negatively affect murres breeding in the
   Pacific Arctic. Divergent migratory connectivity between the two murre
   species might also lead to different conservation threats both inside
   and outside the Arctic.},

Title = {Locating the Indo-Antarctica suture - Correlating the Rengali, Rauer and

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The Rayner Complex of East Antarctica and the Eastern Ghats Province
   (EGP) of India are thought to have been contiguous in past
   supercontinents like Rodinia and Gondwana. These terranes have been
   correlated on the basis of similar granulite facies metamorphic imprints
   and isotopic age data that testify to Grenvillian (1100-900 Ma) and
   Pan-African (650-450 Ma) thermal signatures. The Grenvillian granulite
   facies metamorphic event is generally thought to represent collision
   between Antarctica and cratonic India, but the precise location of the
   Indo-Antarctic suture is disputed. The intensity of Pan-African age
   geological imprints is also variable in both continents, and their
   significance remains unclear. In this review, we correlate structural,
   metamorphic and geochronological data in both terranes and parts of
   their bounding cratons, and suggest that the Ruker Terrane and Rauer
   Group in Antarctica were continuous with the Rengali Province in India.
   Together with the established correlation between the EGP and the Rayner
   Complex, this implies that cratonic India along with the EGP-Rayner
   amalgam collided with the Archaean Ruker Terrane (part of the Crohn
   craton) at-520 Ma along the southern Prince Charles Mountain in East
   Antarctica. This suture is distinct from the Grenvillian suture between
   EGPRayner and cratonic India.},

Title = {Investigating optimum ship route in the Antarctic in presence of sea ice
   and wind resistances - A case study between Bharati and Maitri},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents a technique of ship route optimization in the
   Antarctic sea ice region using Dijkstra's algorithm. It studies some of
   the major parameters that cause resistance to the ship movement through
   sea ice. It aims to optimize a safe ship route in the Antarctic sea ice
   between Bharati and Maitri (Indian Research Stations in Antarctica)
   coasts. The study region is divided into grids that results into unique
   nodes, which are studied for sea ice parameters and wind velocity.
   Resistances caused due to ice and wind are considered to calculate
   expected ship velocity between nodes. The calculated ship velocities are
   then used to estimate durations to cover distances from a node to all
   the neighboring nodes. It forms a mathematical route from source to
   destination through various nodes with time as weight that is then
   optimized through Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain optimal route.
   Satellite remote sensing data derived sea ice parameters (Scatsat-1
   derived sea ice extent and NSIDC sea ice concentration) and modeled wind
   velocity (from ECMWF) have been used as inputs in this model. Ship
   parameters of Kapitan Khlebnikov (Russian icebreaker) are used to test
   and compare the proposed model. Results of model are validated with the
   actual ship route navigated by the 33rd Indian Scientific Expedition to
   Antarctica (33ISEA) ship. The proposed algorithm, which provides an
   optimal route when ship parameters are known in advance, can be useful
   to support future ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice including
   Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica.},

Title = {The SuperDARN's role in ion-neutral coupling research},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The direct collisions that thermospheric neutral particles experience
   with convecting ionospheric ions is the primary way in which energy from
   the solar wind is deposited into the Earth's atmosphere. Because of
   these collisions, the neutral gas polewards of middle latitudes (similar
   to +/- 40. geomagnetic) is often set into motion due to ion-drag, and
   Joule heated due to friction. Transient ionospheric phenomena, such as
   auroral arcs and sub-auroral polarisation streams (SAPS) also modify
   neutral winds in their own distinctive way. Thanks to the large spatial
   coverage of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) at both
   middle and high latitudes, studies into ionosphere-thermosphere coupling
   have been enabled. These range from collaborative studies with neutral
   wind measurements from other instruments, to the driving electrodynamic
   input of various global circulation models. This paper aims to provide a
   general overview of the ion-neutral coupling research conducted
   utilising the SuperDARN, and to offer some directions as to where we
   believe future work should be directed.},

Title = {What controls the luminosity of polar cap airglow patches?: Implication
   from airglow measurements in Eureka, Canada in comparison with SuperDARN
   convection pattern},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Polar cap patches are known as islands of enhanced electron density in
   the polar cap F region ionosphere. To observe the airglow signature of
   polar cap patches continuously at a fixed point near the center of the
   MLAT/MLT coordinate system, we started operating an all-sky imager in
   Eureka, Canada since 2015, where the magnetic latitude is similar to 87
   degrees. By statistically analyzing the 630-nm airglow images from
   Eureka, it was identified that the luminosity of patches, which is
   proportional to the electron density in the F region, increases during
   specific UT interval from 16 to 22 UT. This outstanding UT variation of
   patch luminosity can be explained simply by the systematic shift of the
   terminator in the MLAT/MLT coordinate system due to the offset between
   the geographic and geomagnetic pole. That is, the spatial relationship
   between the dense source plasma in the sunlit area and the high-latitude
   convection system controls the UT variation. We also found that when the
   IMF By is positive, the number of polar cap patches was twice of that in
   the negative IMF By. By deriving average convection patterns from the
   archived SuperDARN map potential data, we confirmed that the
   configuration of plasma convection is more appropriate for patches to be
   transported toward the magnetic pole during the positive IMF By
   condition.},

Title = {Effects of Hunting on a Puma Population in ColoradoEffets de la Chasse
   sur une Population de Puma au Colorado},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {209},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We investigated effects of regulated hunting on a puma (Puma concolor)
   population on the Uncompahgre Plateau (UPSA) in southwestern Colorado,
   USA. We examined the hypothesis that an annual harvest rate averaging
   15\% of the estimated number of independent individuals using the study
   area would result in a stable or increasing abundance of independent
   pumas. We predicted hunting mortality would be compensated by 1) a
   reduction in other causes of mortality, thus overall survival would stay
   the same or increase; 2) increased reproduction rates; or 3) increased
   recruitment of young animals. The study occurred over 10 years
   (2004-2014) and was designed with a reference period (years 1-5; i.e.,
   RY1-RY5) without puma hunting and a treatment period (years 6-10; i.e.,
   TY1-TY5) with hunting. We captured and marked pumas on the UPSA and
   monitored them year-round to examine their demographics, reproduction,
   and movements. We estimated abundance of independent animals using the
   UPSA each winter during the Colorado hunting season from reference year
   2 (RY2) to treatment year 5 (TY5) using the Lincoln-Petersen method. In
   addition, we surveyed hunters to investigate how their behavior
   influenced harvest and the population. We captured and marked 110 and
   116 unique pumas in the reference and treatment periods, respectively,
   during 440 total capture events. Those animals produced known-fate data
   for 75 adults, 75 subadults, and 118 cubs, which we used to estimate
   sex- and life stage-specific survival rates. In the reference period,
   independent pumas more than doubled in abundance and exhibited high
   survival. Natural mortality was the major cause of death to independent
   individuals, followed by other human causes (e.g., vehicle strikes,
   depredation control). In the treatment period, hunters killed 35
   independent pumas and captured and released 30 others on the UPSA.
   Abundance of independent pumas using the UPSA declined 35\% after 4
   years of hunting with harvest rates averaging 15\% annually. Harvest
   rates at the population scale, including marked independent pumas with
   home ranges exclusively on the UPSA, overlapping the UPSA, and on
   adjacent management units were higher, averaging 22\% annually in the
   same 4 years leading to the population decline. Adult females comprised
   21\% of the total harvest. The top-ranked model explaining variation in
   adult survival (S) indicated a period effect interacting with sex.
   Annual adult male survival was higher in the reference period (S = 0.96,
   95\% CI = 0.75-0.99) than in the treatment period (S = 0.40, 95\% CI =
   0.22-0.57). Annual adult female survival was 0.86 (95\% CI = 0.72-0.94)
   in the reference period and 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.63-0.82) in the treatment
   period. The top subadult model showed that female subadult survival was
   constant across the reference and treatment periods (S = 0.68, 95\% CI =
   0.43-0.84), whereas survival of subadult males exhibited the same trend
   as that of adult males: higher in the reference period (S = 0.92, 95\%
   CI = 0.57-0.99) and lower in the treatment period (S = 0.43, 95\% CI =
   0.25-0.60). Cub survival was best explained by fates of mothers when
   cubs were dependent (S-mother alive = 0.51, 95\% CI = 0.35-0.66;
   S-mother died = 0.14, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.34). The age distribution for
   independent pumas skewed younger in the treatment period.
   Adult males were most affected by harvest; their abundance declined by
   59\% after 3 hunting seasons and we did not detect any males >6 years
   old after 2 hunting seasons. Pumas born on the UPSA that survived to
   subadult stage exhibited both philopatry and dispersal. Local
   recruitment and immigration contributed to positive growth in the
   reference period, but recruitment did not compensate for the losses of
   adult males and partially compensated for losses of adult females in the
   treatment period. Average birth intervals were similar in the reference
   and treatment periods (reference period = 18.3 months, 95\% CI =
   15.5-21.1; treatment period = 19.4 months, 95\% CI = 16.2-22.6), but
   litter sizes (reference period = 2.8, 95\% CI = 2.4-3.1; treatment
   period = 2.4, 95\% CI = 2.0-2.8) and parturition rates (reference period
   = 0.63, 95\% CI = 0.49-0.75; treatment period = 0.48, 95\% CI =
   0.37-0.59) declined slightly in the treatment period. Successful hunters
   used dogs, selected primarily males, and harvested pumas in 1-2 days
   (median). We found that an annual harvest rate at the population scale
   averaging 22\% of the independent pumas over 4 years and with >20\%
   adult females in the total harvest greatly reduced abundance. At this
   scale, annual mortality rates of independent animals from hunting
   averaged 6.3 times greater than from all other human causes and 4.6
   times greater than from all natural causes during the population
   decline. Hunting deaths were largely additive and reproduction and
   recruitment did not compensate for this mortality source. Hunters
   generally selected male pumas, resulting in a decline in their survival
   and abundance, and the age structure of the population. We recommend
   that regulated hunting in a source-sink structure be used to conserve
   puma populations, provide sustainable hunting opportunities, and address
   puma-human conflicts. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

   currently known to include eleven species, one in the subgenus
   Jolivetiana Gomez-Zurita \& Cardoso, 2014, and ten in the nominal
   subgenus. The analysis of morphological differences in a large sample of
   Taophila and the validation of the resulting species hypotheses in an
   integrative fashion based on a phylogenetic analysis of partial mtDNA
   sequences (cox1 and rrnS) resulted in the addition of eleven more taxa.
   Taxonomic splits mainly reinterpreted the previous observation of mtDNA
   paraphyly affecting T. subsericea Heller, 1916, shown to represent a
   complex of species mostly distinguishable by diagnostic differences
   among females. The new species described are: T. bituberculata n. sp.,
   T. carinata n. sp., T. dapportoi n. sp., T. davincii n. sp., T. draco n.
   sp., T. goa n. sp., T. hackae n. sp., T. samuelsoni n. sp., T. sideralis
   n. sp., T. taaluny n. sp. and T. wanati n. sp. These additions and the
   synonymy T. subsericea Heller = Stethotes mandjeliae Jolivet, Verma \&
   Mille, 2010 n. syn., bring to 21 the total number of species in
   Taophila. Moreover, we also found the first evidence of mtDNA
   introgression between species of New Caledonian Eumolpinae, resulting
   from putative recent hybridization of T. subsericea and T. dapportoi
   where these species coexist. We describe a model incorporating the mtDNA
   genealogy of T. subsericea about the conditions that may have favored
   the secondary geographic encounter required for the hybridi-zation of
   these species.},

Abstract = {Lygus (Insecta: Heteroptera: Miridae) is a Holarctic genus, and some of
   its representatives are important pests. Determining the Lygus species
   identity and their interrelationships is challenging. Our study aimed to
   delimit five trans-Palearctic species of this group: L. gemellatus, L.
   pratensis, L. punctatus, L. rugulipen-nis and L. wagneri. We implemented
   analyses of morphological characters, morphometrics, cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA sequences. The results showed that
   those species could be delimited using morphology and most species pairs
   were different in morphometrics. Both COI and 16S rRNA were useful for
   species identification. Resulting phylogenetic trees contained two
   highly supported clades. One clade included species known from the
   Palearctic only, the other clade contained species with Nearctic and
   Holarctic distribution. Species were mostly poorly supported or
   non-monophyletic. Molecular species delineation approaches yielded
   results that generally did not correspond to the mor-phologically
   delimited species.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Growth development histories and stands structures of Picea mariana in
   Inuvik (Canadian Northwest Territories), and Pinus sylvetstris in Va
   center dot rrio center dot (Finnish Lapland) forests were reconstructed
   using the stand reconstruction algo-rithm. Informations of present
   forest variables i.e., stem diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height
   (H), and detailed tree-ring data obtained from selected sampled trees
   were used. Development of forests structure in the past, and their
   annual changes were reconstructed (i.e., aboveground biomass, annual
   biomass growth, and stand density). Reconstructed aboveground biomass
   showed that the beta-type distribution function of individual tree size
   in the forests has been maintained throughout the years in the past.
   Several fluctuations in biomass growth over time were also observed.
   Reconstruction showed that stand density generally decreased overtime in
   P. sylvestris, which is a typical pattern for overcrowded population,
   but keeps increasing in P. mariana. Long-term reconstruction of stand
   structure can provide important baseline information for forest ecology
   and any man-agement or restoration activities in the point of view of
   climate change. However, estimation of stand density and biomass growth
   can be improved by a careful selection of sample trees for stem
   analysis, but also by collecting growth information of dead wood
   materials.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Russian High Arctic archipelagos still lack knowledge on the freshwater
   ecosystems and biodiversity. Here, we present results of the freshwater
   bodies' survey of the nine islands in the Franz Josef Land archipelago,
   northeastern Barents Sea, carried out in August 2016. Freshwater lakes
   and streams along with associated coastal habitats were examined for
   hydrochemistry, elemental composition of sediments, microbiota,
   macrozoobenthos, flora and vegetation as well as ornithofauna. Despite
   the harsh climate conditions and ephemeral character of the freshwater
   bodies, there were a diverse microflora and macrozoobenthos.
   Macrozoobenthos consisted primarily of chironomid larvae (with highest
   abundances at 6644.4 specimens/m2 and wet biomass hereinafter referred
   biomass 3.1 g/m2) and enchytraeids (abundances up to 922.2 specimens/m2,
   biomass up to 0.2 g/m2); additionally, numerous mermitides were found in
   two sites; and tardigrades were found in a single water body. Grassmoss
   and moss communities in coastal habitats were described. We propose to
   include freshwater bodies of Franz Josef Land in the CBMP network, which
   at the moment lacks any monitoring sites in the Russian High Arctic, and
   has the only site at comparable latitudes in the Arctic Canada. Our
   results can be used as the background data on the freshwater environment
   and biodiversity for - further monitoring.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The focus of this research lies in creating a uniform approach to the
   legal framework supporting logistics of the vessels carrying out
   commercial navigation in the polar waters. With commercial navigation in
   the polar waters having gained popularity recently, a number of
   specialized publications dedicated to development of Arctic shipping and
   to the perspectives of the Northern Sea Route's commercial use have
   emerged. Regardless of the vessel route, formalities in any port remain
   inevitable step of the international cargo transportation. The projected
   intensive commercial shipping in the Arctic waters will raise the issue
   as to which system for monitoring compliance with Convention
   requirements and mechanisms aimed at reducing the likelihood of
   accidents in polar waters is the most adapted. Against such background,
   the article represents legal measures intended to ensure safety of
   commercial navigation in polar waters and singles out the need to create
   an Arctic Memorandum of Understanding on State Port Control, preventing
   ships that do not meet generally accepted standards and rules to
   navigate the Arctic waters.},

Title = {Climatic assessment of circum-Arctic permafrost zonation over the last
   122 kyr},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Permafrost is an important climate factor of the cold-region
   environments, known to evolve over a long time scale. Although direct
   observations are required for the exact determination of presence, this
   is difficult especially in remote areas. An indirect assessment of
   permafrost zonation can help in estimating the probable extents and
   providing an understanding of its spatiotemporal variability under
   different climate. In this paper, we adopt a previously defined indirect
   assessment method using freezing and thawing indices, which was revised
   and evaluated against new observation-based dataset. The revised method
   was applied to time-series of the circum-Arctic environment for the past
   122 kyr constructed from a Greenland ice core, present-day reanalysis
   climatology, and a glacial isostatic adjustment model, and subsequently,
   examined in terms of the aggregation, persistence, and retreat of
   permafrost. Permafrost zones over exposed land varied between 9.11

Title = {Evenki fire and forest ontology in the context of the wildfires in
   Siberia},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Siberian taiga is the homeland and source of economic, spiritual and
   social well-being for many indigenous Evenki mobile and settled
   communities, while their land rights still remain unresolved. More than
   9 million hectares of forest was burnt across six Siberian and Far East
   regions in the summer of 2019. Siberian wildfires have been used as a
   political resource by different political forces inside and outside
   Russia, pushing local and federal authorities to strengthen their policy
   towards forest management. In my article, based on literary, archival,
   internet and field sources, a wide range of possible causes for the
   Siberian wildfires, varying from climate change to illegal logging is
   considered. Meanwhile many Evenki respondents believe global changes are
   caused by violation of moral laws both by indigenous and non-indigenous
   people. For the Evenki, the forest is a big communicating matrix in
   terms of connectedness, interdependence and mutual responsibility. The
   Evenki still regard wildfires as a punishment inflicted on humans by
   high spirits. The multifunctionality of fire determines its economic,
   cultural, spiritual, social and environmental significance in Evenki
   culture. Living in the forest Evenki practice careful handling of fire.
   My aim is to include Evenki animistic philosophy and fire management
   into the world debate about global environmental changes.},

Title = {Multitaper analysis of an MSTID event above Antarctica on 17 March 2013},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A medium-scale travelling ionospheric disturbance (MSTID) was observed
   concomitantly by SANAE and Halley SuperDARN HF radars during the period
   02-06 UT 17 March 2013. The event occurred during a geomagnetically
   quiet time where no substorm or storm activities were observed. Both
   radars (at similar geomagnetic latitudes of 61.8(0)S (SANAE) and
   62.1(0)S (Halley)) are well placed for observing the sporadic E (Es)
   region associated with the ionospheric trough around midnight during
   quiet geomagnetic conditions. F region electrodynamics and electrical
   coupling between E and F regions are one of the important mechanisms for
   the generation of nighttime MSTIDs. This is thought to be the generation
   mechanism in this study. We analysed the radar data using multitaper
   method (MTM). Multiple windowing mitigates spectral leakage and bias.
   The orthogonality of the tapers allows for confidence levels of peaks to
   be determined. The results from both radars show an MSTID with a period
   of approximately 23 min propagating at a speed similar to 280 ms(-1)
   (SANAE) and 178 ms(-1) (Halley) in the Southeast direction. An upper
   limit of similar to 55 kW was estimated to be dissipated by Joule
   heating due to the MSTID over an area where it was detected by both
   radars with more than 90\% confidence.},

Title = {Impacts and management of forest fires in the Republic of Sakha, Russia:
   A local perspective for a global problem},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), which constitutes the northeastern
   parts of Siberia, holds the largest area of forest coverage among all
   the Russian federal subjects, and forest fires in its land exert
   significant impacts on the global environment. This paper aims to offer
   a local perspective for the globally important problem of Siberian
   forest fires, discussing the general patterns and trends of forest fires
   in Yakutia, their public management system, and their local impacts.
   State statistical data show a decrease in the frequency of fires but an
   apparent increase in burned areas in recent decades in Yakutia - for
   example, from the period 1985?1994 to the period 2005?2014, the average
   number of fires decreased by 17\%, while their average area increased by
   73\%. These changes reflect transitions of local socioeconomic and
   political conditions over the last few decades, such as urbanization,
   the post-Soviet restructuring of the public forest management system,
   budget scarcity and declining trends of forestry activities. These
   factors are also likely to be an important determinant for the future
   trends of forest fires in Siberia, in combination with the effects of
   global climate change.},

Abstract = {Antissella White, 1914 is a small genus of soldier flies endemic to
   Australia, previously thought to comprise only two described species and
   suspected to have a role in pollination. Six new species of Antissella
   are named, described and illustrated herein, and an updated
   identification key to all known species is provided. The new species
   include: Antissella alicespringsensis Lessard \& Woodley sp.n.,
   Antissella elongata Lessard \& Woodley, sp.n., Antissella kalbarriensis
   Lessard \& Woodley sp.n., Antissella nigricentralis Lessard \& Woodley
   sp.n., Antissella ottensorum Lessard \& Woodley, sp.n., and Antissella
   purprasina Lessard \& Woodley, sp.n. A lectotype and paralectotype are
   also selected for Antissella quinquecella (Macquart, 1846). Eight
   species of Antissella are now recognised from Australia. Three of the
   new species are known from areas burned by the devastating 2019/2020
   Australian summer bushfires. Now that they are formally named and
   described, the species may be recognised in future bushfire recovery
   monitoring programs.},

Abstract = {Adult Mantispidae are general predators of arthropods equipped with
   raptorial forelegs. The three larval instars display varying degrees of
   hypermetamorphic ontogeny. The larval stages exhibit a remarkable life
   history ranging from specialised predators of nest-building hymenopteran
   larvae and pupa, to specialised predators of spider-eggs, to possible
   generalist predators of immature insects. Noteworthy advances in our
   understanding of the biology of Mantispidae has come to light over the
   past two decades which are compiled and addressed in this review. All
   interactions of mantispids with other arthropods are tabled and their
   biology critically discussed and compared to the current classification
   of the taxon. Additionally, the ambigous systematics within Mantispidae
   and between Mantispidae and its sister groups, Rhachiberothidae and
   Berotidae, is reviewed. Considering the biology, systematics,
   distribution of higher taxonomic levels and the fossil record, the
   historical biogeography of the group is critically discussed with
   Gondwana as the epicenter of Mantispidae radiation.},

Title = {A case study of cut marks on camelid bones from the El Palacio site in
   the northern highlands of Peru: implication of butchering activities},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {151-164},
Abstract = {South American camelids, which were domesticated in the Central Andes,
   have been emphasized for their secondary uses (e.g. llamas as pack
   animals and alpacas for their wool). In modern pastoral societies the
   use of mature animals for meat is not efficient. However, it is
   interesting that cut marks have often been found on archaeological
   animal bones. This study aimed to describe butchering of camelids
   through macroscopic observation of cut marks in the Middle Horizon
   period, during the Wari Empire (600-1000 CE), when the use of camelids
   reached its peak, and to test whether these activities are consistent
   with ethnoarchaeological and ethnographic findings. The materials used
   here are camelid bones with cut marks from El Palacio in the northern
   highlands of Peru. They were assigned to Middle Cajamarca Phases B and
   C, and a part of the Late Cajamarca Phase (800-1000 CE). In this study,
   cut marks on animal bones were observed by macroscopy, and analyses were
   focused on their distribution, frequencies, and direction. Cut marks on
   camelid bones from El Palacio were observed over the entire body,
   suggesting that these marks were caused by dismembering, skinning, and
   extraction of meat, fat, and marrow. The frequencies of cut marks on
   camelid bones at El Palacio was 1.3\%, lower than that in the Formative
   Period. This lower frequency might have been caused by more fragmented
   bones in the former. Furthermore, it is possible that the use of
   secondary products was emphasized at El Palacio. Cut marks were
   concentrated on the ventral side of each bone. This can be attributed to
   the butchering procedure described from ethnoarchaeology and
   ethnography, in which animal was turned on its back for dismemberment
   and removal of its internal organs from the ventral side, being careful
   not to soil the earth for ritual considerations.},

Abstract = {In the article, the authors draw attention to the priority of city
   cycling infrastructure development to improve the quality of life, safer
   movement, preservation of the environment. The need for measures in the
   development of cycling infrastructure in cities helps in solving a
   number of problems related to improving the environmental situation, has
   a positive economic effect, and is aimed at attracting additional
   cyclists from other regions. The authors study the development problem
   of municipal bicycle infrastructure on the example of Ukrainian cities
   and offer an adaptive approach to the development of a network of
   bicycle paths, which encourages residents to increasingly use bicycles
   for short trips. The study presents the authors' views on plausible
   scenarios for the implementation of municipal programs for the
   development of cycling, environmental quality and closely related to the
   concept of sustainable development and overcoming the effects of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Using the survey method, a portrait of a potential
   user of local bicycle transport was formed, the economic and ecological
   expediency of creation and development of bicycle infrastructure in the
   cities of Ukraine was determined. The scenario plan of development of
   the municipal bicycle infrastructure of the city of Odessa is offered

Abstract = {Pleasing lacewings (Neuroptera: Dilaridae) are a group of Neuroptera
   well known for the sexually dimorphic antennae (unipectinate in male,
   filiform in female). However, in the dilarid genus, Berothella Banks,
   1934, the male antennae are not pectinate but thickly filiform. The
   genus is the sole representative of the recently established subfamily
   Berothellinae Liu, U. Aspock \& H. Aspock, 2017, and includes three
   species from the Oriental region. So far each of the three species is
   known by a single male specimen. Here we describe two new species of
   Berothella, i.e., B. falcata sp. n. and B. wenii sp. n. from China based
   on morphological characters and molecular evidence. Moreover, we report
   on the first female of Berothellinae based on specimens of the newly
   discovered species. The female genital characters of Berothellinae are
   compared in detail with those of the other dilarid subfamilies. The
   distribution data of Berothellinae is updated.},

Abstract = {The subtribe Cylindromorphoidina Cobos, 1979, the only representative of
   tribe Aphanisticini in the Neotropical region, is currently composed of
   two genera, Eurynodes Thery, 1934 and Cylindromorphoides Kerremans,
   1903. The genus Taphroceroides Hespenheide, 2007, originally proposed in
   Cylindromorphoidina, is currently placed in Brachyina (tribe Tracheini).
   A detailed morphological comparison of Taphroceroides species with
   members of Eurynodes and Cylindromorphoides shows similarities that
   strongly support their transference back to Cylindromorphoidina. A new
   morphological definition and classification of Cylindromorphoidina is
   presented along with the description of new species in the three genera:
   Eurynodes gemmatus sp. nov., E. capillatus sp. nov., Cylindromorphoides
   ferrugifrons sp. nov., Taphroceroides brunneus sp. nov., and T.
   brasiliensis sp. nov. Photographs and comments on the type series of
   previously described species are provided. New biological data and
   possible association of Cylindromorphoidina species with Bromeliaceae
   are reported. Finally, a distribution map is provided for all species of
   Cylindromorphoidina.},

Abstract = {A systematic revision of Paryphthimoides, a satyrine genus widely
   distributed in Central and South America, is presented based on an
   integrative approach. Molecular phylogeny inferred using multiple
   methods with nuclear (GAPDH, RpS5) and mitochondrial (COI) genes
   indicates that Paryphthimoides, as currently circumscribed, is
   polyphyletic. A new taxonomic arrangement is proposed reflecting the
   monophyly based on molecular and morphological evidence. Paryphthimoides
   now comprises 14 taxa, namely: P. poltys poltys (Prittwitz, 1865), P.
   poltys numilia (C. Felder \& R. Felder, 1867) stat. nov., P. vestigiata
   (Butler, 1867), P. fridae Zacca, Casagrande, Huertas \& Nakahara sp.

   1867 and E. poltys bahiana Bryk, 1953 are new synonyms of P. poltys
   numilia. Lectotypes are designated for Euptychia zeredatha, Neonympha

Abstract = {Paleolithic evidence of the Indian subcontinent is often expressed
   through the wealth of lithic antiquities from the Stone Age. In this
   region, the earliest known lithic remains comprise simple cores and
   flakes recovered from the Siwalik Hills. The Siwalik Hills are the
   foothills of the southern edge of the Himalayas, and area goldmine zone
   for Soanian lithic implements. Although Acheulean remains have also been
   reported, their occurrences are few. Nevertheless. these remains have
   been known date from the Pleistocene, which shows varied patterns of
   land use and intraregional versatility. In the Siwalik Hills, Soanian
   implements are of two kinds: (i) a chopper type of the Lower Paleolithic
   period and (ii) a flake type belonging to the Middle Paleolithic period.
   The present study was undertaken at a newly discovered Stone Age
   locality, Bam, located within the frontal range of the Siwalik Hills in
   the Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh, India. The area under study
   plays an important role in understanding the relationship between people
   and land. The paper explores the Soanian cultural remains of the site to
   obtain an in-depth understanding of its nature against the backdrop of
   raw material availability and exploitation. The study also throws light
   on the local geological and geomorphological settings of the area.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the persistence impact of the COVID-19 related
   news on the volatility of the Saudi Arabia stock market based on daily
   time series data consists of closing prices of 21 industry groups that
   constitute the Saudi stock market as well as the main market for the
   period from 4th August 2019 to 21st May 2020 by running the EGARCH
   model. The empirical findings showed that the Saudi Arabia market was
   significantly affected during the nine trading days after the first case
   in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the EGARCH model estimates supported the
   existence of asymmetric effect on the Saudi stock market with a 25\%
   negative ( leverage effect) and 14\% positive effects. It was discovered
   that the Saudi stock market showed evidence of volatility persistence
   for the main market index and the majority of the industry groups. This
   paper contributes to the existing literature on the impact of COVID-19
   related news on stock returns volatility. To our knowledge, similar
   studies are absent in the literature about Saudi Arabia. This study used
   the EGARCH model, which is considered the most reliable analysis
   technique to investigate this cloudy subject.},

   Coenosiini 1+1+1; the mid and hind tibia have many long and fine setae
   on the apical half, from the anterior to posterior surface; and the
   preapical setae on all femora are absent on all surfaces. The morphology
   of the male and female terminalia is a typical Coenosiini shape.},

Abstract = {Microplitis Foerster is a highly diverse and cosmopolitan genus within
   Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea, Braconidae). Microplitis
   ceratomiae Riley, a widely distributed North American species,
   exclusively attacks sphingid caterpillars. In this paper, M. ceratomiae
   is reported parasitizing a caterpillar of Sphinx poecila Stephens
   (Sphingidae) which was collected feeding on Spiraea alba Du Roi
   (Rosaceae), a species of white meadowsweet native to the wet soils of
   the Allegheny Mountains and other portions of eastern North America.
   Here, we report and describe this new host-parasitoid-food plant
   association in southern New Hampshire, and include a distribution map
   for the species. Biological, ecological and phylogenetic analyses, and
   an identification key for the nine known species of Microplitis that
   attack sphingids in the New World are provided.},

Abstract = {Passalini comprises 209 species divided into six genera. To date there
   is no published work that addresses the phylogenetic relationships among
   the genera of Passalini. Additionally, the monophyly of Passalus, the
   largest genus of the tribe (81\% of its species) is contested. We
   performed a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological data and
   partial sequence of the 16S ribosomal subunit, to elucidate the
   relationships among the genera of Passalini, and test their monophyly.
   Of the genera for which we tested their mono-phyly, Passalus was the
   only genus found to be non-monophyletic, the same occurred for the
   subgenera Passalus (Passalus) and Passalus (Pertinax). The results
   indicated the subgenus Pertinax is divided into at least four distinct
   lineages, one of them corresponding to Rodocanthopus; thus, we propose
   the revalidation of Rhodocanthopus Kaup, 1869.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Previous studies suggested two major migration events during the Jomon
   and Yayoi periods that affected the genetic diversity of modern Japanese
   (Yaponesians). We explored the possibility of a three-wave migration
   model by examining three datasets of modern human DNA: (1) whole
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes of 1642 Yaponesians; (2) mtDNA haplogroup
   frequencies of 59105 Yaponesians from 47 prefectures; and (3)
   genome-wide SNP data of two Yaponesians (Ainu, Okinawa) and whole-genome
   sequence data of Yamato individuals. the Funadomari Jomon F23
   individual, and three East Asian populations (Korean, northern Chinese,
   and southern Chinese). Past population size change was estimated based
   on dataset 1, and we clearly observed a steep population increase after
   the Yayoi period. Principal-component analysis and phylogenetic network
   analysis were applied to dataset 2, and we confirmed the pattern
   consistent with our model. An admixture program was used on dataset 3,
   and we found that the two- and three-layer migration models are both
   compatible with these SNP data. Taken together, these three datasets
   provide support for our three-wave, `inner dual-structure' model.},

Title = {The Sarasins' Collection of Historical Sri Lankan Crania},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {128},

Abstract = {Swiss naturalists Paul and Fritz Sarasin visited Sri Lanka on five
   occasions. Their later visits were focused on anthropological research
   on the Indigenous Wannila Atto ('Vedda') people and exploration of
   prehistoric settlements in Sri Lanka. Among the Sarasins'
   anthropological and archaeological collections are skeletal material of
   several ethnic groups of Sri Lanka belonging to the 19th and early 20th
   centuries. This collection is curated at the Natural History Museum of
   Basel, Switzerland. The ethnolinguistic groups represented in the
   Sarasins' collection include the `Vedda,' Tamil, and Sinhala people of
   Sri Lanka, and it constitutes the largest `Vedda' cranial collection
   housed at a single institution. The objective of this paper is to
   compare cranial variation of the Indigenous `Vedda' and other Sri Lankan
   ethnic groups using this important dataset, while publishing the raw
   craniometric data for further studies. Observations on the dentition
   show that the Tamil and Sinhala individuals had high incidences of
   caries and dental abscesses that are typically associated with
   agriculturalists and that cribra orbitalia associated with iron
   deficiency was relatively common among all three ethnic groups. Betel
   quid chewing for recreational and cultural purposes, a practice that is
   widespread even today, had left dark stains on the teeth of many
   individuals of all groups in the sample. Multivariate statistical
   analyses on the craniometric data show that there is significant overlap
   among the three ethnic groups in terms of cranial shape. These findings
   underscore the importance of considering the `Vedda,' Tamil, and Sinhala
   groups from Sri Lanka as closely related, due to gene flow over
   millennia.},

Abstract = {The genus Melissodes Latreille in the subfamily Eucerinae (Hymenoptera:

   described Melissodes species that range throughout the western
   hemisphere with the center of diversity in the warm deserts of
   southwestern North America. Despite its widespread nature and importance
   in agriculture, the evolutionary relationships among the species have
   never been investigated. Here, we present a molecular phylogeny using
   five loci for 89 species of Melissodes with representatives from all
   subgenera. We confirm all of the subgeneric delineations constructed by
   LaBerge, except for a paraphyletic M. (Tachymelissodes) and the
   placement of M. (Heliomelissodes), which renders M. (Eumelissodes)
   paraphyletic. We also discuss the unexpected placement of M. tristis
   Cockerell, M. paucipuncta LaBerge, M. dagosus Cockerell, and M. pexa
   LaBerge. Finally, we combine this analysis with previous data to support
   the placement of Melissodes within the subfamily Eucerinae.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {The origins of people in the Japanese archipelago are of long-standing
   interest among anthropologists, archeologists, linguists, and historians
   studying the history of Japan. While the `dualstructure' model proposed
   by Hanihara in 1991 has been considered the primary working hypothesis
   for three decades, recent advances in DNA typing and sequencing
   technologies provide an unprecedented amount of present-day and ancient
   human nuclear gnome data, which enable us to refine or extend the
   dual-structure model. In this review, we summarize recent genome
   sequencing efforts of present-day and ancient people in Asia, mostly
   focusing on East Asia, and we discuss the possible migration routes and
   admixture patterns of Japanese ancestors. We also report on a
   meta-analysis we performed by compiling publicly available datascts to
   clarify the genetic relationships of present-day and ancient Japanese
   populations with surrounding populations. Because the ancient genetic
   data from the Japanese archipelago have not yet been fully analyzed, we
   have to corroborate models of prehistoric human movement using not only
   new genetic data but also linguistic and archeological data to
   reconstruct a more comprehensive history of the Japanese people.},

Abstract = {An intensification of industrial development of the Republic of Sakha
   (Yakutia) involves the Kankunskaya hydropower plant construction
   project, implementation of which would have a drastic impact on the
   ecological state of surface waters within the Timpton River basin. A
   necessary stage of all pre-construction survey work is the initial
   environmental state assessment. In this regard, a study of baseline
   hydrochemical and hydrobiological state of water, including an
   investigation of phytoperiphyton and benthic fauna, has been carried
   out. As a result, it has been found a low salinity of waters, a small
   nutrients' content, and an increased heavy metals' content. It has been
   discovered 12 new species of algae for the water bodies of Yakutia and
   92 new species in the Aldan River basin. The modern composition of the
   benthic fauna includes 8 taxonomic groups, the dominant position is
   occupied by the larvae of caddisflies and chironomids. The quantitative
   parameters of the zoobenthos of the watercourses of the Timpton River
   are low: during the study period, the biomass varied within 0-0.9 g/m(2)
   at a density of 0-72 ind./m(2).},

   2013-18},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Svalbard fjords undergo significant oceanographic and environmental
   changes associated with the ongoing Arctic warming and increased
   Atlantic water inflows. We used CTD data from 2013 to 2018 combined with
   numerical model simulations to decipher the hydrography and circulation
   in the Krossfjorden-Kongsfjorden, two west Svalbard fjords, with a focus
   on the Krossfjorden. The Atlantic water prominent in the fjords showed
   strong inter-annual variability. The Atlantic water and summer
   freshwater volume (FWV) were more in the Kongsfjorden, with the FWV
   being 1.4-2.0 times more than 0.08-0.71 km(3) in the Krossfjorden. The
   Krossfjorden had a two-layer structure with warm less-saline surface
   waters above cold high-saline waters in early summer. The fjord
   transformed to a three-layer system with warm high-saline waters between
   cold less-saline surface and cold high-saline deep waters in peak summer
   and fall. The Krossfjorden temperature showed east-west variability,
   with a warmer eastern side. Numerical simulations show that the warm
   Atlantic water from the West Spitsbergen current enters the Krossfjorden
   through its eastern side, supplying heat to the inner fjord. An outflow
   is also observed along the western Krossfjorden. This study adds to the
   understanding of the Svalbard fjord processes in recent times.},

   ice flux calculations},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The ice sheet and glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland represent the
   largest sources of freshwater on planet Earth. The understanding and
   quantification of their dynamic properties such as albedo,
   precipitation, ice mass movement, and ice elevation changes are critical
   for the improved climate and mass balance models. The present study
   utilizes space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery
   to measure the ice surface velocity at high spatial resolution for a
   part of the central Dronning Maud Land (cDML), East Antarctica. The
   datasets from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite are used for ice
   stream velocity estimation using feature-offset tracking and
   differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) methods. The derived velocity
   products are validated with ground based stakes network at annual time
   scale. The fundamental ice flow laws are used to estimate the ice
   outflux or discharge for selected ice stream drainage basins of cDML at
   fluxgate locations. The ice stream basin has been delineated using
   combination of elevation, slope and continental scale velocity maps. The
   ice influx for study area is estimated using ECMWF fifth generation
   reanalysis (ERA5) and Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) v2.3
   model outputs. The estimated influx and outflux are in the ranges of
   0.18-4.167 Gt/y and 0.201 to 1.278 Gt/y respectively, indicating net
   positive mass balance for the selected area.},

Abstract = {This research executed biomonitoring of anthropogenic changes in the
   fragile ecosystems of the Arctic by implementing a system of repeated
   observations of several coastal areas in the Barents Sea that differ in
   their geographical location, anthropogenic load and seawater salinity
   level. The level of metal pollution (Cu, Cd, Pb) was determined by their
   concentrations in brown algae of the genus Fucus. The data covers a
   period from 2010 to 2018. The results show that the average metal
   concentrations were much higher than the background levels at most
   stations for all algae compared to a reference point. In the most
   polluted waters, the average concentrations of Cu, Cd and Pb exceeded
   the background levels by 5-6, 1.5-2.5 and 3-5 times, respectively. The
   average metal concentrations were much lower than that in other regions
   of the world ocean (over 2-14 times). Seasonal variability somewhat
   differed by species; however, at most stations, the metal concentration
   showed a decreasing tendency from winter to summer for all species.
   MANOVA showed that the salinity level, interaction between site and
   season and all three factors combined had the strongest influence on the
   metal concentration. A decreasing series of polluted water bodies in the
   Murmansk coast was compiled, and the metal pollution index (MPI)
   calculated for the seawater and algae samples confirmed these levels of
   anthropogenic impact. It was demonstrated that the metal concentrations
   in algae correlated well with that in water. This study provides
   valuable background level data for the Murman Coast of the Barents Sea.},

Title = {Mass concentration and origin of black carbon in spring snow on glaciers
   in the Alaska Range},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Black carbon (BC) is one of the light-absorbing particles that reduce
   the albedo of snow surfaces. Snow samples were taken from the surface of
   three glaciers in the Alaska Range in mid-April 2017. The BC size
   distribution and concentration were analyzed with a laser-induced
   incandescence (LII) method. The BC concentration of the snow samples was
   1?6 ?g L-1 and 0.5?3.1 ?g L-1 at a depth of 0?2 cm (surface) and 2?10 cm
   (subsurface), respectively. These values are comparable to other Arctic
   areas and are considered to be the Alaskan background level. The BC
   concentrations are 0.5\% of those of insoluble solid particles (ISPs)
   measured using an electrical sensing zone method. The surface albedo
   change due to BC and other ISPs concentrations was estimated to be
   0.004?0.007 for the snow surface in April. The ablation at the
   observation sites on Gulkana Glacier would be 1.2\% larger in the
   ablation season due to black carbon deposition. The chemical transport
   model revealed that 17\%?34\% of BC originates from biomass burning in
   Asia and Siberia, and 60\% of BC originates from China in this study.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal variations of the atmospheric greenhouse gases and their
   sources and sinks in the Arctic region},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To understand the spatio-temporal variations of the atmospheric
   greenhouse gases in the Arctic region, we have conducted systematic
   observations and numerical model simulations. Long-term observations for
   CO2, CH4 and related constituents at Ny-?lesund helped in separating the
   oceanic and terrestrial uptake rates of CO2 and revealed the importance
   of biogenic CH4 emissions to atmospheric CH4 variations. Shipboard
   observations of atmospheric CH4 in the Arctic Ocean indicated several
   peaks associated with long-range transports of the continental source
   signals. An underestimation of climatological O2 flux is demonstrated by
   the shipboard O2/N2 observations over the North Pacific and Arctic Sea.
   Clear seasonal cycles and long-term trends of the greenhouse gases were
   observed in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the
   Eurasian continent at 8.5?12.5 km in altitude. Forward and inverse
   modeling studies and direct observations of CH4 emission from West
   Siberian wetlands were conducted to evaluate the CH4 fluxes estimated by
   previous bottom-up studies. To be consistent with the atmospheric CH4
   observations, the prescribed CH4 emission needs downward and upward
   revisions at Hudson Bay Lowland and West Siberia, respectively. The
   terrestrial ecosystem model study showed increasing trends in the CH4
   emission in inland North America, Alaska and northern part of West
   Siberian Lowland.},

Title = {Aquaculture: A Faster Growing Greenhouse Gas Emission Sector in
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {44-57},
Abstract = {Aquaculture and fisheries sectors have been reported to contribute in
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. This study
   evaluates the contribution of aquaculture and fisheries sector to GHGs
   emission in Bangladesh, where both sectors are set to continuous
   intensification over the next few years. Data were collected from
   primary sources using focus group discussions, key informant interviews
   and a national level workshop, and secondary sources during July 2015 to
   June 2016. This study quantified that fisheries and aquaculture annually
   emiffes 3.68 Mt CO(2)e which contributes 1.87\% to the country total and
   4.94\% of agriculture sector GHGs emission in Bangladesh. The emission
   from aquaculture subsectors (3.54 Mt CO(2)e per year) accounts for 96\%
   of total fisheries sector emission. This study also found that the
   emission increases with the intensification of the production process.
   Due to continuous intensification over the years, aquaculture is now
   considered as one of the rapidly increasing industries in Bangladesh.
   Therefore, the country's growing dependency on aquaculture will lead to
   higher GHGs emission potential in the future when the world is looking
   for lowering GHGs emission. This study identified potential mitigation
   measures to reduce the GHGs emission from aquaculture subsectors, like
   increasing fuel efficiency, reducing feed material emission intensity,
   reducing feed mill emissions and improving feed management. The findings
   of this study can serve as a preliminary guide to in-depth
   quantification of GHS's from fisheries and aquaculture. This study also
   expected to help policymakers to form fisheries and aquaculture
   development plans with reduced GHG's emission.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Telomere length has recently gained popularity as a biomarker of
   aging-related diseases. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples are commonly used
   to measure telomere length for human biology research, but studies
   assessing intra- and inter-assay variations are scarce. The objective of
   the present study was to analyze and elucidate the extent of intra- and
   inter-assay variation of DBS telomere length measurement. The DBS
   telomere length of a male subject was determined by quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using four different protocols with two
   different container types (96-well plates and 8-well tubes) and two
   different primer sets (tel1b-tel2b and tel1-tel2). The measurement of
   telomere length with 8-well tubes and the tel1-tel2 primer set
   demonstrated the lowest intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV)
   (6.0\%) and gave an inter-assay CV of 5.0\%. The protocol for 96-well
   plates typically resulted in high intra-assay CVs (>27\%). Assessment of
   intra-assay variation is essential when DBS telomere length is measured
   by qPCR.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to provide a stabilized (i.e. less vulnerable to

   mortality for biased skeletal samples. The stabilized equation is
   developed and tested on the United Nations data used to develop the
   original method (McFadden and Oxenham, Current Anthropology, 60(1),
   141-146), and is applied to 16 bioarchaeological samples from mainland
   Southeast Asia. First-order correlations and basic descriptive
   statistics were applied to the data. The stabilized equation was
   comparable in accuracy to the original equation. When applied to
   bioarchaeological samples, it proved to be advantageous where the sex
   ratio differed by more than 0.15 in either direction (i.e. more females
   or more males). The stabilized equation is an improvement over the
   original equation for samples that exhibit sex bias that is randomly
   distributed by age. This method extends the potential applications of
   the maternal mortality estimator.},

   environments of the forthcoming is sustainability anxiety, which ought
   to be mirrored in the deliberate planning of sustainable firms. Through
   adopting long-term application, a more comprehensive set of
   accountability aiming at ethical compliance, staffs, vicinities, and
   clients, such strategic objectives are operationalized.
   Design/methodology/approach- In this paper, we have mapped a gradual
   evolution of the sustainability movement, their policy frameworks, and
   their drifts towards change, and the outcomes of changes. Further, to
   aid the policy-making, for taking ecologically sustainable strategies,
   we have explored the impact of corporate green disclosure activities on
   the financial performance of the corporate entities from the in effect
   literature. To develop an association between the sustainability
   practices of firms through CED and its applied impact on the firm's
   economic performance, we have searched the relevant literature.
   Findings- The findings show that the CED and fiscal performance varies
   on firms, industries, and countries and give a mixed result. However,
   due to the global green movements and increasing angst and awareness,
   the gaps are gradually dwindling and driving the issue towards
   saturation and institutionalization.
   Originality/value- The article offers stimulating inferences for
   stakeholders that a desire for sustainability compliance through green
   management and environmental loyalty based on social, environmental, and
   human objectivity, may result in an optimistic inspiration on the firm's
   economic performance.},

Title = {Methodology of land degradation mapping applied to mountain areas: case

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Water erosion is a very serious phenomenon in Algeria that has a severe
   impact on the land heritage. It affects 45\% of the tellien areas or 12
   million hectares of cultivable land. This phenomenon becomes even more
   serious if we know that 85\% of cropland is located in the areas most
   susceptible to erosion. Analysis of erosion processes is of considerable
   interest in optimal and sustainable land use. It is to highlight soil
   erosion processes with a view to implementing for the identification and
   understanding of the current dynamics of watershed weathering and its
   perverse effects on the sustainable development of our territories.
   The proposed approach involves modelling certain key parameters,
   including precipitation aggression, soil erosion, slope tilting,
   vegetation cover and anthropogenic action to combat this phenomenon. The
   Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model was chosen to quantify and
   spatialize water erosion processes.
   The objective of this study is to develop a methodology for
   understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of water and soils in general
   and monitoring the progression of this insidious phenomenon at a
   watershed area. To do this, we used a mapping game using a geographic
   information system (GIS) for a pilot site is the Mebtouh River watershed
   (north-west Algeria). The approach is to highlight soil structure, land
   use and water transfers and their effects on soil degradation.},

Title = {The Ibaloi fire mummies: the art and science of mummification in the
   Philippines},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {197-202},
Abstract = {The Ibaloi fire mummies are preserved ancient remains of Ibaloi, one of
   the indigenous peoples of the northern Philippines. The locals kept the
   traditional lbaloi mummification through oral traditions, but the
   current generation no longer conducts the actual practice. We
   categorized the mummification steps into preprocessing, smoking, and
   postprocessing. The preprocessing involved a `saltwater purge.' washing,
   positioning the body onto a `death chair,' removing the epidermis, and
   `deworming.' The smoking process, from which the name `fire mummy' was
   derived, involved the smoking of a body under a low-lit woodfire. The
   postprocessing involved sun-drying and application of a plant concoction
   to the body. Notably, the traditional Ibaloi mummification process
   shares similarities with other mummification practices elsewhere. This
   paper provides a systematic review of the traditional Ibaloi
   mummification and highlights the essential physical and chemical
   processes involved in body preservation. We want to encourage more
   interdisciplinary studies on the Ibaloi fire mummies to identify
   potential applications of the traditional process in corpse
   preservation. We also hope to contribute to discourses with people from
   multicultural backgrounds to increase our understanding of the history
   and culture of ancient human settlements in the Philippines and the
   Asia-Pacific.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {A blue ice area (BIA) is located in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica
   between Schiermacher Oasis (SO) and Ulthat mountain ranges.
   High-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey has been carried
   out in the northern boundary of the BIA surrounded by Schirmacher Oasis
   (SO), Shivalinga and Veteheia nunataks to examine if the BIA in the area
   is wind-induced or melt-induced in nature. GPR study reveals that the
   glacier in this part of BIA is warm and showing prominent signatures of
   subsurface melting in the vicinity of the nunataks and other exposed
   rock masses. The signatures of bottom warming also have been detected in
   few profiles which are in agreement with the drilling results in nearby
   areas. Melting signatures vary over the area depending on the distances
   from the exposed rocks and proximity of subglacial bedrock topography.
   The results indicate the possible higher heat supply by the exposed rock
   mass to the BIA. Folding of the internal layers and the presence of two
   firn pockets also have been observed near the nunatak Veteheia. The
   present GPR study concludes that the survey area is predominantly
   melt-induced BIA. Further investigations are recommended to study the
   firn pockets and mass balance of the area.},

Abstract = {Climate change exacerbates existing threats and risks and generates new
   ones in the lives of the Indigenous people of the Arctic regions. The
   ability to cope with climate variability and extreme events is largely
   dependent on territorial adaptive capacities and vulnerabilities in
   addition to the level of regional economic development. The purpose of
   this article is to understand if the people living in Tiksi and its
   hinterland are aware of the impacts of climate change and attribute
   importance to them, as well as to determine if they have adaptation
   actions and strategies have been put in place. The future of Tiksi's
   population is uncertain and is highly dependent on the federal
   government. Issues relating to climate change are not a high priority
   for the local populations. Although the population of the Bulunsky
   district has maintained some capacity for adaptation, both uncertainty
   about the future and their dependence on decisions made at a higher
   level are undermining their ability to plan for adaptation in the long
   term.},

Title = {Modelling ice thickness and storage volume of svalbard glaciers
   monitored through Indian Arctic Programme},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, glacier ice thickness distribution and storage volume has
   been modelled for two glaciers viz., Vestre Broggerbreen and
   Feiringbreen situated across the Kongsfjorden around Ny-angstrom lesund
   in Svalbard. These two high Arctic glaciers are being monitored through
   the ongoing efforts of the Indian Arctic Program. Here, the capability
   of a glacier specific shape factor parametrization approach was
   evaluated when paired with a parsimonoious, simple stress-driven,
   slope-dependent ice thickness estimation model called Glacier bed
   Topography2\_Indian Institute of Technology Bombay version
   (GlabTop2\_IITB). The modelled average thickness of ice for Vestre
   Broggerbreen and Feiringbreen Glaciers was 59 m and 92 m respectively
   during the study period. The obtained ice thickness estimates were found
   to be reliable when compared with the recent field estimates obtained
   through a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey. Moreover, the modelled
   results of both the glaciers were in good agreement with the consensus
   estimates of ice thickness reported in a recent study. The obtained
   results suggest that the modelling approach presented here can be an
   alternative to complex models, which requires lot of other data such as
   surface mass balance, surface velocity etc. Based on the modelled ice
   thickness distribution pertained to the year 2015, the total volume of
   the glacier-stored ice estimated for Vestre Broggerbreen Glacier and
   Freingbreen Glacier was 0.29 +/- 0.04 km(3)and 0.65 +/- 0.09 km(3),
   respectively.},

Title = {Hydrographic characteristics along two XCTD sections between Africa and
   Antarctica during austral summer 2018},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using the Expendable CTDs (XCTDs) collected along two transects between
   Africa and Antarctica during 1-11 January (Cape Town-Prydz Bay, track-2)
   and 12-21 April 2018 (Prydz Bay-Cape Town, track-1), frontal locations
   are delineated and compared with the satellite-based maps of absolute
   dynamic topography (MADT). The MADT maps revealed that the intensity of
   the Agulhas Current (AC) was 1.3 ms(-1) during both periods; the
   southernmost limit of the Agulhas Retroflection (AR) was traced to 40
   degrees S, 20.5 degrees E/42 degrees S, 15 degrees E on track-1/track-2.
   The vertical sections of temperature and salinity revealed the Agulhas
   anticyclonic eddy (AAE) whose core was detected at similar to 38.4
   degrees 5/similar to 37.6 degrees S on track-1/track-2. The cumulative
   transport across track-2 was 50\% higher than across track-1 which is
   attributed to deep-sea upwelling and its subsequent transport across the
   track-2 to the south of 50 degrees S. On both transects, the winter
   water was detected up to 50 degrees S in the upper 100 m. The highest AC
   transport in the upper 1000 m was detected at 37.75 degrees S/38.28
   degrees S on track-1/track-2, which was related to the flow
   characteristics of the AC. The eddies that detached from the AC system
   transported nutrient-rich water southward which mixed with the ambient
   water resulting in peak chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) exceeding
   0.5 mg/m(3) to the north of 42 degrees S on both tracks. The shallow
   topographic features such as the Ob-Lena rise (54 degrees S) and the
   southwest Indian Ridge (44 degrees-46 degrees S) also enhanced Chl-a by
   39\% on track-2.},

Title = {Studies on Arctic aerosols and clouds during the ArCS project},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aerosols and clouds play important roles in the Arctic climate.
   Conversely, aerosol emissions and cloud formation are affected by
   changes in the Arctic climate. This paper reviews studies of aerosols
   and clouds performed during the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability
   (ArCS) project carried out by the National Institute of Polar Research
   (NIPR) in Japan and collaborating institutions. The ArCS project
   included intensive studies of black carbon aerosols (BC). We installed
   Continuous Soot Monitoring System (COSMOS) instruments to measure
   atmospheric BC at four locations in the Arctic, establishing the Arctic
   BC COSMOS Measurement Network (ABCMnet). We also measured BC
   concentrations in snowpack in extensive areas of the Arctic and showed
   that previous studies have greatly overestimated BC in snowpack. We
   developed and improved new aerosol models that achieved better
   agreements with measurements of BC in the Arctic atmosphere, snowpack,
   and falling snow. We made new estimates of radiative forcing of BC in
   the Arctic atmosphere and snow/ice surfaces that lower their albedo. In
   addition to these researches on BC, we made accurate measurements of ice
   nucleating particles (INPs) at Ny-?lesund, Svalbard, showing that their
   concentrations increased in summer as a result of dust particle
   emissions from glacial outwash sediments. This high ice nucleating
   ability was likely due to the presence of organic substances mixed with
   the dust particles. We also made continuous cloud radar measurements and
   the first continuous in-situ measurements of cloud microphysical
   properties in the Arctic at Ny-?lesund. Results from these cloud
   measurements and their relationship with aerosols are described.},

Title = {Information retrieval for Northern Sea Route (NSR) navigation: A
   statistical approach using the AIS and TOPAZ4 data},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Northern Sea Route (NSR) is becoming a practical passage for
   transport during the warm season due to Arctic sea ice reduction. There
   is a need for new navigational support as LNG shipments are increasing
   in recent years. In this research, a non-heuristic optimal route search
   is attempted near the New Siberian Islands. The assumption is that an
   optimal route is related to the surrounding conditions. Accordingly, an
   empirical formula considering vessel specifications, and environmental
   condition parameters can predict transit time along a specific course.
   Then, a route corresponding to the shortest predicted transit time
   becomes the optimal route. Multi linear and LASSO regressions are
   applied over the surroundings of the New Siberian Islands, where three
   routes lie. While the obtained functions are both overfitting models and
   not suitable for practical prediction, the LASSO one can estimate a more
   reasonable range of the standardized velocities. The ranges of the
   standardized velocities to transit through the domain is from 310 to
   1640 km and from 310 to 602 km per day predicted by multi linear and
   LASSO models, respectively. The LASSO regression analysis might be
   expected to identify points where all the cautions are necessary along
   the NSR.},

Title = {Calcatedessa gen.n. a new genus sister to Grammedessa Correia \&

Abstract = {Grammedessa Correia \& Fernandes, 2016 is a genus raised to include some
   species of Edessa Fabricius, 1803 that is a very common group of stink
   bugs inhabiting only the Neotropical region. Grammedessa was proposed
   excluding a few species that were morphologically similar but not
   completely fitting in the diagnostic requirements of the genus.
   Grammedessa was also proposed without considering a phylogenetic
   context. In this work, the monophyly of Grammedessa was tested using a
   cladistic analysis, including all species that were originally excluded,
   under both Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian methods. As a result, six new
   species are now included in Grammedessa, which will be described in a
   forthcoming paper; Edessa botocudo Kirkaldy, 1909 was considered an
   unnecessary new name for Edessa hamata Walker, 1868 that was transferred
   to Grammedessa, resulting in G. hamata (Walker, 1868) comb.n.
   Calcatedessa gen.n., a new genus sister to Grammedessa, is here proposed
   to include four new species: C. anthomorpha sp.n., C. clarimarginata
   sp.n., C. germana sp.n. and C. temnomarginata sp.n. The
   Calcatedessa-Grammedessa clade and both genera were recovered as
   monophyletic by Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian methods. An
   identification key to the species of Calcatedessa gen.n. is provided.
   The new genus is distributed in Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana, and
   Brazil.},

Title = {Diversity of culturable microfungi of coal mine spoil tips in Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The fungal complexes of the coal mine spoil tips around the settlement
   Barentsburg (Svalbard) were studied. Samples were taken from coal mine
   spoil tips with different ages (formed, 10-years, 30-years and
   50-years). Arctic tundra soils were used as the control. The indicators
   of change were the species composition, diversity level, dominant groups
   of species and isolate density of fungal communities. The harsh arctic
   conditions and the inhospitality of the rock substrate determined the
   relatively low diversity of microfungi. Only 15 species of microfungi
   were identified in the samples from formed spoil tip, while in the
   samples from 50-year-old tip the number of microfungi species increased
   to 29. The average density of microfungi (CFU/g) for all sampling depths
   of the coal mine spoil tips was low. But this indicator increased with
   the age of spoil tips. The density of microfungi isolates also increased
   with depth in the coal mine spoil tips. The composition of the dominant
   species of microfungi changed with the age of the spoil tips increased.
   The convergence of the microfungal complexes of spoil tips and control
   arctic soils indicates gradual increase stability of mycobiota in
   disturbed areas.},

Title = {Mapping and identification of ice-sheet and glacier features using

   Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {High-resolution satellite data is used to extract ice-sheet features in
   Princess-Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, in Droning Maud Land between
   70 degrees and 72 degrees S and 5 degrees-20 degrees E, East Antarctica.
   Their mapping and monitoring is cumbersome and time-consuming using
   traditional survey methods. Therefore, to achieve desirable results, RS
   based methods were employed. The main ice-sheet and glacial features
   mapped are Bluelce-Area (BIA), melt water channels, glacier radar zones,
   crevasse, nunataks, moraine, supraglacial lakes, and wind scoop.
   Support-vector-machine (SVM) and supervised classification algorithm
   were applied over Landsat-8, RISAT-1 and Sentinel-1 data to classify
   these features. Surface patterns of snow and clouds were found in the
   continental icesheet, which becomes an obstacle to clearly extract
   sub-surface icesheet features in optical data. Therefore, to improve
   mapping of snow and ice features, high-resolution microwave data was
   also used. By comparing optical and microwave data, it was found that
   more sub-surface features could be mapped using microwave data. Further,
   RS was used to map the temporal change in the glacial features using
   two-year images for the austral summer of 2016 and 2017. It was found
   that diurnal as-well-as seasonal changes in surface ice features occur
   due to changes in local weather and can be mapped using temporal RS
   data.},

Title = {Thermal evolution of mafic granulites of Princess Elizabeth Land, East
   Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Outcrops of East Antarctic Shield exposed along the coast of Princess
   Elizabeth Land (PEL) provide a peek into its Neoproterozoic evolution.
   The terrain comprises of interleaved pelitic, felsic and mafic
   granulites. Examination of mafic granulites from Sostrene Islands -
   Larsemann Hills - Brattstrand Bluffs terrain indicate multiple sources
   for their protolith. The ensemble of mafic rocks intimately associated
   with sedimentary protoliths are sourced from older mafic crust as well
   as syn-sedimentary intrusives, prior to multiple stages of deformation
   and high-grade metamorphism, often including felsic melt generation.
   High-grade metamorphism (peak conditions of similar to 900 degrees C and
   11 kbar) followed by two stages of decompression, which are indicated by
   the presence of symplectitic growth of orthopyroxene over garnet and in
   cracks in garnetiferous mafic granulite. Pseudosection modelling
   confirms that the mafic granulites underwent a near isothermal
   decompression of similar to 2-3 kbar, indicating a clockwise PT path.
   Chemical dating of monazites from associated paragneisses show three
   growth zones viz. a Grenvillian aged core (884-940 Ma) followed by a
   thin Upper Tonian- Cryogenian aged middle rim (689-754 Ma) and a typical
   Pan African aged outer rim (523 Ma). We suggest that the thermo-tectonic
   evolution of PEL outcrops should be reassessed taking into account the
   newly emerging evidence of Tonian metamorphism.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accurate representation of the complex ocean-sea ice interaction is
   still an ongoing effort. In this study, we have coupled the Community
   Ice Code (CICE) model and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to
   develop a highresolution regional coupled ocean-sea ice model for polar
   regions. This setup allows us to investigate the interaction between
   ocean and sea ice in detail. The
   Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment-Transport (COAWST) modeling
   system is the core of this coupled model. Currently, the ROMS model in
   COAWST uses the Budgell sea ice model, embedded as a sub-module in it
   but introducing a more comprehensive sea ice model (CICE) may provide a
   better treatment of sea ice. Here, we present our preliminary results
   based on the coupled ROMS-CICE and ROMS-Budgell simulation over the
   Arctic Ocean. Our results show that both CICE and Budgell models perform
   better in simulating sea ice concentration during winter than during
   summer. Compared to the satellite observations, sea ice concentrations
   from the CICE model in most subregions have higher correlations and
   smaller centered root mean square errors, showing higher simulation
   skills. The sea ice thickness biases are larger in the Budgell model in
   the early months of the year, whereas in the CICE model they are larger
   after October. Both CICE and Budgell models overestimate the sea ice
   extent and sea ice volume in summer, and their performances differ in
   the subregions.},

Title = {Thinking about Russian Arctic council chairmanship: Challenges and
   opportunities},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study aims at examining the following research questions: What has
   been the record of Russia's Arctic Council membership by the present-day
   moment? How has Russia's role evolved? What have been some of the main
   issues, agreements, disagreements, challenges and problems? What is
   Moscow's agenda during the Russian Council chairmanship in 2021-2023?
   The author identifies the following priorities for Russia's Arctic
   Council presidential agenda: climate change action; sustainable
   socioeconomic and environmental development; social cohesiveness and
   connectivity in the region; indigenous peoples; conservation of
   biodiversity; science diplomacy; Council's partial institutional reform.
   Moscow will probably try to make the Arctic Council's budget, including
   specific project budgets, more transparent and systemized. The Russian
   presidency aims to make the role of permanent participants and observers
   in the Council's activities more visible. At the same time, Moscow will
   avoid its former claims to transform the Council from an
   intergovernmental forum to a full-fledged international organization and
   bring military security problematique to the Council's agenda. Russia's
   chairmanship will try to strengthen the Arctic Council's role in
   asserting regional stewardship by responding to the challenges of a
   rapidly changing Arctic and the increasingly more integrated policy
   frameworks from local to global scales.},

Abstract = {Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) play important roles in the survival of
   microorganisms existing in the cold environment. One of the several AFPs
   from an Arctic glacier bacterial strain which in our previous study

   The cry-c AFP from the Svalbard Arctic cryoconite strain Cry-c MLB-29
   belonging to the genus Cryobacterium has been characterized by
   ESI-Q-TOF-MS that revealed its molecular mass as 22.14 kDa.
   Multienzymatic limited digestion and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses revealed
   228 amino acid residues in 21 peptide fragments. First 20 amino acid
   residues of the N-terminus of cry-c AFP has been deduced. Glycine and
   alalninerich sequences and the NXS motifs in several peptide fragments
   have been found out. Selected peptide fragments of the AFP have been
   modeled by PEP-FOLD and the structure-function correlation discussed in
   view of its antifreeze property.},

Title = {Between-year comparison of interactions between environmental parameters

   summers of 2017 and 2018},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the northern Bering Sea, ice coverage and retreat timing were low and
   early, respectively, in the 2017?2018 winter. To evaluate the effect of
   these anomalous ice conditions, we quantified various environmental
   parameters (temperature, salinity, mixed-layer depth, nutrients) and the
   standing stocks of various planktonic taxa (phytoplankton counts, meso-
   and macrozooplankton mass, jellyfish abundance) during July of 2017 and
   2018. For each year, the interaction between each parameter was
   evaluated by structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Large yearly
   differences were detected for the interactions between environmental
   parameters and planktonic stocks. Thus, for 2017, a total of fifteen
   interactions were present between environmental parameters and various
   planktonic stocks. In 2018, however, only eight interactions were
   present. Among the interactions, four were common to the two years. It
   is notable that the path coefficients of these four interactions were
   all lower in 2018 than in 2017. These findings suggest that the small
   magnitude and short pulse of the phytoplankton bloom in 2018 may have
   failed to transfer production and energy to a higher trophic level even
   within the planktonic food web. Indeed, in 2018, mass mortality was
   reported for seabirds (two murre species) feeding on planktivorous
   fishes.},

Title = {Analysis of Land Use/Land Cover Changesusing Remote Sensing Data and
   GISin Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Area, Gujarat, India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {The present study encompasses the Land use/land cover (LU/LC) change
   detection in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area by using Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technology, over a
   period of a decade at an interval of 5 years, i.e., for the year 2005,
   2011 and 2016. Based on geographical conditions, remote sensing data and
   field survey, the study area was classified into six categories. The
   comparison of LU/LC in 2005, 2011 and 2016 derived from Ahmedabad
   Municipal Corporation map and satellite imagery interpretation indicates
   that there is a consistent increase in built-up area and open tree cover
   area.On the other hand, dense tree cover, open land area and water
   spread area of waterbody declined correspondingly. Moreover, the overall
   tree cover of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area has declined from
   2523.01 ha to 2477.45 ha from the year 2005 to 2016 which may be due to
   rapid urbanization of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area. This
   study of detailed LU/LU change analysis with regular monitoring will be
   fruitful to drag the attention of urban planners and decision makers for
   sustainable development, detailed area planning as well as to overcome
   the problem of decline in green spaces and urban sprawl. Additionally,
   the findings of the present study will beuseful in monitoring the
   dynamics of land use resulting from the changing demands of the growing

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},

Pages = {78-104},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyze an eco-epidemiological model of a
   prey predator system where both prey and predator population are
   affected by a disease. Each of the prey and predator population is
   divided into two categories, susceptible and infected. The susceptible
   prey and susceptible predator assumed to migrate at a constant rate; the
   infected prey and infected predator are assumed to get vaccinated. Based
   on those assumptions a four dimensional mathematical model is derived.
   The dynamical behavior of the resulting system: boundedness of
   solutions, existence and stability conditions of the biologically
   feasible equilibrium points, is analyzed mathematically. Extensive
   numerical simulations are carried out to validate our analytical
   findings.},

Title = {Quantifying stratospheric ozone loss over Antarctica in the last two
   decades using corrected satellite profiles},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Loss of stratospheric ozone has occurred over the last half a century
   due to catalytic destruction by halogen -containing anthropogenic
   compounds. Saturated ozone loss events, when the ozone concentrations
   decreased to less than or equal to 1 mPa (>95\% ozone loss), were
   studied across nine stations in Antarctica using the Microwave Limb
   Sounder (MLS) instrument onboard the satellite Aura. The satellite
   observations were corrected using in situ ozonesonde observations to
   quantify the saturated ozone loss between 2004 and 2020. The analysis
   shows that at some stations the original MLS observations underestimated
   the number of loss events by 5-10\%, however, at other stations they
   were overestimated by the same margin. A couple of stations showed a
   very good match between the original and corrected MLS data.
   Irrespective of the bias, the number of loss events decreased gradually
   from 2004 to 2013 suggesting a recovering trend. After 2013, no
   significant trend is visible, with large variation seen for especially
   between 2015 and 2019. The interannual variation was strongly coupled to
   the temperature, highlighting the key role that polar stratospheric
   clouds play in causing saturated ozone loss.},

Title = {Shipboard observations of atmospheric oxygen in the Southern Ocean
   during the 2017-2018 austral summer},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An in situ measurement system was developed for continuous observations
   of the mole fractions of atmospheric oxygen (defined as delta(O-2/N-2))
   and carbon dioxide (CO2) and the continuous observation was conducted
   onboard the research vessel SHIRASE 5003 during its voyage between
   Australia and Syowa Station, Antarctica, in 2017-2018. The CO2 variation
   was low with respect to that of delta(O-2/N-2) in the Southern Ocean,
   suggesting that the land biospheric and fossil-fuel derived CO2 and O-2
   emissions negligibly influenced the observations. Therefore, the
   observed significant variations in the atmospheric O-2/N-2 can be
   attributed to the atmosphere ocean gas exchange. During the southbound
   voyage in December 2017, we observed large spatial variations in
   delta(O-2/N-2) due to marine biological production on the western side
   of the cruise track. Oceanic O2 fluxes based on a simple model and
   atmospheric delta(O-2/N-2) variability were consistent with past oceanic
   observations. No clear longitudinal gradient in delta(O-2/N-2) was
   observed at latitudes toward south of 60 degrees S in December 2017 and
   February-March 2018. However, local delta(O-2/N-2) maxima were observed
   in regions with active marine biological production in December 2017.
   These observations indicate that local O-2 fluxes can also modify the
   spatial distribution of atmospheric delta(O-2/N-2) in the Southern
   Ocean.},

   Margin, Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {A total of 362 marine core samples from 200 meters below the sea-floor
   (mbsf) were examined through the International Ocean Drilling Program
   (IODP), Hole U1325B, Northern Cascadia Margin. The diversity parameters
   increased at -200 mbsf during the Early Middle Pleistocene Transition
   (EMPT) period and gradually decreased towards -165 mbsf. The diversity
   pattern is also notable, which projects the termination of EMPT due to
   increased orbital cyclicity (-41,000 to -100,000 years). The delta 18O
   (Uvigerina peregrina) at regular intervals -150 mbsf, -110 mbsf, -50
   mbsf and -20 mbsf certainly agrees with the abundance of Cibicides
   wuellerstorfi, indicating the intrusion of California Cold Current in
   the region. The relative abundance rate of Cassidulina laevigata
   inversely proportional to the peaks of C. wuellerstorfi strongly
   indicating the circulation of Alaskan warm current in the Cascadia
   Margin. The paleoproductivity and oxygenation proxies strongly suggest
   the maximum primary productivity throughout -85 mbsf towards the recent
   interval and the study region are showing oxic to suboxic environment
   further, the correlation matrix and the principal component phenomenon
   also strongly mirror the relationship and driving factors of the
   paleoceanographic condition. The present study aimed to understand the
   connections between each proxy liable to the paleoceanographic and
   paleoproductivity changes during the EarlyMiddle Pleistocene, Northern
   Cascadia Margin.},

Abstract = {Scientific achievements of ArCS Theme 5 (AT5), whose goal is to assess
   the predictability of Arctic-related climate variations, are reviewed.
   AT5 clarified some important roles played by the responses of the Arctic
   stratosphere and land surface to the Arctic sea ice variations in the
   predictability of the Arctic climate and its remote influence to lower
   latitudes. AT5 demonstrated that some climatic phenomena occurring in
   the tropics and even in the southern hemisphere remotely influence the
   Arctic climate, wherein the influence from the tropics is found to lead
   to higher predictability of the Arctic climate while that from the
   southern hemisphere is a limiting factor for the predictability. AT5
   also investigated how long the Arctic sea ice is predictable using a
   stateof-the-art climate model.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the achievements of one of the themes in the
   Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) project. Consisting mainly of
   researchers of human and social sciences, the theme was designed to
   connect the achievements of other themes to stakeholders and
   policymakers. According to our research method, this paper proceeds the
   discussion in three research areas. First, economic development in the
   Arctic will be analyzed. While climate warming has escalated in the
   Arctic, the possibility of using the Northern Sea Route and of
   developing underground resources is expanding. The sustainability of
   this development will be investigated to identify the future prospects
   of economic activity. Second, interaction between humans and the
   environment will be considered. Based on the information collected
   through fieldwork in East Siberia, interior Alaska, and Greenland, it
   will be illustrated how human and natural factors in environmental
   change are intricately interwoven. Third, various issues concerning
   Arctic governance will be discussed. Several points such as Arctic legal
   policy, international relations, and the involvement of indigenous
   people in resource governance will be key issues of the discussion.
   After showing these achievements of the project, future challenges of
   Arctic study will be indicated.},

Abstract = {The impact of cyclone, flood and drought disasters on agriculture in
   Nagapattinam district has become a subject of increasing importance and
   the present study aims to expose the effect of cyclone, flood and
   drought disasters and its vulnerability on agriculture in Nagapattinam
   district. In this paper we assess the vulnerability of coastal farmers
   of Nagapattinam district to natural disasters and identify policy
   options to strengthen their adaptive capacity. In general, the
   socio-economic conditions of the small farmers in the study area were
   found to be poor and this is risky mainly during the disaster period.
   The foremost alternative for the coastal farmers in all the
   disaster-prone regions was government relief funds and insurance. This
   paper aims to study the vulnerability of the coastal farmers to
   disasters.},

Abstract = {Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is one of the most inexpensive and abundantly
   produced agro-industrial waste, which provides a natural biodegradable
   resource for cost-effective bio-energy production. For commercial
   utilization of SCB, economic and technological factors need a clear
   identification and discussion. This review revisits the different modes
   of valorization process which was brought into an application during the
   due course of time. Pre-treatment is successfully applicable towards
   improved digestibility of cellulose by enzyme accessibility to the
   substrate because of the recalcitrant biological structure of SCB. The
   scope and bottleneck involved in the effectiveness of this procedure
   have been identified and mentioned here. The relative advantages of
   pre-treatment processes along with existing challenging methods and
   various advanced combinatorial methods have been discussed here. The
   present study will be helpful for designing advanced pretreatment
   methods to maximize the yield of desired platform chemicals to obtain a
   sustainable bioenergy market in the future.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-25},
Abstract = {Mercury is a heavy metal which is found naturally in the ecosystem in
   many different forms. Due to its highly toxic nature, its presence and
   increasing accumulation in the environment is of great concern.
   Methylmercury, an organic form of mercury, of all other forms act as
   global and serious problem for human as well as ecological health.
   Although all forms can be accumulated in the living organisms, but it
   has been observed that methylmercury can be taken up at a much faster
   rate as compared to others. This methylmercury has ill-effects on the
   human nervous system. It is also known to cause cancer, although it has
   not been proven yet. Mercury contamination has also been observed in
   aquatic ecosystem and it has disastrous results because its accumulation
   increases many fold in increasing level of the food chain. The adverse
   effect of mercury on the health holds in its ability of bioaccumulation
   and biomagnifications. The objective of this study was to isolate
   mercury-resistant bacteria and characterize them. These bacteria were
   characterized based on their morphological characters and biochemical
   tests conducted on them. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) was
   used to determine its bacterial susceptibility to Hg compounds.},

Title = {Application of statistical and analytical treatments in the explanation
   the origin of groundwater chemistry. Case of the Messaad Plateau. South
   Algerian Steppe Region},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {25-42},
Abstract = {The study area (Messaad plateau) is one of the arid areas with annual
   precipitation of the order of 150 mm. This area includes the Barremian
   aquifer, which plays a very important role in the supply of drinking
   water and irrigation water in the study area. The objective of this work
   is to study the origin of groundwater chemistry in the Barremian
   aquifer. The results obtained from the study of the physico-chemical
   parameters showed that the waters are very strongly mineralized overall,
   with a predominance of calcium sulphate facies and calcium chloride
   facies. Examination of the maps of the spatial variation of the various
   physico-chemical parameters reveals a high degree of mineralization in
   the South and South-East part of the study area near Oued Messaad.
   Statistical treatment by the application of the Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) has shown that the increase in mineralization is mainly
   due to the dissolution of evaporative mineral-rich salt-bearing
   formations, and the predominant redox mechanism over that of acid
   hydrolysis in the acquisition of ions in groundwater. The hydrochemical
   model based on Artificial Neuron Networks (ANN) of the multilayer
   perceptron (MLP) type has shown that the SO42-,Cl-,Ca2+ ,Na+ ions are
   the most important factors influencing the electrical conductivity of
   water. Analysis of the ionic ratios shows that these ions are the result
   of the dissolution of gypsum and halite continuously in the clays and
   marls of the Barremian formations.},

Title = {Barriers in Cultivation and Marketing of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants
   in Uttarakhand, India: A Stakeholder Perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {Indian agriculture is at crossroads and the traditional crop sector has
   reached a plateau. Rising cost of production and rising food prices, has
   brought the issue of food security and need for improving food
   production back to the forefront of policy makers' mind. Pursuing this
   line of thought, proposal to diversify towards more profitable, export
   oriented medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), presents itself as a
   viable option for farmers in the hill state of Uttarakhand, India.
   Firstly, through a review of the existing literature this study strives
   to develop a `view from the above' point-of-view on the structural
   issues of medicinal plants as an `economic sector'. Secondly, by
   investigating the local level `realities' of medicinal plants, their
   production and impacts on livelihoods, the paper also attempts to probes
   the threats and problems associated with medicinal plant resources.
   Thirdly, this study attempts to examine the production, financial and
   marketing constraints in the business of MAPs in Uttarakhand and reviews
   the `Value Chain' of MAPs through an in-depth sector study. Finally, a
   `Stakeholders analysis' of the existing formal and informal
   institutions, their linkages and interplay at various levels is
   undertaken through detailed conversations with stakeholders and analysis
   of the existing marketing channels. Overall, three strategies have
   clearly emerged as the most prominent in ensuring transformation of the
   medicinal plant sector - Conservation, Cultivation and Coordination
   between stakeholders.},

   ingroup) and 115 morphological characters, including male and female
   genitalia. Spartocerini was polyphyletic both under EW and IW because
   Molchina was nested in Mictini. We remove Molchina from Spartocerini and
   consider the genus as incertae sedis. Spartocera, Eubule, and Sephina
   were not recovered as monophyletic. Sephina pubera (Erichson) is
   considered as incertae sedis within Spartocerini, Eubule ampliata

Title = {Tell a Styloperlidae from its wing venation: diagnostic traits of the

Abstract = {Wing venation is a character system commonly used in the systematics of
   fossil insects, but the existing documentation for extant forms is often
   insufficient to allow robust identification of extinct forms. The
   existing literature suggests that the small stonefly family
   Styloperlidae Illies, 1966, for which no fossils have ever been
   identified, might possess a suite of distinctive traits. In order to
   assess their relevance, we conducted a comparative analysis based on a
   set of individuals of Cerconychia livida Klapalek, 1913, and of
   singletons belonging to four additional species. Our survey demonstrates
   that, in forewing, a fusion of the anterior-most branch of AA2 with AA1
   occurs, a trait unique to the family. The occurrence of one to several
   cross-veins in the distal part of the ScP-RA area (both wing pairs), and
   of a supernumerary sigmoidal cross-vein in the MP-CuA area (hind wing),
   are also distinctive features, but are not unique to the family. A few
   other peculiar traits, which relevance remains unclear, are highlighted.
   Hopefully, our survey will allow close fossil relatives to be identified
   in the near future.},

Pages = {60-72},
Abstract = {For decades, green architecture transformations have been a factor in
   the design of urban areas. The urbanization process is associated with a
   burgeoning population, increasing economic activities, and the rise of
   various socioeconomic engagements. Therefore, there is a need to explore
   green space, motivating the city's socio-ecological practices. This
   study aims to evaluate the relationship between spatial patterns and
   urbanization. It discusses the role of spatial patterns in the process
   of urbanization. More specifically, the elements of the network of
   transportation and alteration in land usage were discussed as two
   spatial patterns. Further, the study examines the factors that led the
   Arabian region, mainly, the UAE to transform their industry towards
   green architecture, since the year 1990 was marked as the initiation of
   the change in the construction industry in the Arabian region. The urban
   greenbelt strategy was used in this study to limit the physical spread
   of urban sprawl, avoid environmental deterioration, and preserve green
   space. The study analysed that despite efforts taken to transform the
   construction industry towards green architecture entirely.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Holopothrips is a diverse group of thrips associated to galls in the
   Neotropics, with a variety of host plants and wide morphological
   diversity. Relationships to other Neotropical groups have been proposed,
   but are still untested, and the monophyly of the genus remains doubtful.
   Here, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of Holopothrips, based on
   morphological characters. A total of 87 species were included in the
   matrix and eight analyses were carried out, but all of them failed to
   recover Holopothrips as a monophyletic grouping. Bremer and Bootstrap
   support values were low, and the topologies varied among all analyses,
   with uncertain internal relations for the ingroup. These results
   indicate that the relationships for Holopothrips species, and the
   proposed related genera, are more complex than previously reported; and
   morphological characters may not be enough to recover the evolutionary
   story within this group. We also discuss the influences of different
   character coding, continuous characters and weighting schemes in our
   results.},

Pages = {55-72},
Abstract = {Indian cities are currently facing several challenges due to the abrupt
   increase in urbanization and global climate changes. Since human
   development is an inevitable part of civilization that is rapidly
   increasing at unprecedented rates; therefore, demands for natural
   resources have gone up many folds to ensure the survival of human
   beings. Among urban ecosystems, trees play a vital role in stabilizing
   nature and provide several essential ecosystem services such as water
   and air purification, noise reduction, carbon sequestration, climate
   regulation, food supply, wildlife habitat. At this time, we are moving
   toward a new urban period in which the ecology of our world as a whole
   is mainly influenced by both natural and anthropogenic activities with
   more outstanding contributions from the latter side. Therefore,
   urbanization presents fundamental challenges and provides new
   opportunities to boost the resilience and functioning of ecosystem.
   Through a review of several global works of literature concerning
   ecosystem services, this article highlights the ecosystem services
   values provided by the trees in some prominent cities of India. Various
   ecosystem services have been examined like air filtration, carbon
   sequestration, surface runoff mitigation, noise reduction, temperature
   regulation, climate regulation etc. We concluded that ecosystem services
   have a substantial impact on the quality of life in urban areas. The
   ecosystem services concept can play a crucial role in interconnecting
   cities globally.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {42-59},
Abstract = {There are various types of relationships between per capita income and
   different environmental indicators and Environmental Kuznets Curve is
   one of them. Some very clear patterns of relationship between
   environmental degradation and income emerge from the analysis. Most of
   the environmental indicators improve with rising income. A monotonic
   decrease of environmental degradation along a country's development path
   suggests that policies that accelerate economic growth also lead to
   rapid environmental improvements. `Agricultural methane emissions',
   `agricultural nitrous oxide emissions', `forest area' and `bird species
   threatened' have inverted U type relationship with income. These
   indicators improve after the turning point when incomes are higher.
   Before that point, at lower income levels, environmental quality
   deteriorates as income began to rise. Other indicators like `carbon
   dioxide emissions', `other green house gases emissions', `HFC gas
   emissions', `industrial nitrous oxide emissions', `organic water
   pollutant' and `fish species threatened' have inverted N type
   relationship with income. In these indicators improvement begins after
   the second turning point at a much higher per capita income level. So
   the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is supported by the study for
   ten environmental indicators.},

Abstract = {The Carabidae is by far the largest family of the Adephaga, with more

   sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of Notiophilus
   quadripunctatus (Nebriinae) and Omophrom limbatum (Omophroninae) using
   high-throughput sequencing. Both mitogenomes consisted of a single
   circular DNA molecule that encoded the typical 13 protein-coding genes,
   two subunits of mitochondrial RNAs, 22 tRNAs and a putative control
   region. Our phylogenetic study placed Omophrom limbatum as sister taxon
   to all other analyzed ground beetle species whereas Notiophilus
   quadripunctatus was identified as sister to Nebria brevicollis as part
   of the Nebriinae. The analyses also support the monophyly of the
   Cicindelidae but place Trachypachus holmbergi (Trachypachidae) within
   the Carabidae. Nevertheless, almost all carabid subfamilies with more
   than one analyzed species were identified as monophyla.},

   based on 13 terminal taxa and 60 characters (57 morphological and three
   behavioral) was conducted. The exhaustive search with equally weighted
   characters resulted in two most parsimonious trees with 95 steps.
   Spirachtha is proposed to be the sister group of the monophyletic
   ``subgroup Corotocae{''} (Corotoca + Cavifonexus gen. nov.), based on
   eleven synapomorhphies (ten exclusive and one homoplastic). The
   monophyly of Corotoca is supported here, including six species
   associated with Constrictotermes cyphergaster: (Corotoca hitchensi sp.
   nov + (C. melantho + C. pseudomelantho sp. nov.) + ((C. fontesi + (C.
   phylo + C. araujoi)). A new genus, Cavifronexus gen. nov., is proposed
   to two species associated with Constrictotermes cavifrons (Holmgren,
   1910): Cavifronexus guyanae comb. nov., from Guyana and Brazil,
   previously described as Corotoca; and a new species, Cavifronexus
   papaveroi sp. nov., from Brazil. This work also includes descriptions,
   redescriptions, and illustrations for all species and genera. Keys for
   genera and species identification in ``subgroup Corotocae{''} are also
   provided.},

Title = {The Economic Growth, Energy, Trade, FDI, Exchange Rate, And CO2
   Emissions In Turkey. Fresh Evidence From Combined Co-Integration Test},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effect of economic growth, energy, trade, and
   FDI on CO2 emissions in Turkey. Also, the prime objective of this paper
   is to provide a new insight by examining the impact of the real exchange
   rate (EX) on CO2 emissions by using a new Bayer-Hanck combined
   co-integration approach. The study covers the period of 1980-2015. The
   ARDL and FMOLS models are used to test the relationship between the
   examined variables. The Granger causality test is applied to test the
   direction of the causality among the examined variables. The findings
   from FMOLS and ARDL models show that an increase in economic growth,
   non-renewable energy consumption, and FDI in Turkey led to an increase
   in Turkey's carbon emissions. Furthermore, the outcomes show that the
   real exchange rate negatively affects CO2 emissions in Turkey.
   Additionally, the outcomes confirm that the real exchange rate
   negatively affects carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through the channels
   of energy consumption, FDI, and international trade. It is suggested
   that Turkey's policymakers should play a significant role in supporting
   trade, FDI, energy investment projects to lower the level of Co2
   emission by employing different economic and monetary policies such as
   exchange rate policy to reduce environmental degradation.},

Abstract = {Starting 16000 years ago, the Neolithic lifestyle known as the Jomon
   culture spread across the Japanese archipelago. Although extensively
   studied by archaeology and physical anthropology, little is known about
   the genetic characteristics of the Jomon people. Here, we report the
   entire mitogenome and partial nuclear genome of skeletal remains from
   the initial Jomon period that were excavated from the Higashimyo shell
   midden site at Saga City, Kyushu Island, Japan. This is the first genome
   analysis of the initial Jomon people of Kyushu Island. These results
   provide important data for understanding the temporal transition and
   regional differences of the Jomon people. The mitochondrial DNA and
   Y-chromosome haplogroups were similar to those found in the previously
   reported later Jomon people. Moreover, comparison of three nuclear
   genomes from the initial to final Jomon periods indicated genetic
   continuity throughout the Jomon period within the Japanese archipelago
   with no significant evidence of admixture. This indicates that the
   genetic differentiation found among the Jomon people was promoted by the
   progression of regionalization throughout the Jomon period. Further
   accumulation of high-quality Jomon genome data spanning a wide range of
   regions and ages will clarify both intimate regional and temporal
   differences of the Jomon people and details of their admixture history
   with rice fanners, as suggested by Jomon mitochondrial genome data. The
   results obtained from this study provide important information for
   further analysis.},

Title = {The human remains of the funerary complex of Neferhotep (XVIIIth-XXth
   Dynasty, Valley of the Nobles, Luxor, Egypt) taphonomy and anthropology},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {223-232},
Abstract = {The Valley of the Nobles is a burial area that is located between the
   Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, together with which it
   constitutes the Theban Necropolis. The Valley of the Nobles houses the
   tombs of ancient aristocratic families, which include the monumental
   complex of the Neferhotep tomb, catalogued as TT49 (XVIIIth Dynasty).
   The funerary monument of Neferhotep also includes tombs TT187, TT347,
   TT348, TT362, and TT363, although tombs TT347, TT348 (Ramessid Period),
   and TT363 (XIXth Dynasty) remain closed. Tombs TT49, TT187, and TT362
   contained numerous human remains in different states of conservation.
   Those in tomb TT187 were attributable to at least 71 individuals, who
   showed evident signs of combustion, and also taphonomic alterations that
   had occurred in recent decades. The context of tomb TT362 was different,
   as it contained animal and human mummified remains that were
   disarticulated and showed few signs of exposure to high temperatures.
   These remains were attributable to 64 individuals. Tomb TT49 contained
   the remains of a single individual inside the burial chamber. The
   taphonomic and anthropological data suggest that the tombs within the
   funerary complex of Neferhotep were frequented not only by modern
   populations, as they also testify to the ancient reuse of tombs in
   different phases from the Ramessid to Ptolemaic periods.},

Title = {Correlation analysis of the variability of NO2 and PM tropospheric
   concentrations within the Greater Salento (Italy) before, during and
   after the COVID-19 lockdown},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {52-62},
Abstract = {The period of lockdown, which occurred in many nations as a result of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, represented, for scholars, who deal with the
   complex dynamics connected to emissions and concentrations of
   atmospheric pollutants, an excellent opportunity to deepen their
   studies. However, to date, scientific papers, relating to correlation
   studies between the spatial and temporal variations of thue main
   pollutants present in our cities (among all, NO2 and particulates),
   during the long and atypical period of the almost total block of
   vehicular traffic and many productive activities during pandemic peak,
   are still very few. This analysis focuses on the Greater Salento region
   (Italy) and aims to monitor the changes, and the related
   interrelationships, of the tropospheric concentrations of NO2, PM2.5 and
   PM10, elaborating the overall data of average daily concentrations of
   these pollutants as recorded by the ARPA-Puglia ground-based monitoring
   stations. Nitrogen dioxides and PM emissions are notoriously related to
   vehicular traffic exhausts and, in general, to fossil fuel combustion
   processes. This analyzed Italian territory is very unusual because there
   are two provinces with large industrial settlements, Taranto, with the
   steel area of ex-ILVA, and Brindisi, with petrochemical and
   thermoelectric power plants, which enclose a territory, the province of
   Lecce, free of any industrial plants of such sizes and impacts. From the
   results of this study, in addition to confirming the obvious and overall
   decrease of NO2 concentrations during and after the lockdown period,
   interesting and distinctive local correlations of the concentrations
   variability of these pollutants have also emerged. In fact, the
   conclusions of this paper are so significant as to allow broader
   considerations regarding other similar international areas, regarding,
   i.e., the ineffectiveness of government containment local measures
   concerning the tropospheric pollution of our cities.},

   relationship between the variables. The results obtained from the bounds
   F-statistics confirm the presence of a long-run stable relationship

   and coal consumption raise carbon emissions substantially while the
   financial development and trade openness boost the environmental quality
   in India. Besides, the findings confirm an inverse quadratic link
   between economic growth and CO2 discharges, supporting the validity of

Abstract = {The forewing base structure of the orthopteran suborder Ensifera, a

   the characters selected from the forewing base structure showed that the

   leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) collected in the state of Parana, Southern
   Brazil. The new species, A. elianeae sp. nov., G. josei sp. nov., G.
   meloi sp. nov., G. pinhalensis sp. nov. and G. taquarensis sp. nov., are
   associated with leafhopper species of the subfamilies Iassinae (tribe
   Gyponini) and Deltocephalinae (tribes Deltocephalini and Pendarini).
   Both sexes of G. josei sp. nov. and G. taquarensis sp. nov. were
   associated and males are described, representing the first sexual
   association based on reared specimens from Brazil. We record for the
   first time species of Dryinidae parasitizing the leafhoppers species:
   Curtara concava, Gypona lita and Reticana lineatta (Gyponini),
   Graminella striatella (Deltocephalini) and Copidinomus vittulatus
   (Pendarini). All known records in the Neotropic of both Anteon and
   Gonatupus species associated with host are compiled, all known records
   of parasitoids of gyponines are reviewed, and the interactions with
   dryinids are discussed. Each new species is diagnosed and described, and
   illustrations of both dryinids and parasitized hosts are provided.},

Title = {Geographical distribution of certain toponyms in the Samguk Sagi},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {35-44},
Abstract = {Kim Busik's Samguk Sagi History of the Three Kingdoms, dating from 1145
   A.D., is renowned for including Japanese toponyms in the Korean
   peninsula and the north of Yalujiang district (modern Liaoning and Jilin
   Provinces). Kim's work recorded the older, archaic topony ins before
   they were converted into sinicized (i.e. expressed with Chinese words)
   place names with two Chinese characters in 757 A.D. by the order of King
   Kyeongdeok. This paper maps specific words included in the place names
   of 783 locations for which the corresponding present places are evident.
   The following were words examined: (1) `river' and its related words;
   (2) `valley'; (3) `mountain' and `ridge'; and (4) `city' and `burg'.
   Japonic-sourced toponyms are typically distributed in the central and
   northern areas of the Yalu River, primarily in the district of Kogury6;
   however, they go beyond these regions. The use of Chinese loanwords is
   noted in the southern area, where determining which language was spoken
   is difficult. In a town near Seoul, the stem of the toponym belongs to
   the Korean language, whereas the unit word belongs to the Japonic
   language. This usage may be attributed to bilingualism, whereby
   Korean-speaking inhabitants used their own language for the stem of the
   place name. Mongolic and/or Tungusic loanwords are also found. In some
   cases, determining the language origin of the current toponyms is
   difficult. Therefore, the minute geographical distribution of the origin
   languages is displayed word by word. These toponyms reflect the traces
   of indigenous languages and reveal that Japonic-speaking people still
   dwelled in the central area of the peninsula and in the northern area of
   the Yalu River at that period.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},

Pages = {87-98},
Abstract = {A new mediwn-sized hominoid mandibular fossil was discovered at an early
   Late Miocene site, Tebingan area, south of Magway city, central Myanmar.
   The specimen is a left adult mandibular corpus preserving strongly worn
   M-2 and M-3, fragmentary roots of P-4 and M-1 alveoli of canine and P-3,
   and the lower half of the mandibular symphysis. In Southeast Asia, two
   Late Miocene medium-sized hominoids have been discovered so far:
   Lufengpithecus from the Yunnan Province, southern China, and
   Khoratpithecus from northern Thailand and central Myanmar. In
   particular, the mandibular specimen of Khoratpithecus was discovered
   from the neighboring village of Tebingan. However, the new mandible
   shows apparent differences from both genera in the shape of the outline
   of the mandibular symphyseal section. The new Tebingan mandible has a
   well-developed superior transverse torus, a deep intertoral sulcus (=
   genioglossal fossa), and a thin, shelf-like inferior transverse torus.
   In contrast, Lufengpithecus and Khoratpithecus each have very shallow
   intertoral sulcus and a thick, rounded inferior transverse torus. The
   characteristic morphology of the mandibular symphysis in the Tebingan
   specimen suggests a different taxon from Khoratpithecus. In central
   Myanmar at least two kinds of medium-sized hominoids were likely present
   in the early Late Miocene.},

Abstract = {This research work aims to study the antecedents of the purchasing of
   local food. Therefore, we propose to investigate the proximity effects
   on confidence and on buying local food intention. The empirical study
   was conducted among Saudi market, that enabled us to test our research
   hypotheses and model. Then, proximity with its different dimensions,
   namely relational proximity and proximity of access, process and
   identity, helps to develop consumer confidence in a local product.
   Moreover, we deduct that confidence in a local product can stimulate
   intention to buy local. This study has enhanced the marketing review
   associated to local consumption. Moreover, it provides marketers with
   the real tools to promote local food. Specifically, this work inspects
   the Arabic culture. Besides, it integrates constructs that may affect
   the prospects of this market.},

Abstract = {Athyrium falcatum Bedd. is an economically important fern that occur in
   different ecological niche. In the present work spores of Athyrium
   falcatum were cultured in P \& T medium and 77.5\% spore germination was
   recorded within a week of sowing. The viability of spores was lost in
   seven months, when kept in room temperature. Prothallial development was
   found to be `Drynaria Type'. Antheridia appeared first after 85 days of
   spore sowing, archegonia were initiated after 95 days and bisexual stage
   appeared after 110 days of sowing. Fern habitats are under continuous
   threat due to anthropogenic factors and developmental activities which
   ultimately decrease the forest cover and fern vegetation. In vitro
   culture creates a new path for mass cultivation of ferns and will be
   very helpful for their restoration and conservation. The main aim of the
   present investigation was to record the peculiarities of the pattern of
   spore germination, sex ontogeny and gametophyte development in this
   terrestrial taxon.},

   Triassic rocks have been found to be the main contributors to
   groundwater salinization. The increase in salinity is related to the

Abstract = {The Andean civilization emerged in South America during the Formative
   Period (3000-50 BCE) and developed through renovation activities of
   ceremonial architecture. A collaborative team of Japanese and Peruvian
   archaeologists has been excavating an archaeological site with
   ceremonial architectures at Pacopampa since 2005. Pacopampa is one of
   the largest Formative Period sites in the Northern Highlands of Peru.
   This paper reviewed the previous studies of Pacopampa and reconstructed
   situations of health and death during an initial stage of the Andean
   civilization from a bioarchaeological perspective. Findings from several
   previous studies were summarized as follows: (1) bioarchaeological
   evidence supported the emergence of social stratification in the
   Formative Period; (2) social stratification promoted the difference in
   the proportion of dental diseases and stress markers between burial
   types; and (3) violence-related trauma was first observed at Pacopampa,
   which was highly likely to be caused by ritual practices. These findings
   will contribute to an elucidation of the impacts of social
   stratification on the inhabitants' health.},

Abstract = {Ancient DNA analysis became paleogenomics once high-throughput
   sequencing technology was applied to ancient DNA sequencing.
   Paleogenomics based on whole-genome information from Neanderthals and
   Denisovans showed that small fragments of these genomes remain in the
   modern human genome, and corresponding studies of anatomical modern
   humans clarified the history of migration and expansion among Homo
   sapiens. Due to geographical and environmental conditions, paleogenomic
   studies have fallen behind in Eastern compared with Western Eurasia.
   Recently, however, various capture sequencing techniques, which can
   enrich ancient DNA, have been used in East Eurasia, and the field of
   paleogenomics has been further developed. This review briefly introduces
   the history of ancient DNA analysis leading to paleogenomics, outlines
   three sequencing stages (partial, draft. and complete genome sequencing)
   and capture methods, and discusses the necessity of high-quality
   sequencing for paleogenomes of Eastern Eurasia.},

Title = {The time-dependent evolutionary rate of mitochondrial DNA in small
   mammals inferred from biogeographic calibration points with reference to
   the late Quaternary environmental changes in the Japanese archipelago},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have long been the most popular
   marker for assessing phylogenetic relationships and uncovering
   population dynamics. However. the mechanism of the nucleotide
   substitution rate of mtDNA remains unclear. While the evolutionary rate
   over tens of thousands of years is thought to be time dependent, the
   overall picture is not fully understood. This article presents recent
   achievements related to the time-dependent evolutionary rate of mtDNA in
   small rodents in the Japanese archipelago. The method focuses on rapid
   expansion events during the late Quaternary, during which there was a
   prolonged severe cold period and repeated abrupt warm periods, providing
   multiple calibration points. The global sea level fluctuation and
   migration to islands help to specify the calibration points. For
   calibration points at 11000, 15000, 53000., and 130000 years ago, the
   evolutionary rates were approximately 0.11, 0.11, 0.047, and 0.029
   substitutions/site/million years, respectively, in the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b gene (Cytb). Applying the higher rate to assess the
   evolutionary history of the commensal house mouse (Alus musculus) and
   complete mitochondrial genome sequences (similar to 16000 bp) allowed us
   to trace prehistoric human culture development based on millet and rice
   agriculture. The pattern of time-dependent evolutionary rates presented
   here is likely applicable to other small rodents. The Japanese
   archipelago is ideal for assessing evolutionary rates with biogeographic
   calibration points in the late Quaternary in species with multiple
   genetically distinct local populations.},

Abstract = {The present work was designed to design low cost locally available
   double chamber Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)with photosynthetic algae as

   produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Microalgae grow fast; some can
   double in size within 7 days so that we can easily obtain large biomass
   within a few times. This process combines the production of biomass with
   efficient conversion to electrical energy. Three separate algae species
   were used to achieve the highest voltage levels of Chlorella sp,
   Scenedesmus sp, Chroococcus sp. Initially the anodic section was
   inoculated by activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant and
   the catholic section was inoculated by the cultures of Chlorella sp,
   Scenedesmus sp, Chroococcus sp as pure culture and then mixed with each
   other. Pure culture of each algae sample generated electricity for 7 d
   in a single chamber of the MFC. But mixed cultures produced more stable
   and more powerful than pure cultures.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {20-33},
Abstract = {To reduce pollution and risks of pesticides, numerous studies and
   research are carried out to identify new degradable compounds, identify
   more effective and less dangerous formulations. For this reason,
   hundreds of new compounds and formulations are continuously available
   every year. Use, programs and controls of these chemical compounds are
   not uniform all over the world. In some poor or developing countries,
   means to control exposures and risks, associated with these substances,
   are not available or limited. The main active components of herbicides,
   registered in the world in 2019, were clomazone and isoproturon, used as
   single agents or mixed with other components. The use of Clomazone, in
   particular, has grown in many countries, but in China and other emerging
   economies in the recent past there has not been the expected expansion,
   despite the growing world demand. In fact, many Chinese producers have
   ceased the production of this compound for its higher production costs
   than other substances. However, analysts expect an increase, for the
   next years, of clomazone consumption for various reasons, first of all,
   because it is considered much less toxic than other products. However,
   in the absence of indications deriving from long periods use, it seems
   evident the need to avoid recourse to the massive use of this herbicide
   by carefully observing the indications and precautions provided by the
   appropriate international bodies (US EPA, EFSA, etc.). As regards the
   studies on the effects on the reproductive functions of both terrestrial
   and marine animal organisms, it is evident the need to increase their
   number, until now completely insufficient.},

Title = {Isotopic study of maize exploitation during the Formative Period at
   Pacopampa, Peru},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {121-132},
Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) was an important staple and ceremonial food in the
   pre-Columbian Andean world. Previous researchers have studied maize
   agriculture in early ancient Andean society by examining macro- and
   microbotanical remains. However, isotope analyses of human remains have
   shown that maize was not a primary food resource during the Formative
   Period (1800-1 cal BC). Although a few studies have suggested that maize
   was consumed in this period, we know little about how the dietary role
   of maize differed across the Andean society and how it changed over
   time. This study measures carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from human
   and animal bone collagen samples and human tooth enamel samples
   excavated from the Pacopampa archaeological site in the highlands of
   northern Peru in order to better understand maize consumption in this
   period. The site dates to the Middle to Late Formative Periods (1200-700
   cal BC, 700-400 cal BC) and the Early Cajamarca phase (cal AD 200-450).
   The findings indicate an increase in C-4 resource consumption during the
   Late Formative Period-an increase that we attribute directly to maize
   and indirectly to domesticated animals. Although dietary variation
   related to social stratification was insignificant at this site, it has
   been reported at and between some coeval sites. Thus, we conclude that
   when these populations began exploiting C-4 resources, their strategic
   use of these resources varied depending on the site. This study suggests
   that the use of maize during the Formative Period was probably greater
   and earlier than reported in previous isotope studies. In addition,
   maize utilization for domestic animals in this period, which has rarely
   been mentioned, was also important.},

   (SP2)) for a period of 1 year. For calculating the WQI, 14 parameters,
   namely, pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total suspended
   solids, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, hardness,
   alkalinity, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, iron, copper, and coliform were
   considered. The WQI value ranges from 30.11 to 177.11 (summer season),
   24.30 to 392.61 (rainy season) and 25.38 to 261.74 (during winter
   season) falls under the excellent, good, poor, very poor to unsuitable
   to be used category. The present study revealed that the water of river
   Damodar at Dharampur, West Bengal, India is polluted (due to surface
   run-off, bathing activities, agriculture run-off, effluents from
   upstream from surrounding industrial and garden area, the immersion of
   idols of God and Goddess during festival season), and is unsuitable for
   human consumption, and also for the survival of life forms unless
   treated properly.},

Abstract = {The objective of present study is to reveal spatial variations at 16
   intertidal locations of Gujarat coast, India. The monitoring of coastal
   water quality was done on bi-monthly basis for during March-2016 to
   September 2017. Surface water samples were collected from the selected
   sampling sites and analysed to provide information regarding spatial
   variation observed in different water quality parameters. The range of
   parameters were recorded as follow: (pH (7.10 - 8.7); Water temperature
   (21- 34.8 degrees C); Turbidity (0.8 NTU - 670 NTU); Conductivity (14.8
   mS/cm - 96.41 mS/cm); Total Dissolved Solids (7.29 ppt - 80.0 ppt);
   Dissolved Oxygen (2.50 mg/l - 9.40 mg/l); Alkalinity (60 mg/l - 680
   mg/l); Acidity (20 mg/l to 165 mg/l); Total Hardness (500 mg/l - 23700
   mg/l); Salinity (13.14 ppt - 82.61ppt); Nitrate (0.02 mg/l to 10.30
   mg/l); Nitrite (0.01 mg/l - 0.36 mg/l) and Phosphate (0.05 mg/l - 7.60
   mg/l)]. The study revealed that, overall quality of water of Gujarat
   coast is in a good state suitable for flora and fauna, however, certain
   areas are under anthropogenic pressure and need continuous monitoring to
   know its effect on water quality and dependent biotic communities.},

Title = {Dynamic Analysis of Prey-Predator Model with Infection in the Prey
   Species Under the Effect of Primary and Secondary Toxicants},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {This paper depicts a predator-prey model to study the synchronous impact
   of two toxicants with various toxicities, discharged into nature,
   affecting the biological species. In the model, we consider simultaneous
   effect of two toxicants, in which primary toxicant is being converted
   into secondary toxicant and where secondary toxicant is more harmful.
   Also, transformation rate from primary toxicant to secondary toxicant is
   directly proportional to concentration of primary toxicant in the
   environment. Properties of two of these toxicants are different and
   hence the uptake rate of these toxicants by different species vary.
   Feasible equilibrium points have been obtained for the model. Using
   Routh Hurwitz method, conditions for local stability of non-trivial
   equilibrium points have been established. Also, using a suitable
   Lyapunov function, global stability of a non linear system at interior
   equilibrium point has been established. It has been observed in this
   paper that when conversion rate from primary to secondary toxicant is
   more, equilibrium is attained at a lower level and survival of
   population is less. We observe that although there is lesser infection
   in species in presence of pollution, survival of species becomes
   difficult with increase in pollution, therefore, either pollution has to
   be controlled or certain measures should be taken to reduce the
   conversion rate so that infection decreases and species also survives.},

Title = {The Effect of Climatic Shifts on Biodiversity of Phytocenosis: Lake
   Arakhley (Eastern Siberia, Russia)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Lake Arakhley is located within the Lake Baikal basin in Eastern
   Siberia, Russia. The area is characterized by continental subarctic
   climate with considerate diurnal temperature range, long cold dry
   winters and short hot summers with more precipitation occurring during
   the latter half of the summer. Climatic shifts in high water years and
   low water years result in morphometric changes in the lake and in the
   chemical and physical parameters of the ecosystem. During low water
   years, concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen are
   decreased, whereas nitrate concentration increases. High water years
   feature average concentrations of ammonium ions 1.5-2 times higher than
   the values of recent dry years.
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) of abiotic factors and biotic community
   indicated that the community structure shows the greatest correlation
   with physical and chemical parameters of water and biogenic elements
   (nitrites, ammonium, phosphates) along the first axis, and with the lake
   depth and transparency along the second axis.
   Changes in abiotic factors induce functioning and formation of
   characteristic communities of the primary producers in the trophic
   structure of the ecosystem. During low water years, with increased level
   of autochthonous organic matter, Lindavia comta dominance is observed,
   while during high water years, with increased allochthonous organic
   matter Asterionella fonnosa appeared as dominant. Currently, during low
   water years, the hydrophytes community is monodominant and composed of
   Ceratophyllum demersum. Meanwhile, such species indicating eutrophic
   conditions as Myriophyllum sibiricum, Potamogeton pectinatus are found
   in the lake vegetation.},

Title = {Prevalence of dental caries and antemortem tooth loss at Pacopampa in an

Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {This study examined the occurrence of carious lesions and antemortem
   tooth loss (AMTL) in skeletal remains from Pacopampa, a Formative period
   site in Peru. We sought to identify variations in carious lesions and
   AMTL within and between groups to uncover insights into social
   stratification and subsistence. Targets were permanent teeth and alveoli
   from skeletal remains from the Pacopampa I (1200-700 BCE) and Pacopampa
   II (700-400 BCE) phases. In this study, rates of carious lesions and
   AMTL, were analyzed in relation to cultural phase, age, sex, and burial
   type. The results revealed that rates varied by age (AMTL rates
   increased with age), sex (females exhibited higher carious and AMTL
   rates than males), and burial type (individuals buried with precious
   goods demonstrated lower carious and AMTL rates than other individuals).
   It is concluded that skeletal remains from the early stages of Andean
   social stratification revealed significant variations in dental caries
   and AMTL across cultural and biological factors. This study identified
   differences in the appearance of carious lesions and AMTL rates during
   the emergence of social stratification in the Central Andes in the
   Fonnative period. Future studies that explore diet using stable isotopic
   data are needed to test the assumption that variations in dental caries
   and AMTL are related to dietary patterns.},

Title = {Complexities of regional and interregional interactions during the
   Formative Period in northern Peru: new perspectives from Ingatambo,
   Huancabamba Valley},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},

Pages = {133-143},
Abstract = {This article describes the changing regional and interregional
   entanglements in northern Peru during the Middle and Late Formative
   Periods from a diachronic perspective. Comparing the available
   archaeological data from major or `core' ceremonial centers such as
   Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa, and the contemporaneous center at Ingatambo,
   located in the northern `frontier,' it seems reasonable to divide the
   diachronic process of interactions in northern Peru into three distinct
   phases to better understand its complexities. From this perspective,
   northern Peru around 1200 BC can be considered as an aggregate of local
   spheres (at the level of a valley or basin), with each of the local
   spheres pertaining to the emerging ceremonial centers. However, a major
   change seems to have occurred around 1000 BC, as regional and
   interregional interaction became more active in the northern highlands,
   and regional spheres seem to have expanded in number and geographic
   scale. Ceremonial centers such as Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa formed
   regional-scale spheres beyond a geographically specific area. Around 800
   BC, radical socioeconomic changes occurred in the Central Andes, and
   northern Peru was integrated into a pan-regional network covering the
   whole of the Central Andes. which overlay the northern interaction
   spheres developed by important centers such as Kuntur Wasi and
   Pacopampa. In this context, it seems important to focus on the site of
   Ingatambo, which is located at a unique geopolitical point where
   multiple spheres overlap and interact with the two core centers of
   Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa simultaneously. Ingatambo formed and
   maintained its own regional sphere independent of these two centers
   through its connection with the far north coast and tropical lowlands.},

Title = {Cranial morphometric analysis of early wet-rice farmers in the Yangtze
   River Delta of China},
Journal = {ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {203-222},
Abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta is the best-known homeland of wet-rice
   agriculture. From the Middle Neolithic, rice fanning expanded from the
   Yangtze region to both the north and the south. However, poor
   preservation of ancient human skeletal remains in the region has meant
   that the population history of these expansions has not been fully
   understood. In order to clarify the ancestry of early wet-rice farmers
   in East Asia, we conducted a cranial morphometric analysis and
   comparison of a Middle Neolithic skeletal assemblage excavated from the
   Guangfulin site, Shanghai. The results of bivariate and multivariate
   analyses showed that: (1) Neolithic wet-rice farmers from the lower
   Yangtze retained local morphological characteristics, but were
   nevertheless morphologically more similar to Neolithic and later
   populations in northern China, which was home to early millet farmers,
   than to Neolithic populations in south China; and (2) Neolithic and
   later agricultural populations in East Asia were morphologically
   homogeneous compared to pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer groups even though
   the area occupied by both was equally vast. These results suggest,
   respectively, that: (1) Middle Neolithic wet-rice fanners in the Yangtze
   Delta experienced significant gene flow from regions of northern China
   such as the Central Plains and Shandong even though there is currently
   no evidence that millet cultivation itself had yet reached the delta
   region; and (2) Neolithic populations resulting from interaction between
   the Yangtze Delta and northern China dispersed widely across much of
   East Asia including the Japanese archipelago together with the spread of
   wet-rice agricultural technologies. These two proposals are paralleled
   by recent stable isotope analyses using tooth enamel and bone collagen,
   as well as archaeological evidence from Shandong. Finally, a facial
   approximation was conducted using a cranium (M252) excavated from
   Guangfulin for the purpose of visually expressing the results of this
   study.},

Abstract = {In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the spread of the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the goal to do forecasts for
   the number of infected, recovered and deceased individuals. To do this,
   we propose a SIRD model, which takes into account the fact that
   susceptible individuals that meet infected individuals are not
   immediately infected, they become infected after a period which is
   denoted by t. Similarly, infected individuals recovered or deceased not
   immediately but after a period which is denoted by d. These
   considerations produce discrete delays in the classic SIRD model which
   is a particular case of functional differential equations. Furthermore,
   to take into account the effect of the social distancing, mask use or
   other actions to reduce the risk of infectivity, we consider that the
   transmission, the recovery and the death rates are not constants but
   time-dependent. To apply the model proposed, we developed an algorithm
   which uses ridge regression to do forecasts for the Peruvian regions of
   Moquegua and Tacna.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems harbour zooplankton that fills as a significant
   part of the food chain of water bodies. Tragically, these ecosystems and
   diversity therein are compromised by a lot environmental pressure and
   pollution. An investigation was led from January 2018 to December 2019
   to examine variation in zooplankton with the physicochemical profiles of
   Katira pond and Surya Mandir pond, Arrah keeping standard methods.
   Observations showed that during summer season water temperature, total
   alkalinity, hardness and chloride were observed more during summer
   season followed by the rainy , post-rainy and rainy season but a reverse
   pattern was observed for pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. The
   water temperature demonstrated a positive relationship with total
   alkalinity, hardness and chloride whereas a negative correlation with
   pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. 43 genera of zooplankton
   together with 15 rotifers, 10 protozoa, 9 cladocerans, 6 copepods and 3
   ostracods were related to a numerical density from 1 to 538unit/L. The
   density of zooplankton was more distinguished throughout the colder time
   followed by summer, pre-rainy and rainy seasons. Zooplankton density
   showed a positive relationship with pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and
   sulfate however a negative relationship with water temperature,
   chloride, total alkalinity and hardness. Statistical analysis inferred
   critical contrasts in the spatial variation over physicochemical
   parameters (excluding nitrate), zooplankton groupings and biodiversity
   indices (excluding Simpson index). The observed estimates of the
   Shannon-Weiner index, Margalef Richness Index, Pielou's Evenness Index
   and Simpson index showed moderate to high diversity of zooplankton and
   moderately polluted conditions of these ponds.},

Abstract = {The wetland has a unique role in the ecosystem and for the society. The
   paper discusses about the only Ramsar site in Assam, India; known as
   ``Deeper Beer. In November 2002, Deepor Beel was included in Ramsar list
   which calls for active steps from the government for the protection and
   enrichment of the Deeper Beel. It has attracted large number of
   ecologists, environmentalist, tourist and nature lovers due to its
   unique ecosystem services which harbours large number of migratory birds
   from all around the world. The wetland is a permanent fresh water lake
   and largest wetland in Brahmaputra valley of Lower Assam. Besides being
   Ramsar Site, ``Deeper Beel{''} is also a wildlife sanctuary where along
   with residential bird species, we will find Asian Elephants and many
   migratory birds congregate each year. A ``Beer refers to lake-like
   wetland with stagnant water in the Ganges-Brahmaputra flood plains in
   the Eastern Indian states of Assam and West Bengal. The meaning of the
   term owes its origin from the words meaning ``pond{''} and ``lake{''} in
   both Bengali and Assamese languages. The paper focus on both central and
   state government policies and programmes towards conservation of the
   wetland; and study how far the Ramsar Convention is implemented at the
   local level in the line of Fourth Ramsar Strategic Plan 2016-2024.},

Pages = {105-111},
Abstract = {In temperate villages of Uttarakhand, the Oak wood particularly Quercus
   leucotrichophora is preferred as fuel wood because Oaks have high
   intensity, hardness, rough bark and durability for fuel. Villagers of
   Dwarahat region of Kumaun Himalaya collect wooden logs from surrounding
   forests and use for many purposes for their day to day life. Five tree
   species viz., Quercus leucotrichophora Pinus roxburghii, Lyonia
   ovalifolia, Myrica esculenta and Rhododendron arboreum were found in the
   head loads. The wooden logs of these species are studded with different
   lichens such as Parmotrema, Everniastrum, Usnea and crustose forms.
   Lichens from 18 head loads of fuel wood were separated as foliose,
   fruticose and miscellaneous, and their dry weight was measured in the
   laboratory. It was estimated that an average of 0.390 +/- 0.174 g
   lichens is burnt with about 30.8 +/- 11.9 kg head load of mixed fuel
   wood in the study area. Total lichen biomass burnt on fuelwood was
   estimated between 204.8 +/- 16.2 g year(-1) to 491.4 +/- 41.7 g year(-1)
   from six villages of Dwarahat region. The commercially useful lichens
   are being frequently burnt on fuel wood in the study area without
   expecting the threat they are facing. There is a need to conserve these
   economically potential lichens or else these lichens may be extinct due
   to such man-made activities in the future. Some important suggestions
   for conservation of these lichens have been provided in the present
   study.},

Title = {Responses of Shorebirds to Human Disturbance at Exposed Sandy Beaches of
   North-Eastern Algeria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {Throughout this study we present the results of an expert opinion survey
   on flight initiation distance (FID) estimates for the three beachiest
   shorebirds species (Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, Black-headed
   Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus, Audouin's Gull Ichthyaetus audouinii)
   when overwintering at exposed sandy beaches Annaba Bay, north-eastern
   Algeria. Our final data set contained 336 flushing events of the three
   shorebird species, FIDs for both species ranged from 11 m up to 151m.
   The univariate analysis of variance indicates that the studied Gulls
   behave similarly against human disturbance, since that mean FIDs were
   not varied significantly between species (F2= 0.24, P = 0.78). In
   contrast, change in escape behavior of our sampled species was found to
   be significant (F2=20.54, P<0.05) across the three coastal sites that
   were under varying human pressures (High, moderate, and low). In fact,
   individuals reduced their FIDs when anthropogenic levels increased.
   Additionally, using a regression analysis, the relationship between
   starting distance (SD), flock size and FIDs was confirmed (SD: r=0.9,
   F=176.52, P<0.005; Flock size: r=0.68, df=1, F=30.9, P<0.005), the
   obtained positive correlations (indicate that escape behavior of our
   birds increases with the starting approaching humans distance, and with
   flock size. Producing information of the extent and circumstances under
   which birds may habituate to stresses are an evidence-base which can be
   used by regulatory authorities to start appropriate site-specific
   assessments for anthropogenic marine activities with regard to the
   sensitivity or habituation of seabirds to such activities.},

Title = {Modis Derived Vegetation and Aridity Indices Account for Spatial
   Variation in Desertification Risk Index in Dry Environment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {It was estimated annually that several thousands of hectares (ha) of
   land has been lost to desertification and the negative impacts are
   manifested on the environment and general livelihood of people; reduced
   capacity to provide for the basic needs such as food and water. Although
   this is true of many countries in Sub Sahara Africa, yet the spatial
   pattern of the level of desertification and the areas at risk has not
   been sufficiently quantified and mapped. This study is aimed at
   determining and mapping the spatial extent of desertification risk index
   in the 9 frontline states of Northern Nigeria and to identify areas and
   population that are at risk given the current condition to enhance
   mitigation and adaptation strategy plan. We used both aridity and
   vegetation indices in combination with elevation and urban/settlement
   population data to determine and mapped the risk of desertification in
   the nine frontline states. To obtain aridity index we used De Martonne
   aridity index (lar-DM) equation; this was calculated from the raster
   layers of mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation
   (TAP) using map algebra. To monitor vegetation conditions we used eMODIS
   NDVI 10-day maximum-value composite MVC NDVI images at 250m spatial
   resolution. We created desertification risk index map from spatial
   overlay of NDVI/vegetation cover, elevation, population and aridity
   index. The study shows that aridity in the study area increases
   northward in curvilinear pattern as 75 \% (430,650 km(2)) of the region
   falls into three aridity categories: arid, semi-arid and dry sub humid
   while the remaining 25\% (33,000 km(2)) found in southern Kebbi,
   Zamfara, Katsina and Bauchi falls under sub humid. Aridity index as
   proximate of the desertification was however found to be inadequate as
   the combination of vegetation index produced desertification risk index
   (DRI) map which has helped to identify ``hot spot{''} these are places
   where risks to desertification are higher than their surrounding areas.
   Suggestions such as sound land management, energy substitution strategy
   are made to combat the menace of desertification with special attention
   placed on these highly vulnerable ``hot spot{''} areas.},

Abstract = {Land degradation is related to biophysical conditions and human factors
   influencing the potential for local development. The present study
   investigates long-term trends in selected socioeconomic variables that
   contribute to reduce land quality in an agricultural district exposed to

   is representative of landscape transformations leading to fragmentation
   of the complex land-use mosaic. Taken as a powerful driver of land
   degradation reflecting both long-term and short-term landscape
   transformations, population dynamics in the study area were reconnected
   with local development paths and environmental quality trends. A fine
   tuning of developmental policies with measures addressing land
   conservation is necessary to assure long-term sustainability of
   intensively farmed districts.},

   were collected using light traps, of which 1033 individuals belonging to
   33 spp. and four families were scanned for presence of pollen grains on
   their body parts and slides were prepared for those pollens. The study
   revealed the presence of pollen grains on 149 individuals belonging to
   six spp. of Noctuidae family for plants belonging to seven families
   taken. Also, that among moth spp. of the area, Thysanoplusia orichalcea
   was found to be the most frequent flower visitor followed by Acontia
   lucida and Chrysodeixis chalcites. Though, the present study was
   preliminary, the overall findings were highly encouraging as the study
   established possible role of moths in `pollination network' for plants

Abstract = {To infer the diet and cultural behaviours of Islamic communities during
   the medieval period in Portugal, 43 adult skeletons (13 females, 27
   males, and 3 individuals of undetermined sex) from the medieval Islamic
   necropolis of Santarem were analysed. A total of 779 teeth were
   macroscopically observed to score dental wear and dental alterations as
   enamel chipping, notching, transversal grooves observed on the
   mesiodistal occlusal surfaces (TGMOS), and lingual surface attrition of
   the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT). Occlusal wear was moderate.
   Chipping was recorded in 13.08\% (98/749) teeth from 28 individuals, and
   notching affected 3.87\% (29/749) belonging to 17 individuals. Five
   subjects have transverse grooves, observed on the mesiodistal occlusal
   surfaces in 3\% (23/750) of the teeth. LSAMAT was observed in 41.25\%
   (66/160) of the anterior upper teeth belonging to 20 individuals.
   Combinations of different alterations were investigated:
   LSAMAT-chipping, LSAMAT-TGMOS, and LSAMAT-chipping-TGMOS. These could be
   related to hard food, extra-masticatory behaviours, chewing unknown
   substances, or trauma.},

   nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, heavy metals, ammonia
   nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and germination index (GI). The mixture of
   horse manure and leaf can achieve high composting temperature, long
   retention time of high temperature (55 degrees C), fast organic matter
   degradation, and high GI under the same aeration pattern. Under the same
   composting materials, the intermittent aeration pattern during
   composting was superior to the continuous aeration pattern because the
   former promoted the composting process.},

Abstract = {As a by-product of municipal sewage treatment, sewage sludge must be
   properly treated to avoid secondary pollution to the environment.
   Aerobic composting is one of the mainstream technologies in sludge
   treatment, but nitrogen loss in composting process usually reaches more
   than 40\%, which seriously reduces the fertilizer efficiency of
   composting products, and at the same time, a large amount of odor will
   cause harm to the environment. In this article, the nitrogen emission
   and nitrogen loss were reduced by adding sawdust of different
   proportions in the sludge composting process, and the nitrogen emission
   and nitrogen loss were reduced by up to 70\% and 30\% respectively. The
   addition of sawdust can significantly increase the sludge composting
   temperature and duration of high temperature period, reduce the sludge
   pH and water content, increase the mineralization rate of organic
   matter, thereby inhibiting the nitrogen loss. The results showed that
   nitrogen loss decreased with the increase of sawdust ratio, and A30 was
   the best ratio. The process has the advantages of simple operation, low
   cost and good nitrogen holding effect.},

Abstract = {Degradation rate of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a compostable plastic, is
   affected by its physical properties and environmental conditions. Since
   PLA with different physical properties enter composting systems,
   investigation of degradation of PLA with strong physical properties in
   compost at different temperatures and its influence on compost fungal
   community structure are the main concerns of this study. To determine
   the effect of slow PLA degradation on fungal communities, PLA granules
   with high degree of crystallinity, 60\%, were incubated in compost at 25
   degrees C and 50 degrees C for 4 months at 0, 10, 25 and 50\% (w/w)
   concentrations; their degradation rates were compared and impact of PLA
   degradation on compost fungal communities was examined by terminal
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). PLA granules in
   compost at 25 degrees C showed no physical changes but at 50 degrees C
   physical disintegration occurred after 4 months. TRFLP revealed that
   fungal community profiles in compost were affected by PLA, particularly
   at 50 degrees C where PLA degraded. Compost fungal communities in the
   presence of PLA at 50 degrees C had more variation, 63\%, than at 25

   during 2nd month, community structure changed specifically at 50 degrees
   C and at 50\% (w/w) PLA, however, became similar to that in the absence
   of PLA at the end of 4th month at both temperatures indicating PLA with
   a high degree of crystallinity causes a temporal perturbation in compost

   of certain TRFs representing fungal populations increased to 30\% which

Abstract = {Bacterial species of the genus Acidithiobacillus have been proved to
   reduce soil salinity, but their chemical impact on a saline compost has
   not been reported. This work is aimed to evaluate the effects of A.
   thiooxidans on the chemical properties of a saline compost formulation.
   When added to a microcosm under nonsterile conditions, a
   sulfur-supplemented A. thiooxidans inoculum lowered pH to 7.16, reduced
   exchangeable sodium levels to 97 cmol kg(-1), and increased electrical
   conductivity to 7.93 dS m(-1) after 720 h. No differences in bacterial
   fingerprint were observed after adding A. thiooxidans, either
   supplemented with sulfur or not. These results suggest that inoculating
   saline composts with sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strains of the genus
   Acidithiobacillus could help to decrease salinity-associated parameters,
   and it has the potential of reducing the impact of prolonged application
   of organic fertilizers on the soil. Additionally, it could be a valuable
   tool to remediate high-salinity soils.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at measuring the effect of vermicompost on soil
   physical and chemical properties and runoff quality and quantity in
   agro-ecosystems in Northern Iran. Thus, runoff measurement plots of 1 x
   5 m were set up in sloping lands under natural rainfall during 5 months.
   Runoff quality and quantity, soil properties, and plant growth were
   measured. This study shows that the amount of runoff water and its
   quality (sediment yields, nitrate content, pH, and conductivity) were
   not influenced by the fertilization treatments (vermicompost alone,
   chemical fertilization alone, or their mixture), except for the first
   month of the experiment where a lower runoff amount was measured when
   vermicompost was applied alone. Although no difference in plant growth
   was found, our results showed a significant improvement of soil
   properties when vermicompost was used as a fertilizer. Consequently,
   this study shows that vermicompost can be considered as an alternative
   application for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and improving
   soil properties but its impact on plant growth and runoff is limited to
   the short term.},

Abstract = {The long-term changes in the contents of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb)
   in the food and liver of four shrew species of the g. Sorex, in the
   vicinity of the the Middle Ural Copper Smelter (MUCS) during periods of
   its high (1990-1997), reduced (1998-2009), and almost ceased (2010-2019)
   emissions. The minimum concentrations of all elements in the animal
   organism were noted in unpolluted areas (background zone), the maximum
   concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cd were in the immediate vicinity of the
   plant (impact zone), Cd-at moderate pollution (buffer zone). The species
   specificity of the accumulation of the considered elements in the liver
   was determined by the composition of diets and was expressed in
   increased accumulation of Cu and Cd in the liver of S. araneus and
   increased accumulation of Pb in the liver of S. caecutiens. A multiple
   reduction in industrial emissions did not lead to an equivalent decrease
   in the content of heavy metals (HMs) either in the feed or in the body
   of shrews. Over 30 years, directed changes in HM concentrations in the
   liver were noted only in S. caecutiens: in the impact zone (1-3 km from
   the plant), the content of Zn did not change, the concentrations of Cd
   and Pb decreased by 1.2-1.5 times, while the concentration of Cu, on the
   contrary, increased by 1.5 times. In the buffer zone (4-10 km) Cu, Zn,
   and Pb concentrations remain unchanged, while the concentrations of Cd
   decreased by 1.5 times; in the background area (20-34 km), the content
   of essential elements (Cu, Zn) was maintained at the same level, while
   the concentration of toxic elements (Cd and Pb) decreased by 4-5 times.},

   immature narrow-skulled voles trapped in different zones of Karasuk

Abstract = {The rehabilitation of polluted sites requires knowledge of the responses
   of the keystone species to contaminated soils and to co-occurring
   environmental stressors, such as climate variations and herbivory. To
   obtain this knowledge, we monitored the performance of young European
   aspen (Populus tremula) trees growing naturally at sites 1.8 to 64.5 km
   from the Monchegorsk copper-nickel smelter in north-western Russia from
   2001-2005. Copper and nickel concentrations near the smelter were 25-30
   times higher than the regional background. The radial and vertical
   increments, leaf size, fluctuating asymmetry and insect herbivory did
   not change along the pollution gradient. Leaf fluctuating asymmetry
   positively correlated with the site-specific radial increment.
   Among-year variations in weather conditions did not interact with
   spatial patterns in aspen performance. Lack of detrimental effects of
   extreme pollution on any of the studied traits indicates a high
   tolerance of European aspen to the harsh environmental conditions of
   industrial barrens. This tolerance makes aspen a suitable species for
   rehabilitation of areas with extreme levels of soil contamination by
   copper, nickel and other metals. The fast-growing aspens established in
   heavily polluted sites may facilitate natural recovery of plant
   communities by sheltering dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings and by
   producing litter that improves soil quality.},

Abstract = {Fire is a natural part in the semiarid zone of central Argentina
   (Caldenal). Historically, it had an important ecological role in this
   ecosystem on the species composition, vegetation structure and
   vegetation dynamics. Fire frequency decreased in the past 100 years as
   consequence of fine-fuel removal by domestic livestock grazing and
   active fire suppression. If intermittent fires do not occur the
   rangelands will be converted to savannas, shrublands or woodlands. The
   aim of this review was to explain the ecological role of fire in the
   southern Caldenal rangelands, the woody and grass species response to
   fire, and to discuss the effect of post-fire defoliation on forage grass
   species. Controlled fire could be used as a management tool for to reset
   the ecological balance among grass and woody species in the region.
   After controlled fire, for the recovery of desirable perennial grasses
   the burned rangelands may should not be grazed for at least one year.
   However, there is the need for further research to understand the
   effects of the controlled fire on soil seed bank, soil chemical,
   physical, and biotic properties, and use of controlled fire combined
   with other of woody species control strategies to prescribe sound and
   generalized management policies.},

Title = {The Seasonal Distribution and Migrations of Bearded Seals, Erignathus

Abstract = {The life cycle and distribution of the bearded seal (Erignathus
   barbatus) are closely related to fluctuations of the ice edge during the
   year. The Sea of Okhotsk is a seasonally freezing water area, which is
   completely ice free in summer. This determines the annual cycle of the
   bearded seal and makes it unique compared to populations from other
   parts of the geographic range. Using satellite telemetry, the main
   seasonal habitats and migration patterns of the bearded seals have been
   studied in the Sea of Okhotsk. Seals use different areas during the
   ice-free and iced periods; they perform targeted long-distance migration
   in between these times. During the ice-free period, all bearded seals
   used the shallowest part of the Sakhalin Gulf. In the ice period,
   animals are distributed widely in the water area; they use offshore part
   of the Sakhalin Gulf, the northern and eastern coasts of Sakhalin
   Island. The timing of the formation of the ice cover has the largest
   affect on the dates and direction of seasonal migrations seals. The
   choice of seasonal habitats by the bearded seals is determined by the
   smallest available depths throughout the year and by the ice cover in
   the winter-spring period.},

Title = {Distribution of Tracheid Lumen Areas within Annual Rings at Different

Abstract = {In the north-taiga larch forests of Siberia, on permafrost, there is a
   widespread phenomenon of crown dieback. To reveal the factors causing
   crown dieback, we have studied the structure of water-conducting system
   in the stems of stag-headed and healthy trees of Gmelin larch (Larix
   gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr.). The analysis of distributions of early
   (water-conducting) tracheids with respect to the radial lumen diameter
   at different heights within stems has shown that radial lumen diameters
   of the most of tracheids decrease along with stem height in all of the
   studied trees, both healthy and stag-headed; in stag-headed trees, this
   value was significantly lower than in healthy trees at all heights. The
   findings confirm the following hypothesis: in the permafrost zone, trees
   can suffer from water stress, which causes crown dieback in the trees
   more susceptible to such stress. The high heterogeneity of hydrothermal
   soil conditions is considered as the main factor determining the
   differentiation of trees with respect to water stress susceptibility.},

Abstract = {After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, an
   increased frequency of cancellation of the apical dominance has been
   revealed in young pine trees. The detected morphoses are most likely to
   result from radiation damage to the apical meristems of the conifers and
   also from changes in their phytohormonal status. To test this
   hypothesis, we have checked Japanese red pine populations from areas
   contaminated with radionuclides after the Fukushima accident for the
   frequency of morphoses related to cancellation of the apical dominance
   and estimated the content of main phytohormone classes: indoleacetic
   acid (IAA), indolylbutyric acid (IBA), zeatin, gibberellic acid (GA),
   and abscisic acid (ABA). The concentrations of phytohormones in the
   needles of young trees (5-8 years) were determined by high performance
   liquid chromatography. It has been shown for the first time that chronic
   radiation exposure changes the ratio of the main phytohormone classes in
   the needles of Japanese red pine: the concentrations of IAA, zeatin, and
   ABA increase, while the concentrations of GA decreases. The results have
   allowed us to explain the phenomenon of the increased frequency of
   cancellation of the apical dominance in the populations of young conifer
   trees from the zone of the Fukushima accident.},

Abstract = {We surveyed the vegetation in Deogyusan National Park (conservation
   areas) and surrounding areas outside the park (Mt. Juksang, Mt. Johang
   and Mt. Bonghwa). We calculated plant community indices and diversity
   indices; these identified properties of the surrounding areas that are
   relevant to conservation efforts in the park. We compared the
   diversities of plant communities and plant species between areas using
   field and quadrat surveys to assign the identities of plant communities
   to an existing un-delineated preliminary vegetation map produced from
   aerial photographs. We identified 19 associations. The covers of
   dominant species in all tree and herb layers were markedly higher in the
   conservation areas than in the peripheral zone. Mean richness (based on
   plant community richness and species richness indices) was significantly
   higher in the conservation area, but mean values of community dominance,
   diversity, and evenness and the Simpson, Shannon diversity, and evenness
   indices in the surrounding area were significantly higher than those in
   the conservation area. Ordination by detrended canonical correspondence
   analyses showed that elevation and slope explained the distributions of
   quadrats in the Cartesian space of the ordination. The cover of dominant
   species in the tree, herb, and sub-tree layers and species numbers in
   quadrats explained the variation in species compositions within the
   quadrats. Our results demonstrate that disturbances in the areas
   surrounding a park can have increasing impacts on plant community and
   diversity indices. Hence, the preservation and management of surrounding
   areas are essential conservation elements for protecting whole national
   park areas.},

Abstract = {Interspecific competition is an important mechanism of ecological
   community construction, which potentially contributes to resource
   differentiation and promotes the coexistence of sympatric species.
   Determining the food composition and resource differentiation of the
   whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) and tundra swans (C. columbianus), can
   facilitate efforts to protect them. In this study, fecal microscopic
   analysis was conducted to analyze the feeding habits of whooper swans
   and tundra swans migrating to the Baotou Yellow River Wetland from
   February to May 2020; their food niche width and overlap were
   calculated, and the following results were obtained. The whooper swan's
   diet consisted of nine species from four families of plants, mainly corn
   (Zea mays), reed (Phragmites australis), and halophytes (Suaeda glauca).
   The diet of the tundra swan comprised eleven species from five families
   of plants, mainly corn, quinoa (Chenopodium album) and millet (Panicum
   miliaceum). The food niche widths of the whooper swan and tundra swan in
   the Yellow River Wetland in Baotou were 2.75 and 5.18, respectively.
   There were five main species of food plants in total, and the index of
   niche overlap was 0.65. The food diversity of the tundra swan was
   greater than that of the whooper swan, indicating that the Yellow River
   wetland provides relatively diverse food resources for the tundra swans
   and whooper swans, thereby reducing competition and facilitating
   coexistence.},

Abstract = {Changes in the state of herb-dwarf shrub layer near forest boundaries
   (the edge effect) were evaluated in anthropogenically fragmented
   southern taiga pine forests of the Middle Urals. Studies were performed
   in suburban forests of the Yekaterinburg urban agglomeration on 14
   transects perpendicular to the forest edge that extended from it to the
   inner forest. The transects were 110-260 m long, each consisting of a
   series of six to nine 400-m(2) plots. An increase of species richness in
   the edge zones of suburban forests was observed for almost all plant
   groups of the herb-dwarf shrub layer, except for spore plants. The edge
   effect was expressed most strongly in nonforest, alien, and annual or
   biennial species. The total projective cover of the herb-dwarf shrub
   layer increased from the edge to the inner forest zone, while species
   diversity estimated by the Shannon index remained unchanged. A
   non-threshold edge effect was observed for some parameters; i.e., their
   values monotonically increased or decreased over the entire transect
   length. In parameters where the depth of edge effect was possible to
   estimate, it varied from 13 to 64 m, averaging 41 m. In general, the
   edge effect on the herb- dwarf shrub layer in suburban forests was
   expressed to the same extent as in urbanized forests.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems of high-mountain and high-latitude regions are especially
   sensitive to changes in climate conditions. A considerable part of
   recent publications on climatogenic transformation of plant communities
   deal with the dynamics of the upper treeline, while similar studies on
   shrub vegetation are scarce. Our study on the age structure of Siberian
   juniper (Juniperus sibirica Burgsd.) thickets in the Northern Urals (the
   Chuvalsky Kamen Range) has shown that the upper shrubline has shifted up
   the altitudinal gradient. The establishment of J. sibirica in windblown
   areas with little snow at the summits of slopes began as late as the
   second half of the 20th century and has gained momentum after the 1970s.
   An analysis of climatic data has revealed a linear trend toward increase
   in the magnitude of anomalies in average air temperature over the cold
   season (November-March) by 1.69 degrees C/100 years (R-2 = 0.57), with
   precipitation increasing by 67.3 mm/100 years (R-2 = 0.43). The results
   of correlation analysis between the establishment of J. sibirica and
   average precipitation by 5-year periods show that the strongest
   correlations occur in areas with little snow at the early cold season
   (November-January; R = 0.96). Changes in the pattern of snow
   accumulation in winter could facilitate the current expansion of J.
   sibirica to the mountain tundras of the Northern Urals.},

Abstract = {Studies in the fir-spruce forests of the Middle Urals, in habitats with

   communities determine the food supply of shrew habitats, one of the most
   important microhabitat characteristics. The indicator of food supply
   reflects the state of the foraging base of the common shrew and is a
   stable biotopic characteristic, the stability of which is maintained due
   to the redistribution of the abundance of different taxonomic groups of
   soil mesofauna in the course of their long-term dynamics. The abundance
   of the common shrew was not related to the food supply of the habitats
   of the current year, but depended on the food supply of the previous
   year, and this dependence was most pronounced in strongly disturbed
   habitats.},

   Spontaneous change in the pattern of dynamics observed in our previous

   the possibility to estimate the influence of different factors on the
   Chitty effect (increase in body size at high population numbers) under
   different regimes. This effect was clearly manifested in the bank vole
   population with cyclic dynamics: the average body weight and length of
   the animals were greater at the phases of population growth and peak
   than at the trough (low) phase, while the same parameters of voles from
   the noncyclic regime had intermediate values. The body size of animals
   depends not so much on population density as on factors determining
   their physiological status (including reproductive status).},

Abstract = {We assessed the soil moisture in urbanized habitats dominated by alien
   (invasive) for Eurasia tree species Acer negundo. We supposed that the
   soil water content under the dense canopy of A. negundo is increased
   compared with the soil water content under other tree species. Sample
   plots in urbanized habitats in the city of Yekaterinburg (Middle Urals,
   Russia) were combined into paired blocks: with the dominance of A.
   negundo or the dominance of other tree species. The conditions in each
   block were as similar as possible, except for the dominant tree species.
   In 2019-2021, 170 records of the soil water content of the upper 5 cm of
   soil, 85 records each in habitats dominated by A. negundo or other tree
   species, were performed. The average soil water content in habitats
   invaded by A. negundo (20.0 +/- 0.9\%) was slightly but significantly
   higher than in habitats dominated by other tree species (18.1 +/-
   0.8\%). The differences were close during the three growing seasons.
   Also, the differences in soil moisture between habitats dominated by A.
   negundo and other tree species were stable when taking into account the
   peculiarities of weather conditions and the sample plots altitude. Thus,
   A. negundo is a transforming species with respect to the moisture regime

Title = {Structure and Stock of Phytomass as Indicators of the Stage of

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Thefollowing empirical conclusions have been statistically verified:
   each stage of succession has a definite duration; during succession, the
   stock of above-ground and underground phytomass decrease and increase,
   respectively; however, at the terminal stages, the stock of underground
   phytomass is considerably less compared to virgin steppes. The work was
   based on 54 samples of phytomass from fallow land communities and virgin
   steppes; they were taken in the period from 1994 to 2020 in the four
   steppe intermontane basins of Tyva. Quantitative characteristics of the
   reserves of live above-ground, dead above- and underground phytomass at
   each stage of demutation of Tyva fallow lands have been obtained for the
   first time. The stages of demutation of fallow lands in Tyva are
   substantially different in the stock of either above-ground or
   underground phytomass. Significant differences in the age of fallow
   lands were shown only between the initial (stages 1 and 2) and terminal
   (stages 3 and 4) stages of demutation. It has been confirmed that the
   underground phytomass of virgin steppes is higher compared to
   communities of the terminal stages of fallow succession.},

Title = {Sustainable Bioremediation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soils:
   Opportunities for Symbiosis with Organic Waste Management?},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {463-469},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Bioremediation using microorganisms to remediate petroleum hydrocarbon
   contaminated soils is considered as a sustainable approach to cleaning
   polluted sites. One element of the sustainability is providing nutrients
   (biostimulation) for degrading microbial populations by using organic
   wastes such as animal manures rather than conventionally produced
   mineral fertilisers. Waste management practices are increasingly
   concerned with resource recovery considering organic wastes as being
   valuable resources in the context of a more circular economy. Greater
   attention should be given to the potential benefits of managing organic
   wastes in a symbiotic approach alongside bioremediation of contaminated
   soils. However, organic nutrients such as animal manures often contain
   antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria and genes for antimicrobial
   resistances. Co-selection pressures from pollutants such as heavy metals
   and hydrocarbons may lead to pre-existing adaptations in microbial
   communities living in contaminated soils. The potential risks to human
   health from increasing the diversity and abundance of antibiotic
   resistant strains arising from contaminated soils requires further
   investigation. This review examines some of the opportunities and
   barriers that exist for symbiosis between the management of organic
   wastes and bioremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils.},

Abstract = {Northern and tundra forest ecosystems are especially vulnerable to
   climate impact because of their high sensitivity to changes in
   temperature. An important issue is how the growth and productivity of
   the main forest-forming species in the permafrost zone of Siberia are
   changing under conditions of current climate change. In this study, the
   Vaganov-Shashkin imitation model of tree growth (the VS-model) has been
   used to estimate the effect of climatic factors on the growth of
   Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) in northeastern Yakutia and
   Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr. (Rupr.) in the east of Taimyr) with
   a 1-day time resolution and to determine the extent to which the
   interaction of climatic parameters (temperature/precipitation) and
   physiological processes is reflected in the width and anatomical
   structure of tree rings. Despite the location of the study sites in
   northern regions with harsh conditions, where temperature is the main
   limiting factor, we have managed to identify the days of the growing
   season on which soil moisture had a greater impact on the growth of
   trees than air temperature.},

Abstract = {Climate change entails shifts in the ranges of woody plants along both

   this study, dendrochronological and GIS technologies have been used to

   the Eastern Sayan Mountains. The results show that upward expansion
   along the altitudinal gradient and increase in projective cover against
   the background of climate warming reach a maximum in shrubs (Betula
   spp., Salix spp.); then follow Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.),
   Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour), and Siberian fir (Abies
   sibirica Ledeb). The abundance of P. sibirica undergrowth in the
   mountain forest-tundra ecotone has increased, which is due to a rise in
   May-August air temperatures (r = 0.97). In zones with sufficient
   moisture supply (high mountains), warming stimulates radial growth of
   trees and shrubs and promotes their expansion to the mountain
   forest-tundra.},

Abstract = {Thepurpose of this study was to ascertain the stocks of coarse woody
   debris (CWD) in bilberry pine forests in the southern part of the
   Republic of Karelia (the middle taiga subzone) and evaluate age-related
   changes in CWD abundance, stocks, and structure and reveal patterns in
   their dynamics. Analysis of data from 160 sample plots has shown that
   the amount of CWD decreases with age: on average, from 1525 (SE +/- 12)
   pcs/ha in young stands to 805 (SE +/- 13) pcs/ha in premature ones and
   507 (SE +/- 7) pcs/ha in overmature stands. On the contrary, the stocks
   of wood detritus increase from 21 (SE +/- 2.6) m(3)/ha in young stands
   to 32 (SE +/- 2.9) m(3)/ha in premature stands and 69 (SE +/- 6.8)
   m(3)/ha in overmature stands. CWD stocks differ in the composition of
   components: with respect to the number of trunks, standing deadwood
   prevails in young and middle-aged stands, with the proportion of downed
   deadwood gradually increasing over time; with respect to the stock,
   downed deadwood prevails in all age groups except middle-aged stands.
   The degree of CWD decay gradually increases with stand aging.},

Abstract = {Responses to contamination of several soil types with crude oil were
   comparatively analyzed in organisms of different trophic groups. Samples
   of soddy podzolic, light gray, soddy calcareous, dark gray, and
   floodplain soils were supplemented with oil in concentration ranges of
   1-5 and 100-300 g/kg and tested in the laboratory for the effect on
   heterotrophic soil bacteria and higher plants (Lepidium sativum,
   Triticum aestivum, Picea obovata, and Pinus sylvestris). In addition,
   water extracts from oil-contaminated soils were tested for the effect on
   Chlorella vulgaris and Daphnia magna. It was found that agricultural
   plants Lepidium sativum and Triticum aestivum were more tolerant of
   low-dose oil contamination (1-5 g/kg soil), compared to seedlings of the
   taiga tree species Picea obovata. The abundance of heterotrophic
   bacteria increased in soils treated with low oil concentrations (up to 5
   g/kg) and decreased when oil concentration reached 100-300 g/kg soil.
   The entire range of tested oil concentrations caused reduction in the
   morphological diversity of heterotrophic soil bacteria. Experiments with
   water extracts from oil-contaminated soils showed that toxicity test
   with Daphnia magna was insufficiently sensitive and that the response of
   Chlorella vulgaris microalgae to soil contamination with oil was
   ambiguous. The floodplain soil proved to be most tolerant to oil
   contamination, while soddy calcareous and light gray soils were most
   vulnerable.},

Abstract = {The development of the ecosystem of Lake Kezenoi-Am (Kezenoyam) for the
   last 100 years is described on the basis of published and original data.
   The ecosystem of the lake has undergone a catastrophic transformation as
   a result of an outbreak of the chub population in the late 20th and
   early 21st centuries and introduction of European perch in 2012-2014.
   Enormous overfishing was an additional factor in the ecosystem
   degradation. The endemic subspecies of brown trout has probably
   completely disappeared from the lake. In order to preserve and restore
   the population of Kezenoi-Am brown trout, it is necessary to take urgent
   measures, including its artificial breeding and reclamation measures to
   reduce the number of chub and perch.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that Acer negundo,
   an alien (invasive) tree species in Eurasia, has allelopathic activity.
   Using the method of roll culture, two experiments were performed to
   estimate the effect of water extracts from summer (green) and autumn
   (colored) leaves of A. negundo, compared to native woody species Sorbus
   aucuparia, Prunus padus, and Salix caprea, on the early development of
   Festuca rubra, Sinapis alba, and Trifolium repens. The results failed to
   prove conclusively that A. negundo leaf extract affects the early
   development of test plants: its effect was similarly strong as those of
   extracts from the leaves of native P. padus and S. caprea, while the
   leaf extract of the native shrub S. aucuparia proved to have a distinct
   inhibitory effect. On the whole, no evidence was obtained that
   allelopathic influences of compounds leached from A. negundo leaves may
   be the actual mechanism accounting for the ecological success of this
   species in its secondary range.},

Abstract = {The long-term dynamics of beta-diversity of small mammal (SM)
   communities in the vicinity of a large copper smelter has been analyzed
   during the periods of high (1990-1997), reduced (1998-2009), and almost
   terminated emissions (2010-2020). The results show that the
   beta-diversity of communities increases as the smelter is approached,
   with the level of pollution playing a key role in the formation of
   community structure (up to 25\%). Throughout the 30-year observation
   period, the background communities have been less variable than the
   buffer and impact communities; i.e., the more unstable the environment,
   the higher the community variability. Structural rearrangements in the
   impact and buffer communities in the period of emission reduction have
   resulted in the progressive divergence between the communities of
   background and polluted areas.},

Abstract = {Soil respiration modeling (i.e., simulation of carbon dioxide emissions
   from the soil surface) makes it possible to analyze and forecast changes
   in the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Along with classical
   regression models, researchers currently use machine learning methods
   based on neural networks or regression tree ensembles. However, models
   produced using these methods are often used as `black boxes', which
   hinders the analysis of process mechanisms. This paper demonstrates
   capabilities of the Random Forest algorithm that can be successfully
   used to estimate effects exercised by various factors on soil
   respiration based on features importance measurements. Using variance
   separation, predictors have been classified either as spatial (biotope
   type, soil type, vegetation type, and soil moisture content) or temporal
   (soil and air temperature, NDVI, LAI, FPAR, and SPEI). Several models
   were produced based on 5670 respiration measurements performed during
   five growing seasons (2012-2016) on 30 sampling plots in south-taiga
   pine forests and meadows that feature different vegetation and soil
   types but are confined to the same small area. Different models include
   different sets of predictors (all predictors, temporal predictors only,
   spatial predictors only, and temperature and humidity only), and their
   accuracy reaches R-2 = 0.88 (MSE = 0.47). It is established that soil
   respiration depends primarily on temporal factors whose importance
   ranges from 76 to 91\%. In forests, the effect of spatial factors on
   respiration is stronger than in meadows.},

Abstract = {The temporal dynamics of species diversity and projective coverage of
   herbaceous communities formed on fallows and dumps was studied. Annual
   studies of these phytocoenotic indicators were carried out in four
   groups on the territory of the Tagil zone of the Middle Urals in
   2006-2019. The successional development of communities depends on
   edaphic factors. Phytocenoses with a projective coverage and species
   diversity typical for meadow communities on the background territories
   develop on agrozems and technozems under conditions of low soil
   contamination with heavy metals. The meadow stage under conditions of
   high pollution is short, and it is characterized by low values of the
   studied parameters. Other trajectories of succession: a long delay in
   the grass stage or skipping the meadow stage and transition from grass
   to tree-shrub stage, are also possible. The species diversity of
   communities is more conservative compared with the total projective
   coverage of species, the rate of development of which is largely
   determined by the successional age of the community than by the type of
   substrate.},

Abstract = {The motility of epididymal sperm cells in two closely related rodent
   species, bank vole (Clethrio-nomys glareolus,n = 71) and northern
   red-backed vole (Cl. rutilus,n = 52), from the vicinities of two copper
   smelters in the Middle Urals was studied with regard to the functional
   group of animals (mature young of the year and overwintered
   individuals). The proportion of motile cells (Motile) and parameters of
   their motility (VCL, VSL, VAP, ALH, BCF, STR, LIN) were determined using
   the MouseTraxx computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system (Hamilton
   Thorne, United States). These parameters proved to be species-specific:
   sperm velocity (VCL, VSL, VAP) and linearity of movement (LIN) in Cl.
   glareolus were higher, while head beat cross frequency (BCF) was lower
   than in Cl. rutilus. Sperm motility in both species showed no dependence
   on sampling region or functional group. Its parameters in Cl. rutilus
   did not differ between plots with different pollution levels, while in
   Cl. glareolus the proportion of motile cells (Motile) and their velocity
   (VCL) were lower in in animals from the impact than from the background
   zone. However, pollution accounted for only 8 and 9\% of variation in
   test parameters, respectively; i.e., the parameters of sperm motility in
   rodents from natural populations have low sensitivity to pollution.},

Abstract = {The natural nitrogen-15 abundance method does not always make it
   possible to calculate the rate of symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes
   and needs to be improved. Five legume species typical for the alpine
   belt of the Teberda Nature Reserve (Anthyllis vulneraria, Astragalus
   levieri, Hedysarum caucasicum, Oxytropis kubanensis, and Trifolium
   polyphyllum) have been grown from seeds under conditions of laboratory
   vegetation experiment. The results show that nodules on the roots of
   these plants are formed at early stages of their development; Trifolium
   polyphyllum does not form nodules either under high-mountain conditions
   or during growth in the laboratory. The natural N-15 abundance in the
   leaves of legume plants in alpine ecosystems makes it possible to
   calculate the contribution of atmospheric N-2 to nitrogen nutrition as
   early as the first year of their development, while the isotopic
   nitrogen composition of the roots does not allow this parameter to be
   determined. The calculation of atmospheric nitrogen fixation rate should
   take into account isotope fractionation between symbiotic bacteria
   (nodules) and the host plant; otherwise, the proportion of fixed
   nitrogen in plant nutrition may be underestimated.},

Abstract = {The statistical background for the relationship between the taxonomic

   of 35 indices of species and phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity in
   the tributaries of the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs compared to the
   saline rivers of the Elton Lake basin. The hypothesis of phylogenetic
   niche conservatism {[}5] is confirmed by a significant effect of
   phylogenetic overdispersion at low and medium salinity of watercourses
   and phylogenetic clustering at high water salinity. Mean salinity
   tolerance has been assessed for each of the 356 species considered; this
   index was interpreted as the statistical probability of inhabiting the
   waters of certain mineralization by particular species. A statistically
   significant phylogenetic signal corresponding to the species traits was
   revealed by Pagel's lambda and Bloomberg's K tests. Mean salinity
   tolerance for taxa of various systematic levels has been presented as a

   divergence of foraging behaviour within a lineage. This paper recorded
   the similarities and dissimilarities in foraging behaviour of five
   nonbreeding Anatidae waterfowl in different foraging habitats. Genetic
   distances between these waterfowl might have influenced the foraging
   behaviour of these species. Phylogenetic tree of the birds based on
   mitochondrial DNA supported the observation. Pairwise post hoc analyses
   of the species highlighted significant differences between foraging
   techniques employed by these Anatidae birds. Canonical Correspondence
   Analysis clearly demarcated the foraging preferences between three
   prominent clusters of waterfowl species being studied. Generalist nature
   of foraging behaviour was recorded in Lesser Whistling Duck, which
   branched apart early in the evolution. Northern Pintail, Red-crested
   Pochard, Common Pochard, and Tufted Duck showed specialized foraging
   behaviour such as predominantly upending and diving. Significant Pearson
   correlation coefficient (p < 0.01) between genetic distance and time
   allocated for diving was 0.899, and the corresponding coefficient for
   upending was 0.876. Red-crested Pochard, which is considered to be a
   link between dabbling ducks (Anatinae) and pochards (Aythyinae), showed
   interesting foraging behaviour to attest their phylogenetic position
   between divers and dabblers depending on the foraging habitats.
   Red-crested Pochard used beak-dip more frequently like Northern Pintail.
   Gene-mediated physical and physiological constraints might have led to
   the behavioural dominance on a particular foraging technique and
   resource partitioning in a given habitat, which has supported the stable
   coexistence of several waterfowl in a wetland.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the effects of the litter cover
   thickness and cleaning methods on seed germination and seedling growth
   of Pinus densata. The overall goals are to provide a reference for the
   cultivation of seeds and seedlings of P. densata in Tibet and to
   establish a theoretical basis for the sustainable development and
   utilization of P. densata. Five typical P. densata forest plots have
   been set up in Nyingchi City, Tibet, and their litter and cones have
   been collected in the plots. Experiment 1 has set 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cm
   as different litter cover thickness treatments. Each thickness level has
   been used three times, and the seed germination and seedling growth have
   been recorded for each. Experiment 2 has been site preparation
   treatments in the sample plots: no removal of shrubs and litter, removal
   of herbs and litter, removal of shrubs and litter, removal of shrubs and
   herbs, and removal of shrubs, herbs, and litter. Each treatment has been
   repeated three times, and the survival rate of the seeds and the growth
   of the seedlings have been recorded in each case. The results have shown
   the following. Litter cover thickness and the interaction between the
   cover and the seeds have had significant effects on the survival rate
   and germination potential of P. densata seedlings. The lesser the litter
   cover, the higher the seedling survival rate has been, meaning there is
   a negative correlation. The root length and stem length of P. densata
   seedlings has first increased and then decreased with the increase of
   litter coating thickness. The needle length of P. densata seedlings has
   been relatively stable, and basically has not varied with changes in
   litter thickness. On the other hand, root, stem, and leaf biomass and
   total biomass of P. densata seedlings have varied significantly with
   changes in litter cover thickness. The biomass has first increased and
   then decreased with the increase of litter thickness. There have been
   significant differences in the survival rate of P. densata seeds under
   different cleaning methods, and the survival rate of P. densata seeds
   has been the lowest under the A treatment. The preserved shrubs have had
   the greatest impact on the survival rate of P. densata seeds and had a
   strong promoting effect. The root length of P. densata seedlings has
   reached its longest under the B treatment, and the values range has been
   the largest. The basal diameter of seedlings has shown a gradual
   downward trend moving from the A treatment to the E treatment.
   Significant differences in root, stem, leaf, and total biomass of P.
   densata seedlings have occurred under different cleaning methods.},

Abstract = {Algal diversity of geothermal springs in Sri Lanka is poorly studied and
   remains largely unknown. In this study Temperature, Conductivity, pH,
   Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand of Wahawa, Madunagala,
   Maha Oya and Kapurella geothermal springs have been measured using
   standard methods. Water samples with algal mats have been collected from
   each spring and species of cyanobacteria and green microalgae have been
   identified using microscopic characteristics. The correlation of
   cyanobacteria and green microalgae richness with measured
   physicochemical parameters has been statistically analysed. 25
   cyanobacteria and green microalgae species have been identified from all
   sites. The lowest species richness has been observed in Kapurella and
   Madunagala with the highest temperature (67.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and the
   conductivity (8475 +/- 15 mu S) respectively which indicates a weak
   negative correlation of temperature and conductivity with species
   richness. The highest species richness has been recorded in Wahawa with
   relatively low temperature and conductivity. Species richness has been
   observed to correlate more highly with temperature and conductivity
   compared to other measured physicochemical parameters. The richness of
   cyanobacteria is higher than green microalgae, meaning cyanobacteria
   might adapt well to existing physicochemical parameters in thermal
   habitats. Phormidium sp., Calothrix sp. and Gloeocapsa sp. have been
   found to be in several springs and they can survive under broad range of
   physicochemical parameters. Nephrocytium sp. is a new record to
   geothermal springs which is unique to Kapurella spring. Nevertheless,
   there are no significant distribution patterns of cyanobacteria and
   green microalgae in relation to the evaluated physicochemical parameters
   measured separately, and the obtained results might have been caused by
   the combination of all environmental factors. Considerable species
   richness has been observed despite the extreme conditions.},

Abstract = {The long-term dynamics (over more than 70 years) of pike infection by
   cestodes Triaenophorus crassus and T. nodulosus in the Rybinsk Reservoir
   (the Volga River) has been studied in a comparative aspect. Cestode T.
   crassus is an invasive species that has entered the reservoir together
   with vendace Coregonus albula (the second intermediate host) from Lake
   Beloe; T. nodulosus is a native species that develops with the
   involvement of perch as a second intermediate host. Climate warming in
   the Rybinsk Reservoir manifests itself in a consistently growing average
   water temperature. This has led to a gradual decrease in the rate of
   pike infection by cestode T. crassus as a result of disturbances in the
   set of complex ecological relationships between the parasite and its
   hosts: a decrease in the abundance of large pike, fluctuations in the
   reservoir water level, and mass death of vendace in years with
   abnormally hot summers and the alternation of strong and weak
   year-classes in this short-cycle species (age 1+ to 3+). The long-term
   dynamics of pike infection by T. nodulosus is characterized by its
   consistently high rates and slight fluctuations. The abundance of perch
   population in the Rybinsk Reservoir remains high, and its age
   composition is stable, which contributes to a high rate of infection of
   both perch and pike by T. nodulosus. Cestode T. crassus occurs only in
   large pike (30 cm long or more); the rate of infection increases with
   age; T. nodulosus parasitizes mainly young pike (starting from young of
   the year), with the infection rate decreasing in large pike.},

Abstract = {The question of the nature (random or ordered) of the loss of species in
   plant communities as a result of an increase in the participation of
   dominants is considered. The objects of study were 15 sites of
   communities of different types: riverbanks, forest meadows, steppes,
   subalpine and alpine meadows of the Western Caucasus, macrophytobenthos
   of the Sea of Azov. Two approaches were used: in the 1st one, the data
   on biomass samples taken from micro-sites of communities with differing
   participation of dominant species were compared with series of model
   cenoses with a random distribution of species; in the 2nd, groups of
   samples were compared with differing participation of the dominant, but
   with equal total biomass of accompanying species due to the different
   numbers of samples in groups. As a result, a well-pronounced effect of
   ordered disappearance of species was revealed only in three areas
   (dominated by Rubus caesius, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and Solidago
   canadensis). In other cases, the distribution of species over
   micro-sites with differing participation of the dominant was random.
   This means that the increase in the participation of dominants leads
   mainly to an indiscriminate displacement of other species.},

Abstract = {Variation in fine root biomass (FRB) and turnover rate (TOR) were
   examined in four land use systems at two altitudes by using ingrowth
   core method. The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of altitude,
   depth and distance from tree stem on FRB and TOR. Significant variations
   (p < 0.05) were observed among land use systems, over seasons, depth and
   distances from the tree stem. The FRB varied between 47.09 and 528.59 kg
   ha(-1). It was maximum in agri-horticulture (AH) system in bhabhar
   region and in homegarden (HG) system in hill region. In each land use
   system at both the altitudes FRB was maximum at uppermost layer (0-20
   cm) during rainy season at 50 cm distance from tree stem while, TOR did
   not showed any particular trend with soil depth and distance from the
   tree bole. FRB and turnover rate showed significance correlation with
   distance from tree bole at both the altitudes i.e. (r(2) = 0.898 for low
   and r(2) = 0.899 for high altitude).},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {For the first time, the density of fish population has been
   quantitatively assessed in the Mekong River delta in the territory of
   the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The studies were carried out in the
   main courses of two main branches, Hau and Tien rivers, into which the
   Mekong River splits in its lower course, and in the mouth branches of
   the delta. When comparing the fish abundance at 28 stations of the
   delta, statistically significant differences in the average specific
   abundance were found between the main river course and a mixohaline zone
   of the estuarine ecotone where values of the fish abundance were much
   lower. The analysis of the relationship between the fish abundance
   dynamics and different natural and anthropogenic environmental factors
   has demonstrated a weak significant correlation with salinity, distance
   from the mouth, the type of fish community and the amount of
   anthropogenic debris on the bottom. Large fluctuations in the fish
   abundance parameters associated with aggregated distribution of such
   species as Polynemusmelanochir, Ariusmaculatus and some representatives
   of the families Akysidae, Cynoglossidae, and Ariidae are observed in the
   delta. The results may be used as a baseline for subsequent monitoring
   of the abundance dynamics of bottom-dwelling fish communities in the
   Mekong Delta.},

Abstract = {The genetic and phenotypic structure (according to the fur color) of 14
   sable samples from the Baikal mountain land (BML) has been studied by
   analyzing 257 animals for 11 microsatellite loci and evaluating over 12
   000 pelts with respect to seven standard color categories. It has been
   found that the population structure of sable in the region is
   heterogeneous both phenotypically and genetically. An isolated
   population group of sable with dark fur inhabits Zabaikalsky krai
   (Uletovsky, Petrovsk-Zabaikalsky, and Krasnochikoysky districts). The
   Khamar-Daban Ridge in the south of Lake Baikal is inhabited by a sable
   population with a high genetic diversity and the lightest fur color in
   the study region, which is most likely due to its contacts with the East
   Sayan population. The other BML samples have a relatively high genetic
   diversity and intermediate parameters of fur color, which may result
   from their large-scale intraregional translocations and migrations. The
   results of comparative tests suggest an indirect correlation between the
   phenotypic and genetic structures in samples from at least seven sable
   populations inhabiting the study region.},

Abstract = {This study has been carried out to determine water quality of Sangi
   Stream (West Anatolia, Turkey) and to compare the performance of indices
   used. Five biotic and three diversity indices have been used for
   determination of water quality of Sangi Stream. The assessment of water
   quality has been done based on benthic macroinvertebrate and
   physicochemical parameters. The following biotic indices have been used:
   Saprobi Index (SI), Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Average
   Score per Taxon (ASPT), Family Biotic Index (FBI), Belgian Biotic Index
   (BBI), as well as the following diversity indices: Shannon-Weaver index
   (SWDI), Simpsons index (SDI), Margalef index (MDI) and Evenness (E1).
   Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to the
   physicochemical variables. The similarities between the sampling
   stations have been clustered by using Cluster analysis (CLUS). Our
   results have shown the presence of 9 taxonomic groups in Sangi Stream:
   Crustacea, Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera,
   Trichoptera, Odonata, Coleoptera, and Diptera. The water quality along
   the Sangi Stream has varied from high class quality in station 1, 2, 3
   and 4, to good and moderate quality in station 5 and 6. The results
   indicate that the SI, BMWP, FBI and ASPT were sufficient in the
   estimation of water quality in the examined watercourse. This study has
   clearly shown that a specific biotic index according to the ecological
   characteristics of Turkey should be developed.},

Abstract = {Lycophytes and ferns are the oldest terrestrial vascular plants,
   sensitive to climate change, and can act as an indicator of
   environmental change in the forest. However, knowledge about the way in
   which environmental factors influence diversity distribution of
   lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China still remains limited. Based on
   the latest PPGI classification, this study has taken lycophytes and
   ferns in Northeast China as the research object. Using county
   distribution information and environmental factor data, combining
   stepwise multiple regression (SMR) and geographically weighted
   regression (GWR), species diversity and environmental origin of
   lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China have been discussed. The results
   have shown that areas of high species diversity of lycophytes and ferns
   in Northeast China have mainly been concentrated in Changbai Mountains,
   Da Hinggan Mountains and Xiao Hinggan Mountains, and Changbai Mountains
   have been the most abundant. Precipitation of wettest quarter (Bio16),
   elevation range (ER), and forest area (FA) have been the three key
   environmental factors affecting the species diversity distribution.
   Bio16, as the most important factor, can further reveal the influence of
   special life history characteristics of lycophytes and ferns on species
   diversity. This study sheds light for the first time on the main
   environmental factors affecting the species diversity of lycophytes and
   ferns in Northeast China.},

Abstract = {This research was conducted in two farms with different management in
   north-east Slovakia. The aim of this study was to examine
   interrelationship between functional biochemical and microbial
   indicators of soil quality, and their suitability to differentiate areas
   under contrasting management regimes. Soil samples from two ecological
   and conventional farming were applied to Biolog EcoPlate and average
   colour development (AWCD), richness (R) and Shannon diversity index (H)
   were calculated. Additionally, selected physicochemical and microbial
   indices were analysed. Over the 5-year study period, it was found that
   ecological farming contributed to an increase of organic matter and high
   dose of organic amendment maintained soil pH. Enzymatic tests revealed
   that activity of most studied enzymes showed higher values in ecological
   system. Microbial population from the soil under ecological management
   showed higher metabolic activity. Also the differences of diversity and
   richness index were observed. Activity and functional diversity of
   microbial population in the ecological farming were significantly
   correlated with favourable soil reaction and a higher content of organic
   matter. We conclude that microbial parameters are most effective
   indicators of management induced changes to soil quality, and that a
   variety of microbial analyses should be used when considering the impact
   of management on soil quality.},

Abstract = {To assess carbon dioxide exchange in the ecosystem of cowberry-lichen
   pine forest, 8790 eddy covariance measurements were made during the
   summer-autumn period. The annual cycle of CO2 fluxes between forest and
   atmosphere was reconstructed using regression equations. The total net
   CO2 exchange, gross photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration in the
   pine forest were estimated at -103, -407, and 304 g C m(-2) year(-1),
   respectively. Total evapotranspiration in June to September was 98 mm,
   and the efficiency of water utilization for gross photosynthesis varied
   about 2-3 g C kg(-1) H2O. A close correlation was revealed between the
   daily average values of gross photosynthesis and total evaporation over
   the forest canopy. The rates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange and
   evapotranspiration in the cowberry-lichen pine forest proved to be
   significantly lower than in a spruce forest of the East European taiga
   zone, which confirms the hypothesis that the structure of forest cover
   has an effect on the parameters of energy and mass exchange at the
   surface layer of the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the largest
   source of open scientific data on the biodiversity of Russian: over 4.3
   million species occurrences became available through GBIF as of May
   2020; the most abundant among them are data on vascular plant occurrence
   (over 1.9 million) and bird occurrence (over 900 thousand). The
   representativeness of data for other taxonomic groups and most of the
   regions of the country still remains low, although the amount of
   available information continues to grow owing to the mobilization of
   data from scientific collections and personal archives of researchers,
   as well as from citizen science projects, iNaturalist, and eBird. Data
   available through the GBIF portal are of great interest to ecologists

Title = {Current State of Planktonic and Benthic Communities in the Mouth Part of

Abstract = {The Northern Dvina River, one of the largest watercourses in the
   European northeast of Russia, is exposed to a multifactorial
   anthropogenic impact, which leads to changes in the structure of aquatic
   biocenoses: changes in the species diversity and abundance and biomass
   of organisms and a general reduction of aquatic biological resources.
   This paper presents the results of an integrated study of invertebrate
   zooplanktonic and zoobenthic communities in the mouth part of the
   Northern Dvina River. It has been established that zooplanktonic and
   zoobenthic communities are characterized by quite a high taxonomic
   diversity. According to the fishery classification, the level of
   zooplankton development in the lower reaches of the river allows one to
   consider this area oligotrophic for plankton-feeding fishes. The average
   values of the abundance and biomass of zoobenthos make it possible to
   classify the studied part of the river as eutrophic for benthophages. In
   terms of zooplankton indicators, the quality of the river waters had a
   clearly defined seasonal dynamics: it varied from class II (weekly
   polluted waters) during the spring flood period to class I
   (conditionally clean waters) in other seasons. Two areas, the Korabelny
   branch and Maimaks channel, were the only exceptions; here, the load on
   the communities of aquatic organisms was also observed in the
   summer-autumn low water period. The predominance of eurybiontic species
   in the zooplankton probably indicates the anthropogenic pressure on the
   river ecosystem. On the whole, the ecological state of the studied part
   of the watercourse can be assessed as satisfactory in terms of the
   zooplankton indicators.},

Abstract = {An ecologo-floristic approach and Tsyganov's ecological indicator values
   have been used to analyze the effect of abiotic factors on the
   distribution of Anemonastrum biarmiense (Juz.) Holub, a species endemic
   to the Southern Urals. The results show that this species has a wide
   range of tolerance to edaphic factors, with its synecological optimum
   being positioned centrally. Therefore, changes in edaphic conditions
   have no significant effect on its productivity and vitality. With
   respect to climatic factors, the realized ecological niche of A.
   biarmiense is narrow. The synecological optimum is displaced to its
   boundary and corresponds to mountain tundra communities, where habitat
   conditions change over relatively small distances. Therefore, the
   response of A. biarmiense to climate warming will involve in the first
   place a decrease in the density of cenopopulations with the following
   reduction of habitats. Thus, the combination of the narrow range of
   tolerance to climatic factors and the position of synecological optimum
   at the boundary of realized ecological niche makes A. biarmiense a good
   indicator of global climate change.},

Abstract = {Some factors influencing C and N contents in fine plant roots were
   studied in the Middle Urals. They included ecological (edaphic) features
   of habitats; type of root symbioses (the capability for symbiotic
   nitrogen fixation and formation of different mycorrhiza types); and
   ecological strategies of species. Samples of fine roots from woody and
   herbaceous plants and of the upper soil layer were collected in two
   industrial dump sites and in an area with natural communities. In each
   area, samples were taken from forest and meadow habitats. The content of
   C or N in the species from the sampling plot served as an observation
   unit. A total of 83 estimates were analyzed. As a result, differences
   were revealed between the key factors influencing the content of each
   element in fine roots: the C content is determined mainly by the type of
   mycorrhiza, while the determinant factor for the N content is the
   capability for symbiotic nitrogen fixation; ecological features of
   habitats and the type of plant ecological strategy are the second and
   third factors influencing the C and N contents. The patterns of N
   accumulation in the roots of plants with different ecological strategies
   and with different types of mycorrhizas do not fully replicate the
   patterns of N accumulation in their leaves.},

Abstract = {The long-term dynamics of the composition, total abundance, and
   diversity (alpha- and gamma-diversity) of small mammal (SM) communities
   is analyzed in the vicinity of a large copper smelter during the periods
   of high (1990-1997), reduced (1998-2009), and almost terminated
   emissions (2010-2019). It is shown that the response of SM communities
   to pollution has not fundamentally changed over 30 observation years. An
   increase in pollution caused a significant reduction in the total
   abundance and alpha-diversity of communities and their dominance index
   in each of the three periods; at the same time, the gamma-diversity
   remained similar in the background (13 species) and polluted zones (12
   species). The reduction of emissions had no significant influence on the
   SM communities in the background (conditionally clean) zone: the species
   structure fluctuated insignificantly, the dominance structure did not
   change, and the increase in the animal abundance by the end of
   observations (owing to forest voles but not insectivores) was due to
   successional changes in the vegetation. The reduction of emissions led
   to a succession of dominants near the smelter and the trends of changes
   in abundance in this area differed from those observed in the buffer and
   impact zones (increase and no change, respectively). The increase in the
   abundance of species of different trophic groups (phytophages,
   granivores, and zoophages) in the moderately polluted (buffer) zone can
   be considered a symptom of the initial stages of recovery due to the
   improvement of habitat quality. Positive shifts in the SM community from
   the highly polluted (impact) zone are less distinct, being expressed
   only as an increase in the proportion of shrews.},

Abstract = {Two new species of Eriocaulon (Eriocaulaceae) from the Brazilian Cerrado
   are described and illustrated. Eriocaulon benedictum, found in the
   Tocantins River Basin and Plate River Basin has a vegetative morphology
   similar to Eriocaulon aquatile and E. modestum due to the submerged life
   form with submerged leaves and long scapes surpassing the water column,
   but differs from both by the presence of a submerged stem with spiral
   leaves (vs. a rhizome with rosulate leaves), obtrullate floral bracts
   (vs. oblong floral bracts in E. aquatile or obovate in E. modestum), and
   band shaped projections on the seeds (vs. post shaped projections on E.
   modestum or projections absent in E. aquatile). Eriocaulon naviculum,
   found in the Araguaia River Basin, an emergent species, has a floral
   morphology similar to E. altogibbosum and E. gibbosum due to the
   presence of gibbous sepals in the pistillate flowers, but differs from
   both by the grey trichomes on the leaf sheath (vs. translucent trichomes
   in the latter species), slightly sinuous scapes (vs. straight scapes in

Abstract = {A new species, Espeletia ocetana (Asteraceae), from about 3500 m a. s.
   l. in Paramo de Oceta, Mongua, Boyaca department, Colombia, is described
   and illustrated. The new species exhibits a caulescent rosette habit
   (0.7-1.8 m tall), sessile leaves, elliptic leaf laminae with greyish
   indumentum, robust bracteate thyrsoid capitulescences spreading
   laterally from rosette, each holding 16-37(-69) capitula, external
   phyllaries 14.2-31.1 mm long, and ray florets 13.9-21.3 mm long arranged
   in 2.0-2.9 series. It is markedly different from the majority of other
   members of the genus, and only slightly similar to E. jaramilloi, from
   which it can be easily distinguished by its taller stems, wider leaves
   with a smaller length/width ratio, and longer sheaths. Furthermore, E.
   ocetana has capitula with ray florets arranged in fewer series, and with
   longer phyllaries, ray corollas, ray corolla limbs, ray styles, ray
   style branches, disc florets, and disc styles. In addition, E. ocetana
   is distributed allopatrically in regard to E. jaramilloi, and differs as
   well in its ecological preference for humid to very humid shrubby
   paramos. Espeletia ocetana is rather abundant in its type locality,
   which is a relatively well-conserved paramo located within the limits of
   Parque Natural Regional Siscunsi-Oceta. However, it is absent from road
   margins, abandoned agriculture fields, and other areas impacted by human
   activities. Further studies will be necessary to know appropriately the
   extent of the geographic distribution of E. ocetana, its ecological
   requirements and its phylogenetic affinities with other species.},

Abstract = {The genus Solidago represents a taxonomically challenging group due to
   its sheer number of species, putative hybridization, polyploidy, and
   shallow genetic divergence among species. Here we use a dataset obtained
   exclusively from herbarium specimens to evaluate the status of Solidago
   ulmifolia var. palmeri, a morphologically subtle taxon potentially
   confined to Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri. A multivariate
   analysis of both discrete and continuous morphological data revealed no
   clear distinction between S. ulmifolia var. palmeri and Solidago
   ulmifolia var. ulmifolia. Solidago ulmifolia var. palmeri's status was
   also assessed with a phylogenomic and SNP clustering analysis of data
   generated with the ``Angiosperms353{''} probe kit. Neither analysis
   supported Solidago ulmifolia var. palmeri as a distinct taxon, and we
   suggest that this name should be discarded. The status of Solidago
   delicatula (formerly known as Solidago ulmifolia var. microphylla) was
   also assessed. Both morphological and phylogenetic analyses supported
   the species status of S. delicatula and we suggest maintaining this
   species at its current rank. These results highlight the utility of the
   Angiosperms353 probe kit, both with herbarium tissue and at lower
   taxonomic levels. Indeed, this is the first study to utilize this kit to
   identify genetic groups within a species.},

Abstract = {Comolia abaetensis, an endemic new species from the Abaete and Itapua
   sand dunes, Bahia, Brazil, is described and illustrated. Additionally,
   field images and a geographic distribution map of the new species are
   provided, together with morphological and leaf anatomy comparisons among
   the most similar congeners, and a dichotomous key to the species that
   occur in Brazil. Comolia abaetensis is morphologically similar to C.
   ovalifolia, but differs from the latter by the following combination of
   characteristics: glabrous (rarely with sparse trichomes) internodes and
   hirsute nodes, glabrous leaf blades or rarely with sparse eglandular
   trichomes, abaxial surface predominantly red with green nuances,
   glabrous pedicels, cupuliform hypanthium, and filaments of the
   antesepalous stamens that are 5-6 mm long. Specimens of C. abaetensis
   have been confused with and/or tentatively determined as C.
   berberifolia. However, these two species are readily distinguished by
   the size of the leaves, the length of the trichomes and filaments, and
   the color of the abaxial foliar surfaces. Comparisons between the leaf
   anatomy of C. abaetensis and C. ovalifolia are provided and the
   occurrence of emergences and hydathodes are here reported for the genus
   for the first time. Finally, we informally recommend a conservation
   status of Critically Endangered {[}CR B1ab (iv) 1 2ab (iv)] for C.
   abaetensis.},

Title = {Survival of Early Burbot Larvae (Lota iota L., 1758) in the Ob
   Floodplain},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {486-495},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The long-term data (2000-2017) on the abundance of burbot larvae (Lota
   iota L., 1758) during the downstream migration from the spawning areas
   in the spawning tributaries of the Ob River (the Voykar and Sob rivers)
   and in feeding areas in the floodplain system are analyzed. The average
   absolute abundance of feeding burbot larvae was 12.4 million specimens
   in the Voykar River and 7.3 million specimens in the Sob River. The
   average proportion of survived larvae which started exogenous feeding of
   the number of hatched larvae was 0.78 and 0.59\%, respectively. The
   total abundance of feeding larvae is determined by the number of
   juveniles which migrated downstream from the spawning tributary: in the
   Voykar River, r(Sp) = 0.741, p = 0.006, in the Sob River, r(Sp) = 1.000,
   p < 0.001. The correlation between the survival of burbot larvae in the
   floodplain and environmental factors affecting the juveniles until their
   complete transition to exogenous feeding was found. For example, in the
   Voykar River the correlation between the survival rate and duration of
   flooding at the level of 7 m was r(Sp) = 0.732, p = 0.007; between the
   survival and average daily temperature for 14 days was r(Sp) = 0.921, p
   < 0.001; between the survival and the number of days of water warming
   above 8 degrees C, r(Sp) = 0.780, p = 0.003; in the Sob River the
   correlation between the survival and the average daily temperature for
   14 days was r(Sp) = 0.900, p = 0.037. The linear regression equation
   describing the relationship between the larvae survival rate and the
   average daily water temperature for 14 days has the following form: y =
   0.15x - 0.35, R-2 = 0.95. It is suggested that the main factor affecting
   the survival of feeding larvae is the availability of start feed
   (phytoplankton), the growth of which is determined by the levels of
   light and water temperature.},

Abstract = {Recent climatic changes significantly affected forest ecosystems in
   northern Eurasia. Trees growing in Siberia are very sensitive to climate
   change due to strong temperature limitation of their growth. Our study
   covers high-latitude (northeastern Yakutia, eastern Taimyr, central
   Evenkia) and high-altitude (Russian Altai) zones in Eurasia, where
   tree-ring parameters (tree-ring width, cell-wall thickness, and maximum
   latewood density) mainly record summer air temperature variations. To
   reveal the impact of moisture changes (e.g., amount of precipitation,
   vapor pressure deficit, relative humidity and potential
   evapotranspiration) on tree growth in Siberian forest ecosystems, we
   evaluated delta C-13 in tree-ring cellulose over the past century. We
   found that at all the study sites mainly June-July precipitation and
   June-July evapotranspiration affect larch radial growth, while the
   strongest influence of vapor pressure deficit on the delta C-13 was
   observed in northeastern Yakutia. Further increase of vapor pressure
   deficit and rise of air temperature in the coming decades in Siberian
   regions will probably lead to drought and related forest mortality even
   under additional source of water due to permafrost thaw.},

Abstract = {We propose a new reconnaissance method for mouse-sized mammal abundance
   estimation that does not involve animal capture. For survey purposes, we
   used plastic bottles without covers, which were baited and set out with
   free entry and exit for animals. Two patterns of setting out were
   tested: 5 and 10 m intervals on transects of 120 m in length. The total
   abundance of small mammals was estimated by the proportion of bottles in
   which baits were absent or eaten. These values were compared with data
   obtained in the same places by means of snap-trap lines or live-trap
   plots. We determined empirical coefficients for the conversion of the
   bottle attendance index into relative numbers (individuals per 100 trap
   nights) or community density (individuals per ha). It was shown that the
   method can be used in urban environments and combines quantitative
   estimation with low labour expenditures and high simplicity.},

Abstract = {The long-term dynamics of the taxonomic composition of zooplankton in
   the lower reaches of the Northern Dvina River and the effect of some
   hydrochemical factors on its abundance have been studied. It is found
   that the species list of the zooplankton has included 141 species over
   50 years: it consisted of a total of 98 taxa in 1965 and 104 taxa in
   2012-2019. The results of analyzing the spatiotemporal abundance
   distribution of the zooplankton and its taxonomic groups are presented.
   A significant increase in abundance (on account of copepods) and changes
   in the taxonomic structure of zooplankton have been revealed in the
   lower parts of the study water area. In 2019, changes in the
   structure-forming complex of zooplankton were noted for the first time
   over the study period. It is found that species diversity reaches high
   values in waters classified as ``heavily polluted{''} and ``dirty,{''}
   which is evidence for a complex structure of zooplankton communities.
   The main factor influencing the horizontal distribution of the
   zooplankton abundance is the dissolved oxygen content of water.},

Abstract = {This paper is analyzes the faunistic composition and quantitative
   characteristics of aquatic communities in the mountain lakes of the
   Torgovaya River basin (Subpolar Urals) with special focus on the
   distribution of Siberian fish and invertebrate species. Aquatic
   communities of seven mountain lakes have been studied; three of them can
   be considered as glacial refugia inhabited by the resident form of
   Arctic grayling. Four species of amphibiotic insects have been
   identified in the chyme of two grayling species; their main range is in
   Siberia. The zoobenthos included 16 large taxa; among them, nematodes,
   entomostracans, and chironomids were dominant in abundance and dipteran
   and stonefly larvae were dominant in biomass. Twenty eight taxa typical
   for the fauna of the European northeast of Russia have been identified
   in the zooplankton. The recorded patterns of distribution of the local
   aquatic fauna are determined mainly by the glacial history of the Urals.
   It is assumed that rheophilic benthic invertebrates of Siberian origin
   colonized the Torgovaya riverbed in the postglacial period.},

Abstract = {Absract-Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   of ribosomal DNA isolated from 51 basidiocarps of tinder fungus shows
   that this xylotrophic fungus in the Urals and North Kazakhstan is a
   complex species consisting of two cryptic phylogenetic lineages (A and
   B) represented by sublineages A2 and B2. Their natural habitats overlap
   and encompass the South, Middle and North Urals, as well as the North
   Kazakhstan, though A2 and B2 are more often found in the North and
   Middle Urals and in the North Kazakhstan, respectively. Their sympatry
   is based on trophic specialization: representatives of sublineage A2
   occur on Alnus, Betula, Prunus, Salix, Sorbus; those of B2 occur on
   Acer, Populus, Salix, Tilia. The major substrate is Betula for the
   former and Populus for the latter. With respect to the ITS regions of
   rDNA, sublineages A2 and B2 correspond to Fomes fomentarius sensu
   stricto and Fomes inzengae (Ces. \& De Not.) Cooke, respectively, which
   are the two sympatric cryptic species described in Europe. With respect
   to the level of nucleotide divergence, F. fomentarius s. s. and F.
   inzengae are equidistant from F. fasciatus (Sw.) Cooke (6.26\% and
   7.05\%, respectively), but the level of divergence between them (1.49\%)
   does not exceed the average level of intraspecies ITS variability of
   basidial fungi. Most likely, they should be considered as cryptic
   sympatric infraspecific phylogenetic lineages of Fomes fomentarius sensu
   lato at a rank of subspecies.},

Abstract = {The beta-emitter tritium (H-3, the half-life is 12.32 +/- 0.02 years)
   contained in the environment has a natural and technogenic origin. The
   equilibrium global content of natural tritium is estimated at (1.0-2.6)
   x 10(18) Bq. The total activity of technogenic tritium that was formed
   as a result of nuclear and thermonuclear weapon tests in 1945-1975 and
   during the normal and emergency operation of nuclear fuel cycle
   enterprises reaches 10(20) Bq. Anthropogenic tritium serves as a unique
   marker for generalizing data on the behavior of this radionuclide in
   different environmental components. This is especially important in view
   of the intensification of research and development works in the field of
   controlled thermonuclear fusion in recent years. Promi-sing fusion power
   reactors, in which it is planned to use a significant amount of H-3 as
   fuel, can become an additional source of impact on the biosphere. Their
   safety should be assessed, justified, and ultimately ensured based on
   proper technology and infrastructure. We have analyzed the dynamics of
   the number of publications on H-3 over the period from 1951 to 2021 from
   the Google Scholar and Clarivate Analytics databases. The main
   characteristics and chemical forms of tritium are given. The methodology
   for assessing the content of different forms of H-3 in environmental
   components is given taking into account interlaboratory
   intercalibration. Pathways of tritium entry into the environment
   (atmosphere and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems) as a result of
   routine and emergency releases and discharges from nuclear industry
   enterprises are analyzed. Seasonal fluctuations in tritium activity with
   the maximum level in spring, as well as the effect of climatic factors
   and distance from the emission source on the spatial distribution of
   H-3, are shown. The role of soil organic acids in the behavior of
   tritium in ecosystems is noted. Based on the concept of reference plant
   and animal species, we have analyzed publications to assess the
   accumulation of different forms of H-3 by biota during laboratory
   experiments and monitoring studies of natural ecosystems. A number of
   topical issues that need to be addressed in the near future have been
   revealed.},

   Over the 100 years, no negative recreation-driven changes in the radial
   growth were found. There is a significant increase in the tree-ring
   width and the number of absent rings in the chronologies from active
   recreation sites. A linear relationship was found between the number of
   absent rings and Palmer's drought severity index. Under summer drought
   conditions, lake proximity may mitigate the negative effects of
   recreation on stands even at sites with V stage of recreational
   degradation.},

Abstract = {We tested a hypothesis about the different abilities of alien and native
   plants to form arbuscular mycorrhizae. The studies were carried out in
   the Belarusian Polesia (Eastern Europe) in the zone of mixed
   coniferous-deciduous forests with a temperate continental climate. The
   intensity of formation of various structures of arbuscular mycorrhizae
   (arbuscule, vesicles, and hyphae), as well as root hairs, was determined
   microscopically in 19 alien and 25 native plant species collected in six
   different habitats. In each habitat, both alien and native plants were
   collected. In mycorrhizal alien plants, arbuscules were formed less
   frequently (28 +/- 6\%) than in native plants (48 +/- 6\%). Root hairs
   in alien species were laid more often (43 +/- 6\%) than in native
   species (32 +/- 4\%). In both native and alien plants, the mycorrhiza
   was more actively formed in disturbed habitats, but the interaction
   between the factors ``degree of naturalization{''} and ``degree of
   habitat disturbance{''} has not been established. Thus, arbuscular
   mycorrhizae function less effectively in alien plants of the Belarusian
   Polesia than in native plants.},

Abstract = {The growth rate of the first lower molar and its wear features have been

   molar growth, a lower crown, and a more obtuse wear angle of the chewing
   surface than the animals feeding on hard feed; they were also
   characterized by the appearance of lateral wear facets. As these signs
   of wear developed in animals fed soft food, the growth rate of the molar

Abstract = {Based on the long-term laboratory rearing of gypsy moth larvae on an
   artificial diet with different modifications, which were taken from egg
   masses in the same forest area in different phases of the population
   dynamics, we have studied the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on
   the duration of the development and survival rate of larvae at younger
   instars in the group- and solitary-rearing regimes. It is shown that the
   duration of larval development at younger instars is influenced by the
   sum of effective temperatures at the early embryonic stage of
   development, as well as by the duration of embryo exposure to
   temperatures below the developmental threshold and by the food
   composition. The effect of the group rearing regime (group effect) on
   the rate of larval development is associated with the population
   dynamics phase; its most significant positive effect has been recorded
   in the eruptive period. It has been revealed that the response of larvae
   to the food composition through the development duration differs in
   different rearing regimes, depending on the population density phase.
   With respect to the food composition, the group effect can be determined
   both by the acceleration of larval development in the group regime and
   by the deceleration of larval development in the solitary rearing
   regime. The studied effects have been quantitatively assessed.},

   both species have the highest foraging costs in coastal habitats and the
   lowest ones have in marsh habitats. Without significant differentiation
   of trophic niches, the snow goose has significantly lower foraging costs

Abstract = {One of the fundamental problems of modern ecology is assessment of the
   response of woody plants to environmental effects under changing climate
   conditions on Earth. Various simulation models of tree ring growth can
   serve as an effective tool for solving this problem. We have proposed a
   new simulation model for the functioning of cambium, which reproduces
   the process of cambial activity of coniferous species of woody plants,
   depending on the action of the key climatic factors. It is based on the
   hypothesis of the presence of a cytoplasmic inhibitor of cell
   differentiation, the functioning of which is limited by temperature,
   moisture, and illumination. The new algorithm was developed based on the
   existing cambial block of the Vaganov-Shashkin simulation model of tree
   ring growth (VS-model). The model has been tested based on indirect
   observations of the functioning of the cambium of coniferous woody
   plants in southern Siberia (Republic of Khakassia), namely, on the
   measured seasonal cell production from 1964 to 2012. A software
   implementation of the new cambial model based on the R. Shiny
   technology, which can be easily adapted to the on-line platform of the
   VS-model, is proposed. The developed widgets (process visualization
   tools) make it possible to track the growth dynamics of the cambial zone
   to an accuracy of one-hundredth of a day.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {173-187},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The evolutionary-ecological concept of morphoniche is proposed where the
   morphoniche is regarded as part of the multidimensional ecological niche
   that characterizes the limits of phenotypic plasticity of individuals,
   cenopopulations, and taxocenes in the morphospace. The phenome-a
   morphofunctional ``shell{''} of an individual-is the basic part of its
   ecological niche and a multifunctional ``biological tool{''} allowing
   the individual to perform its generative, trophic, and
   environment-forming functions in the population and community. The
   phenome characterizes the morphophysiological habitus of an individual
   and serves as its personal morphoniche. Geometric morphometrics makes it
   possible to bring into correlation the locations of individual
   morphoniches in the common morphospace and evaluate coupled
   morphogenetic reactions of individuals to changes in aut- and
   synecological factors. The epigenetic system of a population
   parameterizes the potential morphospace, delimiting the fan of possible
   invariants of morphogenesis. The volume of population morphospace
   reflects morphogenetic reactions of a population to the range of local
   ecological factors and allows estimation of its realized morphoniche. An
   analysis of realized morphoniches over many years provides an estimate
   of the potential population morphoniche. Part of the community
   (taxocene) comprising cenopopulations of closely related sympatric
   species provides a model of the cenotic morphoniche. The ratios between
   the volumes of realized and potential morphoniches make it possible to
   evaluate the adaptive modification potential and optimality index of the
   realized morphoniches of individuals, cenopopulations, and taxocenes,
   the limits of their phenotypic plasticity, and the risk of an
   evolutionary-ecological crisis.},

Abstract = {The proportion of jointly visited traps and the frequency of visits to
   the traps recorded during mark-recapture studies have been compared with
   the mathematical expectation obtained in a computer experiment based on
   the assumption that traps located in an equivalent space are visited at
   random. It has been found that the numbers of jointly visited traps in
   all sex-age groups of shrews are close to those expected for the random
   pattern of visits and do not exceed the boundaries of the confidence
   interval for 1000 repeated simulations. The number of visits of
   neighbors to traps located within the home ranges of individual shrews
   corresponds to the proportion of traps visited by two or more animals,
   indicating that neighbors have no effect on the frequency of visitation.
   In view of specific biological features of common shrews, the system of
   space use based on the random distribution and stochastic interaction of
   resident animals may be considered optimal for this species.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Data of monitoring studies (2014-2016) on the state of hydrobionts in
   watercourses during the development of a hydrocarbon deposit on the
   Yamal Peninsula have been analyzed. The increased content of suspended
   solids has the greatest effect on hydrobionts. While the background
   values of concentration of suspended solids is 4-6 mg/L, in the area of
   the entrance of the pit effluents to the watercourses, their
   concentration increases up to 440 mg/L and higher. The effect of
   increased turbidity on the qualitative and quantitative indicators of
   planktonic organisms has not been found. An increase of suspended solids
   in water has a negative effect on zoobenthos (r(Sp) = -0.426, p = 0.030
   for the number of species; r(Sp) = -0.590, p = 0.002 for the abundance;
   r(Sp) = -0.480, p = 0.013 for the biomass) and fish (r(Sp) = -0.567, p =
   0.004 for ecological density of small fish species). Especially
   sensitive fish to the increased content of suspended solids are
   whitefishes and lake minnows. The most tolerant to turbidity are the
   nine-spined stickleback and Barbatula toni. Increased concentrations of
   suspended solids in autumn are the reason for the cessation of up-stream
   migration of whitefishes from the Gulf of Ob to the deep lakes.},

Title = {Revised Taxonomy of the Arctotis Annual Clade (Arctotideae, Asteraceae)

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Previous phylogenetic analysis of ITS nrDNA sequence data for
   Arctotidinae species resolved a strongly supported clade containing all
   but one of the showy annual Arctotis species (informally designated the
   Arctotis Annual Clade). In the present study, phylogenetic relationships
   in the Arctotis Annual Clade were investigated by Bayesian inference and
   maximum parsimony analyses of cpDNA (trnT-trnL-trnF and trnH-psbA) and
   nrDNA (ITS) sequence data. The cpDNA and nrDNA phylogenies were notably
   incongruent. Arctotis venusta and a putative unnamed species (A. `sp.
   B') were strongly supported as monophyletic by both data sets. The
   monophyly of A. leiocarpa was strongly supported by the ITS data set,
   whereas the remaining accessions formed a poorly resolved complex (the
   `A. fastuosa complex'). Within the A. fastuosa complex, A. hirsuta was
   monophyletic with strong support in the ITS phylogeny. A statistical
   parsimony-derived cpDNA haplotype network resolved five broad groups of
   haplotypes and showed no consistent geographical structure, but
   species-specific haplotype lineages for A. venusta and A. sp. B were
   resolved. Arctotis fastuosa accessions were distributed among four
   haplotype groups. Incongruence between the data sets and poor resolution
   within the A. fastuosa complex may reflect reticulate evolution,
   ancestral polymorphism, and incomplete lineage sorting, in tandem with
   the low information content of the data sets. The greatest phenotypic
   diversification in the clade is in cypsela morphology. Comparison of
   cypsela morphology with the phylogenies suggests a general trend for
   reduction in the sizes of the cypsela, abaxial wings, pappus scales, and
   loss of pubescence during diversification. A revised taxonomy,
   integrating currently available evidence, accompanied by full
   descriptive accounts and a key to the taxa are presented. Eight species
   are recognized, including the nomenclatural novelties Arctotis
   chrysantha (sp. nov.) and Arctotis namibiensis (sp. nov.). The names
   Arctotis karasmontana, Venidium fugax, and Venidium macrocephalum are
   lectotypified.},

   Eucnide (Loasaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {678-688},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Eucnide (Loasaceae) consists of about 15 species distributed across
   Mexico, Guatemala, and the North American Southwest, a geographically
   complex landscape made up of floristically unique deserts, large
   mountain ranges, and a large, geographically isolated peninsula. This
   complex geography is credited for high levels of biodiversity and
   endemism in the region and we examine relationships between geography
   and cladogenesis in Eucnide. In the most recent treatment of the genus,
   Thompson and Ernst recognize three sections of Eucnide differentiated
   based on floral morphology. To date, no molecular phylogenetic studies
   have broadly sampled species in this genus. We used Bayesian and
   maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of one plastid marker (matK)
   and one nuclear marker (ITS) to: 1) test the monophyly of Eucnide
   sections and assess whether the existing taxonomy sufficiently
   circumscribes diversity within the genus; 2) assess the divergence times
   of Eucnide lineages to determine when the major clades diversified; and
   3) estimate the ancestral range of Eucnide and hypothesize patterns of
   geographical diversification of the genus. We found that not all
   infrageneric units of Eucnide are monophyletic and the taxonomy needs
   revision. Additionally, the major clades of Eucnide are predominantly
   restricted to geographic regions, suggesting that species have
   frequently diversified within geographic areas. The ancestral range of
   Eucnide was inferred to be widespread, and the divergence times of the
   major clades coincide with major geological events, particularly, the
   formation of the North American warm deserts, the isolation of the Baja
   Peninsula, and the uplift of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. This
   suggests that major geological/climatic events may have contributed to
   the diversification of the genus.},

Title = {Molecular Systematics of Tribe Physarieae (Brassicaceae) Based on
   Nuclear ITS, LUMINIDEPENDENS, and Chloroplast ndhF},

Abstract = {Physarieae is a small tribe of herbaceous annual and woody perennial
   mustards that are mostly endemic to North America, with its members
   including a large amount of variation in floral, fruit, and chromosomal
   variation. Building on a previous study of Physarieae based on
   morphology and ndhF plastid DNA, we reconstructed the evolutionary
   history of the tribe using new sequence data from two nuclear markers,
   and compared the new topologies against previously published cpDNA-based
   phylogenetic hypotheses. The novel analyses included ca. 420 new
   sequences of ITS and LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) markers for 39 and 47 species,
   respectively, with sampling accounting for all seven genera of
   Physarieae, including nomenclatural type species, and 11 outgroup taxa.
   Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses showed that
   these additional markers were largely consistent with the previous ndhF
   data that supported the monophyly of Physarieae and resolved two major
   clades within the tribe, i.e., DDNLS (Dithyrea, Dimorphocarpa,
   Nerisyrenia, Lyrocarpa, and Synthlipsis) and PP (Paysonia and Physaria).
   New analyses also increased internal resolution for some closely related
   species and lineages within both clades. The monophyly of Dithyrea and
   the sister relationship of Paysonia to Physaria was consistent in all
   trees, with the sister relationship of Nerisyrenia to Lyrocarpa
   supported by ndhF and ITS, and the positions of Dimorphocarpa and
   Synthlipsis shifted within the DDNLS Clade depending on the employed
   data set. Finally, using the strong, new phylogenetic framework of
   combined cpDNA 1 nDNA data, we discussed standing hypotheses of trichome
   evolution in the tribe suggested by ndhF.},

Abstract = {This study summarizes the taxonomy of the species of Maranta from
   northeastern Brazil. While 20 names have been proposed in the region,
   only 13 are accepted. We provide two new records, M. rugosa and M.
   polystachya, and five new species are described, of which M. bahiensis
   and M. villosovaginata are endemic to Bahia, M. chrysogina to Ceara, M.
   vieirae to Maranhao, and M. lorifolia occurs in Bahia and Espirito
   Santo. Maranta noctiflora, M. parvifolia, M. phrynioides, and M.
   rupicola L. have distributions outside of the study area, while M.
   anderssoniana and M. hatschbachiana are synonymized. Our final checklist
   includes 21 species, which represent more than half of the species in
   the genus, highlighting northeastern Brazil as a center of diversity for
   Maranta. Among the species listed, M. lorifolia, M. tuberculata, and M.
   zingiberina are thought to be endangered (EN), while M. gigantea is
   likely critically endangered (CR). Finally, this study provides informal
   conservation statuses, descriptions, distribution maps, and an
   identification key to the species. Typifications for M. subterranea and
   M. polystachya are also provided.},

Title = {Resolving the Tetrastigma loheri s. l. Species Complex (Vitaceae) in the
   Philippines: No Evidence for Recognizing More than One Species},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {750-763},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae) is a vine species native to Borneo and the
   Philippines. Because it is a commonly encountered forest species in the
   Philippines, T. loheri is potentially suitable for studying patterns of
   genetic diversity and connectivity among fragmented forest ecosystems in
   various parts of this country. However, previous research suggests that
   T. loheri is part of a species complex in the Philippines (i.e. the T.
   loheri s. l. complex) that potentially also contains Philippine plants
   identified as T. diepenhorstii, T. philippinense, T. stenophyllum, and
   T. trifoliolatum. This uncertainty about its taxonomic delimitation can
   make it challenging to draw conclusions that are relevant to
   conservation from genetic studies using this species. Here, we tested
   the hypothesis that T. loheri s. l. is composed of more than one species
   in the Philippines. For this, we used generalized mixed Yule coalescent
   (GMYC) and Poisson tree process (PTP) species delimitation models to
   identify clades within DNA sequence phylogenies of T. loheri s. l. that
   might constitute species within this complex. Although these methods
   identified several putative species, these are statistically poorly
   supported and subsequent random forest analyses using a geometric
   morphometric leaf shape dataset and several other vegetative characters
   did not result in the identification of characters that can be used to
   discriminate these putative species morphologically. Furthermore, the
   results of principal component and principal coordinates analyses of
   these data suggest the absence of morphological discontinuities within
   the species complex. Under a unified species concept that uses
   phylogenetic and morphological distinction as operational criteria for
   species recognition, we therefore conclude that the currently available
   data do not support recognizing multiple species in the T. loheri s. l.
   complex. This implies that T. loheri is best considered as a single,
   morphologically variable species when used for studying patterns of
   genetic diversity and connectivity in the Philippines.},

Title = {Taxonomy and Relationships Within Polemonium foliosissimum
   (Polemoniaceae): Untangling a Clade of Colorful and Gynodioecious Herbs},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {519-537},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {New molecular and ecological data have necessitated taxonomic revisions
   of several species complexes within Polemonium (Polemoniaceae),
   including P. foliosissimum, an herbaceous perennial widespread in the
   Intermountain West of the United States. As currently circumscribed, P.
   foliosissimum is a highly polymorphic species of four taxonomic
   varieties. One of the most striking morphological traits of the species
   is its diversity in flower color, which is unusual for the genus.
   Several species have been proposed based on this variation in flower
   color. However, these names have been treated as infraspecific taxa
   because previous authors have concluded that the presence of micropollen
   grains throughout the geographic range of the species complex indicated
   partial hybrid sterility and therefore incomplete barriers to gene flow.
   However, recent evidence suggests that micropollen is instead due to a
   gynodioecious breeding system. Using 128 nuclear loci and eight
   quantitative morphological traits, I clarify relationships and taxonomy
   within the species complex. I show that what is currently circumscribed
   as four varieties of P. foliosissimum represent five species that, in
   addition to differing in corolla color, differ in leaflet number,
   corolla size, and vegetative and floral pubescence. I propose a new
   species endemic to the White Mountains of southeastern Arizona,
   Polemonium apachianum. This study provides a new phylogenetic context
   and taxonomic circumscription to serve as a framework for future
   research on the evolution of floral color and sexual systems in a
   previously misunderstood but evolutionarily exciting system.},

Abstract = {The recent rediscovery of Jatropha riojae, which was considered as
   probably extinct, led to a taxonomic re-evaluation of the species due to
   its problematic circumscription with respect to morphologically similar
   species of Jatropha section Loureira subsect. Loureira. Based on our
   study, J. riojae is accepted, taxonomic clarifications are made,
   including the designation of a lectotype for the name, a complete
   description of vegetative and reproductive structures is provided, and
   the species is illustrated and compared to others with which it has been
   confused. The geographical distribution of J. riojae is clarified as
   endemic to the municipality of Acatlan, Puebla, Mexico in the south of
   the Balsas River Basin. To determine the conservation status of the
   species, the risk assessment method of theMexican Red List (NOM
   059-SEMARNAT-2010) was applied, indicating that J. riojae should be
   assigned to the ``Endangered{''} category. A re-evaluation of the
   species under the IUCN criteria indicated that it should be assigned in

Abstract = {This work involved materials from the recent and ancient (Holocene and
   Late Pleistocene) localities of the ornithogenic assemblages of Ural
   rodent bone remains. The work included the development and trial of
   criteria for assignment of the temporal dynamics of rodent communities
   to particular scales based on their comparison against levels of the
   spatial differences of the recent rodent faunas from localities situated
   in the territories of the various phytogeographical ranks, namely,
   districts, subzones, and zones. Paired coefficients of the ecological
   and taxonomic similarities were calculated based on a distribution of
   proportions of the rodent remains (\%) in heterochronous localities of
   the Middle Urals. The paper demonstrates analogy between spatial
   differences and temporal dynamics: the zone differences-evolutionary
   scale, subzone differences-historical scale, and intradistrict
   differences-actual scale.},

Title = {Natural Recovery of Terrestrial Ecosystems after the Cessation of
   Industrial Pollution: 1. A State-of-the-Art Review},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-39},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent decades, atmospheric emissions from industrial enterprises
   have been reduced in many countries, which makes it possible to analyze
   the patterns of ecosystem recovery. The review provides an annotated
   list of studies of natural recovery (i.e., without involving any
   reclamation measures) of terrestrial ecosystems near industrial plants
   that have ceased or significantly reduced their emissions. Seventy-three
   studies of biota recovery (70 publications) performed near 22 plants
   (mainly metallurgical ones) have been identified; other 18 and 14
   studies deal with analysis based on repeated records of the dynamics of
   the content of pollutants in plants and animals and in soils,
   respectively. Numerous gaps in the knowledge of natural recovery have
   been revealed: uneven study of different biomes and ecosystem types,
   fragmentariness (absence) of data on many taxa, the prevailing number of
   single-component studies within a specific area, and dominance of
   relatively short observation series with a small number of time points.
   These gaps make it so far impossible to generalize data on a global
   scale. Shortcomings in the presentation of results in publications
   (incomplete data on the dynamics of emissions and dates of material
   collection) also make it difficult to generalize data.},

Title = {Dynamics of Distribution Boundaries of Epiphytic Macrolichens after

Abstract = {Natural recovery of forest ecosystems after the termination of impacts
   caused by emissions from large industrial enterprises gives a clue to
   their sustainability mechanisms. However, the lack of data on different
   ecosystem components, natural zones, and emission sources makes it
   impossible to identify general patterns of restorative successions. This
   paper examines the distribution and abundance dynamics of macrolichens
   growing on birch trunks in the southern taiga forests of the Middle
   Urals affected for many years by emissions from the Middle Ural Copper
   Smelter. Two periods were compared: (1) period of intense emissions
   (1995-1997); and (2) period of almost ceased emissions (2014-2016). In
   the interval between the two studied periods, technogenic boundaries of
   all studied lichen species distribution have shifted closer to the
   smelter, and the abundance of most species increased in all pollution
   zones, including the slightly polluted and background zones. However,
   the frequency and abundance of the species still go down as the distance
   to the smelter decreases. The explerent species Tuckermanopsis sepincola
   demonstrates the opposite response: it disappears from background and
   slightly polluted areas reaching maximum abundance in the extremely
   severe pollution zone.},

Abstract = {The development of methods for exclusion or reduction of the abundance
   of the target group in a field experiment is one of the important
   methodological tasks in studying the interactions of soil fungi and
   invertebrates. The possibility of using cypermethrin in order to reduce
   the abundance of invertebrates during the research of interaction with
   mycorrhizal fungi was studied in two model coniferous forests (in the
   reserves ``Kivach{''} and the Central Forest State Reserve). A
   short-term (30 days) experiment showed a significant decrease in the
   abundance of soil invertebrates and no differences in the mycelium
   biomass of mycorrhizal fungi. In a longer experiment (90 days), the
   effect of soil defaunation was similar, but the production of mycelium
   of mycorrhizal fungi decreased compared to the control. The method of
   soil defaunation with cypermethrin is effective, but can be recommended
   for use only in short-term field experiments.},

Abstract = {The forest-steppe ecotone in southern Siberia is the natural transition
   zone from the dry steppe in the south to the wetter taiga in the north,
   where tree growth is increasingly limited due to drought. Within this
   zone, tree growth limitation is expected to intensify due to ongoing
   climate changes, reducing forest productivity, affecting tree
   physiological processes and increasing tree mortality, with potential
   implications for the regional and global carbon cycle. We explored Pinus
   sylvestris L. tree ring growth and structure response to climate in
   southern Siberia. We measured tree-ring width (RW) and xylem parenchyma
   represented as the percentage of ring surface occupied by parenchyma
   rays (PERPAR) and the total amount of ray parenchyma per sample width
   (TOTRAY) within the growth rings for the 1967-2018 period. The results
   showed an influence of environmental conditions before and during the
   formation of ray parenchyma, with an independent climate response from
   the observed in the RW. Therefore, pine xylem parenchyma-based
   chronologies have potential as a proxy to evaluate climate sensitivity
   in P. sylvestris. However, the dependence on climate conditions might
   affect ray parenchyma's critical role in conifers as P. sylvestris under
   the current temperature-induced drought trend in the forest-steppe.},

   different adaptation strategies of halophytes significantly differ in

Abstract = {The current state of forest stands has been assessed in the most
   polluted part of East Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT) formed as a result
   of the Kyshtym accident in 1957. The main radionuclide in this area is
   Sr-90, with soil contamination density varying from 70 to 67 450
   kBq/m(2). Birch grass forests dominate in this territory, and more than
   85\% of them are aged between 70 and 120 years. Pine forests are
   relatively rare, with tree age reaching 80-110 years in 58\% of these
   stands. The average age of birch forests proved to decrease with an
   increase in the density of soil contamination with Sr-90, which was
   explained by the increasing proportion of young birch stands formed in
   the most contaminated areas 25-30 years after the accident. No
   significant dependence of relative forest density and timber stock on
   the level of soil contamination with Sr-90 in different allotments was
   revealed. A comparison of timber stock recorded in 2003 and 2020 showed
   that this parameter was increasing more rapidly in the most contaminated
   plots due to active growth of young birch stands in these areas during
   the corresponding period. Assessing natural forest regeneration in the
   EURT area, it was found that tree regrowth is formed in most sites,
   which is potentially capable of ensuring further development of forest
   ecosystems. The emergence of pine regrowth was observed for the first
   time in plots closest to the epicenter of the accident, where all pine
   trees perished during the acute radiation period. These samples
   contained an increased proportion of plants with morphological
   abnormalities. No dependence of the rate of tree die-off on the soil
   contamination density with Sr-90 was revealed. The assessment the loss
   of trees and natural regeneration of forests was difficult due to fires
   that occur regularly in the EURT area.},

Abstract = {Siphocampylus flavescens is a new species endemic from the Serra Negra
   region, in the Serra da Mantiqueira complex, in Minas Gerais state,
   Brazil. It is characterized mainly by being a polycarpic decumbent
   subshrub, with whorled phyllotaxis (usually three leaves per node), and
   by its entirely yellow corolla, which differentiates S. flavescens from
   all other Brazilian species of Siphocampylus. Morphologically, it is
   more related to S. fluminensis, from which it can be distinguished
   mainly by the entirely yellow corolla (vs. bicolor, with the tube
   reddish and the lobes yellowish or greenish). Minor differences include
   the equally denticulate leaf margin, with reduced teeth, the reduced
   widely obconic hypanthium, and the rounded capsule of S. flavescens
   (unequally denticulate to fimbriate leaf margin, larger obconic
   hypanthium, and obconic capsules in S. fluminensis). The new taxon is
   here described. We provide a distribution map, photographs, and an
   identification key to the Siphocampylus species found in Minas Gerais
   state. We also informally propose the inclusion of S. flavescens in the
   IUCN Red List as an Endangered (EN) species due its small area of
   occurrence and the growing human impact in the region.},

Title = {The Genetic Diversity of Triploid Celtis pumila and its Diploid
   Relatives C. occidentalis and C. laevigata (Cannabaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {441-451},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Celtis in eastern North America shows puzzling patterns of
   variation. While three species are generally recognized, many authors
   have suggested hybridization may be blurring the boundaries among them.
   Suspected hybridization between C. occidentalis and C. pumila has
   hampered conservation planning for the latter, which is a Threatened
   species in Canada. Using microsatellite markers and flow cytometry, we
   assessed the relationship between genetic diversity, ploidy, and
   morphology in this group. We confirmed the presence of two diploid
   species, C. occidentalis and C. laevigata, and that they do hybridize
   where they co-occur in southern Missouri and Illinois. We found two
   triploid genetic groups. These groups had distinct geographic ranges,
   but were morphologically very similar, corresponding to C. pumila.
   Furthermore, the triploid groups were characterized by a small number of
   heterozygous multi-locus genotypes. A single genotype dominated
   populations across Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, indicating
   apomictic reproduction is common in these groups. While the triploid
   clusters were distinct from each other, they did have strong
   associations with sympatric diploid species, and also with the western
   triploid species C. reticulata. However, we found no evidence of
   hybridization or gene flow between diploid C. occidentalis and triploid
   C. pumila. This removes hybridization and introgression as a
   complicating issue for conservation management. The intermediate forms
   observed are a demonstration of remarkable phenotypic plasticity, with
   the same triploid genotype variously presenting as dwarf shrubs in
   xeric, exposed sites, and subcanopy trees in mesic forests.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-84},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Diastatea (Campanulaceae-Lobelioideae) is a genus of small, herbaceous
   annuals found mostly in Mexico. Differences in the number of recognized
   species in the historical treatments, and the lack of a phylogeny,
   suggested that a revision of the genus was necessary. Species boundaries
   and species level relationships were tested based on a sampling of
   nearly 50 individuals. Sequences of the chloroplast spacer regions,
   atpB-rbcL and ndhF-rpl32, as well as the ITS, were generated and then
   analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The
   analyses of the separate datasets produced congruent topologies. Two
   strongly supported clades of Diastatea are newly recognized as subgenera
   in the taxonomic treatment. Diastatea Scheidw. subg. Diastatea and
   Diastatea subg. Angustifolia E.P.Johnson \& T.J.Ayers can be
   distinguished morphologically by leaf shape and pubescence, hypanthium
   shape, and the presence or absence of a gibbous projection on the
   ventral side of the corolla. A morphological treatment of the genus
   corroborated by the molecular analysis revealed one new species,
   Diastatea aptera E.P.Johnson \& T.J.Ayers, one new subspecies, Diastatea
   tenera subsp. durangensis E.P.Johnson \& T.J.Ayers, and elevated an
   existing subspecies, Diastatea ciliata (McVaugh) E.P.Johnson \&
   T.J.Ayers, to specific rank.},

Abstract = {The features of the restoration of the diversity of plant communities

   2006-2020, restorative successions on the territory of the Tagil zone of
   the Middle Urals were observed on nine sites, five of which were fallow
   lands, and four were overgrown anthropogenic pits. In the course of
   direct observations of the communities of fallow lands and pits, four
   groups of phytocenoses were identified, reflecting successive stages of
   succession: gramineous phytocenoses with maintaining their status during
   the study period; gramineous phytocenoses with subsequent transition to
   the meadow stage; and early meadow and formed meadow phytocenoses. The
   temporal dynamics of their species composition and alpha diversity was
   studied. Differences in indicators of diversity of communities
   associated with their successional age and physicochemical parameters of
   soils (agrozems and technozems) were established. Communities of
   agrozems and technozems differed in the rate of change in alpha
   diversity indicators. The increase in these indicators occurred
   significantly faster on agrozems than on technozems. The transition
   between stages was not accompanied by a significant increase in the
   diversity of communities on technozems.},

Abstract = {The influence of the color and brightness of the surroundings on the
   body coloration was studied for juveniles of giant freshwater prawn
   Macrobrachium rosenbergii. In the first experiment, prawns were kept for
   10 days in containers with white, gray, black, green, blue, and red
   backgrounds; in the second, for 30 days in containers with red, gray,
   and blue backgrounds. The color indices at the end of the experiments
   were evaluated for abdomen, branchiostegites, and rostrum in the CIELab
   color space. When the color of the background changed, the brightness
   component of color elements changed as well in juveniles of M.
   rosenbergii. This effect was most pronounced against a black background.
   The chromatic indices of coloration also changed, indicating involvement
   of the prawn's color vision in the regulation of body coloration. The
   change in the chromatic indices of body coloration was less pronounced,
   and the changes were statistically significant only in a longer
   experiment.},

Abstract = {Inner Mongolia Hanma National Nature Reserve without human disturbance
   is a natural laboratory for the study of Larix gmelinii forest because
   it has well-preserved coniferous forests in cold temperate zone in
   Northeast China. Fifty-eight plots were set up in nature reserve to
   examine the most important local environment factors involved in spatial
   distribution of Larix gmelinii forest communities. Based on field
   investigation, there were 5 association groups in Larix gmelinii forest
   including Community I (Larix gmelinii-Betula platyphylla-Vaccinium
   vitis-idaea+ Ledum palustre), Community II (Larix gmelinii-Pinus
   pumila-Vaccinium vitis-idaea), Community III (Larix
   gmelinii-Rhododendron dauricum-Vaccinium vitis-idaea), Community IV
   (Larix gmelinii-Vaccinium vitis-idaea+ Ledum palustre), Community V
   (Larix gmelinii-Betula fruticosa-Ledum palustre). Larix gmelinii in
   Community IV has larger Diameter at breast height of trees and
   relatively little regeneration seedlings. The content of soil total
   carbon, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus in Community III
   reached highest value among all the association groups. Species richness
   showed significantly negative correlation with elevation and slope,
   meanwhile, positive correlation with soil total phosphorus. Species
   evenness showed significantly positive correlation with elevation and
   slope, meanwhile, significantly negative correlation with soil total
   nitrogen and phosphorus. Redundancy analysis showed a better explanation
   for vegetation distribution pattern and indicated that elevation, slope,
   soil pH and aspect played significant roles in community assembly. The
   study provided a reference for Larix gmelinii forest ecosystem
   protection and a theoretical basis for scientific management in similar
   areas.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of the species richness, breeding density, and structure of
   the community of birds occupying nest-boxes upon a 50-fold reduction of
   atmospheric emissions from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter was analyzed
   based on long-term continuous observations (1989-2020). The total
   density in the deciduous forest was lower in the heavily polluted zone
   (impact zone) than in the background zone, while there were no
   differences in the coniferous forest between the zones. The total
   breeding density of the community of hole-nesters increased in the
   impact zone over the 30 years (especially, in the deciduous forest in
   2010-2020) after the significant reduction of industrial emissions. The
   breeding density of the two most abundant species varied in different
   directions: it increased for pied flycatcher and decreased for common
   redstart. This led to a change of dominants in the impact zone: redstart
   dominating until 2012 was replaced by pied flycatcher. The differences
   in the dynamics of species density are probably determined by the
   beginning of vegetation recovery near the smelter, which is favorable
   for pied flycatcher but not for redstart.},

Abstract = {Owing to the high resolving power and efficiency of DNA sequencing,
   researchers have discovered the extremely high diversity of bacterial,
   fungal, protist, and microinvertebrate communities in the soil, wood,

   these communities require powerful tools for analyzing multicomponent
   systems. One of them is the analysis of ecological networks, which makes
   it possible to solve a broad range of problems. This review briefly
   describes the possibilities of network analysis, its concepts, and
   metrics of network topology. It also indicates limitations related to
   specific features of DNA sequencing (compositionality and data sparsity)
   and potential sources of errors in the interpretation of results (relic
   DNA, artifactual DNA sequences and spurious connections in a network).
   The focus is on the communities of microorganisms, but the discussed
   issues are relevant for most other groups of the biota.},

Abstract = {A new method for assessing the response of biota to climatic changes in
   the ecosystem has been tested. In the Central Forest Natural Biosphere
   Reserve, the average annual air temperature between 1990 and 2019 was
   4.8 +/- 0.13 degrees C (increasing at a rate of 0.35 degrees C per 10
   years), and the amount of precipitation was 781 +/- 22.9 mm/year (22.6
   mm per 10 years). A significant change in the timing of the seasonal
   activity has been determined for 11 phenological phenomena in nine bird
   species (52\%). The clustering of phenological events in birds depends
   on the pattern of their seasonal migrations, the effect of agro- and
   hydrometeorological and trophic factors, and on whether spring or autumn
   phenological dates are used. Along with multivariate statistical
   methods, the integral index based on the standardized deviation makes it
   possible to unify the meteorological series and phenological traits on a
   biologically and statistically sound basis for improving the sensitivity
   of indicative properties of the biota under conditions of climatogenic

Abstract = {Data are presented on the results of geobotanical studies along a
   27.7-km permanent transect across the northern Volga-Akhtuba floodplain
   on which 88 geobotanical sampling plots are located. The transect was
   established in 1955, before the largest hydroelectric complexes were
   built on the Volga. As a result of their operation, the annual average
   floodwater discharge to the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain has decreased by
   10-15\% since 1959, amounting to 40-45\% of the total annual water
   discharge. The water released from the Volgograd Reservoir falls from
   high height, has much kinetic energy, and its impact leads to deepening
   of the Volga riverbed in the northern part of the floodplain. Therefore,
   the same volumes of releases from the reservoir during floods result in
   increasingly lower rise in water level and, as a consequence, reduction
   in the inundated floodplain area. The results of surveys in 1982, 2008,
   and 2019 showed that xerophytization of vegetation in the floodplain
   region crossed by the transect has progressed during the 64-year period.
   Changes in the vegetation caused by the impairment of moisture
   conditions in the floodplain are accompanied by successions of
   phytocenoses resulting from invasion by new species. Among them, the
   North American species Fraxinus pennsylvanica has the most significant
   effect on the natural vegetation.},

Title = {A Generic Taxonomic Synopsis of the Pleurophyllum Clade (Asteraceae:
   Astereae: Celmisiinae) with the Recognition of the New Zealand Endemic
   New Genus Macrolearia},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {607-634},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The Pleurophyllum lade is one of two main clades within subtribe
   Celmisiinae (Astereae) and includes 10 species almost entirely
   restricted to New Zealand (one species also occurs in the Australian
   Macquarie Islands), with seven of them confined to Stewart
   Island/Rakiura and the outlying Chatham and subantarctic islands. The
   Glade is defined by its purple to dark red cyathiform disc corollas,
   which are absent from the other members of Celmisiinae. A new generic
   taxonomy of the Glade is presented here with the recognition of three
   genera: Pleurophyllum with three species, Damnamenia (monotypic), and
   Macrolearia, a new genus segregated from Olearia, which is described
   here to accommodate the six species and one hybrid previously known as
   the ``macrocephalous olearias.{''} The main morphological differences
   between the three genera lie in the growth form, trichome types of
   leaves and disc corollas, morphology of the style branches,
   presence/absence of staminodes, and cypselae morphology. These
   morphological differences are also discussed within subtribe, tribe, and
   family contexts, and special consideration is given to the use of the
   ``megaherb growth form{''} concept for Pleurophyllum. The allopatric
   distribution of the three recognized genera is also stressed. Seven new
   combinations: Macrolearia angustifolia, Macrolearia oporina, Macrolearia
   semidentata, Macrolearia chathamica, Macrolearia colensoi, Macrolearia
   lyallii, and Macrolearia x traillii, and five new synonyms are proposed,
   and four names are lectotypified. Taxonomic keys are provided for genera
   and species.},

Title = {Phylogenetic Relationships of Tovomita (Clusiaceae): Carpel Number and
   Geographic Distribution Speak Louder than Venation Pattern},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {102-108},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Tovomita is a Neotropical clade of Clusiaceae that includes 52 species
   widely distributed throughout the Amazon, Atlantic, Antilles, and
   Chocoan/southern Mesoamerican rainforests. Species-level relationships
   within Tovomita remain largely unexplored, thus hindering our
   understanding of their biogeography and the evolution of key
   morphological characters in the genus. Here, we inferred a plastid
   genome phylogeny containing 18 Tovomita species using maximum likelihood
   and Bayesian inference approaches. Our results indicate that current
   infrageneric classification of Tovomita, which relies largely on leaf
   venation, does not reflect phylogenetic relationships. Instead, we
   identify carpel number as a more reliable morphological trait for
   infrageneric classification: clades within Tovomita tend to include
   species that possess either four or five (or more) carpels. Moreover,
   groups of species within Tovomita tend to exhibit a high degree of
   geographic endemicity corresponding to their clade affiliation: species
   within these clades are restricted to either Amazon or Atlantic forests.
   The well supported clade of Atlantic forest inhabitants we identify is
   sister to a clade of mostly Amazonian species that also includes Amazon
   and Atlantic forest disjunct species, which are more closely related to
   Amazonian than to other Atlantic forest species. These findings
   represent a first important step in elucidating morphological evolution
   and biogeography in this widespread genus of neotropical rainforest
   trees and shrubs.},

Abstract = {Piptolepis is an endemic genus of the Brazilian Central Plateau. It
   comprises 13 species, almost all of them microendemic and poorly
   collected. They are shrubs, subshrubs, or treelets, with leaves
   displayed in a typical pad-like sheath, the heads are solitary or
   organized in a pseudoglomerule, or rarely a syncephalium (second-order
   inflorescence), with weakly imbricate phyllaries. As a preliminary
   result of an ongoing taxonomic revision of Piptolepis, we hereby report
   three new species. P. corymbosa is similar to P. leptospermoides, while
   P. pilosa resembles P. ericoides, and Piptolepis procumbens is similar
   to P. campestris. These new species are described and illustrated, their
   taxonomic affinities are discussed, and the informal conservation status
   for each is assessed.},

Abstract = {Three new species of Eriocaulaceae, endemic to the Serra da Canastra in
   Minas Gerais state, are described. Paepalanthus petraeus is assigned to
   P. ser. Paepalanthus, differing within the series by its thickened stem
   accumulating leaf sheaths, linear leaves, and numerous scapes shorter or
   equaling the leaf height and bearing capitula with brown involucral
   bracts. Paepalanthus sinuosus belongs to P. subsect. Polyactis and is
   distinguished by few scapes in lax fascicles, more than twice as long as
   the leaves, which are patent to slightly recurved, and light brown
   involucral bracts with acute apex. Syngonanthus culcitosus, within S.
   sect. Syngonanthus, is unique due to its elongate and branched stem
   forming dense mats, simple inflorescences, cream-colored involucral
   bracts equaling the length of the floral disc, and gynoecium with
   nectariferous appendages. Comparisons with the most similar species are
   provided for each new taxon. Maps, photographs, and illustrations are
   presented, together with comments on phenology, distribution, habitat,
   and morphology. Paepalanthus petraeus and P. sinuosus are likely to be
   assessed as Critically Endangered, and S. culcitosus as Vulnerable,
   according to IUCN criteria.},

Title = {Phylogeny of the Styracaceae Revisited Based on Whole Plastome
   Sequences, Including Novel Plastome Data from Parastyrax},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {162-174},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships among 11 out of the 12 genera of the
   angiosperm family Styracaceae have been largely resolved with DNA
   sequence data based on all protein-coding genes of the plastome. The
   only genus that has not been phylogenomically investigated in the family
   with molecular data is the monotypic genus Parastyrax, which is
   extremely rare in the wild and difficult to collect. To complete the
   sampling of the genera comprising the Styracaceae, examine the plastome
   composition of Parastyrax, and further explore the phylogenetic
   relationships of the entire family, we sequenced the whole plastome of
   P. lacei and incorporated it into the Styracaceae dataset for
   phylogenetic analysis. Similar to most others in the family, the
   plastome is 158189 bp in length and contains a large single-copy region
   of 88085 bp and a small single-copy region of 18540 bp separated by two
   inverted-repeat regions of 25781 bp each. A total of 113 genes was
   predicted, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and four
   rRNA genes. Phylogenetic relationships among all 12 genera of the family
   were constructed with 79 protein-coding genes. Consistent with a
   previous study, Styrax, Huodendron, and a clade of Alniphyllum +
   Bruinsmia were successively sister to the remainder of the family.
   Parastyrax was strongly supported as sister to an internal clade
   comprising seven other genera of the family, whereas Halesia and
   Pterostyrax were both recovered as polyphyletic, as in prior studies.
   However, when we employed either the whole plastome or the large- or
   small-single copy regions as datasets, Pterostyrax was resolved as
   monophyletic with 100\% support, consistent with expectations based on
   morphology and indicating that non-coding regions of the Styracaceae
   plastome contain informative phylogenetic signal. Conversely Halesia was
   still resolved as polyphyletic but with novel strong support.},

Title = {Synthesizing Existing Phylogenetic Data to Advance Phylogenetic Research
   in Orobanchaceae},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {533-544},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {To date, no comprehensive phylogenetic analyses have been conducted in
   Orobanchaceae that include both a wide sampling of genera and a large
   sampling of species. In addition, a lack of fossil evidence in the Glade
   precludes the use of primary fossil calibrations for divergence time
   estimation, preventing the establishment of a comprehensive temporal
   framework for use in macroevolutionary studies. Here, we use a recently
   developed set of tools for synthesizing publicly available data, apply
   these to reconstruct a comprehensive timetree for Orobanchaceae, and
   then investigate diversification dynamics in this Glade of mostly
   parasitic plants using two model based methods. The assembled
   supermatrix included more than 900 species, representing approximately
   40\% of the known species diversity of the family, and the resulting
   phylogeny largely confirmed relationships revealed in earlier studies;
   however, we identified ten non-monophyletic genera that will require
   focused systematic attention to resolve. Diversification rate analyses
   found substantial support for character-dependent diversification, with
   elevated rates in hemiparasitic clades, and evidence for a number of
   speciation rate changes throughout the tree that are likely linked to
   other traits. Importantly, our multi-state HiSSE (Hidden State
   Speciation and Extinction) analysis revealed that transitions to a
   parasitic lifestyle only occur when there is a prior transition in an
   unobserved precursor state. For Orobanchaceae, our study provides a new
   comprehensive framework for the Glade that can serve as a stepping-stone
   for future macroevolutionary studies.},

Abstract = {It is generally believed that cliffs bear low biodiversity because of
   their harsh habitats. However, another reason, i.e. insufficient
   investigation caused by the inaccessibility of the cliffs, could not be
   excluded. In the genus Aster, two cliff species, Aster fanjingshanicus
   and Aster tianmenshanensis, respectively growing on slate and limestone
   cliffs, were previously described. During our extensive field
   investigations, a third cliff species of Aster growing on granite cliffs
   from eastern China was found. Based on evidence from molecular
   phylogeny, morphology and micro-morphology, we propose that it should be
   treated as a new species and named Aster sanqingensis. It is described
   and illustrated here. Considering its limited number of individuals,
   highly localized distribution, and disturbed habitat, we propose to
   treat it as a Critically Endangered species. Our new finding indicates
   there is cryptic biodiversity on the cliffs remaining to be discovered.},

Abstract = {Espeletia saboyana, a new species from Paramo de Saboya, Boyaca
   department, Colombia, is described and illustrated. It is a caulescent
   rosette up to 5 m tall, with whitish-cinereous appearance, sessile
   leaves with elliptic laminae, cymose capitulescences with aphyllous
   unbranched portion and 3-5 capitula, 5-13 phyllaries, the external ones
   17.4-26.0 nun long, 49-92 ray florets 13.0-18.4 mm long, and 162-347
   disc florets 8.2-12.2 mm long. Espeletia saboyana is similar to E.
   incana, but with longer laminae, bigger foliar area, and fewer ray
   floret series. It is also similar to E. murilloi, but with longer ray
   tubes, ray paleae, disc corollas, disc styles, disc anther appendages,
   and disc paleae. In addition, E. saboyana is distributed allopatrically
   in regard to E. incana and E. murilloi. This species is informally
   proposed to be listed as IUCN Critically Endangered (CR), since it is
   restricted to a single population with extent of occurrence =1.83 km(2)
   and area of occupancy = 0.48 km(2). Besides, this population is severely
   fragmented into 40-50 demes, the largest one covering only 34,000 m(2).
   Most demes are found in humid soils and wetlands submitted to continuous
   habitat deterioration as water is drained for use in agriculture.
   Espeletia saboyana is rare or absent in these newly drained areas, which
   are either colonized by other species that thrive on drier soils or
   transformed into pastures for cattle grazing. Furthermore, analyses of
   size class distributions show that recruitment rates of E. saboyana are
   significantly lower in small demes, which, if not reversed, can further
   reduce population size in the near future.},

Title = {Description of Four New Species of the Habenaria repens Complex

   Phylogenetic Approach},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {The Habenaria repens complex comprises ca. 14 species distributed from
   the southern United States to northern Argentina. In Brazil, several
   morphotypes with similar ecological preferences to H. repens s. s.
   occur, which have made identification at the specific level challenging.
   In an associated article using molecular phylogenetic, morphometry, and
   population genetic analyses, we showed that the H. repens complex is
   polyphyletic and subdivided into three main distantly related clades.
   Four of the studied morphotypes are phylogenetically distant from H.
   repens s. s. and morphologically distinct from all other taxa in the
   complex. They are described here as H. bryophila, H. hygrophila, H.
   subrepens, and H. compluviosa. Similarly to H. repens s. s., these newly
   proposed species show preferences for aquatic environments, but differ
   in habitat specificity, phenology, and morphology. The new taxa are
   restricted to upland, wet grasslands associated with campos rupestres
   occurring in the Espinhaco Range in the states of Minas Gerais and
   Bahia, or other mountainous areas of Minas Gerais and Goias. We provide
   a diagnosis with detailed morphological characterization for each
   species, including etymology, distribution, informal conservation
   assessments, data on habitat and phenology, notes, images, and
   diagnostic characters to separate them from each other and H. repens s.

Abstract = {During a taxonomic and phylogenetic study of Xylopia from the Amazon
   River basin, South America, we examined collections from the Brazilian
   states of Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, and Tocantins that
   resembled Xylopia nitida by some characteristics of the leaves, but
   differed consistently from the latter in a number of floral and fruit
   characters. On the basis of these specimens we describe here a new
   species, Xylopia maasiana. The new species is a small to medium-sized
   tree encountered mostly in riparian habitats across the southern
   Brazilian Amazon and in some transition areas between the Amazon forest
   and cerrado biomes in Central Brazil. In addition to the detailed
   description, we include a preliminary assessment of conservation status,
   taxonomic comments, illustrations, a distribution map of the new
   species, and comparison with X. nitida.},

Abstract = {Daustinia montana (Convolvulaceae) is the only species of the genus, and
   is notable for its wide leaf variability. To understand whether this
   plasticity is correlated with the distribution of the species, linear
   morphometric and leaf contour analyses were performed. Specimens from
   herbaria were photographed, and pre-established linear measurements were
   made. A multivariate analysis was then performed to test the strength of
   associations among morphological characteristics, climatic variables,
   and distribution of the species. Elliptic Fourier analysis based on 20
   harmonics was used to generate shape descriptors, resulting in ninemain
   components. With elliptic Fourier descriptors, a grouping tree was
   created that suggests the existence of six morphotypes in D. montana.
   Moreover, clustering analysis revealed two large groups distinguished
   mainly by leaf width. The present findings indicate that the morphotypes
   are strongly related to latitude and that other characteristics such as
   the type of indumentum are related to climatic variables.},

   a Morphologically Coherent Clade},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {794-801},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {We describe and illustrate Paepalanthus fabianeae, a new species of
   Eriocaulaceae from the central portion of the Espinhaco Range in Minas
   Gerais, Brazil. Previous phylogenetic evidence based on analyses of
   nuclear (ITS and ETS) and plastid (trnL-trnF and psba-trnH) sequences
   revealed P. fabianeae as belonging to a strongly supported and
   morphologically coherent clade containing five other species, all of
   them microendemic, restricted to the Espinhaco range. Due to the
   infrageneric classification of Paepalanthus being highly artificial, we
   preferred not assigning P. fabianeae to any infrageneric group.
   Paepalanthus fabianeae is known from two populations growing in campos
   rupestres (highland rocky fields) in themeridional Espinhaco Range. The
   species is characterized by pseudodichotomously branched stems, small,
   linear, recurved, and reflexed leaves, urceolate capitula, and bifid
   stigmas. Illustrations, photos, the phylogenetic position, and a
   detailed description, aswell as comments on habitat, morphology, and
   affinities with similar species are provided. The restricted area of
   occurrence allied with threats to the quality of the habitat, mainly due
   to quartzite mining, justifies the preliminary classification of the new
   species in the Critically Endangered (CR) category using the guidelines
   and criteria of the IUCN Red List.},

Abstract = {A comparative study of four Coriaria nepalensis (hereafter Coriaria)
   dominated sites has been conducted to evaluate the facilitation effects
   on tree and shrub characteristics and soil nutrients. A gradient of
   Coriaria abundance (level 1-4) has been established and the sites have
   been arranged in order of increasing abundance of Coriaria. In this
   study, compared to the lowest abundance level, the tree species richness
   increased by 43\% and the shrub species richness increased by 25\% at
   the highest abundance level of Coriaria, indicating that the effects of
   Coriaria have been consistent and strongly positive on the species
   richness. The tree and the shrub density have also been increased along
   with increasing abundance of Coriaria while the tree and the shrub basal
   area have been decreased. The population structure and the regeneration
   status have suggested that regeneration of tree species has been
   facilitated by Coriaria in low abundance sites and inhibited in high
   abundance sites. These findings suggest that changes in soil
   characteristics that occur after the Coriaria colonization facilitate
   growth and regeneration of the associated woody vegetation. However,
   with increasing abundance of Coriaria, there is a shift from
   facilitation to inhibition, thus the changes in dominance of species and
   species composition of the vegetation.},

Abstract = {The current state of zoobenthos communities has been studied in a large
   Siberian river, namely, the Chulym River. Bioindication indices have
   been calculated to determine the water quality. The use of the integral

   system in compliance with the Russian standards. The high water quality
   ({''}conventionally clean{''}) has been recorded in the middle reaches,
   where the river is semi-mountainous, as well as in the zone of its
   transformation from the semi-mountain type to the lowland type.
   Deterioration of the water quality ({''}dirty{''} water) has been
   recorded in the lowland reaches. It is shown that the assessment of the
   ecological state of water bodies using bioindication methods should take
   into account natural environmental factors, in particular, the type of
   bottom sediments.},

Abstract = {Species diversity of the overstory, understory, undergrowth, ground
   vegetation layer, and the taxocene of ground beetles (Coleoptera:
   Carabidae) was assessed in forest ecosystems of Southern Primorye with
   different degrees of disturbance. Diversity estimates were obtained in
   13 permanent test plots established in nominally primary forests and
   forests affected by selective logging and fires. The results of ANOVA
   showed that the corresponding groups of plots significantly differed
   from each other in the species composition of the overstory, understory,
   and undergrowth and in Shannon index values for the overstory,
   understory, and ground beetle taxocene. The Jaccard index of floristic
   similarity for species of the ground vegetation layer was below 0.1 in
   comparisons between test plots within the groups of Korean pine and oak
   forests and ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 in comparisons between these groups,
   indicating a radical change in the composition of herbaceous plants
   after pyrogenic forest transformation. The numbers of ground beetles
   were higher in oak forests, but Shannon index for their taxocene was
   higher in Korean pine forests. It is concluded that moderate selective
   logging does not lead to significant changes in the species composition
   of forests, whereas regular fires in forests are a hazard to their
   biological diversity.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are regarded as a global environmental problem.
   The role of cyanobacteria in the food web of water bodies is still
   unclear. We have carried out an experimental study of invertebrate
   trophic relationships during the bloom of the cyanobacterium
   Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The key links of the food web-plankton,
   microperiphyton, detritus, and benthic invertebrates-were collected for
   stable isotope analysis of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15)
   after 20-day exposure in mesocosms simulating the conditions of the
   near-shore biotope of the Rybinsk Reservoir without cyanobacteria
   (variant I) and with high abundance of cyanobacteria (variant II).
   Statistically significant differences in the delta N-15 values for
   crustaceans (Cladocera, Copepoda, Asellus aquaticus and Gmelinoides
   fasciatus), and mayfly larvae have been revealed between the variants:
   these values were 1-4 parts per thousand lower in the variant with
   cyanobacteria than in the variant without them. The
   cyanobacteria-induced shifts in the delta N-15 value for consumers
   indicate an assimilation of diazotrophic nitrogen and incorporation of
   cyanobacterial nutrients into their food chains.},

Title = {Ignored Biodiversity in Acid Soil Islands in Karst Areas, South China:
   Impatiens longlinensis (Balsaminaceae), a New Critically Endangered
   Species},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The karst area in South China is notable for its fragile vegetation and
   unique flora with many narrow endemic species, and is one of the most
   threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world. However, the biodiversity
   of acid soil areas scattered in the karst area have previously been
   underestimated. With a recent increase of new discoveries of plants and
   animals, the conservation of biodiversity in these acid soil areas has
   become urgent. This study deals with a new species, Impatiens
   longlinensis. The new species is similar to I. yui and I. lasiophyton in
   having pubescence, two lateral sepals, funnelform lower sepal, and
   linear capsule. But it can be distinguished by having orbicular to
   obovate dorsal sepals and oblong to elliptic lower and upper lobes of
   lateral united petals. Moreover, molecular data and micro-morphological
   evidence also support that the species is new to science. The new
   species is only known from a valley near the summit of Mt. Jinzhongshan
   within an area of less than 5 km(2). Based on the Red List categories
   and criteria developed by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature, and the threat posed by exploitation for tourism development, we
   categorize it as Critically Endangered (CR).},

Title = {Investigating Phylogenetic Placement and Species-Level Relationships in
   a Recent Radiation of Mentzelia section Bartonia (Loasaceae) from the
   Mojave Desert},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-151},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding species level relationships is a central goal in
   systematic botany; however, complexes of closely related and
   morphologically similar species often pose considerable challenges to
   that goal. The North American west is home to many notable genera that
   notoriously have difficult species complexes (e.g. Astragalus,
   Eriogonum, Penstemon). Mentzelia section Bartonia (Loasaceae), another
   example of a group with difficult species complexes, is a recently
   evolved and diverse clade that occurs across the North American west.
   Phylogenetic studies have resolved many relationships across Mentzelia,
   but the relationships within a species complex of perennial, subshrub
   species that occurs in the Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado
   Plateau remains elusive. This arid-adapted clade, which is referred to
   as the Mojave clade, has significant conservation implications due to
   three narrowly endemic species: Mentzelia polita and Mentzelia tiehmii
   are state listed, and Mentzelia leucophylla is federally listed. Species
   relationships within the Mojave clade are not fully understood.
   Populations of Mentzelia oreophila from California and Nevada, for
   example, are not monophyletic. We generated restriction site associated
   DNA sequence data (RADSeq) to address evolutionary relationships in the
   Mojave clade. Our results corroborated previous studies in continued
   recognition of Mentzelia polita, Mentzelia leucophylla, and Mentzelia
   tiehmii; however, Mentzelia oreophila was recovered in three clades that
   includes a California clade, a Nevada clade, and one with Mentzelia
   puberula. Incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization might have
   generated conflicting phylogenetic signal between Mentzelia oreophila
   and Mentzelia puberula. Increasing population level sampling will aid in
   species delimitation and further help to understand how gene flow and/or
   hybridization is influencing population level dynamics in the Mojave
   Desert.},

Abstract = {All Viburnum species produce drupes with a hardened endocarp surrounding
   a single seed. Endocarp form varies greatly within Viburnum, and
   differences in shape have long been used to distinguish major subclades.
   Here we trace the evolution of Viburnum endocarp shape using
   morphometric analyses and phylogenies for 115 Viburnum species. Endocarp
   measurements were obtained from fruits sampled from herbarium specimens
   and from field collections, and shapes were analyzed using elliptical
   Fourier analysis. We infer that the first viburnums had flattened and
   grooved endocarps. Subsequently, there were multiple losses of grooving
   in conjunction with shifts to both highly flattened and nearly round
   endocarps. In several clades the parallel evolution of a derived
   endocarp shape was accompanied by changes in a suite of other fruit
   traits, yielding distinctive fruit syndromes likely related to bird
   dispersal. However, in other clades endocarp shapes similar to the
   ancestral form have been retained while other fruit traits (color,
   amount of flesh, nutritional content) have diverged. We quantify cases
   of parallel evolution in endocarp shape that cut across recognized fruit
   syndromes such as red, carbohydrate-rich fruits with flattened endocarps
   or blue, lipid-rich fruits with round endocarps. Our analyses now invite
   studies of function and the selective factors that have yielded the
   distinctive suites of fruit and seed traits that distinguish the major
   Viburnum lineages.},

Abstract = {Artocarpus bergii, named for the late C. C. Berg, is from Halmahera in
   the Moluccas, and is a close ally of breadfruit (A. altilis). The
   species resembles the Micronesian A. mariannensis but with generally
   smaller parts. Because it is known from only a small area and the type
   locality is a potential mining site, A. bergii is likely of conservation
   concern, particularly given its status as a crop wild relative.},

Abstract = {Several taxonomic novelties of the genus Sisyrinchium have been
   presented recently, so for some specialists this reveals the need of
   more systematic studies on the genus to better understand its diversity.
   They have also pointed out some regions as those of more priority to be
   explored. One of these is northwestern Mexico, in which after a
   floristic inventory in a Natural Protected Area in Sierra Madre
   Occidental, a new species was discovered. It is here described and
   illustrated as Sisyrinchium jacquelineanum, and diagnosed against S.
   polycladum, the morphologically most similar species. It differs from
   this by the growth habit, position of root thickenings, absence of
   fibrous remnants of old leaves at the base of the stem, flower size, and
   in the shape and pubescence of the capsules. An identification key for
   the 16 species of Sisyrinchium present in the Sierra Madre Occidental
   and an analysis of their richness patterns throughout this province are
   also provided.},

Title = {Two New Endemic Tetraploid Species of the Genus Isoetes from the

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {301-305},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Isoetes cipoensis and I. longifolia, two new endemic tetraploids from
   the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), are described, illustrated, and
   compared to their similar species. Isoetes cipoensis can be
   distinguished by a set of characters such as flaccid, straight, and
   erect leaves, deltate labia, presence of conspicuous sclerified
   phyllopodia, baculate megaspores with frequent long spine-like
   macroelements, and distally echinate microspores. Isoetes longifolia is
   characterized by having a fully submerged habitat in the river, flaccid,
   long leaves (70-100 cm long), oblong labia, uniformly baculate
   megaspores, and densely echinate microspores. Importantly, chloroplast
   genomes already published for the species further support their
   phylogenetic distinctness in comparison to other species from the
   tropical region in Brazil. This study provides a key and distribution
   map for the species from the Brazilian savanna and scanning electron
   microscopy images of the mega- and microspores for the new species.
   These species are only known from their type location. We suggest I.
   cipoensis and I. longifolia should be classified as Data Deficient (DD)
   and Endangered (EN) species, respectively, based on the IUCN criteria.},

Abstract = {We continue the taxonomic reevaluation of Aphyllon sect. Aphyllon by
   describing a widespread species throughout western North America
   previously recognized within a polyphyletic A. fasciculatum. To support
   our description and revised key, we analyzed fifteen continuous and
   discrete characters sampled from 186 herbarium specimens and iNaturalist
   observations representing the geographic and host ranges. Principal
   component and multiple correspondence analyses reveal clear variation in
   floral characters. Discriminant analyses show that three aspects of
   floral color, corolla lobe tip shape, the calyx cup to calyx lobe ratio,
   calyx lobe length, and degree of bend in the corolla tube are useful
   distinguishing features, but not diagnostic in every case.},

Abstract = {``Plant blindness{''} is affecting humans' relationships with plants,
   which has negative consequences for both science and conservation. It
   is, therefore, important to find new ways to promote societal interest
   in botany and plants. One possibility is encouraging the use of informal
   settings to promote curiosity and provide education to students. Forest
   fragments can be regarded as open air labs for teaching botany,
   especially on university campuses. We aimed to formally document the
   angiosperm diversity in the Mata dos Saguis (MS), a fragment of Atlantic
   forest under restoration belonging to the central campus of the Federal
   University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil. We recorded 140
   species, 113 genera in 52 families, and 24 orders of angiosperms. The MS
   has nearly 10\% of the species and one third of all the families
   occurring in the entire state of Rio Grande do Norte, representing the
   main evolutionary groups of angiosperms, and we also recorded two new
   species occurrences for the state. Here we provide a checklist of the
   MS, a location that has been used as an open-air laboratory by many UFRN
   undergraduate courses in biosciences. We also share examples that can be
   replicated in other institutions and discuss the process of learning
   systematic botany in floristically rich countries by means of
   alternative and hands-on experiences.},

   Euphorbia tithymaloides In The Caribbean},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {We examine investment in male function in the context of geography and
   floral morphology in the plant ring species Euphorbia tithymaloides,
   which colonized the Caribbean from Mexico/Guatemala along two fronts
   that roughly correspond to the Greater and the Lesser Antilles and that
   meet in the vicinity of the Anegada Passage. Our results on investment
   in pollen relative to ovule production are consistent with E.
   tithymaloides relying on pollinators for reproduction across its range
   in the Caribbean. We document a geographic pattern of reduction in
   anther number and pollen:ovule ratios in populations of E. tithymaloides
   towards the Anegada Passage, which is consistent with a possible
   geographic transition towards a mixed breeding systemwhere selfing has
   increased importance in this area where its two expansion fronts meet.
   The reduction in pollen production is correlated with inflorescence
   morphology, which converges to relatively shorter cyathia towards the
   Anegada Passage along both fronts. We discuss alternative scenarios and
   potential drivers of the patterns we document.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have identified four major clades
   within the fern genus Tectaria but none of them is supported by any
   morphological characters. Here we present an expanded phylogeny of
   Tectaria based on five plastid markers (atpB, ndhF + ndhF-trnN, rbcL,
   rps16-matK + matK, and trnL-F), with a particular focus on the species
   from Asia to the Solomon Islands. Our aims are to infer the systematic
   position of newly included species, providing insights to interspecific
   relationships of some species groups, and to determine the identity of
   some specimens with distinct morphology. As a result, three major clades
   and a total of 14 lineages are identified in Asia to the Solomon
   Islands. The 19 newly sampled species were well resolved in the
   phylogenetic tree, of which T. lobbii (representative of rare rheophytes
   in Tectaria) was confirmed as belonging in the T. angulata-T.
   vanikoroensis lineage. Four new species from the Solomon Islands, T.
   acrophoroides , T. glenniana , T. pallescens , and T. vanikoroensis ,
   are recognized and described. Phylogenetic and morphological evidence
   suggests frequent hybridizations between T. crenata and T. decurrens
   from Malesia to the Solomon Islands, and between T. devexa and T.
   simonsii in mainland Asia and adjacent islands, which render the obscure
   species boundaries within the two groups.},

Abstract = {Justicieae is one of the largest tribes of Acanthaceae, composed of 2000
   species distributed in 100 genera, with highest diversity in the
   neotropical region. Palynological studies containing several
   representatives of the tribe are rare, specially species from
   Northeastern Brazil. The present study aims to differentiate species and
   evaluate palynological characters in the light of a phylogenetic
   hypothesis of Justicieae. Eighteen species belonging to six genera were
   analyzed. Pollen grains were acetolyzed, measured and photographed under
   light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pollen
   grains are medium to very large in size, isopolar, planaperturate,
   subprolate, prolate to prolate spheroidal, and two-colporate to
   three-colporate, or with six pseudocolpi. The exine ornamentation is
   microreticulate to reticulate with areolae between the apertures in most
   species. Some species present a cavea in the mesocolpium. The pollen
   morphology of Justicia chamaedryoides, J. congrua, J. glaziovii, J.
   thunbergioides, J. sphaerosperma, Pseuderanthemum congestum, and P.
   modestum are hereby described for the first time. A new combination is
   also proposed, Thyrsacanthus angustissimus.},

Abstract = {The genus Stigmatodon occurs in vertical and bare granite slopes,
   typical of the inselbergs of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Here, we
   present the first broad phylogenetic analysis focused on Stigmatodon,
   sampling a total of 83 terminals, including 16 of the 20 species of the
   genus and the morphologically similar species of Vriesea. We conducted a
   phylogenetic analysis using two plastid markers (matK and rps16-trnK)
   and the nuclear gene PHYC to infer phylogenetic relationships and
   reconstruct ancestral states for ecological and morphological
   characters. Our results suggest the monophyly of Stigmatodon as
   originally circumscribed is only possible with the inclusion of
   morphologically and ecologically similar Vriesea species. In addition,
   the morphological and anatomical traits led us to propose a new
   circumscription for the genus, combining eight species of Vriesea to
   Stigmatodon as S. andaraiensis, S. freicanecanus, S. lancifolius, S.
   limae, S. oliganthus, S. pseudoliganthus, S. vellozicolus, and S.
   zonatus. The stomata positioned above the ordinary epidermal cells, the
   adaxial water-storage parenchyma with axially elongated cells, the
   stamens positioned in two groups of three on each side of the corolla,
   and the tubo-laciniate stigma are exclusive to Stigmatodon in its new
   circumscription. These new morphological and phylogenetic results
   constitute a relevant contribution to the taxonomy and evolution of
   Bromeliaceae, one of the most diverse and ecologically important
   families of flowering plants of the Neotropics.},

Abstract = {The genus Paraphlomis (Lamiaceae) consists of approximately 30 species,
   most of which are restricted to the subtropical area of China. In this
   study, P. longicalyx Y.P.Chen \& C.L.Xiang, a new species from southern
   China, is described and illustrated. Molecular phylogenetic analyses
   implemented based on two nuclear ribosomal DNA and four plastid DNA
   regions showed that P. longicalyx is a distinct lineage from all
   morphologically similar species within the genus. Morphological
   examination demonstrated that the new species is most similar to P.
   javanica and P. foliata, but can be distinguished from these species by
   its densely hispidulous surfaces, much longer calyces, and pale-yellow
   corollas with reddish-purple spots on the lower lips.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Abstract = {Cereinae comprises 14 genera distributed in Neotropical dry forest
   formations such as in the Caatingas of northeastern Brazil or in rocky
   outcrops in the north of southeastern Brazil. Historically, the taxonomy
   of the group has been very controversial, especially regarding generic
   circumscriptions, and phylogenetic relationships within the group are
   still poorly understood. To investigate the delimitation of the subtribe
   and infra-subtribal relationships, we performed a phylogenetic analysis
   including 50 taxa representing 13 genera using one nuclear (PhyC) and
   four cpDNA (petL-psbE, trnL-trnT, trnS-trnG, and rpl16) regions. Our
   results show a monophyletic Cereinae with high support in Bayesian,
   maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses based on combined
   matrices. Although our results expand the knowledge of generic
   relationships, we emphasize the need for further molecular phylogenetic
   studies combined with ecological evidence to clarify relationships at
   the more inclusive nodes of the subtribe.},

Abstract = {Lasiocarpus is a genus of bisexual, dioecious, or trioecious shrubs or
   small trees of Malpighiaceae endemic to the seasonally dry tropical
   forests of the Pacific slopes of Mexico. In this paper the monophyly of
   this genus is tested using a molecular phylogeny based on three plastid
   (ndhF, matK, rbcL) and a single nuclear (PHYC) markers that were newly
   sequenced for the three currently accepted species in this genus, along
   with representative taxa from the main phylogenetic groups previously
   recognized in Malpighiaceae. The three species of Lasiocarpus were
   retrieved in a well supported clade corroborating the monophyly of this
   genus. A taxonomic treatment of this genus is presented. Lasiocarpus
   ovalifolius is synonymized with L. salicifolius, and a new species,
   Lasiocarpus andersoniorum, endemic to Southern Mexico, is proposed. It
   is morphologically distinguished by characters such as axillary
   inflorescences, reflexed sepals, petals with crenate margin and strigose
   indumentum, large styles, and 2-lobed stigmas. The taxonomic revision
   includes morphological descriptions and distribution maps for the three
   accepted species of Lasiocarpus.},

Abstract = {Populations of Carex sect. Rhynchocystis (Cyperaceae) from the
   Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores and Madeira) have traditionally been
   treated either as a variety of the widely distributed Western Palearctic
   C. pendula, or directly synonymized under it. However, recent
   phylogenetic studies have shown that Azorean populations of C. pendula
   display a certain degree of differentiation from mainland plants, while
   the phylogenetic relationships of Madeiran populations remain unclear.
   Here we perform an integrated systematic study focused on the
   Macaronesian populations of Carex sect. Rhynchocystis to elucidate their
   phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status. We reconstructed a
   molecular phylogeny based on five DNA regions and conducted a
   multivariate morphological analysis. Divergence time estimates show that
   the Macaronesian populations can be traced back to a Plio-Pleistocene
   origin. Our results suggest that these island populations of C. pendula
   are better treated as two distinct species within Carex sect.
   Rhynchocystis (i.e. C. leviosa from the Azores and C. sequeirae from
   Madeira). We provide morphological characters to differentiate the new
   species from C. pendula s. s., detailed descriptions of the three taxa,
   a revised key for the entire section, as well as detailed analytical
   drawings of the two newly described species. We also perform a critical
   evaluation of the taxonomic diversity of Carex in the Azores and
   Madeira. Finally, we informally assessed the conservation status of the
   new species at a global scale under IUCN categories and criteria,
   resulting in the proposal of the categories Least Concern for C. leviosa
   and Critically Endangered for C. sequeirae.},

Abstract = {A new gesneriad species, Didymocarpus vickifunkiae is described here
   from the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The new species is
   morphologically similar to D. aureoglandulosus, but differs from it in
   having a corolla tube with indumentum, eglandular and ovate to
   oblanceolate bracteoles, slightly broader calyx lobes, and a bearded
   anther. We provide a detailed morphological description of the newly
   described species along with images and compare it with species that are
   morphologically similar to it. Here, we also lectotypify D.
   aureoglandulosus and provide a brief history on its collection and
   taxonomy. Finally, we provide a dichotomous identification key for all
   the Didymocarpus species from Mizoram, India.},

Abstract = {Antiphytum charruasorum, a new endemic species from western Uruguay, is
   described. This is the only South American species in the genus with
   white corolla and an infra-medial cicatrix on the ventral face of the
   eremocarp, both features shared with the North American species of
   Antiphytum, in sharp contrast with the blue corolla and the basal
   cicatrix at the end of a stipe-like prolongation that characterizes all
   South American species in the genus. Antiphytum charruasorum increases
   the diversity of the genus in South America, as well as the endemism and
   distribution range into Uruguay. Moreover, this new species adds novel
   features in Antiphytum such as the irregularly dichasial inflorescences,
   the hirsute faucal appendages, the eremocarps with a tissue plug from
   the gynobase, and the habitat where the species has been reported.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {802-811},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Flora endemic to the cold habitats of the Northern Hemisphere provide
   important models for investigating diversification and disjunctions,
   given both the intense climatic fluctuations of these areas in the
   recent past and the fascinating biogeographic patterns of
   today'sArcticalpine plant communities. Micranthes Haw. (Saxifragaceae),
   a clade of small-flowered herbaceous flowering plants comprising;80
   species, is an ideal group for investigating the evolution and
   diversification of plants in montane and Arctic ecosystems. Micranthes
   has proven to be a particularly challenging clade to unravel
   taxonomically due in part to rampant auto- and allopolyploidy,
   hybridization, and cryptic speciation. With the goal of providing an
   updated conspectus for this group, we build upon a recent large
   phylogenomic analysis to help elucidate the evolution of Micranthes.
   Here, we present new downstream analyses including diversification
   analyses, biogeographical reconstructions, and a comparison of methods
   for dating phylogenomic data sets. To complement these new analyses, we
   also synthesize chromosomal variation, new observations regarding
   morphology and species identification, comprehensive field studies, and
   an extensive review of the literature for Saxifragaceae and Micranthes.
   A new perspective on the systematics and taxonomy of Micranthes is
   provided.},

Abstract = {This paper presents Artocarpus buyangensis , a newly-described species
   known only from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. A member of Artocarpus
   subgenus Artocarpus phylogenetically placed near A. section Artocarpus
   series Rugosi, A. buyangensis most closely resembles Artocarpus
   elasticus and A. sericicarpus, neither of which is found east of the
   Moluccas. The new species thus represents a substantial eastward
   expansion for the A. series Rugosi clade. Long-distance dispersal,
   perhaps by birds, is suggested as a possible explanation for the origin
   of A. buyangensis .},

Abstract = {Amblyanthus chenii (Primulaceae; Myrsinoideae) is a new species
   discovered growing in the understory of primeval forests in Medog
   County, southeast Xizang, China and is described based on morphological
   evidence. This is the first generic record of Amblyanthus in China. The
   new species is most morphologically similar to A. multiflorus.
   Amblyanthus chenii can be easily distinguished from other congeneric
   species by various morphological differences. A phylogenetic analysis
   based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and six plastid markers indicated that A.
   chenii and Amblyanthopsis burmanica form a clade that is nested within
   the large pantropical genus Ardisia and is sister to Ardisia subgenus
   Crispardisia. The close relationship among Amblyanthus, Amblyanthopsis,
   and Ardisia subg. Crispardisia is strongly supported by their shared
   synapomorphy of crenulate leaves with marginal glands.},

Title = {A Revision of Chusquea sect. Serpentes (Bambuseae, Bambusoideae,

Abstract = {The Neotropical woody bamboo genus Chusquea consists of 193 currently
   described species ranging from central Mexico and the Caribbean to Chile
   and Argentina, primarily in montane habitats. The six previously
   described species of Chusquea subg. Chusquea sect. Serpentes are
   scandent in habit, with infravaginal branching, few subsidiary buds per
   complement, and foliage leaves that tend to be relatively large compared
   to those of other members of Chusquea s.s. A review of available
   material of Chusquea sect. Serpentes, found throughout montane forests
   from Mexico south to the central Andes in Peru, revealed at least two
   undescribed species. One of the new species, Chusquea recurvata, is
   native to Venezuelan montane forests and is distinguished from Chusquea
   serpens by having circular central buds, asymmetrical, acute inner
   foliage leaf ligules, and 6-12 foliage leaves per complement. The other
   new species, Chusquea acutigluma, has been found only in and around the
   Risaralda gorge in Colombia, and differs from all other known South
   American species of Chusquea sect. Serpentes by its broadly open
   paniculate synflorescences. This paper includes (re-)descriptions of all
   known species of Chusquea sect. Serpentes, along with detailed
   photographs of the two newly described species, and a vegetative
   morphological key to the eight species belonging to the section. The
   morphology and foliage leaf micromorphology and anatomy of the two newly
   described species are compared to C. serpens, to which they show the
   greatest macromorphological similarity.},

Title = {Insights into Species Delimitation of Selected Species in the Flowering
   Plant Genus Medicago section Buceras (Leguminosae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {431-440},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Medicago (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) contains about 90
   species including the important forage crop alfalfa Medicago sativa and
   the genomic model Medicago truncatula. Despite intensive research on the
   genus because of its agricultural importance, there is a relative lack
   of information about chromosome number and genome size in some Medicago
   species, especially those from Medicago section Buceras that were
   formerly placed in the sister genus Trigonella, and are paraphyletic to
   the remainder of the genus Medicago. Past studies revealed that previous
   species delimitations did not conform well with complex patterns of
   morphological or genetic variation. Some published chromosome numbers,
   e.g. 2n = 28 and 2n = 44, differ from those of the rest of the genus,
   which are mostly 2n = 16 or polyploids thereof, although some cases of
   aneuploid reduction or dysploidy (e.g. 2n = 14) do exist. Here we
   estimated phylogenetic relationships of 42 accessions corresponding to
   14 currently recognized Medicago species that are paraphyletic to the
   remainder of Medicago with a focus on Medicago monantha; for a number of
   those accessions we obtained estimates of genome size (39) and
   chromosome number (14). We can confirm the delimitation of two species
   within M. section Buceras and our data suggest that there are at least
   two entities with distinct geographic distributions within the currently
   recognized species M. monantha, which differ in chromosome number and
   genome size. Our data also suggest that polyploidy and post-polyploid
   descending dysploidy played a significant role in genome evolution
   within M. section Buceras. Our data provide a strong foundation for
   whole-genome sequencing projects and further in-depth research of these
   paraphyletic lineages.},

Abstract = {Neocalyptrocalyx (Capparaceae) is a Neotropical genus that comprises
   eleven species that occur in the lowlands of Brazil, Guyana, French
   Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, and Ecuador. The study of collections
   deposited in herbaria added to field observations allowed the
   recognition of three species as new to science, and those are formally
   presented here: Neocalyptrocalyx aequatoriensis, known only from eastern
   Ecuador, Neocalyptrocalyx atlanticum from the Atlantic Forest, and
   Neocalyptrocalyx polycataphyllus from the Brazilian Amazonia.
   Neocalyptrocalyx aequatoriensis represents the new westernmost boundary
   for the genus and the first generic record for Ecuador. We present
   diagnoses, descriptions, ink illustrations, field photos, distribution
   maps, notes on ecology, habitat, morphology, phenology, conservation
   status, and a key to distinguish the new species from related species.},

Abstract = {Fossil fruits of Symplocos (Ericales: Symplocaceae) are here recognized
   from the Pliocene of Guasca, Colombia, based on specimens formerly
   attributed to Cordia (Cordiaceae, Boraginales). Symplocos vera (Berry)
   comb. nov. is represented by 19 lignitized fruits. The fossils are
   recognized as belonging to Symplocos primarily by their woody endocarps
   that are apically truncate and that possess 3 to 5 apical germination
   pores and locules, and a central vascular canal extending the length of
   the endocarp. In several key characters they are highly congruent with
   the endocarps of the extant Neotropical clade S. ser. Symplocos. Some of
   the extant species in the series are variably 3- to 5-locular; 4-locular
   endocarps are otherwise rare in Symplocos, and 5-locular endocarps
   appear to be unique to this series. Symplocos vera is the only
   specifically named record of fossil Symplocos fruits with accessible
   voucher specimens from South America. The younger Neogene age of the
   fossils relative to those attributed to S. ser. Symplocos from the late
   Eocene of Texas, along with a report of Colombian fossil endocarps from
   the middleMiocene, supports the North America to South America migration
   inferred for this clade from molecular phylogenetic data.},

Abstract = {Ongoing research on the taxonomically complex genus Cheilanthes
   (Pteridaceae; Cheilanthoideae) has resulted in the identification of a
   new species from Loja Province in Ecuador, Cheilanthes ecuadorensis,
   described and illustrated herein. Originally collected in 1988 and
   identified as C. cf. rufopunctata, C. ecuadorensis is clearly distinct
   from that species in having pubescent adaxial blade surfaces and narrow,
   poorlydifferentiated false indusia (rather than the glabrous adaxial
   surfaces and wide false indusia of C. rufopunctata). Among the South
   American species currently included in Cheilanthes, C. ecuadorensis is
   superficially most similar to C. pilosa. However, our molecular
   phylogenetic analyses indicate that C. ecuadorensis is sister to C.
   micropteris, the morphologically disparate generitype of Cheilanthes.
   Here we examine the phylogenetic relationships, morphology,
   cytogenetics, and geography of these four South American Cheilanthes
   species in a study that, once again, highlights the importance of
   herbaria in the process of new species discovery.},

Title = {Evolution of Chromosome Number in Wild Onions (Allium, Amaryllidaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-346},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Polyploidy has been shown to be a significant driver of diversification
   among land plants. In addition to whole-genome duplication, other common
   mechanisms of chromosome number evolution include increases by a
   multiple of 1.5 in chromosome number due to the fusion of gametes with
   different ploidy levels (demi-polyploidy), gains or losses of single
   chromosomes that alter the DNA content of an organism (aneuploidy), or
   chromosome fission or fusion (ascending dysploidy or descending
   dysploidy, respectively). Considering the high variability in chromosome
   number transitions across multiple clades within angiosperms and the
   ancient genome duplication events responsible for their diversity, more
   studies of large polyploid systems are necessary to close the gaps in
   understanding chromosomal evolution in polyploid plants. Allium L.
   (Amaryllidaceae) is an ideal candidate for polyploid research because it
   is a large clade that includes numerous natural populations of diploid
   and polyploid species. Species of Allium mainly occupy temperate
   climates in the Northern Hemisphere and include economically important
   ornamentals and cultivated crops such as leeks, garlic, chives, and
   onions. Here, we used a molecular phylogeny of Allium to examine
   chromosomal evolution with chromEvol v. 2.0 which uses likelihood-based
   methods for inferring the pattern of chromosome number change across a
   phylogeny. The best-fit model of chromosomal evolution indicated that
   chromosome transitions within Allium occurred through the constant gains
   and losses of single chromosomes as well as demi-polyploidization
   events, with the rate of chromosome gain events being approximately 2.5
   to 4.5 times more likely to occur than demi-polyploidization and loss
   events, respectively.},

Abstract = {We describe two new species of Calibrachoa (Solanaceae) from southern
   Brazil grasslands. The new species were first detected by molecular
   data, and later corroborated by morphological traits and field
   observations. Both species are erect shrubs with showy purple corollas.
   The main distinctive morphological traits are the marked dark purple
   ring contrasting with the yellow corolla throat and the lobed stigma in
   C. atropurpurea, and the long androecium reaching the distal part of the
   corolla tube and the connivent anthers in C. synanthera. A key for the
   species with purple flowers from the Rio Grande do Sul Brazilian State,
   where the species were found, is given.},

Abstract = {Oenothera sect. Pachylophus has proven to be a valuable system in which
   to study plant-insect coevolution and the drivers of variation in floral
   morphology and scent. Current species circumscriptions based on
   morphological characteristics suggest that the section consists of five
   species, one of which is subdivided into five subspecies. Previous
   attempts to understand species (and subspecies) relationships at a
   molecular level have been largely unsuccessful due to high levels of
   incomplete lineage sorting and limited phylogenetic signal from slowly
   evolving gene regions. In the present study, target enrichment was used
   to sequence 322 conserved protein-coding nuclear genes from 50
   individuals spanning the geographic range of Oenothera sect.
   Pachylophus, with species trees inferred using concatenation and
   coalescent based methods. Our findings concur with previous research in
   suggesting that O. psammophila and O. harringtonii are nested within a
   paraphyletic Oenothera cespitosa. By contrast, our results show clearly
   that the two annual species (O. cavernae and O. brandegeei) did not
   arise from the O. cespitosa lineage, but rather from a common ancestor
   of Oenothera sect. Pachylophus. Budding speciation as a result of
   edaphic specialization appears to best explain the evolution of the
   narrow endemic species O. harringtonii and O. psammophila. Complete
   understanding of possible introgression among subspecies of O. cespitosa
   will require broader sampling across the full geographical and
   ecological ranges of these taxa.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {477-497},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Acalypha (Euphorbiaceae: Acalyphoideae) is a large, monophyletic genus
   distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, with a few
   species extending into temperate areas of southern Africa, Asia, and
   North and South America. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships
   within the genus using DNA sequences from the plastid ndhF and trnL-F
   regions and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region, sampling 142 species to
   represent the geographic, morphologic, and taxonomic diversity with the
   genus, resulting in a 162 (158 in Acalypha) terminal and 3847 character
   combined dataset. Bayesian and maximum likelihood reconstructions based
   on the combined dataset yielded a tree with a generally well-supported
   backbone and several strongly supported clades. Our results strongly
   supported the monophyly of Acalypha subg. Acalypha as currently
   recognized but showed that A. subg. Linostachys and almost all other
   infrageneric taxa recognized in the most recent comprehensive
   classification of the genus were not monophyletic. We therefore propose
   a new subgeneric classification comprising A. subg. Acalypha, A. subg.
   Androcephala, A. subg. Hypandrae, and A. subg. Linostachys (s.s.). Our
   results also shed light on relationships within some species groups,
   including in what has been treated as a broadly defined A. amentacea, in
   which we recognize A. amentacea, A. palauensis comb. nov., and A.
   wilkesiana as distinct species. Bayesian ancestral state estimations
   based on the phylogeny of Acalypha demonstrated that inflorescence
   position and sexuality and habit show high homoplasy, especially within
   A. subg. Acalypha, and that inflorescence position and habit exhibit
   correlated evolution.},

   connate with the leaves on only one side, and vittae absent with only a
   region of larger leaf cells in the mid-lower portion of the leaves
   (vitta-like), distinguishes B. amadoi from the similar B. gracilis. The
   new taxon is placed within the key for the identification of species
   from the Brazilian Amazon domain, and represents an addition to the rich
   endemic flora of the Brazilian Amazon mountains of the Guiana Highlands.
   A detailed illustration of the new species is included, and also its
   informal conservation assessment.},

Abstract = {Mimosa is a species-rich genus with about 600 species distributed mainly
   in the Neotropics. Mimosa is especially diverse in the Cerrado where the
   genus shows high levels of endemism, but it is also represented in the
   Caatinga (the Brazilian seasonally dry vegetations). Four new species
   are described here, M. emaensis and M. sevilhae from the Cerrado, M.
   afranioi from the Caatinga, and M. robsonii from the Atlantic domain. We
   assessed their informal conservation status and two species would likely
   be categorized as Endangered (EN), one as Vulnerable (VU) to extinction,
   and one as Data Deficient (DD).},

Title = {Examining the Needle in the Haystack: Evolutionary Relationships in the
   Mistletoe Genus Loranthus (Loranthaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {403-415},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Loranthus (Loranthaceae) consists of ca. nine Old World
   species distributed from eastern Asia to Europe. Loranthus, the type of
   the family, has had a complex taxonomic history that continues today,
   partly because most mistletoes in the family have resided in this genus.
   For this reason, there are over 1800 Loranthus species names, the vast
   majority of which are synonyms for mistletoes in other genera. The
   present work sampled representatives of nine species considered bona
   fide members of the genus. Using complete plastome sequences, nuclear
   ribosomal DNA, and mitochondrial 26S rDNA, phylogenetic gene trees were
   generated to assess interspecific relationships. The Loranthus plastomes
   ranged in size from 121 to 125 kb and exhibited the quadripartite
   structure seen in most Santalales. These plastomes have lost or
   pseudogenized 24 genes, including all of the NADH dehydrogenase complex,
   thus reducing the genomes to ca. 90 functional genes. Cladistic analyses
   of morphological characters were conducted and these trees compared to
   the molecular trees, thus informing which taxonomic characters best
   define clades and characterize species within the genus. Two major
   clades in Loranthus were identified. The Europaeus clade includes the
   deciduous species L. europaeus, L. grewingkii, L. lambertianus, and L.
   tanakae mostly distributed above 30 degrees N latitude. The Odoratus
   clade, mostly distributed below 30 degrees N latitude, included L.
   guizhouensis, L. kaoi, L. odoratus, and L. pseudo-odoratus. The latter
   four species are genetically closely related, show percurrent (vs.
   pseudo-dichotomous) branching, and have evergreen leaves. Unisexual
   flowers have apparently evolved independently in each of the two clades.
   Future work should focus upon the species delimitation in the Odoratus
   clade and whether hybridization is occurring among any members.},

Title = {Biogeography of ITS Variation in the Helenium autumnale (Asteraceae)
   Species Complex},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {235-247},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {We used ITS sequences as species barcodes to evaluate 127 samples of 12
   Helenium species from the eastern and central USA, focusing on a species
   complex of H. autumnale (76 sequences from 11 U.S. states and two
   Canadian provinces), the federally ``threatened{''} H. virginicum, now
   recommended for delisting (30 sequences from three U.S. states), and H.
   flexuosum (11 sequences from four U.S. states). ITS sequences confirmed
   most species identifications and supported the presence of the first
   population of the ``threatened{''} endemic Missouri-Virginia disjunct,
   Helenium virginicum, in Indiana. Because the Indiana plants grow in a
   restored wetland, have a cpDNA haplotype previously known only from
   Missouri, with a morphology similar to Missouri variants, and an
   herbarium search for additional populations in Indiana found none, it is
   unclear whether the Indiana population is natural or planted. The
   presence of a putative sister lineage to H. virginicum thought to exist
   on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, Canada, was not supported after
   sequencing 36 plants with the sister morphology that grew there along 18
   km of beach fens and finding they had H. autumnale sequences. Fine-scale
   biogeographic patterns of intraspecific sequence variation were found
   mostly in H. autumnale, with centers of different base site
   polymorphisms found in northern North America and the Missouri Ozarks.
   As in a previous study, we found DNA evidence of hybridization between
   Helenium species in Missouri. We offer hypotheses to explain the
   biogeography of North American Helenium, focusing on the three species
   that compose the H. autumnale species complex and suggesting that H.
   autumnale may be a compilospecies showing incomplete lineage sorting. We
   encourage exploration of more Helenium species and their conspecific
   populations in search of fine-scale ITS base site polymorphisms to
   reveal emerging lineages and resolve the origins and evolutionary
   implications of these biogeographic patterns.},

   state, in Brazil, restricted to few localities, inhabiting seasonal
   forests and outcrops in the Caatinga biome. It is morphologically
   related to S. luridifuscescens, sharing the papillose anthers without
   swollen connectives, but distinguished by the forked cymes with flowers
   congested at the apex, swollen calyx with shorter lobes, as well as
   shorter, sessile stamens. The morphology, geographic distribution,

Abstract = {The region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau hosts a remarkable biodiversity,
   including a plethora of endemics. There, the process of documenting
   biodiversity is still ongoing, and recently, an unusual plant of
   Gentiana section Frigida was discovered at Cuopu Lakes (Sichuan, China).
   Although Flora of China identified these specimens as G. algida based
   upon unmistakable traits (e.g. corolla colour and length, sessile
   flowers), it was obvious that the Sichuanese plants strongly differed
   morphologically from G. algida specimens from Siberia and North America.
   In order to clarify their relationships, we used an integrative
   approach, investigating not only morphological traits, but also
   phylogenetic relationships (based upon plastome and rDNA-cistron), as
   well as chloroplast structure. Whereas the rDNA-cistron phylogeny was
   poorly resolved, the plastome phylogeny was well supported in both
   Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses. Our findings
   indicate that the samples of G. algida from Cuopu Lakes are
   morphologically and genetically distinct from those collected elsewhere,
   supporting the recognition of a new species, G. susanneae. The new
   species differs from G. purdomii (another similar species) by having
   sessile flowers, and from G. algida by being a generally much taller
   plant with more and longer flowers, and by having a smaller calyx.
   Gentiana susanneae clusters with other species from the region of the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from which it differs morphologically, and is only
   distantly related to the G. algida/G. frigida Glade, which stems from a
   dispersal event out of Tibet. Based upon these solid lines of evidence,
   G. susanneae is described and illustrated (drawings and photographs). In
   addition, a conservation assessment and an identification key modified
   from Flora of China are provided.},

Title = {Phylogeny and Character Evolution of the Neotropical Fern Genus
   Cyclodium (Dryopteridaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Cyclodium is a neotropical fern genus with 13 species, most of them
   distributed in the Amazonian lowlands, particularly in the Guianan
   region and along the border with the Andes. It belongs to the
   polybotryoid clade of Dryopteridaceae, being unique within this clade by
   a combination of characters related to rhizome growth, leaf dimorphism,
   anastomosing venation, and peltate indusia. Here we present a molecular
   phylogenetic hypothesis for Cyclodium resulting from Bayesian and
   maximum likelihood analyses, using molecular sequences of five plastid
   markers. We also map 12 morphological characters and habit onto the
   resulting trees. Our results support Cyclodium as monophyletic and
   sister to Polybotrya. The presence of peltate indusia is the main
   character distinguishing Cyclodium. Our results also suggest that
   plesiomorphic conditions in Cyclodium are free venation (vs.
   anastomosing), creeping rhizomes (vs. erect or decumbent), highly
   dissected laminae (vs. 1-pinnate), monomorphic sterile and fertile
   fronds (vs. dimorphic), and pinnatifid apices (vs. conform).},

Abstract = {Populations of Balanophora from southern China are often identified by
   local botanists as B. laxiflora based on their long cylindric male
   inflorescence, subsessile male flowers with slender rudimentary bracts,
   and subdiscoid synandria. In this study, we clarify the identity of
   seven such populations based on morphological characters and
   phylogenetic analysis using nuclear 18S and ITS ribosomal DNA sequences.
   We confirmed the occurrence of dioecious populations of B. yakushimensis
   and two previously unrecognized species, which we describe here as B.
   parajaponica and B. appressa. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that B.
   parajaponica, B. yakushimensis, B. appressa, B. laxiflora, and the
   agamospermic B. japonica, formed a well resolved clade, viz. the B.
   laxiflora clade. The four dioecious species, although highly similar in
   the morphology of male inflorescence and flowers, can be separated by
   leaf morphology and arrangement, ovary color, and arrangement of female
   flowers. The species limit of B. laxiflora, however, remains unresolved.},

Abstract = {Most ecotoxicological studies on the toxicity of metals in soil are
   conducted using artificially contaminated soils, i.e., originally
   uncontaminated soils to which increasing amounts of metals are added in
   the form of soluble salts in a laboratory setting. This approach has
   been rightly criticized because of the difficulty of extrapolating the
   results to real field situations. In our literature review, all studies
   without exception demonstrated a higher toxicity of metals in
   artificially contaminated soils than in anthropogenically contaminated
   soils exposed to pollution a few decades ago. Therefore, the traditional
   approach to the analysis of metal toxicity in soils, which is based on
   metal enrichment, has become outdated; new studies with such soils
   cannot provide any original insights at this time. We encourage
   researchers of metal pollution from anthropogenic emissions to analyze
   dose-effect relationships using native field-collected soils, rather
   than adopting the standard approach, which is based on artificially
   contaminated soils.},

Abstract = {Winter CO2 fluxes in Central Siberian ecosystems have been measured
   using different methodological approaches: dynamic chamber measurements
   at the soil surface under snowpack (F-soil) and at the upper snowpack

Abstract = {Recent fieldwork in the Sierra Martin Garcia in southwestern Dominican
   Republic has yielded a new species of the American clade Castela
   (Simaroubaceae), Castela senticosa sp. nov., from seasonally dry
   tropical forest. This species has been collected from two separate
   localities, including Mole St. Nicolas in northwestern Haiti in 1929,
   but until now fertile material with both flowers and fruit was unknown.
   We provide a photographic plate and illustration, place it
   phylogenetically using plastome data, and compare it morphologically
   with close relatives. This increases the number of known species of
   Castela on Hispaniola from one to two, both of which are endemic but
   from different clades, and yields another species for the Greater
   Antilles, a known biodiversity hotspot and clear center of
   diversification for this group of arid-adapted, thorny shrubs. This work
   emphasizes that seasonally dry, tropical forests, although often
   understudied, house as yet undiscovered biodiversity and deserve far
   more comprehensive studies.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {The genus Castanea in North America contains several tree and shrub taxa
   of conservation concern. The two species within the group, American
   chestnut (Castanea dentata) and chinquapin (C. pumila sensu lato),
   display remarkable morphological diversity across their distributions in
   the eastern United States and southern Ontario. Previous investigators
   have hypothesized that hybridization between C. dentata and C. pumila
   has played an important role in generating morphological variation in
   wild populations. A putative hybrid taxon, Castanea alabamensis, was
   identified in northern Alabama in the early 20th century; however, the
   question of its hybridity has been unresolved. We tested the
   hypothesized hybrid origin of C. alabamensis using genome-wide
   sequence-based genotyping of C. alabamensis, all currently recognized
   North American Castanea taxa, and two Asian Castanea species at. 100,000
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. With these data, we generated
   a high-resolution phylogeny, tested for admixture among taxa, and
   analyzed population genetic structure of the study taxa. Bayesian
   clustering and principal components analysis provided no evidence of
   admixture between C. dentata and C. pumila in C. alabamensis genomes.
   Phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated that C.
   alabamensis forms a distinct group within C. pumila sensu lato. Our
   results are consistent with the model of a nonhybrid origin for C.
   alabamensis. Our finding of C. alabamensis as a genetically and
   morphologically distinct group within the North American chinquapin
   complex provides further impetus for the study and conservation of the
   North American Castanea species.},

Abstract = {Plants from Brazilian campos rupestres usually present morphological
   strategies that allow them to survive in extreme environments. However,
   in Chamaecrista (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae), one of the most diverse
   genera in the campos rupestres, needle-like leaflets are rare. Reviewing
   the species that present such leaf morphology, we describe Chamaecrista
   acicularis, a new species from the Canastra Range, in the southwestern
   region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses
   revealed that C. acicularis is not closely related to other quite
   similar needle-like leafleted species and that this trait evolved
   convergently. We also present comments on the phylogenetic relationships
   of needle-like leafleted species as well as the evolution of the leaflet
   amplitude, and a detailed description of C. acicularis alongside
   illustrations, photos, geographical distribution, a key to the
   needle-like leafleted species and taxonomic notes on similar species.
   Additionally, we expand the description of Chamaecrista strictifolia and
   present an informal conservation status for all needle-like leafleted
   species.},

Abstract = {Cecropia is a group of fast-growing pioneer trees that are important in
   forest regeneration and a common ant-plant mutualism in the Neotropics.
   To investigate the evolution of mutualism between Cecropia and
   associated ants, a phylogenetic framework is necessary. Cecropia species
   are difficult to distinguish morphologically and conventional genetic
   markers are insufficiently variable to resolve the phylogenetic
   relationships among species. Our study aimed to compare the phylogenetic
   utility of restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to prior
   work based on commonly sequenced gene regions. RAD sequence data
   resolved and supported species-level relationships better than previous
   studies. We identified a deeply divergent non-myrmecophytic Glade
   including C. sciadophylla and African Musanga. Results from
   geographically widespread and morphologically heterogenous C.
   obtusifolia and C. angustifoha suggest that current synonymy has lumped
   phylogenetically divergent lineages. Reconstruction of ant associations
   on the highly supported Cecropia phylogeny inferred equal probability of
   the ancestor of Cecropia being myrmecophytic or not. More intensive
   genetic study is needed to refine species concepts in Cecropia.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {A taxonomic treatment is herein provided for the six primarily
   Neotropical species of Vigna subg. Lasiospron. This subgenus is
   distinguished, in part, by its close relationship with Old World Vigna
   species, but rather than having an Old World Vigna floral asymmetry
   where distal floral parts can have a right-hand curvature (from a
   face-view perspective), distal parts of Vigna subg. Lasiospron flowers,
   like those of American Phaseolinae, curve to the left. Our proposed
   taxonomy reflects published phylogenetic analyses that resolve the Vigna
   subg. Lasiospron species in a subclade of the primarily Old World clade
   of species of Vigna sensu stricto. Vigna subg. Lasiospron is therefore
   distinctive in having a primarily neotropical distribution. Three of the
   six Vigna subg. Lasiospron species have an amphi-Atlantic distribution,
   which we suggest was achieved naturally by the ability of these species
   to disperse and colonize coastal habitats. Nomenclatural and taxonomic
   synonyms are reported, along with species descriptions and the
   biogeographical, genetic, and morphological evidence that argues for
   each of the six Vigna subg. Lasiospron species fitting a unified species
   concept.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {186-210},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Rogiera (Guettardeae, Rubiaceae) is a Neotropical genus distributed from
   Mexico to northern South America that includes shrubs, treelets, or
   trees, which were previously treated in the taxonomically controversial
   and confused Rondeletia complex. Rogiera can be recognized among other
   Rubiaceae by the combination of multiflowered inflorescences,
   heterostylous flowers, quincuncial corolla aestivation, a hairy ring at
   the corolla mouth, and capsular fruits with loculicidal dehiscence.
   Despite the recent taxonomic circumscription of Rogiera there is not a
   comprehensive taxonomic treatment to it. Moreover, regional floristic
   treatments disagree on the species circumscriptions, with discrepancies
   in the number of species of Rogiera from 11 to 20. Based on molecular
   and morphological evidence studied on field and herbarium specimens, we
   present a taxonomic revision of Rogiera. We recognize ten species;
   Mexico is the center of diversity with nine species, four of them
   endemic. An identification key, descriptions, distribution maps,
   nomenclatural history, phenological data, and illustrations of all the
   species in the genus are provided for the first time. Several names
   required lecto- or epitypifications designated here.},

Title = {Climatic Niche Dynamics of Three Widespread Cardiospermum (Paullinieae,

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The genus Cardiospermum comprises eight species distributed in the
   American continent, from central-eastern United States of America to
   central Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile; C. corindum, C. grandiflorum, and
   C. halicacabum are distributed worldwide. Howthese species spread to the
   African continent from the Americas and from Africa to the rest of
   theworld remains to be understood. Two hypotheses were tested in this
   study: the species would have colonized the African continent either
   naturally, through extreme long-distance dispersal, or via human
   activities. Our work considers the niche conservatism principle, which
   states that a species tends to retain aspects of its fundamental niche
   over space and time; however, a deviation (i.e. niche shift) may be
   detected, indicating that the ecological and evolutionary traits of the
   species change in response to environmental modifications. We compared
   the niche of each of the three species based on their known occurrences,
   both in the Americas and in the rest of the world, and on climatic
   variables. We performed an environmental niche modelling analysis for
   three periods: Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, and the present. In
   addition, a Principal Components Analysis of climatic variables
   associated with known occurrences was performed through the COUE scheme.
   Our results suggest an early migration of C. corindum and C. halicacabum
   from the Americas to Africa; therefore, these two species would be
   native to these ranges, as proposed in previous studies. In addition, a
   recent introduction event of C. grandiflorum to Africa, and from Africa
   to India, Asia, and Oceania, was detected, which confirms the invasive
   status of this species outside the Americas.},

   This species, restricted to the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve
   (situated in the central region of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil), is the
   second in the genus Macrotorus. The new species description is based on
   morphological and cytogenetic (karyotype and genome size) comparative
   analyses. We also report a new record of Macrotorus utriculatus for the
   state of Bahia, confirming a potential distribution modelling
   prediction, and provide comments for the conservation of both species.},

Title = {A New and Expanded Phylogenetic Analysis of Hyptidinae
   (Ocimeae-Lamiaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1086-1094},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Hyptidinae, ca. 400 species, is an important component of Neotropical
   vegetation formations. Members of the subtribe possess flowers arranged
   in variously modified bracteolate cymes and nutlets with an expanded
   areole and all share a unique explosive mechanism of pollen release,
   except for Asterohyptis. In a recent phylogenetic study, the group had
   its generic delimitations rearranged with the recognition of 19 genera
   in the subtribe. Although the previous phylogenetic analysis covered
   almost all the higher taxa in the subtribe, it lacked a broader sampling
   at the species level. Here we present a new expanded phylogenetic
   analysis for the subtribe comprising 153 accessions of Hyptidinae
   sequenced for the nuclear nrITS, nrETS, and waxy regions and the plastid
   markers trnL-F, trnS-G, trnD-T, and matK. Our results widely support the
   previous phylogenetic results with some changes in the support and
   relationship between genera. It also uncovers the need for a new
   combination of Eriope machrisae in Hypenia and the phylogenetic position
   of Hyptis sect. Rhytidea, which was demonstrated to be part of
   Mesosphaerum. The generic delimitation in Hyptidinae is discussed, and
   we recommend that further studies with more markers are needed to
   confirm the monophyly of Hyptidendron and Mesosphaerum, as well as to
   support taxonomic changes on the infrageneric delimitation within Hyptis
   s. s.},

Abstract = {In this study, five species of Cathedra (Olacaceae s. l.) were
   recognized, four of them endemic to Brazil and one widely distributed,
   occurring in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Venezuela.
   Cathedra rupestris, a new species described here, is endemic to campos
   rupestres (Cerrado) in the state of Bahia, and is differentiated from
   other species of the genus mainly by reticulate bark, length of pedicel
   in flower (1.5-2.2 mm), length of petals (3-3.5 mm), as well as by the
   proportion of the hypogynous disk in relation to the fruit, which in
   this species is limited to the base of the drupe. Regarding informal
   conservation status, C. bahiensis, C. grandiflora, and C. rubricaulis
   are suggested as Endangered, while C. acuminata and C. rupestris as
   Least Concern and Critically Endangered, respectively. Here the genus is
   reviewed, nomenclatural (one synonymization and two typifications) and
   geographic distributional updates are provided, in addition to an
   identification key, descriptions, and illustrations. Emended
   descriptions are also provided for two species.},

Title = {A Toxic Story: Phylogeny and Classification of Strychnos L.
   (Loganiaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {639-655},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Strychnos is a pantropical genus of Loganiaceae (Gentianales), with
   approximately 200 species, that lacks a detailed worldwide phylogenetic
   understanding until now. We investigated the global phylogeny of the
   majority of Strychnos species, and evaluated morphological and key
   character patterns to discuss congruence between phylogenetic clades and
   sectional classification systems. We included 147 ITS sequences across
   12 genera, with 127 samples (103 species) of Strychnos and 20 outgroup
   accessions (19 species) in a Bayesian analysis. Tribes Antonieae,
   Loganieae, and Spigelieae were supported as monophyletic, but Strychneae
   was resolved as polyphyletic due to the positioning of Gardneria placed
   outside of the Strychnos 1 Neuburgia clade. Strychnos was supported as
   strongly monophyletic with 12 strongly supported clades, but the
   relationships among many of these clades were not well resolved. Most of
   the 12 sections in the current infrageneric classification system of
   Strychnos were resolved as non-monophyletic, indicating the need for a
   revision of the sectional divisions. Characters common in species placed
   within the relatively more nested clades include a non-climbing habit,
   invasion of non-rainforest habitats, absence of tendrils, absence of
   secondary phloem, and elongated corolla tubes, suggesting that these
   characters are relatively derived conditions in the genus. Inflorescence
   position, fruit size, and fruit wall thickness are extremely variable
   and were distributed among various clades in our phylogeny. Stamen,
   pistil, seed and seed coat, and phytochemical characters have figured
   prominently in the taxonomy of the genus, but are as yet incompletely
   described, thus preventing significant inference about their evolution.
   Most of the 12 well-supported clades within Strychnos are restricted to
   specific continents, sometimes with limited dispersion between
   neighboring continents, suggesting a history of repeated cross-oceanic
   dispersal or vicariance patterns. The Neotropical clades nested within
   the African clades have the shortest branches and the most unresolved
   topologies, probably indicating relatively recent radiation in the
   Neotropics.},

   field expeditions to the Lajedo de Soledade archaeological site, in the
   state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, a new species of Pectis was found
   on rocky outcrops (lajedos) in the Caatinga. Pectis loiolae sp. nov.
   grows on limestone rocks in sedimentary substrate and is recognized by
   its prostrate habit with ascending branches terminating in a solitary
   capitulum, apex of the involucral bracts rounded, apiculate, and green
   becoming vinaceous in the apical 1/3, corolla of ray flowers (5) with
   abaxial surface vinaceous and adaxial white, disk flowers 8-10, and
   presence of stylopodium in the disk flowers. A morphological
   description, illustration, distribution map, habitat, conservation
   status, and a key for all Brazilian Pectis species are presented herein.},

Abstract = {A recent phylogenetic tree for the large paraphyletic genus Paepalanthus
   showed that the genus Actinocephalus is also paraphyletic with two
   species of Paepalanthus nested within it: Paepalanthus macrocephalus and
   Paepalanthus camptophyllus. These species have the diagnostic
   morphological traits of Actinocephalus, but they are too small to be
   seen in Paepalanthus macrocephalus and difficult to interpret in
   Paepalanthus camptophyllus, which has resulted in them being overlooked
   until now. Furthermore, Paepalanthus macrocephalus has a challenging
   circumscription, with several putative synonyms whose nomenclatural
   confusion has persisted for decades. Here we analyzed the morphology of
   Paepalanthus camptophyllus and Paepalanthus macrocephalus to confirm
   their relationship with other species of Actinocephalus as shown in the
   phylogeny and to investigate the diagnostic features that distinguish
   these species in Actinocephalus. The opportunity was also taken to
   evaluate putative synonyms of Paepalanthus macrocephalus and
   Paepalanthus camptophyllus, and to include the remaining variety of A.
   phaeocephalus (Paepalanthus phaeocephalus var. foliosus) in
   Actinocephalus, which was lacking in the revision of the genus. Four new
   combinations and eight lectotypes are provided, as well as six new
   synonyms. We also provide comments on diagnostic characteristics,
   distribution, and notes on Actinocephalus.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {1080-1085},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Sanchezia dubia is described and illustrated as a new species from the
   department of Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru. Its morphology
   slightly resembles Sanchezia sprucei, but its most remarkable feature is
   its close similarity to Suessenguthia, even more so than to those of its
   own genus. This new species is distinguished from others by its glabrous
   stem and leaves, its inflorescence containing two to five serial cymose
   heads, which are sessile to short-pedunculate, with mostly two to four
   flowers each (occasionally one), its inner bracts ranging in length
   between 6 and 23 mm, and its androecium composed of two stamens and two
   mucronate staminodes. We suggest it is an endangered species based on
   its restricted geographic distribution, its few known populations, and
   the increasing threats to its habitats. Along with Suessenguthia
   koessleri, this new species seems to be a key taxon to understanding the
   phylogenetic relationship between these two genera, which is still
   uncertain. Additionally, we provide a key to identify the Sanchezia and
   Suessenguthia species of the Madre de Dios River basin from southern
   Peru to northern Bolivia.},

Title = {Phylogeny and Biogeography of Acaena (Rosaceae) and its Relatives:
   Evidence of Multiple Long-Distance Dispersal Events Across the Globe},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},
Pages = {998-1010},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Acaena (Rosaceae) is the most complex and ecologically variable genus in
   Sanguisorbinae. Although it has been the subject of several taxonomic
   treatments, the largest phylogenetic analysis to date only sampled a
   small fraction of the total global diversity (five to seven out of 45 to
   50 species). This study included most of the species to elucidate the
   phylogenetic relationships of Acaena and biogeographic patterns in
   Sanguisorbinae. Phylogenetic analyses of non-coding nuclear (ITS region)
   and chloroplast (trnL-F) DNA sequence markers using maximum likelihood
   and Bayesian analyses suggested that Acaena is a paraphyletic group with
   species of Margyricarpus and Tetraglochin nested within it. We
   identified strong support for eight subclades that are geographically or
   taxonomically structured. Nevertheless, the species-level relationships
   within subclades are still uncertain, which may be due to rapid
   diversification and lack of informative characters in the markers used.
   Sanguisorbinae, a primarily Southern Hemisphere clade, exhibits a
   classic Gondwana disjunct distribution. This current distribution is
   explained primarily by eight long-distance dispersal events. Our results
   suggested that Sanguisorbinae split into Cliffortia and Acaena around
   13.6 mya. While Cliffortia diversified in southern South Africa, Acaena
   experienced several migration events in the Southern Hemisphere. Our
   estimation of the ancestral range suggested that Acaena likely
   originated in South Africa, followed by migration and subsequent
   diversification into southern South America. From there, the genus
   migrated to New Zealand, throughout the Andes, and to tropical areas in
   Central America, reaching as far north as California. Chile and New
   Zealand are the main sources of propagules for dispersal as well as the
   greatest diversity for the genus. The evolutionary relationships of
   species in Acaena combine a history of rapid diversifications,
   long-distance dispersals, and genetic variation within some taxa.
   Further research should be undertaken to clarify the infraspecific
   classification of A. magellanica.},

   In Mexico, there are five Rhipidocladum species, two of which are

   Rhipidocladum from Guerrero, Jalisco, and Nayarit that do not fit
   morphologically with any of the five Rhipidocladum species presently
   known in Mexico nor any other species in the genus. Here we describe and

Title = {Hybridization in the Temperate Bamboos (Poaceae: Bambusoideae:
   Arundinarieae): A Phylogenetic Study Using AFLPs and cpDNA Sequence Data},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The temperate bamboos are a taxonomically difficult group with nearly
   600 species in approximately 30 genera and at least 12 constituent
   lineages. In this study, phylogenetic relationships were explored using
   amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data in comparison with a
   phylogeny based on plastid DNA sequences, with an emphasis on
   Arundinaria of North America and its allies in East Asia (the
   Arundinaria clade). Molecular analyses involved 248 individuals in 10
   genera and 60 species. Hybridization was detected both within and among
   genera. Comparative analyses indicated hybrid origins for species in
   several widespread andwell-known genera, including Hibanobambusa,
   Sasaella, and Semiarundinaria. Evidence also indicated that Pseudosasa
   japonica (the type species of Pseudosasa) is an intergeneric hybrid
   involving Pleioblastus and Sasamorpha. In addition, cryptic hybrids were
   detected within and among Pleioblastus, Sasa, and Sasamorpha. After
   accounting for hybrids, phylogenetic analyses of AFLP data provided
   resolution for core lineages in the Arundinaria clade, including
   Pleioblastus sensu stricto, Sasa s. s., and Sasamorpha. AFLP data also
   provided evidence for the monophyly of the North American cane bamboos
   (Arundinaria, three species) but failed to identify their closest
   relative among the East Asian taxa. The broader evolutionary
   implications of hybridization in the temperate bamboos are discussed
   along with recommendations for future studies.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Pedicularis sudetica can be a difficult complex to identify and classify
   using herbarium specimens. Colors fade, rendering corolla patterns
   indistinct. Especially problematic is the presence of spots on the lobes
   of the lower lip and color patterns of the galea. Spots are either
   clearly visible or so faded that only a few spots are visible on one or
   two flowers in the inflorescence. Galeas are either unequivocally
   bicolored, solid, or indistinctly diffuse. Other characters have been
   inconsistently applied by taxonomists and/or are difficult to discern.
   All these factors combined only serve to confound taxon identity and
   classification, and members of the complex have been classified as
   species, subspecies, or even varieties by different taxonomists.
   Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of qualitative traits and
   principal component analysis (PCA) of quantitative traits were employed
   to explore the character and taxonomic structure of the group. MCA
   revealed that only three characters are necessary to classify the four
   taxa of the complex. No taxon structure was evident with PCA. Abundance
   of intermediate specimens over a broad geographic range indicates
   hybridization is extensive among members of the complex and suggests
   that a subspecific classification of the group is appropriate.},

Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {125-139},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {New entities in the allopolyploid Dilatata complex of Paspalum are
   formally described and illustrated. Three sexual tetraploids formerly
   subsumed under Paspalum dilatatum are recognized as discrete taxonomic
   entities: P. plurinerve and P. vacarianum are described as new species,
   and P. dilatatum subsp. flavescens is upgraded to species rank as P.
   flavescens. Both P. vacarianum and P. plurinerve are distributed in the
   Brazilian southern Plateau (Planalto Meridional), in the states of Rio
   Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, the first one in the eastern region
   and the second one in the western region including adjacent areas of NE
   Argentina. Paspalum flavescens is distributed in southeastern Uruguay
   and the provinces of Buenos Aires and Cordoba (Argentina). The apomictic
   allohexaploid P. torrense, distributed along the coastal areas of the
   Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana, and
   adjacent regions along the edge of the southern Plateau, also deserves
   specific status, whereas two further hexaploid biotypes are
   differentiated from the pentaploid P. dilatatum var. dilatatum and
   described as Paspalum dilatatum var. chiru and P. dilatatum var.
   uruguaianense. Paspalum dilatatum var. chiru is restricted to a small
   area around the locality of Molles Grande, in the department of
   Paysandu, Uruguay; whereas P. dilatatum var. uruguaianense is
   distributed in the SW of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and northern
   Uruguay. The Dilatata group of Paspalum is thus comprised of 8 species
   and 3 varieties, which are summarized here and for which an
   identification key is provided.},

Title = {Morphological Diversity and Taxonomic Importance of Fruits and Seeds of
   the Genus Spigelia (Loganiaceae) in Mexico},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {278-292},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The genus Spigelia (Loganiaceae) is a Neotropical genus that includes
   more than 80 species distributed from the United States to Argentina.
   Systematic studies of the group have rarely considered the carpological
   characters, so their taxonomic importance has not been analyzed in
   detail. The aim of this study is to analyze the morphological
   characteristics of these organs to provide more information for a better
   species separation and for a more robust infra-generic classification.
   We provide a detailed description of Spigelia fruits and seeds of the
   Mexican species since the country represents one of its main centers of
   diversification. Fruits and seed samples from 54 individuals across 14
   species were measured and photographed to describe each one, maintaining
   as much detail as possible. With the morphological matrix a DFA, PCA,
   and a dendrogram using the NJ method was performed. The fruits and seeds
   of the Mexican Spigelia species proved to be taxonomically useful,
   allowing the differentiation of four main clusters of species separated
   by the size of the analyzed structures in the three analyses (DFA, PCA,
   NJ). The results show the variation in size and shape of the structures
   analyzed, which shows the taxonomic importance of fruits and seeds of
   the genus Spigelia. Our work represents an advance in the detailed
   knowledge of structures, which are rarely considered in the
   descriptions, and which allows us to have a separation of species. A
   taxonomic treatment and photographs of the fruits and seeds are also
   included.},

Abstract = {The generic classification of the Thelypteridaceae has been the subject
   of much controversy. Proposed taxonomic systems have varied from
   recognizing the approximately 1200 species in the family within the
   single genus Thelypteris, to systems favoring upwards of 30 genera.
   Insights on intrafamilial relationships, especially for neotropical
   taxa, have been gained from recent phylogenetic studies; however, in the
   most recent classification, 10 of 30 recognized genera are either
   non-monophyletic or untested. We sequenced 407 nuclear loci for 621
   samples, representing all recognized genera and approximately half the
   known species diversity. These were analyzed using both maximum
   likelihood analysis of a concatenated matrix and multi-species
   coalescent methods. Our phylogenomic results, informed by recently
   published morphological evidence, provide the foundation for a generic
   classification which recircumscribed 14 genera and recognized seven new
   genera. The 37 monophyletic genera sampled demonstrate greater
   geographic coherence than previous taxonomic concepts suggested.
   Additionally, our results demonstrate that certain morphological
   characters, such as frond division, are evolutionarily labile and are
   thus inadequate for defining genera.},

Title = {No Evidence of Low Genetic Diversity Despite High Levels of Inbreeding
   and Poor Genetic Connectivity Among Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae)
   Populations in Remaining Forest Areas in Cebu, Philippines},

Abstract = {Little is known about the effects of habitat fragmentation on the
   patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity of species in the
   remaining tropical forests of Southeast Asia. This is particularly
   evident in Cebu, a Philippine island that has a long history of
   deforestation and has lost nearly all of its forest cover. To begin
   filling this gap, data from 13 microsatellite loci developed for
   Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae), a common vine species in Philippine
   forests, were used to study patterns of genetic diversity and genetic
   connectivity for the four largest of the remaining forest areas in Cebu.
   Evidence of relatively high levels of inbreeding was found in all four
   areas, despite no evidence of low genetic diversity. The four areas are
   genetically differentiated, suggesting low genetic connectivity. The
   presence of inbreeding and low genetic connectivity in a commonly
   encountered species such as T. loheri in Cebu suggests that the impact
   of habitat fragmentation is likely greater on rare plant species with
   more restricted distributions in Cebu. Conservation recommendations for
   the remaining forest areas in Cebu include the establishment of
   steppingstone corridors between nearby areas to improve the movement of
   pollinators and seed dispersers among them.},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {711-727},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {A RAD-seq phylogeny is presented for the genus Ulmus, and a revised
   infrageneric classification is given, with keys, descriptions, and range
   maps for the subgenera and sections. The previously accepted
   classification was based on a cpDNA phylogeny, but several well-marked
   clades in the chloroplast phylogeny are not recovered in the RAD-seq
   phylogeny and do not seem to represent valid clades in the organismal
   phylogeny. Ordination and STRUCTURE analysis support a broad species
   concept in Ulmus sect. Foliaceae and demonstrate interspecific
   hybridization in the section. Several sections of the genus are disjunct
   between Asia, Europe, and North America, indicating dispersals between
   the northern continents with inferred dates from ca. 20 Ma to ca. 3 Ma.
   Morphological variation is discussed, and some characters previously
   considered characteristic of Ulmus subg. Oreoptelea (narrowly winged
   achenes, ciliate achene margin) are shared with the unrelated U.
   villosa. A new subgenus, Ulmus subg. Indoptelea, is described. It can be
   recognized morphologically by its combination of compact inflorescences
   with very short pedicels, and samaras with narrow, strongly ciliate
   wings. It is sister to Ulmus subg. Ulmus, but has a smaller genome than
   either of the other subgenera.},

Abstract = {Reinterpreting the morphology of two taxa proposed by Victoria C.
   Hollowell in the 1980s and not formally published, we describe here
   three new species of Eremitis, a Neotropical genus of herbaceous bamboos
   (Poaceae, Bambusoideae, Olyreae), which is endemic to the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest. Two of them, Eremitis grandiflora and E. paucifolia,
   are endemic to Espirito Santo state. Eremitis victoriae occurs in
   southern Espirito Santo and has also been documented for southern Bahia.
   Eremitis grandiflora is similar to the smallest species of the genus,
   but can be differentiated by its decumbent culms with scale-like leaf
   blades and its longer gynecandrous whorls. Eremitis paucifolia is
   characterized by its leafy culms with a reduced number of leaves
   {[}5-6(-7)] compared to other species of the genus. Eremitis victoriae
   is distinguished from the congeneric species mainly by its abaxially
   glaucous leaf blades. Here, we provide an identification key to all
   described species of Eremitis that occur in Espirito Santo, as well as a
   map with their geographical distribution. All three new species are
   illustrated with both line drawings and photographic images, and an
   informal assessment of their conservation status is presented.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {We present a monographic treatment for the 13 species of Elaphoglossum
   sect. Polytrichia subsect. Apoda (Dryopteridaceae). Molecular
   phylogenetic analyses have recovered this subsection as monophyletic
   within the so-called ``subulate-scaled clade{''} of Elaphoglossum.
   Morphologically, the species of E. subsect. Apoda are usually
   characterized by the presence of brightly colored stem scales
   (yellowish, orangish, or reddish, as opposed to castaneous to black),
   evenly distributed subulate scales on laminar surfaces, tiny glandular
   hairs on different parts of the leaves, and adult sterile leaves without
   hydathodes. The species can be divided into two groups: one with
   subsessile and the other with long-petiolate leaves. Elaphoglossum
   subsection Apoda is distributed from southern Mexico and the Antilles to
   Bolivia and midwestern Brazil. Elaphoglossum atehortuae, a new species
   from the Amazon region of Ecuador, is described, illustrated, and
   compared to its most similar species. It is unusual within this group
   for lacking subulate scales on both surfaces of the laminae, a character
   state that it shares with E. backhouseanum. Two species, E.
   polyblepharum and E. trichophorum, are included in the group for the
   first time, whereas E. procurrens and E. siliquoides are excluded based
   on morphological characters and previously published molecular

Abstract = {Conchocarpus is the largest genus of Galipeinae (tribe Galipeeae), which
   is the most diverse group of Neotropical Rutaceae, with ca. 50 species.
   Recent phylogenetic analyses support a recircumscription of Conchocarpus
   to accommodate the species of Almeidea, a taxon from the Brazilian
   Atlantic Rainforest and Bolivia whose synapomorphy is the possession of
   pantocolporate pollen grains. Four species are recognized here: C.
   albiflorus, C. coeruleus, C. hendrixii, and C. ruber. A taxonomic
   revision of this group of four species of Conchocarpus is provided, with
   updates of their nomenclature, morphology, circumscription, geographic
   distribution, and preliminary conservation status, as well as a key to
   the species and illustrations. Conchocarpus limae and C. lilacinus are
   consigned to the synonymy of C. ruber.},

Abstract = {Dwarf mistletoes are a lineage of morphologically-reduced stem parasites
   inhabiting Pinaceae and Cupressaceae throughout the northern hemisphere
   and equatorial East Africa. Though diagnosable by a suite of
   morphological traits, phylogenetic knowledge of species relationships
   has been limited to studies employing either comprehensive taxonomic
   sampling of one or two genes, or more sequence data from a limited
   number of individuals. We used data from genome skimming to assemble 3kb
   of the nuclear ribosomal cistron and up to 45kb of the plastome to
   clarify the phylogenetic root of the genus, monophyly of species, and
   relationships among infraspecific taxa. Genomic differentiation among
   terminal taxa was variable; however, we found strong support for
   reciprocally monophyletic New World and Old World lineages, congruent
   nrDNA and plastome topologies at the species level and below, and
   monophyly of most taxonomic sections and species. Plastome gene content
   was stable across the genus with minimal pseudogenization or loss, as in
   other hemiparasites, with the notable exception of cemA. These findings
   form the basis of our re-evaluation of historical biogeographical
   hypotheses, species- and subspecies-level taxonomy, and plastome
   evolution in Arceuthobium. More broadly, this work provides a foundation
   for future clade-focused comparative and biosystematics studies of
   Arceuthobium.},

Title = {Using marginal species localities for the revision of the western
   boundary of the Altai-Yenisei floristic Province},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {55},
Pages = {6-18},
Abstract = {Floristic regionalization is a necessary stage of the investigation of
   plant taxa distribution. The result of floristic regionalization is a
   scheme of geographic units (phytochoria), which differ by composition
   and structure of their floras. There are several approaches to
   distinguish phytochoria and their boundaries: by geographical features
   of the investigated territory; by vegetation and taking into account the
   relief of the territory; by endemic taxa; by comparing the floras of the
   key territories; by concentration of range boundaries and by lines of
   the range boundaries coincidence. For drawing phytochoria boundaries,
   this paper proposes to use the westernmost and the easternmost species
   localities on dot distribution maps and clusters of these localities
   rather than ranges and concentrations of range boundaries. The research
   specifies the western boundary of the Altai-Yenisei floristic Province
   (WbAYP).
   Published dot distribution maps of 2569 vascular plant species and
   subspecies of Siberian flora were used to reveal marginal western and
   eastern localities. They were geocoded by means of Geographic
   Information System ArcView GIS 3.2a (registration number is
   843181116338) and the module ArcView Spatial Analyst 2.0a (registration
   number is 849601104159). The coordinates of geocoded localities and
   supplementary data (taxon name, numbers of map and locality) were
   entered into the Localities Database tables in MS Access (DBLoc). The
   total number of entries in the database tables was 169854. The marginal
   western and eastern localities in the limits of 49 degrees-62 degrees N
   and 80 degrees-100 degrees E were selected for each species/subspecies
   from the DBLoc. The latitudinal extent of the frame corresponds to the
   latitudinal length of the WbAYP, and the longitudinal extent corresponds
   to the distance of approximately 10 degrees to the west and to the east
   from the border. Selection of the marginal localities was made by means
   of computer programmes written by the author in the Visual Basic for
   Applications. At this stage, the Marginal Localities Database was made
   (DBMarLoc), which comprised data on 1654 dots. Then, for more detailed
   consideration of the southern, central and northern parts of the
   boundary, data corresponding to the localities from smaller overlapping
   frames along the boundary were selected (See Fig. 1). GIS NextGIS QGIS
   was used to visualize some floristic boundaries in Asiatic Russia. The R
   free software environment for statistical computing and graphics was
   used to visualize marginal localities inside the selected frames, as
   well as to test their patterns against Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR)
   hypothesis. CSR hypothesis was tested by chi(2) test (quadrat.test
   function in spatstat package in R).
   Southern part of WbAYP. Testing CSR hypothesis for marginal localities
   in frame 1 (827 dots, a grid of 10x4 squares with side of 1 degrees)
   (See Fig. 2) gives the p-value less than 2.2e-16, that is less than
   0.001 and allows us to reject the null hypothesis of complete spatial
   randomness of the distribution of dots in the frame. The deviation from
   the random distribution of marginal localities is manifested in their
   accumulation in the southwestern part of the frame, corresponding to the
   Altai Mountains. The dot cluster extends beyond the westernmost point of
   the Altai-Yenisei Province at 84 degrees E. There, at the Tigerekskiy
   Ridge, there are the westernmost Siberian localities of Schulzia crinita
   (Pall.) Spreng., Lloydia serotina (L.) Rchb., Salix vestita Pursh,
   Minuartia biflora (L.) Schinz et Thell., Smelowskia calycina (Stephan)
   C.A. Mey., Saxifraga terektensis Bunge, Sibbaldia procumbens L.,
   Hedysarum theinum Krasnob., and Doronicum altaicum Pall. Obviously, the
   Altai-Yenisei floristic Province should include the Western Altai
   Mountains of Altai Krai and the province boundary shoud be located more
   to the west than that drawn earlier.
   Central part of WbAYP. Testing CSR hypothesis for marginal localities in
   frame 2 (52 dots, a grid of 6x4 squares with side of 1 degrees) gives
   the p-value 0.045, that is less than 0.05 and does not allow us to
   accept the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness of the
   distribution of dots in the frame. However, attention is drawn to the
   closeness of the p-value to the threshold level, the excess of which
   would allow accepting the random distribution of dots in the frame.
   Testing CSR hypothesis for marginal localities in frame 3 (128 dots, a
   grid of 4x6 squares with side of 1 degrees) gives the p-value of
   6.237e-10, that is less than 0.001 and allows us to reject the null
   hypothesis of complete spatial randomness. The cluster of marginal
   localities in coordinates 52 degrees-53 degrees N and 89 degrees-90
   degrees E corresponds to the Abakan Ridge and ridges of smaller scale at
   the junction of the Abakan Ridge and the Western Sayan Ridge at the
   southern part of the Republic of Khakassia. There, the marginal
   localities of Aconitum biflorum Fisch. ex DC., Oxytropis kusnetzovii
   Krylov et Steinb., and Conioselinum longifolium Turcz are found. The
   cluster of dots in coordinates 54 degrees-56 degrees N and 89 degrees-91
   degrees E corresponds to the northern part of the Republic of Khakassia
   with its western boundary approximately along the meridian 89 degrees E
   by the slopes of the Kuznetsk Alatau Ridge. The marginal western
   localities are found there of Salix saxatilis Turcz. ex Ledeb., Betula
   divaricata Ledeb., Veronica alpina L. s. str. Apparently, WbAYP in its
   central part should be delineated approximately along the 89 degrees E
   meridian.
   Northern part of WbAYEP. Testing CSR hypothesis for marginal localities
   in frame 4 (56 dots, a grid of 15x5 squares with side of 1 degrees)
   gives the p-value of 0.11, that is more than 0.05 and allows us to
   accept the null hypothesis of complete dot spatial randomness in the
   frame. Comparatively small number of marginal dots and their random
   distribution does not allow us to outline floristic boundary by marginal
   localities in this region. Nevertheless it is noteworthy that some
   marginal localities tend to the Ob' and Yenisei Rivers and their
   tributaires. Apparently, the northern part of the WbAYP should be drawn
   according to the geographical principle by the Yenisei River, which flow
   among plain and mountain territories: the Yenisei and Ketsko-Tumskaya
   plains to the west of the river, the Yenisei Ridge and Zaangar Plateau
   to the east of it. For example, the marginal western localities of
   Lilium pensylvanicum Ker-Gawl., Filipendula palmata (Pall.) Maxim. and
   Chrysanthemum zawadskii Herbrich subsp. peleiolepis (Trautv.) Zuev. are
   marked for specified meridional interval to the east of the Yenisei
   River.},

Title = {Comparative evaluation of the effect of resveratrol and carnitine on the
   full transcriptomic profile of liver tissue in mice with different
   sensitivity to the development of alimentary obesity},

Abstract = {Specialized food products and biologically active food supplements
   enriched with minor biologically active substances are considered as a
   useful supplement in the treatment of obesity and other
   nutrition-dependent diseases. Biologically active substances of food can
   have a complex effect on the expression of a large number of genes,
   which can affect the results of a therapy. The aim of the study was to
   analyze the nutrigenomic mechanisms of the effect of biologically active
   substances - 1-carnitine and resveratrol on the expression of liver
   genes of DBA/2J mice and DBCB tetrahybrid, differing in genotype and
   sensitivity to the development of diet-induced obesity, using the method
   of full transcriptomic profiling of liver tissue.
   We carried out the experiment on male DBA/2J mice and the hybrid of the
   2nd generation DBCB, obtained by crossing 4 lines of mice (DBA/2J,
   BALB/c, CBA/lac and C57Black/6J). Mice for the experiment were obtained
   from Stolbovaya nursery, Federal State Budgetory Scientific Institution
   Scientific Center of Biomedical Technologies of the Federal
   Medical-Biological Agency (Moscow region, Russia). We worked with
   animals in accordance with international recommendations (Directive
   2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes
   adopted on September 22, 2010; Guide for the care and use of laboratory
   animals. Eighth Edition / Committee for the Update of the Guide for the
   Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; Institute for Laboratory Animal
   Research (TEAR); Division on Earth and Life Studies (DELS); National
   Research Council of the National Academies. Washington: The National
   Academies Press. 2011). The mice were divided into four groups with an
   equal number of 8 individuals. During 65 days, animals of the 1st
   (control) groups received a balanced semi-synthetic diet and purified
   drinking water, the 2nd groups received a high- carbohydrate and
   high-fat diet with a high fat content (30\% by of dry matter of the
   diet) and replacing drinking water by 20\% fructose solution, 3rd groups
   - high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet with the addition of resveratrol
   at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight, 4th groups - high-carbohydrate and
   high-fat diet with the addition of 1-carnitine at a dose of 300 mg/kg
   body weight. Full transcriptome analysis was performed using the Gene
   Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA) on SurePrint G3
   Mouse GE 8860K Microarray Kit microarrays. Differential gene expression
   was expressed as base 2 logarithm of increasing or decreasing
   fluorescence (log 2 FC) compared to control groups, separately for
   DBA/2J and DBCB mice. Chip scan data and calculation of differential
   expression values were exported to the ``R{''} IDE and bioinformatics
   analysis was performed with quantile normalization and further analysis
   in the limma package. The packages AnnotationDbi, org.Rn.eg.db,
   pathview, gage, gageData were used to identify metabolic pathways among
   the genes, metabolic pathways and functions of biological systems
   presented in the international database Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes and to visualize them. To visualize the results at all stages,
   the standard ``R{''} graphics and additional packages ggplot2, ggrepel,
   and gplots were used. Liver morphology was studied by light microscopy
   after staining with hematoxyline-eosine (See Fig. 1).
   We revealed differential expression for at least one of the intergroup
   comparisons in the amount of vertical bar log2FC vertical bar >= 0.5
   (towards both enhancement and attenuation) and at a p-value <= 0.05 for
   415 transcripts, of which 311 were identified with proteins or RNA with
   a known function (See Tables 1-3). Consumption of a high-carbohydrate
   and high-fat diet was reflected in differential expression of 62 genes
   in DBA/2J mice and 97 in DBCB mice. In DBA/2J mice fed on a
   high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, supplementation with resveratrol
   and 1-carnitine caused a differential expression of 26 genes each. At
   the same time, only 2 genes (Pklr; Tkfc) responded to resveratrol and
   1-carnitine in mice of this strain. In DBCB tetrahybrid mice,
   resveratrol consumption corresponded to differential expression of 147
   genes, and 1-carnitine consumption corresponded to 221 genes. 61 genes
   from DBCB mice responded to both supplements, and the number of genes
   simultaneously targeted by high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets,
   resveratrol and 1-carnitine was 10 (See Fig. 2). The gene expression
   profiles in DBA/2J and DBCB mice formed two separate clusters, the
   differences within which, determined by the composition of the diets,
   were less significant than the interstrain differences (See Fig. 3).
   Differential expression values in DBCB and DBA mice responding to HFCD
   and both supplements correlated negatively (See Fig. 4). The consumption
   of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet in DBA/2J mice resulted in
   significant changes in 4 metabolic pathways, and in DBCB mice, in
   addition, in 5 more metabolic pathways. Resveratrol consumption did not
   cause significant changes in DBA/2J mice, and in tetrahybrid mice it
   affected mmu04512 ECM-receptor interaction. L-carnitine supplementation
   caused significant changes in mmu00830 Retinol metabolism only in DBCB
   mice (See Table 4). Consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet
   produced similar changes in the mmu00830 Retinol metabolism pathway in
   both mice (See Fig. 5). In metabolic pathway mmu03320 PPAR signaling
   pathway DBA/2J and DBCB mice showed positive differential expression of
   the PPAR gamma gene and negative Scd1. At the same time, only DBCB mice
   in this metabolic pathway are characterized by activation of the RXR
   gene expression and suppression of FABP, and the direction in changing
   Cyp4a1 in both mice is opposite (See Fig. 6). Changes in the metabolic
   pathway mmu00590 Arachidonic acid metabolism characterized by the
   imbalance in the expression of Cyp4a and Cyp2 isoforms, which are
   responsible for the synthesis of various hydroxy and epoxy derivatives
   of arachidonic acid, is characteristic only of DBCB mice (See Fig. 7).
   Thus, the experiments performed revealed both a certain similarity and
   differences in the response of the transcriptome of DBA/2J and DBCB mice
   to the consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, resveratrol
   and 1-carnitine. The mechanisms that determine the direction of changes
   induced in the transcriptome of mice (and in coupled phenotypic changes)
   are, apparently, in the intervention of the studied dietary factors in
   key metabolic pathways, such as the PPAR signaling pathway, the
   metabolism of retinoids and eicosanoids. The data obtained indicate the
   importance of an adequate choice of a in vivo model of obesity and
   metabolic syndrome in preclinical studies of biologically active
   substances, in diet therapy and the enrichment of specialized food
   products with them.},

Title = {Taxonomic Studies on Malagasy Dalbergia (Fabaceae). III. Two New Species
   from Southeastern Madagascar and an Emended Description of the Rosewood
   Species Dalbergia maritima},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The Malagasy rosewood species Dalbergia maritima has a long history of
   unsustainable exploitation for its beautiful, burgundy-colored
   heartwood. As currently circumscribed, D. maritima has a wide geographic
   distribution in eastern Madagascar and exhibits significant
   morphological, ecological, and genetic variation, suggesting it may
   comprise more than a single entity. Multivariate analyses of leaf,
   flower, and inflorescence characters as well as eco-geographic features
   reveal several morphologically well delimited entities with distinct
   habitat preferences and/or geographic ranges, which are consistent with
   results from recent phylogenomic and population genomic studies of
   Malagasy Dalbergia. Based on these findings, we describe and illustrate
   two new species from southeastern Madagascar comprising material
   previously assigned to D. maritima, viz. D. pseudomaritima,
   characterized by paniculate inflorescences and small, broadly elliptic
   to orbicular, glabrous leaflets, and D. razakamalalae, distinguished by
   racemose inflorescences with large flowers, and narrowly ovate to
   narrowly elliptic, glabrous leaflets. Dalbergia maritima is consequently
   re-circumscribed to include only populations from east-central
   Madagascar, within which we recognize two subspecies, D. maritima subsp.
   maritima, with glabrous leaves, inflorescence axes, and gynoecia,
   occurring in littoral forest habitats, and D. maritima subsp. pubescens,
   with indument on these structures, and growing in evergreen humid forest
   farther inland. Photos are provided for each taxon, along with line
   drawings for the two new species. Provisional IUCN Red List assessments
   indicate that all three species are Endangered, D. maritima and D.
   razakamalalae mainly because of selective logging for trade in their
   high-quality heartwood, and D. pseudomaritima primarily because of
   habitat degradation due to land clearing and fire for subsistence
   agriculture, which has important implications for their conservation and
   sustainable management.},

Pages = {1121-1130},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {A molecular phylogenetic investigation was carried out to clarify
   aspects of the systematics of Oxylobus, a primarily Mexican alpine genus
   of Eupatorieae. Analysis of sequence data from two nuclear (nrDNA ITS,
   ETS) and three plastid markers (rbcL, ndhF, matK) confirmed the
   monophyly of Oxylobus and placed species of Ageratina as its sister
   group. A survey of 56 samples of Oxylobus using nrDNA ITS and ETS
   provided support for the currently accepted species, and showed the
   recently described O. coyulensis to be distinct and the sister group to
   the rest of the genus. The results also confirmed the placement of O.
   juarezensis in synonymy with O. subglabrus. The results of a broad
   survey of Ageratina for ITS data showed that it is likely not
   monophyletic as currently circumscribed. The phylogenetic results also
   highlighted the distinctiveness of Piqueria and Piqueriopsis as a
   distinct clade at the base of Eupatorieae.},

Title = {A Remarkable New Species of the Habenaria nuda Complex (Orchidaceae)
   from the Espinhaco Range of Eastern Brazil},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {790-798},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Habenaria longissima, a new species from the H. nuda species complex, is
   described and illustrated. It is remarkable for the exceptionally long
   lateral segments of the petals and labellum, which are the longest among
   Neotropical Habenaria, both in absolute and in proportional terms.
   Despite the morphological similarity, Bayesian and parsimony
   phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid DNA markers
   (matK), revealed that H. longissima is distantly related to other
   species of the complex, and constitutes an independent lineage. Its
   distribution is unusual in that it is the only species of Orchidaceae
   restricted to the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in the State of Minas Gerais
   and to Chapada Diamantina, in the central part of the Espinhaco range in
   the State of Bahia, with the populations 1000 km from each other.
   Habenaria longissima is a rare species, known only from three localities
   and four populations and informally proposed as Endangered due to the
   small area of occupancy and small number of known populations.},

Abstract = {Spiranthera (Rutaceae, Galipeeae) is a neotropical genus, recognizable
   mainly by the presence of trifoliate leaves, pentamerous flowers,
   exappendiculate filaments, spirally revolute anthers lacking a basal
   appendage, a campanulate disk, and anelongated gynophore. Species in
   this genus are mostly sciophilous treelets from South American
   rainforests, except for Spiranthera odoratissima, the most widespread
   species, which is a shrub inhabiting savannic formations and showing the
   widest morphological variation within the genus. In this taxonomic
   revision we present an extensive morphological analysis of the genus
   based on data from field work and from herbaria, an identification key,
   and descriptions and illustrations of the six species here recognized,
   including a new one from Iquitos, Peru. Also, we present updated
   information on the geographic distribution of the species, their
   habitats, and their morphological variability.},

Abstract = {Specimens attributed to Myrcia chytraculia and associated species form a
   complex within M. sect. Calyptranthes, occurring sympatrically
   throughout the Caribbean and Central America and sharing a continuously
   variable suite of morphometric traits. To ascertain whether species
   within this complex should be treated as separate or conspecific taxa,
   seven morphometric traits and a further two discrete characters are
   analysed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Leaf size and
   shape are found to be indicative of subspecies, and significant mean
   differences of traits can be found between groups, though they overlap
   throughout the range of the M. chytraculia complex. As a result of these
   findings, updated taxonomy for this group is proposed, creating the new
   combinations Myrcia chytraculia var. americana, Myrcia chytraculia var.
   pauciflora, and M. chytraculia var. zuzygium, as well as seven new
   synonyms. A distribution map and a key to the new varieties are also

Abstract = {We describe a new remarkable dwarf and apparently acaulescent species of
   Carex (Cyperaceae) from the Andes of northern Chile: Carex
   phylloscirpoides. Morphological and molecular data (two nuclear and
   three plastid DNA regions) were used to study the phylogenetic placement
   and systematic relationships of this species, which resulted in its
   assignment to Carex section Racemosae. However, despite being related to
   the other three species of the section present in the Southern Cone
   based on phylogenetic evidence, it displays a number of unusual
   morphological features. In addition, it is geographically disjunct and
   genetically differentiated from them. A preliminary conservation
   assessment was performed which resulted in the proposal of the
   Critically Endangered category at the global level under IUCN
   guidelines. We discuss the biogeographic and ecological peculiarities of
   the new species and its allies, with emphasis in the high number of
   acaulescent sedges present in South America. The features of C.
   phylloscirpoides emphasize its unique evolutionary position and its
   rarity highlights its conservation importance, especially in the context
   of the South American Andean flora.},

Abstract = {Kalmia buxifolia (sand-myrtle, Ericaceae) is disjunctly distributed
   across the high-elevation rock outcrops of the southern Appalachians,
   upper monadnocks and pine savannas of the Carolina Piedmont and Coastal
   Plain, and the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Here, we sampled plants from
   each region and reconstructed the phylogeographic history of K.
   buxifolia to test a rock-outcrop Pleistocene refugium hypothesis,
   estimate the potential direction(s) and timing of migration, and date
   divergence from its alpine sister species, K. procumbens. We also assess
   whether isolation in these different environments has led to variation
   in intrinsic water-use efficiency. Dating analysis challenges the
   current hypothesis that rock-outcrop species are relics of Pleistocene
   refugia (< 18,000 ybp), placing the divergence of K. buxifolia and K.
   procumbens much earlier, in the late-Miocene (9.40 Ma). Chloroplast
   haplotype analysis indicates four potential refugial sites, with the
   most ancient on Mount LeConte in the Great Smoky Mountains, and point to
   an Appalachian corridor as the likely Pine Barrens colonization route.
   The sister species divergence time and population level divergences
   within K. buxifolia generally coincide with major climatic shifts from
   the late-Miocene to mid-Pleistocene. Results from carbon isotope
   discrimination indicate that plantwater-use varies geographically within
   K. buxifolia, as does leaf morphology, although it is unclear whether
   this variation is due to genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity.
   These patterns of phylogenetic divergence and resulting ecophysiological
   diversity within K. buxifolia are significant for clarifying long-held
   questions about the biogeographic history and trait differentiation
   within this species. Further, our results suggest that high-elevation
   rock outcrop communities may have been inhabitated by northern-affinity
   species for much longer than previously assumed, and that subsequent
   population disjunction and isolation may have resulted in
   ecophysiological differentiation in these communities.},

Title = {Differentiation of larch (Larix spp.) climatypes in the Central Siberian
   forest-steppe provenance trial},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {Forest conservation is one of the main problems in world forestry.
   Numerous forest fires and widespread fungal pathogens and pests have led
   to a significant decline in forest areas and biodiversity and the
   disappearance of valuable populations. The problem of forest
   conservation and regeneration became especially relevant at the
   beginning of this century because of increasing wood harvesting. In this
   case, genetic collections of woody species, including provenance trials,
   established at different times play an important role in gene pool
   conservation of the main coniferous species - the forest-forming species
   in Russia - and in basic and applied problems in the context of climate
   change and the growing conditions in biogeocoenoses. The special
   interest in larch research is associated with a wide range of factors,
   such as inter- and intraspecific differentiation, capability to adapt to
   stressful growth conditions and the ability to successfully transfer
   seeds over large distances for creation of plantations with special
   purposes. The aim of this study was to assess inter- and intraspecific
   differences in height growth, crown area and length using the example of
   future generations of different larch species representing different
   provenances in the provenance trial.
   We obtained material for this study, located in the provenance trial
   research plot `Pogorelsky bor' (56 degrees 22'06 `' N, 92 degrees 57'23
   `' E) in the forest-steppe of Krasnoyarsk krai, in 2016. Live larch
   trees in the provenance trial were inventoried using the GIS complex
   `Field-Map'. The total number of inventoried trees was 1674. Nineteen
   provenances (climatic ecotypes) of various larch species (See Table and
   Fig. 1) were chosen for comparative analysis of height, crown area and
   crown length using a nonparametric method - the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA
   test and Median test. The crown proportion of tree stems was assessed
   using median values. Trees with a diameter similar to that of the main
   sample (121-160 mm; 412 trees) and an alternative sample of trees with a
   wider diameter (181-220 mm; 291 trees) were chosen for comparative
   analysis. Such an approach enabled the assessment of different biometric
   traits of trees while accounting for diameter and similar growth
   conditions at the trial site. The number of trees in the main sample was
   3 and 148 in the two provenances, whereas it ranged from 6 to 48 in the
   rest of the provenances.
   In this study, tree height (See Fig. 2) and tree crown length (See Fig.
   4) differed between climatic ecotypes of different larch species in the
   forest-steppe provenance trial of the south Krasnoyarsk region. These
   differences were related to the origin of the climatypes. We found that
   larch climatypes from mountain regions showed lower tree height and
   crown length. We also found that descendants of larch that originated in
   climatically favourable areas or those connected to the hollows of
   southern Siberia and the Biryusa and Chuna river basins within the
   Pre-Sayan province, as well as representatives of the Dahurian larch
   (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) and Chekanowskii larch (L. czekanowskii Szafer)
   from Chita Oblast, had greater tree height and tree crown length in the
   provenance trial (See Fig. 2 and 4). Therefore, the exploitation of
   these provenances for reforestation of the Krasnoyarsk forest-steppe may
   be reasonable and rational. Although the results obtained for
   10-year-old trees (Iroshnikov, 1977) indicated that the height growth of
   the Petrovsk-Zabaikalski climatype (Chekanowskii larch) was lower than
   that of the Siberian and Dahurian larches, by the age of 50 years, it
   achieved a similar diameter and may be regarded as equal in height
   growth to the majority of representatives of the latter two larches in
   the forest-steppe zone. Comparative analysis of samples with different
   diameters showed that, in general, climatypes were in the same tree
   height groups (See Fig. 1). Our results show that significant
   differences in tree height between climatypes are not an obligatory
   condition for differences in crown length. Tree crown length has its own
   separate developmental strategy, which is genetically associated with
   the environmental conditions of the place of origin. The climatype from
   the highlands with the lowest hydrothermal coefficient of place of
   origin (the Tes-Khem climatype from Tyva) had the shortest crown length.
   The ratio of crown to full stem length of the Tes-Khem climatype was
   18\%. High crown lengths were found for larch climatypes from the
   hollows of southern Siberia and for representatives of the Dahurian
   larch from Amur Oblast (the Zeya climatype). The northernmost climatype
   from the southern taiga (the Motygino climatype, Angara river basin) had
   a crown length lower than that of the representatives of the Dahurian
   larch. The crown length proportion of the Zeya climatype (38\%, the
   highest median value of the samples compared) was 14\% higher than that
   of the Motygino climatype (24\%). Differences in crown proportion of
   more than 5\%-10\% were observed between a few larch climatypes. In
   general, natural differences between species could not be defined. In
   this study, significant differences between samples representing
   different larch species were only found for crown length. The Gmelin
   larch had a significantly higher crown length than the Siberian (p <
   0.001) and Japanese (p < 0.05) larches. In contrast to the other traits
   studied, crown area did not significantly influence the difference
   between climatypes. The reasons for the absence of significant
   differences were the high variability of this trait in the majority of
   climatypes and the presence of extremes in some samples (See Fig. 3).},

Title = {Variability of the reproductive ability of Lonicera caerulea
   (Caprifoliaceae) in the seismically active zone of the Altai Mountains
   (Severo-Chuisky range, Kyzyl-Yaryk valley)},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {Seismically active areas of tectonic faults create specific
   inhomogeneous living conditions of plant populations and can thereby
   determine their structure. Studies of the reaction of plant reproductive
   structures to geoecological anomalies associated with active tectonic
   processes are practically absent. The aim of this work was to study the
   variability of the reproductive characteristics of Lonicera caerulea
   subsp. altaica plants in the local seismic zone of the Altai Mountains.
   We carried out studies in 2017 in the valley of the Kyzyl-Yaryk river
   (Altai Republic, Kosh-Agachsky district) (See Fig. 1), which was formed
   in the junction zone of seismic-generating faults active in the Holocene
   that are the boundaries of the North Chuy Range, Kurai intermountain
   basin and Chagan-Uzun massif and separating the Kurai and Chuysky
   depressions. We isolated 5 micropopulations of the Altai subspecies of
   blue honeysuckle - L. caerulea subsp. altaica in areas differing in
   volumetric activity of the radon emanation field (262-1162 Bq / m3) for
   research. Fifty fruits were selected in each micropopulation of L.
   caerulea subsp. altaica from 20 plants. We examined the morphometric
   characteristics and taste of the fruits, the number of full seeds and
   immature ovules in the fruits, the ratio of the number of full seeds to
   the total number of seeds and ovules, the correlation between the
   characters, as well as the seed germination capacity and germination
   readiness. The taste of the fruits was evaluated by the organoleptic
   method on a 5-point scale of taste variations based on the degree of
   bitterness in the fruits. To determine seed germinating capacity and
   germination readiness, germination was performed in Petri dishes at room
   temperature. We evaluated germination readiness on the 5th day, where n
   is the number of seeds and N is the number of seeds germinated during
   this period. For each micropopulation, we analyzed data for intragroup
   homogeneity using the chi(2) method. Student's t-test, Fisher's exact
   test and one-way ANOVA analysis were used to test statistically
   significant differences in reproductive characteristics, as well as to
   assess the correlation between them.
   The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the values of the Fisher
   criterion for the length, width, index, weight of the fruit and the
   number of seeds in them considerably exceed the critical value, which
   indicates a reliable effect of the place of plant growth on all these
   parameters at a 95-99\% probability level. For individual test
   micropopulations, significant differences were found in the morphometric
   characteristics and seed productivity of plant fruits in comparison to
   the control micropopulation (the area with the lowest level of radon
   emanation field) (See Fig. 2, 3, 4 and 5). An analysis of the frequency
   of occurrence of plants with different weight and seed productivity of
   the fruits from the studied micropopulations showed a shift in the
   distribution of these parameters towards larger values, compared to the
   control micropopulation (See Fig. 6). The seeds collected in the control
   micropopulation were characterized by the least germination (See Fig. 8)
   and the shortest germination period (See Fig. 9). In the studied
   population, the average and close degree of correlation between the
   weight of the fruit and the number of full seeds was established; the
   reliability of the correlation varied depending on the place of plant
   growth. Plants in the L. caerulea subsp. altaica in the valley of the
   Kyzyl-Yaryk river were characterized by high polymorphism of the fruit
   shape. The frequency of occurrence of plants with oval fruits was
   significantly lower than in populations of L. caerulea subsp. altaica in
   other areas of the Altai Mountains. In micropopulations under the
   influence of a higher level of volumetric activity of subsoil radon, the
   variety of fruit shapes (See Fig. 3) and their taste variations (See
   Fig. 7) increased, including an increase in the expression of the
   recessive trait L. caerulea, the absence of bitter fruits (bitter-free
   fruits). The correlation between the level of radon emanation and the
   frequency of occurrence of plants with bitter fruits was significant at
   p <0.01. The influence of the level of radon emanation on the
   variability of morphometric characteristics of the fruit, seed
   productivity, germination and germination energy of the seeds was not
   significant. The heterogeneity of the population of the L. caerulea
   subsp. altaica, according to the features of the generative sphere,
   suggests a possible influence of a complex of factors associated with
   active tectonic processes on the formation and development of plant
   reproductive organs.

Title = {Molecular and Morphological Analysis Supports the Separation of
   Robrichia as a Genus Distinct from Enterolobium (Leguminosae:
   Caesalpinioideae: Mimosoid Clade)},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {As currently circumscribed, the legume genus Enterolobium comprises 11
   species in two sections: E. sect. Enterolobium and E. sect. Robrichia,
   with an overall distribution from Mexico to Argentina and a centre of
   diversity in Amazonia. In the absence of the characteristic indehiscent
   fruits, Enterolobium is difficult to distinguish from other genera in
   the ingoid clade, including Albizia sensu lato, Samanea, and Cathormion.
   Previous phylogenetic studies which have included Enterolobium have
   sampled few species of the genus, leaving questions about its monophyly
   and interspecific relationships. Here we evaluate the circumscription of
   Enterolobium and its two infrageneric taxa, their phylogenetic placement
   in the ingoid clade, and interspecific relationships within the two
   sections of the genus. Our study includes all Enterolobium species, and
   analyses of nuclear (ITS and ETS) and plastid (trnD-T and trnL-F)
   molecular regions, and morphology. Bayesian inference, maximum
   parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses show that Enterolobium, as
   presently circumscribed, is not monophyletic. The genus is divided into
   two well-supported independent clades, corresponding to the two
   previously recognized sections; one of them is sister to the genus
   Leucochloron and is here raised to generic rank as the genus Robrichia,
   with three species, Robrichia glaziovii, Robrichia oldemanii and
   Robrichia schomburgkii. The genus Enterolobium consequently now
   comprises eight species and is more closely related to a clade composed
   of Albizia and Falcataria. This new arrangement is reinforced by
   morphological synapomorphies recovered by ancestral character state
   reconstructions. Indumentum type, the number of pinnae pairs per
   bipinnate leaf and leaflet pairs per pinna, inflorescence type, and
   fruit shape characterize Robrichia, while the recognition of
   Enterolobium remains based on fruit traits. We also provide the formal
   lectotypifications for E. contortisiliquum, E. cyclocarpum, E.
   gummiferum, E. maximum, E. monjollo, and R. schomburgkii.},

Abstract = {Relationships among members of Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae have
   been difficult to resolve due to reduction and convergent evolution in
   these parasitic plants. All species in this subfamily are fully
   mycoheterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by parasitizing fungi
   rather than through photosynthesis. Here, we examine relationships and
   host specificity in one of the most widespread species in this
   subfamily, Monotropa uniflora. We use several lines of evidence to
   investigate whether there is support for recognizing a segregate, M.
   brittonii, as distinct. Based on molecular and morphological analysis of
   Monotropa collected throughout its range in the United States, we find
   two distinct lineages, one of which corresponds morphologically and
   geographically to Small's M. brittonii. We identified several
   morphological characters that differ between the two species. We also
   observed a high degree of fungal host specificity in M. brittonii, which
   appears to parasitize almost exclusively Lactifluus subgenus
   Lactariopsis section Albati. Additionally, M. brittonii was primarily
   collected from Florida scrub, which are xeric, shrub-dominated habitats
   that differ substantially from the mesic forests where M. uniflora
   typically occurs. Based on these molecular, morphological, and
   ecological differences, we support recognition of M. brittonii as
   distinct from M. uniflora.},

   longiglandulosa are characterized by their sessile leaves, congested
   flowers at the apex of the branches, dimorphic stamens with
   tetrasporangiate and bicolorous anthers. However, M. joaosemiriana
   differs in having hypanthium and sepal covered only with spherical
   glands and sepal shorter than the hypanthium length. Microlicia
   longiglandulosa has hypanthium and sepal with glandular trichomes mixed
   with spherical glands and sepal longer than the hypanthium length.
   Microlicia jolyana has a petiolate and thickened leaf, lanceolate to
   oblong leaf blade, rounded to slightly acuminate at the apex, smooth and
   not striate hypanthium surface, triangular-oblong and thickened sepal,
   dimorphic stamens, and purple to purple-blackish anther on both whorls.
   Also, Microlicia linifolia var. naudiniana is elevated to species rank
   with a new name (Microlicia acerosa), and M. nortecipoana and M.

Title = {Spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in a plain river of
   a semi-desert zone},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {53},
Pages = {131-150},
Abstract = {Current climate changes require special attention to the implementation
   of environmental activities in arid regions. The study of the biotic
   component of water bodies of such ecosystems and the patterns of their
   spatial distribution is an important area of scientific research. The
   river network of the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain is one of the
   least studied lotic systems in the Lower Volga basin. In this river
   network, the plain Yeruslan River is of the greatest importance because
   it largely determines the environmental characteristics of this arid
   territory. Therefore, it is important to study the structural indicators
   and spatial dynamics of macrozoobenthos communities in the Yeruslan
   River. The aim of the work was to study species composition, the
   structural and quantitative indicators of macrozoobenthos from the
   source to the mouth of the Yeruslan River and to determine the
   conceptual belonging of the bottom communities of the plain river of the
   semidesert zone to a certain type of distribution.
   The Yeruslan River (51 degrees 18'3 `' N, 47 degrees 46'19 `' E) flows
   through the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain (Volgograd region,
   Russia) and it is a tributary of Volgograd reservoir. The length of the
   Yeruslan River is 282 km, with a catchment area of 55700 km(2). We
   collected samples of macrozoobenthos at 9 stations of the Yeruslan River
   (See Fig. 1) in June 2015 and July 2016. In the ripal zone, the
   integrated samples for quantitative macrozoobenthos analysis were taken
   using an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 25 cm(2)) in replicates
   (8X) and a handle blade trawl (0.2 M x 0.5 M). In the medial zone,
   samples were taken by an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 250
   cm(2)) in replicates (2X). Samples were washed in the field using a mesh
   screen with 300-310-mu m mesh size and preserved in 4\% formaldehyde. At
   each station of the Yeruslan River, we used field analytical instruments
   for measuring pH and oxygen content. Water samples were taken for
   hydrochemical analysis at different sections of the river (See Table 1).
   We used the model of isolation by distance (Malecot, 1948), Monmonier's
   maximum difference algorithm (Manni et al., 2004) and the Dickey-Fuller
   test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) to perform statistical analysis of
   changes in the species structure of macrozoobenthos.
   The Yeruslan River flows within the geochemical province of continental
   salinity, which is characterized by an evaporative type of natural water
   regime, leading to progressive accumulation of salts. In this research,
   we found out that water was brackish at several stations of the river
   (1250-1420 mgl(-1)) due to water drainage of saline soils. We revealed
   that the Yeruslan River is polluted with nitrite nitrogen (at station 1)
   and phosphorus compounds (at stations 4 and 8) but concentrations of
   ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, cadmium, copper, zinc and lead did
   not exceed the MPC. Comparative analysis has shown that from the source
   to the mouth of the river there are no significant changes in the speed
   of water velocity flow, and the physical and chemical conditions are
   specific for each station. In the river, we collected 132 species: 47 -
   Diptera, 20 - Oligochaeta, 11 - Mollusca, 11 - Grustacea, 11 -
   Coleoptera, 7 - Trichoptera, 7 - Heteroptera, 6 - Hirudinea, 4 -
   Odonata, 4 - Ephemeroptera, 1 - Lepidoptera, Hydracarina, Polychaeta and
   Megaloptera. The macrozoobenthos of the river is represented by
   limnophilic species in the upper, middle and lower reaches. This is due
   to the small slope of the Yeruslan River and the presence of permanent
   and temporary dams. In the mouth reaches, the macrozoobenthos
   communities included species of the Ponto-Caspian and Ponto-Azov
   zoogeographic complexes. At all stations of the river, Oligochaeta and
   Chironomidae were of high density. Also, in the river mouth, Mollusca
   were of high density (See Fig. 2). Statistical analysis of sequences of
   hydrobiological characteristics along the longitudinal gradient of the
   Yeruslan River using the Dickey-Fuller test showed that the presence of
   a stationary distribution trend with random ``wandering{''} is typical
   of the series of total density and biomass of macrozoobenthos, the
   number of worms of the family Tubificidae, larvae of chironomids of the
   subfamily Tanytarsini and mayflies of the family Baetidae. For the other
   series of observations, the presence of a nonlinear trend is noted (See
   Table 3 and Fig. 3). The selection of a sequence of borders (barrier)
   between river communities within the ecosystem by Montmonier's method
   using a matrix of species distances by the Bray-Curtis method made it
   possible to identify the source (station 1) with a high level of
   nitritic nitrogen in the water as one of the specific areas. The second
   most important border separates station 3 with a low content of
   dissolved oxygen, and the third one allocates the mouth reaches (station
   9) as an independent area, where there is a cohabitation of river and
   reservoir species (See Fig. 4). Based on the analysis of fauna and using
   statistical methods, we found out that macrozoobenthos communities do
   not change from the source to the mouth of the river in accordance with
   the ``the river continuum concept{''}. The habitat of taxa depends on
   local abiotic and biotic factors at each river station, therefore, we
   can assume that the distribution of macrozoobenthos communities,
   generally, corresponds to ``the patch dynamics concept{''}. At the same
   time, stations 1, 3 and 9 form fairly isolated hydrogeomorphological
   areas, which is postulated by the concept of ``the functional process
   zones{''}. It seems that the spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos
   communities in the Yeruslan River can be explained by a complex
   combination of two concepts: ``the patch dynamics concept{''} and ``the
   functional process zones{''}.
   This type of distribution seems to be typical of plain rivers with very
   low water velocity and the presence of dams.

Title = {Determination of analytical specificity of PCR methods for Acidovorax
   citrulli identification},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {Acidovorax citrulli (Schaad et al.), the causative agent of bacterial
   fruit blotch of cucurbits is a significant object in plant quarantine.
   The main stage in the detection of the phytopathogen in the framework of
   laboratory diagnostics is using molecular-genetic methods, like PCR, and
   it is the results of the application of these methods that are decisive.
   In this regard, the used PCR-methods impose strict requirements for
   assessing their applicability. Applicability criteria such as analytical
   specificity, showing the ability of a test to reliably distinguish a
   target organism from a non-target organism, is an integral component of
   the assessment applicability of a diagnostic method. Analytical
   specificity is evaluated based on the values of parameters such as
   inclusivity and exclusivity. Inclusivity shows the ability of the method
   to identify strains of the target bacterium, representing all genetic
   diversity, different geographical origin and host plants. Exclusivity
   shows the ability of the method to distinguish non-target bacteria,
   especially those that can be in the DNA of host plants. This study was
   conducted to determine the analytical specificity of the PCR-methods for
   identification of A. citrulli.
   We detemined analytical specificity with 5 A. citrulli strains, 19
   bacterial strains of other species from international collections, 28
   other bacterial isolates (See Table 1) and 106 DNA samples isolated from
   various varieties and species of Cucurbitaceae plants. 30 samples were
   plant debris, and 76 were seed samples (See Table 2). The process of
   preparing analytical samples consisted in the extraction of microbiota
   from samples into phosphate-saline buffer and subsequent concentration
   using high-speed centrifuge. Then DNA was extracted from the samples.
   PCR for each sample was performed in triplicate for each of the
   following tests: qPCR Acit 1 F/R and Acit 1-probe according to Woudt et
   al {[}2009], commercial kits for qPCR by ``Syntol{''} and
   ``AgroDiagnostika{''} (Russia), PCR with primers AC158F/AC158R according
   to Cho et al. {[}2015], PCR SEQ ID 3/4 according to Schaad et al.
   {[}2000], PCR PL1/PL2 according to Zhong et al., 2015 and PCR
   G12AcFwd/G12AcRev according to Zivanovic \& Walcott {[}2017]. The value
   of inclusivity for each PCR test was determined as the ratio of reliable
   positive results of the target to the total number of reactions,
   expressed as a percentage. The value of exclusivity was determined as
   the ratio of reliable negative results to the total number of reactions
   of non-target, expressed as a percentage. An assessment of analytical
   specificity was assigned to each of the test based on an analysis of the
   inclusivity and exclusivity parameters. The conclusion about the
   specificity of the tests was made with the values of inclusivity and
   exclusivity of 99\% or higher. Isolation of bacteria was carried out
   from analytical samples of cucurbit crops that showed at least one
   positive result when tested by any of the above PCR methods (See Table
   3). DNA from single colonies was used for PCR with primers 8UA/519B. For
   identification, we used the Sanger method for determining the nucleotide
   sequence, which were, then, compared with the sequences of bacterial
   genomes in the NCBI database.
   The process of diagnosing phytopathogens is a combination of
   sequentially applied methods and tests, the final stage of each of which
   is the interpretation of the data. In the case of obtaining positive
   results of the applied tests, it is important to establish the exact
   cause of these results. During the study, PCR tests showed positive
   results with samples known to be free of the A. citrulli DNA. Agarose
   gel amplicon detection also revealed the presence of reaction products
   characteristic of A. citrulli (See Fig. 1). Also, isolated 89 bacterial
   cultures whose colonies were morphologically different. These isolates
   were selected for testing by the Acit 1 F/R, Acit 1-probe in order to
   detect those isolates that can lead to positive results. 14 isolates
   showed positive results. These isolates were used for PCR 8UA/519B. For
   4 of the 14 nucleotide sequences, matches in the NCBI were detected, and
   isolates identified as Microbacterium phyllosphaerae, Arthrobacter sp.
   (2 isolates) and Sphingomonas paucimobilis. These isolates showed a
   positive reaction when tested using Acit 1 F/R, Acit 1-probe,
   ``Acidovorax citrulliRV{''} ``Synthol{''} and Acidovorax citrulli-Rt
   ``AgroDiagnostika{''}. When tested using the AC158F/AC158R method, these
   isolates were also positive (See Fig. 1). In addition, the isolate
   identified as Microbacterium phyllosphaerae showed a positive reaction
   when tested by methods of SEQ ID 3/4 and PL1/PL2 (See Fig. 2). Thus,
   bacteria that are potentially sources of false-positive PCR tests were
   isolated and identified. Testing of other bacteria not belonging to the
   species A. citrulli showed negative results. The results of testing
   strains A. citrulli by Acit 1 F/R, Acit 1-probe, ``Acidovorax
   citrulliRV{''} ``Synthol{''}, Acidovorax citrulli-Rt
   ``AgroDiagnostika{''}, AC158F/AC158R, SEQ ID 3/4, PL1/PL2 and G1
   2AcFwd/G12AcRev were used to determine the value of inclusivity (See
   Table 4). PCR methods showed a positive reaction with each of the 5
   tested A. citrulli strains (100\% inclusivity). Test results of
   bacterial strains not belonging to the species A. citrulli and DNA
   samples isolated from different varieties and species of Cucurbitaceae
   were used to determine the value of exclusivity (See Table 3). We found
   that the exclusivity values of the Acit 1 F/R, Acit 1-probe, Acidovorax
   citrulli-RV{''} ``Synthol{''}, Acidovorax citrulli-Rt
   ``AgroDiagnostika{''} and AC158F/AC158R methods are below 99\%,
   established as a criterion for recognizing the method as specific;
   therefore, these methods cannot be considered specific, despite 100\%
   inclusivity. At the same time, the methods SEQ ID 3/4, PL1/PL2 and
   Gl2AcFwd/G12AcRev are specific (the value of exclusivity is more than
   99\%, the value of inclusivity is 100\%). The results of the analytical
   specificity assessment allow us to conclude that Acit 1 F/R, Acit
   1-probe, ``Acidovorax citrulli-RV{''} ``Synthol{''}, Acidovorax
   citrulli-Rt ``AgroDiagnostika{''}, AC 158F/AC 158R can be used in
   diagnosing A. citrulli only as screening methods. Based on the positive
   results of testing the samples with the indicated methods, it is
   impossible to draw a conclusion about the presence of the pathogen in
   the sample. At the same time, PCR SEQ ID 3/4, PL1/PL2 and G1
   2AcFwd/G12AcRev can be used as confirmatory diagnostic methods for A.
   citrulli. Thus, as a result of the study, we evaluated the analytical
   specificity of existing molecular-genetic methods for identifying A.
   citrulli. Such a full-scale assessment of the analytical specificity of
   diagnostic PCR methods for A. citrulli was carried out for the first
   time.
   The obtained data will allow testing laboratories to more reliably
   identify A. citrulli.},

Abstract = {We herein present nomenclatural and taxonomic novelties in Calea sect.
   Meyeria from Brazil. Calea pruskiana is a new species related to C.
   triantha and can be distinguished by the acute or cuneate, rarely
   attenuate leaf apex (vs. obtuse), slightly branched capitulescence (vs.
   profusely branched), and ray florets 18-21.7 mm long (vs. 9.2-15.3 mm).
   Calea hispida f. subinfrgcrrima is lectotypified, recombined, and
   elevated to species level as Calea subintegerrima, which also resembles
   C. triantha, however differs from it by the usually glabrous abaxial
   leaf surface (vs. usually hispid), glandular-punctate peduncle (vs.
   glands absent), and cypselae with hirsute ribs (vs. pilose ribs). These
   species are described and illustrated, their geographic distributions
   are mapped, and their taxonomic affinities are discussed. Furthermore, a
   new terminology is proposed to describe more accurately the pappus scale
   size variation according to the relative length of the scales and the
   occurrence of combinations of pappus scales of different lengths in the
   same capitulum.},

Abstract = {Inga subnuda is one of 31 Inga species endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest and is currently treated as having two subspecies (I. subnuda
   subsp. subnuda and I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana). However, due to
   intermixed leaf and floral traits, these subspecies are difficult to
   morphologically distinguish. This study aimed to better understand the
   boundaries of these two subspecies and to test if these taxa should be
   treated at the species level. Morphological variation and bioclimatic
   data related to the two subspecies of the complex were assessed using
   multivariate morphometric analyses and ecological niche modeling.
   Different groups were recognized using morphological quantitative
   characters. The climatic space was similar but not identical, and recent
   climatic cycles that could have shaped the current distributions of the
   subspecies are discussed. The results of our integrative study suggest
   the subspecies are distinct species. Thus, we propose changing the
   status of I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana to the rank of species. The
   new taxon is described and illustrated.},

Abstract = {Two new species of lycophytes, Selaginella obovata and S. zhangii, were
   discovered in southeastern Yunnan, China. Selaginella obovata is
   characterized by the prostrate habit and relatively small size of plant,
   obovate median leaves, and short, dorsiventral strobili, and is not
   apparently similar to any known species. Phylogenetic analyses of
   plastid sequences (rbcL, atpI, psbA) indicated that S. obovata is
   closely allied to S. bisulcata, which is also supported by spore
   morphology, and that these two taxa together with S. pennata constitute
   a well-supported monophyletic group. Selaginella zhangii is comparable
   to S. rolandi-principis in their broad stems and shape and arrangement
   of vegetative leaves; but the former differs from the latter in its
   prostrate habit and dorsiventral strobili. The results of phylogenetic
   analyses indicated that S. zhangii is allied to S. heterostachys in the
   S. heterostachys-S. ciliaris clade, while S. rolandi-principis is
   distantly placed in the S. doederleinii-S. involvens clade. Finally, we
   provide comprehensive descriptions, photographs of living plants, line
   drawings, and scanning electron micrographs of spores to facilitate
   their recognition.},

Abstract = {The genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae, monocotyledons) is characterized by
   bladeless leaves, which are leaves having only leafsheaths. To study the
   evolutionary process through which Eleocharis species lost their leaf
   blades, we analyzed the outer morphological and anatomical characters of
   the representative Eleocharis species, plus species from nine
   phylogenetically related genera. From the analysis, we recognized eight
   characters and we optimized their character states on a recent molecular
   phylogenetic tree. As a result, we recognized five characteristics
   shared by Eleocharis species as follows: (1) the most apical internode
   is more than seven times longer than the next apical internode; (2)
   bladeless leaves having only leaf sheaths; (3) transversely septate

Title = {A Revised Classification of Glossopetalon (Crossosomataceae) Based on
   Restriction Site-Associated DNA Sequencing},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {562-572},

Abstract = {Glossopetalon inhabits arid regions in the American west and northern
   Mexico on limestone substrates. The genus comprises four species: G.
   clokeyi, G. pungens, G. texense, and G. spinescens. Three of the species
   are narrow endemics. The fourth, G. spinescens, is a widespread species
   with six recognized varieties. All six varieties are intricately
   branched shrubs that have been difficult to identify due to a lack of
   clearly delineating morphological characters. Characters typically used
   to differentiate the varieties of G. spinescens, such as stem
   coloration, leaf blade size, and presence of stipules, are highly
   variable within and among populations. A custom protocol of double
   digest restrictionsite associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) was used to
   resolve the phylogeny of Glossopetalon and address if population genetic
   data analyses (such as STRUCTURE, SVDquartets, and phylogenetic
   networks) support the recognition of six varieties of G. spinescens.
   Glossopetalon was fully supported as monophyletic and G. pungens was
   resolved sister to the remaining taxa in the genus. The varieties of G.
   spinescens were resolved as two distinct lineages corresponding to their
   biogeography, one to the northwest (lineage 1) and one to southeast
   (lineage 2) of the species range. Glossopetalon clokeyi was resolved at
   the base of lineage 1 and G. texense was embedded within lineage 2
   sister to G. spinescens var. spinescens. Taxonomic changes include the
   recognition of G. texense and G. clokeyi as varieties of G. spinescens
   and description of a unique population from northern Arizona as a new
   variety, G. spinescens var. goodwinii.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Volume = {47},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Erythroxylum macrophyllum is a morphologically variable and widely
   distributed species complex in Central and South America with several
   sub-specific taxa and numerous species included in its synonymy. A
   single variety grows in the Colombo-Venezuelan savanna region which can
   be distinguished from the rest of the E. macrophyllum complex by the
   size of leaves, cataphyll and stipule characteristics, and shape of
   calyx lobes. A molecular phylogeny reconstructed from 519 nuclear genes
   also reveals that the savanna variety is more closely related to E.
   acuminatum and E. pauciflorum than E. macrophyllum. This phylogenomic
   evidence also suggests Erythroxylum sect. Macrocalyx, to which E.
   macrophyllum belongs, is a polyphyletic taxonomic section. We thus
   propose elevating this variety to specific status, as Erythroxylum
   savannarum. We provide an updated taxonomic description, information
   about its habitat and distribution, and justify its informal IUCN
   categorization of Near Threatened (NT).},

Abstract = {The family Malvaceae s. l. is a clade that comprises nine subfamilies.
   Phylogenetic relationships among them are not completely resolved and
   are inconsistent among studies, probably due to low phylogenetic
   informativeness of conventional molecular markers. In the present study,
   we provide new phylogenetic information for Malvaceae s. l. derived from
   newly-designed group-specific nuclear markers. By mining transcriptome
   data from the One Thousand Plants Project (1KP) and publicly available
   genome information from cotton, cacao, and Arabidopsis, we designed a
   set of molecular markers of potentially single- or low-copy nuclear
   genes for Malvaceae s. l. Phylogenetic potential of these new loci was
   compared to previously applied conventional markers (i.e. plastid
   trnK-matK region and rbcL gene and the nrDNA ITS region) using the
   phylogenetic informativeness method. The results show that, when the
   mined nuclear regions are used in combination, it is possible to resolve
   relationships at different taxonomic levels within the phylogeny.
   However, incongruence among nuclear loci is frequent in the group,
   explaining the prevalence of unresolved phylogenetic relationships.},

Title = {Taxonomic Reevaluation of Endemic Hawaiian Planchonella (Sapotaceae)},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {875-888},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Planchonella (Sapotaceae) in Hawaii has a complicated taxonomic history
   that has resulted in considerable confusion among botanists and
   conservation practitioners. Up to seven different species and several
   varieties have been described in Hawaii, with the most recent taxonomic
   evaluation recognizing one species, P. sandwicensis. We have conducted a
   phylogenetic study of Hawaiian Planchonella using molecular (ETS, ITS,
   and RPB2) and morphological data to infer whether one or several species
   can be distinguished. In line with earlier research based on molecular
   data, we find that Planchonella in Hawaii is comprised of two
   well-supported clades distinguished by fruit color: yellow or purple.
   The purple-fruited clade contains individuals with flat leaf blades,
   long pedicels, and greenish corollas, a species corresponding to P.
   sandwicensis, distributed on all Hawaiian Islands except the island of
   Hawaii. The yellow-fruited clade possesses leaves that are frequently
   longitudinally rolled, wavy or distally deflexed, short pedicels, and
   yellow or cream (rarely greenish) corollas, a species corresponding to
   P. spathulata that is distributed on all Hawaiian Islands but is
   believed rare in Kauai. Both species can set fruit with aborted ovules,
   resulting in small fruits that look dissimilar to well-developed fruit.
   The species can occur in sympatry, where P. sandwicensis seems to be
   better adapted to slightly wetter forests and higher altitudes, whereas
   P. spathulata usually occurs at lower elevations in mesic to dry
   forests. Both species exhibit large morphological variation and overlap,
   resulting in many previous collections with inadequate label
   information, which has impeded correct taxonomic determinations. We
   refrain from recognizing infraspecific taxa because there is no
   morphological coherence, no molecular support, and it is unhelpful for
   species conservation. Five lectotypes are here designated. Both species
   are assessed for conservation status according to IUCN guidelines and
   are tentatively proposed as species of Least Concern.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {666-677},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Lineage recombination is an important source of genetic and
   morphological variation in species-rich groups of plants. Tetraploids
   that are intermediate in morphology and ecology with respect to
   sympatric diploids are regularly hypothesized to be the products of
   hybridization. Arctostaphylos mewukka is one such intermediate
   tetraploid long regarded as the result of hybridization and genome
   duplication among divergent and geographically overlapping diploids
   widely distributed across the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. Here
   we set out to test this hypothesis leveraging the notion that
   allopolyploids arise repetitively and may show signs of reciprocal
   organellar exchange among species between maternal and paternal
   progenitors. We compared nuclear ribosomal and plastid sequence data
   acquired from samples within and outside this target species complex.
   Molecular sequence data show striking patterns indicative of widespread
   reticulation and chloroplast capture events across the genus
   Arctostaphylos. Results support the notion that outcrossing, long-lived
   woody plant species such as members of the genus Arctostaphylos can
   retain a secured morphological identity despite ongoing influence of
   interspecific gene flow that would otherwise render species boundaries
   vulnerable to dissolution.},

Abstract = {We sampled 130 individuals (2 to 25 per taxon) of Pinus subsections
   Ponderosae and Sabinianae. Nucleotide sequences were obtained by
   targeting 703 low copy nuclear genes. From the unenriched portion of the
   short reads, we assembled nearly complete plastome nucleotide sequences.
   We used 600 nuclear genes and the plastome sequences to create
   phylogenies and species trees that we compared to evaluate cytonuclear
   concordance and reticulation. We found that Pinus jeffreyi belongs with
   Pinus subsect. Sabinianae based on morphological synapomorphies as well
   as strong molecular phylogenetic support. Pinus ponderosa sensu lato is
   paraphyletic, and we suggest treatment as three species: P. ponderosa
   sensu stricto (with P. ponderosa var. ponderosa, P. ponderosa var.
   benthamiana, and P. ponderosa var. washoensis), P. scopulorum, and P.
   brachyptera. The persistence of lineages with the footprints of ancient
   nuclear introgression (labeled bpw in clade N4) and chloroplast capture
   (labeled bpw in clade P1) should caution species identification in Pinus
   subsection Ponderosae based on limited molecular data. The hybrid
   frequency was low based on cytonuclear discordance, and the persistence
   of an ancient P1 plastid clade is a better explanation than
   hybridization between P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi for unexpected
   plastid associations in the western Sierra Nevada, USA. We identified a
   new potential zone of ancient admixture between P. ponderosa and P.
   scopulorum in Idaho, USA. Some populations of P. arizonica, P.
   brachyptera, P. engelmannii, and P. scopulorum in the USA are more
   closely related to taxa with distributions limited to Mexico than they
   are to each other. To integrate phylogeny and taxonomy, future work
   should sample widely in Mexico and the USA, score morphological
   characters (including seedling characters from the known seed parent),
   on the same individual as used for molecular data, and use methods that
   are based on individuals rather than population frequencies.},

Abstract = {Family- and genus-level circumscription of ferns in the suborder
   Aspleniineae (eupolypods II) has long been controversial, due in part to
   confusion about the relationship among the families Aspleniaceae and
   Athyriaceae. Recent studies have demonstrated that character states
   traditionally used to infer a close relationship between these two
   families are either symplesiomorphic or homoplastic, and re-examination
   of numerous taxa has led to the recircumscription of several clades, and
   the description of several new families and genera. In light of these
   findings, we re-evaluated the taxonomic affinities of Diplazium
   praestans, a little-known fern from western Amazonia that is
   morphologically disparate to the remainder of Neotropical Diplazium.
   Using sequence data from three chloroplast markers and analysis of eight
   morphological characters, we demonstrate that Diplazium praestans was
   erroneously placed in that genus and instead is a Hymenasplenium. We
   place it in a phylogenetic context, reassess its morphology in light of
   our findings, evaluate its conservation status under IUCN criteria, and
   provide a new combination: Hymenasplenium praestans. We also provide an
   updated key to the Neotropical species of Hymenasplenium and discuss
   unresolved taxonomic problems in the genus.},

Abstract = {A new species of the genus Senna from the Atlantic Forest of Paraiba
   State, Brazil, is described and illustrated based on a field collection,
   traditional taxonomic methodologies, and the analysis of Senna
   collections at RB and the main herbaria in northeastern Brazil.
   Morphologically, Senna pluribracteata is related to a group of four
   species of Senna sect. Chamaefistula ser. Bacillares: S. macranthera, S.
   pinheiroi, S. rizzinii, and S. rugosa, although S. pluribracteata has a
   set of distinctive anatomical characters that differentiate it: two
   extrafloral nectaries between leaflets in the rachis; large and
   conspicuous elliptic bracts 7.0-9.0mmlong along the inflorescence
   peduncle; the epidermis on the abaxial surface is conspicuously and
   compactly papillose; the rounded leaflet margins have palisade
   parenchyma near the apex; the mesophyll is dorsiventral with a single
   layer of palisade parenchyma, with isodiametric cells occupying
   approximately 60\% of that structure; the petiole has a somewhat
   pentagonal shape and is planar adaxially; the rachis is obdeltoid and
   planar adaxially. Morphological and leaf anatomical descriptions, and a
   key to identifying the seven species of Senna ser. Bacillares found in
   Paraiba State are provided. The morphological and anatomical affinities
   of S. pluribracteata and its allied taxa are discussed.},

Title = {Wood of Aspidosperma sections Aspidosperma and Pungentia (Apocynaceae)
   from Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil: Taxonomic Implications},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {175-185},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Aspidosperma (Apocynaceae) is composed of trees and shrubs; the genus
   includes 70 species, 42 of which occur in Brazil. The midwestern region
   has the second highest diversity, with 30 species, after the northern
   region, and Mato Grosso do Sul state has 15 species. This study provides
   macroscopic and microscopic wood features for ten species from A.
   section Aspidosperma and A. section Pungentia (Apocynaceae) fromMato
   Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. These characteristics can aid in the
   identification of Aspidosperma species because the nine species of these
   two sections have many morphological similarities; moreover, the wood of
   these species is economically important for timber production. Through
   macroscopic and microscopic analysis procedures, the characteristics of
   the wood and the organoleptic properties allowed recognition and
   distinction of the studied taxa. The characters of diagnostic value for
   recognition of the sections are vessel frequency and arrangement, and
   ray width. Individually, each species had a set of characteristics that
   allowed its identification: wood color; vessel arrangement; vessel
   length; ray visibility, ray composition and width; presence of crystals,
   starch grains and lipids in axial and/or ray parenchyma cells. The
   results may support conscientious exploitation by industries by
   facilitating the correct identification of the species, and will also
   help in the detection of illegal timber logging.},

Abstract = {Chirita umbrophila is a species endemic to Yunnan, China, and its exact
   systematic position remains a mystery since it was treated as a species
   with uncertain generic affiliation in the taxonomic revision of Chirita
   in 1985. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships between C.
   umbrophila and its allied species were inferred using two nuclear
   ribosomal DNA regions (ETS and ITS) and three chloroplast regions
   (rpl16, rps16, and trnL-F). Additionally, the type locality of C.
   umbrophila was revisited and flowering specimens were collected and
   examined. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that Chirita umbrophila is
   imbedded in three accessions of Loxostigma kurzii with strong support.
   Morphological observations revealed that C. umbrophila can be
   characterized as perennial herbs with somewhat tufted leaves at the top
   of the aerial stem, large ventricose corollas with yellow-brown spotted
   interior surfaces, four anthers cohering in pairs, and two equal or
   subequal stigmas. Detailed morphological analyses suggested that C.
   umbrophila is indistinguishable from Loxostigma kurzii ( Diclymocarpus?
   kurzii). Therefore, both molecular phylogenetic results and
   morphological evidence support that Chirita umbrophila is conspecific
   with Loxostigma kurzii, and a taxonomic treatment is provided herein.},

Abstract = {The palm tribe Lepidocaryeae (Arecaceae) comprises seven genera and 51
   currently accepted species that are distributed in lowland tropical
   forests and savannas across Africa and the Americas. Subtribal
   relationships within Lepidocaryeae have been a persistent challenge,
   limiting our understanding of its systematics, morphology, and
   biogeography. Several aspects make the tribe an ideal system to study
   plant evolution and diversity: it is well-represented in the fossil
   record as a prolific pollen producer, its continental diversity
   contradicts common biodiversity patterns of lower species richness in
   Africa in comparison to South America, and it contains one of the most
   abundant Amazonian tree species, Mauritia flexuosa. Here, we
   investigated the systematics of the tribe by sampling 122 individuals
   representing 42 species (82\% of the tribe), using target sequence
   capture. We recovered nearly 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms from
   nuclear and plastid DNA across 146 target sequences to separately infer
   a phylogenomic tree. Our results strongly support inter-generic and
   inter-specific relationships, where a majority of nodes were resolved
   with over 90\% bootstrap support. We also identify strong phylogenetic
   support for the recognition of a new species from central and south
   Amazonia, Mauritiella disticha. The distichous phyllotaxy is diagnostic
   of the species within the genus. Rare and currently only known from the
   middle-lower Madeira River basin in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, M.
   disticha is restricted to open vegetation and forest edges growing in
   white sand habitats with saturated or well-drained soils. Our
   preliminary red list assessment suggests its threatened status to be
   vulnerable (VU). We use our phylogenomic inference to define and
   contextualize systematic relationships in the tribe, and present a
   formal species description.},

Abstract = {A new Schizanthus species from northern Chile is described and
   illustrated. Schizanthus nutantiflorus was discovered based on recent
   collections made during unusual rain events in the Atacama Desert in
   2015. The new species is distinguished morphologically from other
   Schizanthus species from northern Chile by its short corolla tube, with
   a distinct upper lip arrangement and colour, having the longest lower
   lip, and downward-facing flowers. Additionally, the reinstatement of
   Schizanthus fallax is proposed. By using both nDNA and cpDNA,
   phylogenetic relationships among all species of Schizanthus were
   investigated. Molecular and field observations, as well as an exhaustive
   morphological revision of fresh material and herbarium specimens,
   supports the segregation of Schizanthus with short corolla tubes from
   northern Chile into three species. We propose that, in order to fully
   understand both the taxonomy and evolution of Schizanthus, an
   integrative framework encompassing molecular, ecological, and
   morphological data should be carried out. Information on distribution,
   habitat, informal conservation status, as well as taxonomic notes and
   illustrations are provided. In addition, an updated key for the species
   of Schizanthus from northern Chile is given.},

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The tribe Crescentieae includes Amphitecna (21 species), Crescentia (six
   species), and Parmentiera (10 species), three genera of understory trees
   with a center of diversity in Central America and a small number of
   species in the Antilles and northern South America. Species in
   Crescentieae are united by their fleshy, indehiscent fruit and
   cauliflorous, bat-pollinated flowers. To lay a foundation for examining
   morphological, ecological, and biogeographic patterns within the tribe,
   we inferred the phylogeny for Crescentieae using both chloroplast (ndhF,
   trnL-F) and nuclear markers (PepC, ITS). The most recent circumscription
   of Crescentieae, containing Amphitecna, Crescentia, and Parmentiera is
   supported by our phylogenetic results. Likewise, the sister relationship
   between Crescentieae and the Antillean-endemic Spirotecoma is also
   corroborated by our findings. This relationship implies the evolution of
   fleshy and indehiscent fruits from dry and dehiscent ones, as well as
   the evolution of bat pollination from insect pollination. Fruits and
   seeds from species in Crescentieae are consumed by humans, ungulates,
   birds, and fish.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Genetic and Morphological Variation within the

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Species complexes present considerable problems for aworking taxonomy
   due to the presence of intraspecific variation, hybridization,
   polyploidy, and phenotypic plasticity. Understanding evolutionary
   patterns using molecular markers can allow for a more thorough
   assessment of evolutionary lineages than traditional morphological
   markers. In this study, we evaluated genetic diversity and phylogenetic
   patterns among taxa of the Platanthera hyperborea (Orchidaceae) complex,
   which includes diploid (Platanthera aquilonis) and polyploid
   (Platanthera hyperborea, P. huronensis, and P. convallariifolia) taxa
   spanning North America, Greenland, Iceland, and Asia. We found that
   three floral morphological characters overlap among the polyploid taxa,
   but the diploid species has smaller flowers. DNA sequence variation in a
   plastid (rpL16 intron) and a nuclear (ITS) marker indicated that at
   least three diploid species have contributed to the genomes of the
   polyploid taxa, suggesting all are of allopolyploid origin. Platanthera
   convallariifolia is most like P. dilatata and P. stricta, whereas P.
   huronensis and P. hyperborea appear to have originated from crosses of
   P. dilatata and P. aquilonis. Platanthera huronensis, which is found
   across North America, has multiple origins and reciprocal maternal
   parentage from the diploid species. By contrast, P. hyperborea,
   restricted to Greenland and Iceland, appears to have originated from a
   small founding population of hybrids in which P. dilatata was the
   maternal parent. Geographic structure was found among polyploid forms in
   North America. The area of Manitoba, Canada appears to be a contact zone
   among geographically diverse forms from eastern andwestern North
   America. Given the geographic and genetic variation found, we recommend
   continued recognition of four green-flowered species within this
   complex, but caution that there may be additional cryptic taxa within
   North America.},

Title = {Cryptic species of Anopheles messeae sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae),

Abstract = {The paper describes the change in perspective in the composition of the
   A. messeae taxonomic unit. Initially, based on the disequilibrium of
   natural populations, the species was differentiated into A and B forms
   using chromosomal inversions as markers. The positive assortative
   mating, as well as the ecological features and geographical distribution
   of these forms, made it possible to give them the status of species in
   statu nascendi. Later, we additionally investigated the EcoRI
   restriction fragments of the genomic DNA and the ITS2 nucleotide
   sequences in the A and B A. messeae species. Unambiguous differences
   between the species in the former marker and semi-quantitative
   differences in the latter one, alongside with the absence of hybrids in
   the populations studied, led us to conclude that A. messeae s.l. is
   comprised of two homosequential cryptic species with parallel
   chromosomal polymorphisms. Unequivocal parallels between A. lewisi
   Ludlow, 1920 and A. messeae B in regards to their features, as well as
   the identity of A. daciae Linton et al., 2004 to A. messeae A in its
   ITS2 sequence, and to A. messeae Fall. in diagnostic chromosomal
   inversions, allowed us to consider A. lewisi Ludlow, 1920 and A. messeae
   B as two names of the same biological species, and A. messeae Fall.,
   1926, A. messeae A, and A. daciae Linton et al., 2004 as three names of
   the other one. Both are members of the palaearctic group of the
   Maculipennis complex under the names Anopheles (Ano.) lewisi Ludlow,
   1920 and Anopheles (Ano) messeae Falleroni, 1926, respectively.},

Title = {Occurrence and characteristics of Bacillus cereus group bacterial
   atmospheric aerosols in Novosibirsk region},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {56},
Pages = {60-85},
Abstract = {The microbial diversity of atmospheric bioaerosols involves
   microorganisms that can cause allergic and infectious diseases or toxic
   effects. They include bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group (B. cereus,
   B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, etc.),
   which can result in diarrhea, pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and
   other infectious diseases. Accordingly, monitoring the presence of
   Bacillus cereus group bacteria in aerosols is critical. However,
   practically no data exist on Bacillus cereus and other cereus-group
   bacteria in southwestern Siberia's poorly investigated atmospheric
   aerosol environment. Bacteria of the cereus group are capable of
   effective production of various biologically active compounds, with
   important implications for biotechnology; microorganism strains with new
   capabilities are being investigated. This study aimed to determine the
   occurrence and characteristics of B. cereus group bacteria in
   ground-level and high-altitude atmospheric aerosols in Novosibirsk
   region of southwestern Siberia, and to evaluate the biotechnological
   potential of the obtained microbial isolates.
   High-altitude atmospheric samples were collected over Karakan Pine
   Forest, approximately 50 km south of Novosibirsk, at altitudes of 7000,
   5500, 4000, 2000,1500, 1000, and 500 m, by aircraft sounding. Boundaries
   of the aircraft flight path: 54 degrees 26'38 `' N, 82 degrees 30'47 `'
   E; 54 degrees 10'55 `' N, 81 degrees 44'00 `' E. Ground-level samples
   were collected at various sites in Koltsovo settlement, Novosibirsk
   region. Impingers with a flow rate of 50 L/min containing 50 ml of
   Hanks' solution were used for air sampling. The obtained aerosol samples
   were sown on a set of nutrient media and incubated at 28-30 degrees C
   and 6-10 degrees C. The titers of microorganisms in high-altitude and
   ground-level samples were determined in terms of 1 m 3 of atmospheric
   air. Standard microbiological methods were employed to study the
   phenotypic characteristics of the identified microbial isolates.
   Lipolytic activity was determined on yolk agar and LB agarized medium
   containing fatty acid esters with 0.01\% CaC1 2 . The substrates used
   were 1.0\% monolaurate (tween-20) and monooleate (tween-80). Amylolytic
   activity of the cultures was determined by their isolation on
   starch-ammonia agar, and proteolytic activity by their ability to
   hydrolyse milk gelatin and casein (Maniatis T et al., 1984). The ability
   to hemolysis was taken into account when cultures were plated on LB
   medium with the addition of ram's blood. Nuclease activity was studied
   on LB medium with the addition of Sigma DNA (USA) (Maniatis T et al.,
   1984). The content of plasmid DNA in the isolates was determined by
   screening according to Maniatis T et al. (1984). The capacity for RNAase
   secretion in culture medium (peptone - 9.27 g/l, yeast extract - 5 g/l,
   NaCl - 3.00; 10 ml of 50\% glycerin, 2 ml of 20\% glucose; pH 7.07.2)
   during cultivation of bacteria at 30 degrees C, for 18-24 h, was
   determined by the accumulation of acid-soluble products, formed upon
   hydrolysis of high-polymer RNA of yeast (1 mg/ml). Antibiotic activity
   of the studied strains was determined by cross-strics (Yasuda T et al.,
   1992) on LB medium at 37 degrees C. The following pathogenic test
   strains were used: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis
   ATCC 6633, Candida albicans 620, Klebsiella pneumoniae B-4894,
   Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella typhimurium 2606, and Shigella
   sonnei 32 (collection of FSBI State Research Centre Vektor of the
   Rospotrebnadzor). The genetic analysis of bacterial isolates was
   performed using PCR with specific primers on 16S rRNA. The calculation
   of the number of cultivated microorganisms in the samples was carried
   out according to the Kerber method {[}Bottone EJ, 2010], and the number
   of microorganisms was averaged over three parallels of the inoculated
   samples. The annual average numbers of cultivated microorganisms were
   calculated as a mean +/- the confidence interval at a significance level
   of 95\% of t-Student's (p < 0.05).
   Percentages of spore-forming cultured bacteria in aerosol samples varied
   significantly across the years of observation (1998-present): in
   high-altitude samples, the minimum and maximum were 0.5\% (in 2005) and
   55\% (in 2011), respectively, and, in ground-level samples, the minimum
   and maximum were 0.1\% (in 2002) and 83\% (in 2016), respectively (See
   Fig. 1 and 2). Annual averages of total concentration of microorganisms
   ranged from < 1 to 5810 5 CFU/m(3). The number of cereus-group bacteria
   also varied significantly from sample to sample, with averages ranging
   from 0.01\% to 6.5\% of the total number of isolated microorganisms. A
   total of 2.025 bacterial isolates, of which 62 formed endospores, were
   isolated from ground-level and highaltitude aerosol samples collected
   during the predominance of south-westerly winds from Kazakhstan in
   autumn 2016, and were characterized by increased dust-component content.
   Spore-forming bacteria were identified as belonging to the genera
   Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Lysinibacillus, and some others.
   Both high-altitude and ground-level aerosol samples were shown to
   contain bacteria of the cereus group: Bacillus cereus (Bc) and Bacillus
   thuringiensis (Bt), Bt ssp. kurstaki, Bt ssp. galleriae subspecies; Bt
   strains with indefinite serotype were also found. Notably, Bacillus
   anthracis species were not found (See Table 1). Screening for enzyme
   secretion revealed Bt and Bc strains with pronounced proteolytic,
   phosphatase, lipolytic, and amylolytic activities in a medium pH range
   from 5.0 to 9.0 (See Table 2). An atypical strain of B. thuringiensis
   Cb-527, which demonstrates high production of RNase, was isolated. All
   strains demonstrated hemolysis capability, were multi-resistant to
   antibiotics (resistant to 6-15 drugs (See Table 3), and suppressed the
   growth of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, to varying degrees.
   The Bt Cb-527 strain, as well as several Bc strains, also effectively
   inhibited the growth of Gram-positive test strains of Staphylococcus
   aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Gram-negative bacterial test strains were
   low-sensitive to the action of metabolites of the studied Bc and Bt
   strains (See Table 4).
   In high-altitude and ground-level samples of the studied atmospheric
   aerosols, bacteria of the cereus group belonging to Bacillus cereus and
   Bacillus thuringiensis species were found in amounts ranging from 0.01
   to 6.5\% of the total number of cultured microorganisms isolated under
   experimental conditions. The presence of aggression enzymes such as
   phospholipases, hemolysins, proteases, and nucleolytic enzymes typical
   of representatives of these taxa, was found. We isolated Bc and Bt
   strains with high levels of secretion of enzymes and metabolites that
   possess antibiotic activity; these strains are promising as producers.
   The Bacillus thuringiensis Cb-527 strain (with a pronounced secretion of
   the RNase complex) can be used for the development of
   anti-RNA-containing virus drugs. The isolated Bc and Bt strains
   demonstrated multiple antibiotic resistance, which confirms literature
   data on the increasing prevalence of polyresistance among the identified
   natural microbial isolates.},

Title = {Assessment of the relationship between chlorophyll content and biogenic
   elements in large lowland resevoirs},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {53},
Pages = {151-168},
Abstract = {In the second half of the 20th century, with increased rates of
   eutrophication, universal quantitative relationships between the content
   of biogenic elements and chlorophyll (Chl) were obtained, which serves
   as a marker of algae biomass, as well as an indicator of the trophic
   status of water bodies. Most of these studies were performed on lakes,
   however, the patterns and ratios found for lakes were not always
   observed in reservoirs, young ecosystems with high development dynamics.
   Long-term studies of phytoplankton productivity are carried out in the
   reservoirs of the Upper Volga. These studies have shown that a direct
   relationship of Chl with total nitrogen (N-tot) and phosphorus (P-tot)
   is rarely found and is at low correlation coefficients. A more
   successful attempt was to indirectly assess this relationship using the
   ratios of Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot, which was named ``phytoplankton
   response{''} (Vinberg, 1987) corresponding to the term ``efficiency{''}
   (Kalf, Knoechel, 1978). Our first data on Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot in the
   Upper Volga reservoirs refer to 1980-1990 (Mineeva and Razgulin, 1995;
   Mineeva, 1993; Mineeva, 2004). At present, new data have been obtained,
   which have made it possible to follow long-term trends in the
   development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga in
   connection with the availability of biogenic elements under variations
   in the trophic status of the reservoirs.
   Samples were collected in August 2015-2018 at 26 stations in three large
   reservoirs of the Upper Volga (56 degrees 51'-58 degrees 22'N, 35
   degrees 55'-38 degrees 25'E): Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs.
   Chlorophyll content was determined by the fluorescence method (Gol'd et
   al., 1986) in integral water samples taken from the surface to the
   bottom. Data on biogenic elements obtained at the same time by Dr Irina
   Stepanova are given in our joint publication (Mineeva et al., 2021). The
   standard software packages for a personal computer were used for
   statistical processing (calculation of mean values and standard error of
   the mean (M +/- m(M)), correlation and variation coefficients,
   regression equations and graphing).
   In this research, we revealed that nutrient content in the Upper Volga
   reservoirs varied within similar limits, the average N-tot/P-tot ratio
   was the same, and the average values of P-tot and N-tot decreased in
   Rybinsk reservoir. Chl content was typical of the summer phytoplankton
   maximum in the Upper Volga reservoirs (See Table 1). P-tot content did
   not change much in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but in Rybinsk
   reservoir it increased in 2015 and decreased in 2016. The more stable
   content of N-tot decreased a little in the cool 2017. Chl concentrations
   of 20-30 mu g/L obtained in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2018, in
   Uglich reservoir in 2017 and in Ivankovo reservoir in 2015 correspond to
   the eutrophic category; concentrations of 35-52 mu g/L (Rybinsk
   reservoir in 2016, Uglich reservoir in 2015, 2016 and 2018, Ivankovo
   reservoir in 2016-2018) - to hypertrophic category, and only in 2017 in
   Rybinsk reservoir did they decrease to a moderately eutrophic level of
   13 mu g/L (See Fig. 1). It was found out that under these conditions Chl
   content per unit of biogenic elements varied in a wide range: Chl/P-tot
   from 0,03 to 2,13, Chl/N-tot from 2,55 to 123, with maximum values in
   the highly eutrophic Shosha reach in Ivankovo reservoir (August 2018).
   Chl/N-tot slightly differed in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but
   increased in Rybinsk reservoir; Chl/P-tot decreased in the range of
   Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs (See Table 1). Most of both
   ratios belong to narrower limits: 0.10-0.50 for Chl/P-tot (67\% of all
   values) and 10-40 for Chl/N-tot (51\%) (See Table 2). The average
   Chl/P-tot ratio for the entire data set is 0.43 +/- 0.03, and Chl/N-tot
   is 29.8 +/- 1.9 with variation coefficients of 77.0 and 63.9\%. The
   interannual changes (See Fig. 1) show that all the maximum ratios were
   obtained in 2016, while the minimum in Ivankovo reservoir was in 2015,
   in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2017 and in Uglich reservoir in 2017
   and 2018. Our results demonstrate that both ratios correlate with each
   other (See Fig. 2), as well as with the Chl content (See Fig. 3). The
   correlation of both ratios with Chl weakens in Ivankovo reservoir,
   probably due to the abundant development of macrophytes. We can observe
   the same in all reservoirs in the cool 2017 with a decrease in Chl(Cya)n
   (the abundance of cyanoprokaryotes) and an increase in the proportion of
   Chl(Bac) (the abundance of diatoms). Both ratios are insignificantly
   dependent on hydrological factors as well as on P-tot and N-tot content,
   but the situation can change in individual reservoirs and in different
   years of observation (See Table 3). As it was demonstrated, both ratios
   increase with the growth of trophy estimated by Chl. They do not
   significantly differ in mesotrophic and moderately eutrophic waters, but
   become much higher in eutrophic and highly eutrophic waters, indicating
   a more efficient consumption of nutrients in the latter. At the same
   time, P-tot and N-tot change little along the Chl gradient (See Table
   4).
   Chl/P-tot decreases with the increase in P-tot and grows slightly with
   the increase in N-tot; Chl/N-tot does not change over the entire range
   of P-tot and N-tot; but both ratios vary along the gradient of
   N-tot/P-tot (See Table 5) that serves as an indicator of the biogenic
   limitation of phytoplankton and a factor regulating the development of
   algae. A retrospective analysis shows significant interannual
   fluctuations of both ratios in Rybinsk reservoir and a tendency to
   increase them in Uglich and Ivankovo reservoirs (See Fig. 1).
   Thus, Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot ratios are useful for analyzing the
   relationship between the development of phytoplankton and nutrient
   supply that is necessary in order to assess the efficiency of their use
   and their availability to algae cells. The results obtained allow us to
   conclude that phytoplankton in the Upper Volga reservoirs is less
   sensitive to the presence of nitrogen and more dependent on phosphorus.

Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {114-134},
Abstract = {Micropropagation is one of the fastest ways of plant propagation. This
   method allows obtaining a large number of clones that retain all
   characteristics of the species and varieties of plants. Among the
   important problems of micropropagation of potato plants, two can be
   distinguished: the rate of microclones regeneration (rooting of
   microclones and the development of regenerants) in vitro and the value
   of the propagation factor (number of layers). The plant hormones auxins
   and cytokinins, whose content changes along the longitudinal axis of the
   plant, play a key role in the regeneration of cuttings. The aim of this
   research was to study the specificity of micropropagation, morphogenesis
   and metabolism of Solanum tuberosum L. regenerants in vitro, depending
   on the initial explants position in the plant.
   The objects of the study were plants of S. tuberosum L. of the
   mid-season cultivar Lugovskoy. During the experiment, cuttings
   (explants) taken from layers 3 and 5 of the shoot consisted of
   intemodes, buds and leaves. We chose apical cuttings containing a
   greater amount of endogenous auxins due to the spatial separation of the
   site of synthesis and the main action of these hormones in the plant as
   experienced clones. Cuttings from the middle of the shoot were those of
   control. We cultured cuttings on hormone-free solid agar 50\% nutrient
   medium Murashige-Skoog (MS) supplemented with 3\% sucrose and vitamins.
   The flux density of incident photons of the PAR was 200-230 mu
   mol/(m(2).s), with a 16-hour photoperiod and an air temperature of 20-22
   degrees C. Luminescent white lamps TL-D 58W / 54-765 G13 (Philips,
   Poland) were used as a light source. The relative light intensity was
   measured using an AvaSpec-102/256/1024/2048 spectrometer version 6.2
   (Avantes BV, Netherlands). During 3 weeks of culturing microclones in
   test tubes, we described the phenology of their regeneration. We
   assessed the formation of adventive roots (AdR) by the dynamics of
   changes in the number and length of AdR primordia. The formation of
   regenerants was assessed by the dynamics of changes in the number of
   layers and the length of shoots. At the end of cultivation on the 39th
   day, we removed the regenerants from the test tubes and determined their
   growth and biochemical parameters. We used the gravimetric method to
   determine the wet and dry biomass of the regenerants. We measured the
   leaf surface area using the Moticam 2300 software (Spain) on photographs
   taken with a digital camera. The intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPO)
   and the content of free proline were measured in the leaves of the
   middle layers fixed with liquid nitrogen. The content of photosynthetic
   pigments was determined in the alcoholic extract. In the air dry
   material, the total content of flavonoids and anthocyanins was
   determined. We carried out the measurements using a Genesys 10S UV-Vis
   spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron, Germany). The significance of the
   differences between the samples was assessed using Student's t-test
   (p<0.05). Figures show data as the mean of the repetitions and their
   confidence interval (M +/- 1.96SEM). All experiments were performed in
   20-40 (growth parameters) and five (physiological parameters) biological
   and three analytical replicates.
   We noted the emergence of roots in potato cuttings on the 4th-5th day.
   More active root formation and their elongation occurred after seven
   days of cultivation in apical clones, compared with clones obtained from
   the middle layer. By the 10th day of cultivation, the apical clones had
   formed seven roots, while the middle ones had four roots, their total
   length was 9.04 +/- 0.36 and 6.56 +/- 0.26 cm, respectively (See Fig. 1,
   A-B). In the cuttings of the middle layer, bud opening and growth of the
   first shoot internode started earlier than in the apical microclone (See
   Fig. 1, C-D). The manifestation of donor-acceptor bonds between organs
   during the formation of regenerants should be noted. The predominant
   growth of the root system in the apical microclone caused inhibition of
   the growth and development of the shoot. In the middle microclone, the
   opposite pattern took place: shoot growth prevailed when the root growth
   was inhibited. We studied the growth parameters of 39-day-old potato
   regenerants obtained from apical (AR) and medium (MR) shoot cuttings of
   potato mother plants (See Fig. 2, A). In AR, root volume, shoot length,
   number of layers, and the total leaf area increased by 25, 14, 11 and
   20\% (p<0.05), respectively compared to MR (See Fig. 2, B-E). The
   regenerants had the same total dry biomass (See Fig. 2, F). However, the
   redistribution of dry matter between the organs in the plant was
   ambiguous. We showed that ARs had a 34\% (p<0.05) lower dry root mass
   relative to MR, but a 13.4\% higher shoot biomass due to the leaf
   surface. As a result, the shootto-root dry mass ratio was higher in AR
   compared to MR. In vitro potato regenerants showed predominantly
   heterotrophic growth since more active AR growth occurred against the
   background of a low content of all groups of photosynthetic pigments and
   the chlorophyll a I chlorophyll b ratio (See Fig. 3, E). We studied the
   physiological state of the regenerants by the biochemical parameters of
   the middle leaves. In AR leaves, the intensity of LPO relative to MR
   decreased by 22\% (p<0.05), which indicated the formation of a higher
   oxidative status in MR. AR has a reduced content of free proline by 28\%
   (p<0.05) compared to MR (See Fig. 3, A-B). The total flavonoids content
   in MR was twice that in AR (See Fig. 3, C). This could indicate a
   decrease in the intensity of their growth processes. The level of
   anthocyanins in the MR and AR did not differ.
   The data obtained show the ability of the initial hormonal status of
   microclones to change the sequence and intensity of their regeneration
   processes, including organogenesis, growth rate and plant metabolism.
   The use of apical micro-clones is especially important when it is
   necessary to increase the reproductive rate of plants. The mechanisms
   underlying the different rates of regeneration of microscopic cuttings
   taken from different layers of the S. tuberosum shoot are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the Republic of Altai, there are about 7 thousand lakes with a total
   area of more than 600 km(2) and most of them are practically unexplored.
   Despite the fact that botanical research has been carried out on the
   territory of the Republic of Altai for a rather long period and
   generalizing works have been published, the aquatic flora of the region
   has not been fully studied. This work presents a processed part of the
   data on floristic findings obtained during hydrobotanical research in
   lakes of the Altai Mountains.
   We completed the fieldwork in the first half of July 2018. 12 lakes
   located in Ust-Kanskii, Ongudayskii, Ulaganskii and Kosh-Agachskii
   districts, as well as several small roadside water bodies were surveyed
   by the route method using an inflatable boat. In the course of the work,
   we used hydrobotanical cat-rakes, a portable Garmin eTrex Vista
   navigator (with a GPS receiver), and a Pentax waterproof camera.
   Mineralization measurements were carried out in the surface layer of
   water using a Hanna HI 98130 portable conductometer-thermometer-pH
   meter. To determine the plants, we used an Altami PS0745-T stereoscopic
   microscope with a camera. Herbarium specimens were transferred to the
   NSK Herbarium of the Central Siberian Botanical Garden of the Siberian
   Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences.
   During our hydrobotanical reseach on a number of water bodies of the
   Altai Republic, we discovered five species that had not been previously
   indicated for this region.

   the first three species in fresh waters, and Z. repens and S.
   chakassiensis in brackish waters. All these findings supplement
   information on the distribution of these species in Siberia. Utricularia
   macrorhiza, Ranunculus subrigidus and Lemna turionifera are
   predominantly American-Asian species, Stuckenia chakassiensis is,
   mainly, an Asian one.},

Title = {The effect of deicing salt solutes on Moina macrocopa and Allium cepa in
   a toxicity test experiment},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Chloride salts are the most commonly used deicing materials for winter
   maintenance of roads. Numerous studies indicate a significant increase
   in the salinity of aquatic ecosystems associated with the long-term use
   of deicing materials in countries located in cold climates. The
   functioning of ecosystems largely depends on salinity, since salinity is
   one of the key factors determining the species composition, the
   structure of food webs and the productivity of aquatic communities.
   Given the growing threat of salinization of groundwater and surface
   waters, it is extremely important to study the effect of deicing
   materials on the biota and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The aim of
   this research is to determine the threshold concentrations of solutions
   of the deicing salt mixture ``Bionord{''} containing sodium and calcium
   chlorides, at which negative effects on the development of animal and
   plant test objects are observed.
   In this study, we used the salt-containing mixture ``Bionord{''} as a
   model deicer. Similarly, with the most commonly used ice melting
   chemicals, the ``Bionord{''} salt mixture contains a large amount of
   sodium and calcium chlorides (about 85\% of the total weight). To
   evaluate the toxicity of the deicer solutions, we used acute and chronic
   toxicity tests with cladoceran Moina macrocopa (Straus, 1820)
   (Cladocera: Moinidae) and standard onion-based test with Allium cepa L.
   (Liliopsida: Amaryllidaceae) (Allium-test). In acute and chronic
   toxicity tests with Cladocera, the females on the first day of their
   life (body size 0.5-0.6 mm) were placed individually in jars with aged
   (not less than for 72 h) tap water with a volume of 20 ml with the
   addition of a deicer at a certain concentration. A group of animals that
   was placed in the medium without the deicer was used as a control. In
   the acute toxicity tests, we used the following concentration of the
   deicer: 1.3; 2.5; 4.0, 5.0; 6.0; 8.0; 10.0 g/l. The mortality of animals
   was recorded 24 and 48 hours after the start of the experiment. The
   concentration of the deicer (LC50) at which 50\% of animals was observed
   to die, compared to the control, was determined in the acute toxicity
   test. In a chronic toxicity test, animals were tested in the following
   range of concentrations of the deicer: 0.3; 0.6; 1.3; 2.5; 5.0; 6.0 and
   8.0 g/l. The chronic toxicity test was conducted until the death of all
   test animals. Based on the data obtained in the chronic toxicity test,
   the specific growth rate of juvenile females, average fecundity, and
   average life span of M. macrocopa were calculated for each concentration
   of the deicer. Bulbs of onions of the Stuttgartenrisen variety with a
   diameter of 1.8 +/- 0.1 cm and a weight of 2.27 +/- 0.17 g were used in
   the onion test. Bulbs with their bottoms were placed in test tubes
   containing 20 ml of a solute of the deicer or tap water for 48 hours.
   Three bulbs were tested for each concentration and for the control. The
   following concentrations of the deicer were used in the onion test: 1.0;
   2.5; 5.0; 7.0; 10.0; 15.0; 20.0; 50.0 g/l. The general toxic and
   cytotoxic effects were evaluated in the onion test. The average root
   length and the total root length on each bulb were used as indicators of
   the total toxicity of the solutions of deicer. To evaluate proliferative
   activity, we calculated the mitotic index as the fraction of dividing
   cells in the apical root meristem to the total number of cells. Based on
   the results of the experiments, we determined median effective mixture
   concentrations (EC50) at which there is a 50\% decrease, compared to the
   control, in the values of root growth indicators: average root length,
   sum of root lengths on each bulb and mitotic index.
   Median lethal concentration (LC50) of the deicing salt determined in the
   48-hour acute toxicity test with females of Al. macrocopa was equal to
   5.1 g/l. In the chronic test, we showed that the exposure to the
   solutions of the deicing salt in the range of concentrations from 0.3 to
   5.0 g/l does not affect the life span, specific growth rate of juveniles
   and fecundity of females of M. macrocopa. The median effective
   concentration (EC50) of the deicing salt determined in the Allium-tests
   were 6.3, 5.2 and 10.4 g/l for the sum of root lengths, average root
   length on each bulb and proliferative activity at the tips of roots
   (mitotic index), respectively (See Table 1 and 2). Complete inhibition
   of onion root growth was observed at the concentration of the decider
   equal to 20 g/l, while the death of all test animals in the acute
   toxicity test occurred at the concentration of the deicer equal to 8,0
   g/l (See Fig. 1).
   Thus, we demonstrated that similar concentrations of the deicer induced
   50\% inhibition of the growth of onion roots and 50\% mortality of
   cladocerans. These values, in general, corresponded to a critical
   salinity of 5-8 \%o above which qualitative changes occur both in the
   external and internal condition of aquatic animals. The electrical
   conductivity of the deicer solutions, which had a negative effect on the
   selected test species, coincides with the previously obtained values of
   the electrical conductivity of sodium chloride solutions harmful to
   cladocerans. We can assume that the main mechanism of the effect of the
   deicing material that we study is associated with the biological effect
   of its chlorine and sodium salts Taking this into account, the value of
   electrical conductivity measured for solutions of deicing salt can be
   used to assess its negative potential effects. We estimated that in the
   absence of timely cleaning, regulated by the rules for using the
   material, the runoff from each square meter of the treated surface can
   lead to the pollution of 8-13 liters of fresh water. Thus, the basic
   requirement for the use of deicing salts on roads is the need to comply
   with the cleaning regime of the treated surfaces. Otherwise, the gradual
   accumulation of sodium and calcium chlorides in water bodies can cause
   an increase in salinity which will affect the survival of freshwater
   aquatic organisms and lead to serious disturbances in the functioning of
   aquatic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in the cone scales of
   two closely related larch species, Larix dahurica Laws. (=Larix gmelinii
   (Rupr.) Rupr) and L. cajanderi Mayr, was carried out. The data on the
   taxonomy and distribution of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi are
   contradictory. The taxonomic status of L. cajanderi has been confirmed
   by the genetic and morphological studies performed in Russia and based
   on considerable evidence, but the species has not been recognized
   internationally, being considered as a synonym of Larix gmelinii var.
   gmelinii. In the systematics of larch, morphological characters of the
   generative organs are mainly used as diagnostic markers, among the most
   important being the shape variation of the cone scales. The aim of this
   study was to test geometric morphometrics as a tool for analyzing
   differentiation of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi in the shape of their
   cone scales.
   Characterization of shape variations in cone scales using geometric
   morphometric methods consists in digitizing points along an outline of
   scales followed by analysis of partial warps, describing individual
   differences in coordinates of the outline points. We studied the
   populations of L. dahurica from Evenkia and the Trans-Baikal region and
   six L. cajanderi populations from Yakutia and Magadan Oblast. In each
   population, we analyzed samples of 100-150 cones collected from 20-30
   trees. Scales taken from the middle part of the cones were scanned using
   an Epson Perfection V500 Photo. On the scanned images, outline points
   were placed with a TPSDig program (Rolf, 2010), using angular algorithm
   (Oreshkova et al., 2015). The data were processed and analyzed using
   Integrated Morphometrics Programs (IMP) software
   (http://www.canisius.edu/similar to sheets/morphsoft.html, Sheets,
   2001), following the guidelines on geometric morphometrics in biology
   (Pavlinov, Mikeshina, 2002; Zelditch et al., 2004). Initial coordinates
   of the scale landmarks were aligned with the mean structure for L.
   dahurica and L. cajanderi cone scales using Procrustes superimposition
   in the CoordGen6 program. PCA based on covariances of partial warp
   scores was applied to reveal directions of variation in the shape of the
   cone scales. The relative deformations of the cone scales (PCA scores)
   were used as shape variables for statistical comparisons of these two
   larch species with canonical discriminant analysis. Morphotypes of the
   cone scales were distinguished in L. dahurica populations by pairwise
   comparison of samples from trees in the TwoGroup6h program using
   Bootstrap resampling-based Goodall's F-test (Sheets, 2001). Samples from
   the trees in which the cone scales differed significantly (p < 0.01)
   were considered to belong to different morphotypes. Morphotypes
   distinguished in L. dahurica populations were compared with the
   morphotypes that we had previously determined in L. cajanderi
   populations. The composition and the frequency of occurrence of
   morphotypes were used to determine phenotypic distances between
   populations (Zhivotovskii, 1991). Multidimensional scaling matrix of the
   phenotypic distances was applied for ordination of larch populations.
   In this research, we revealed differentiation of L. dahurica and L.
   cajanderi using geometric morphometric analysis of the shape variation
   of cone scales. The results of PCA of partial warp scores exposed four
   principal components, which account for 90\% of total explained variance
   in the shape of the cone scales in the two larch species. Graphical
   representations of these shape transformations in the vector form
   characterized directions of shape variability in scales corresponding to
   the maximum and minimum values of four principal components (See Fig.
   2). PCA-ordination of the larch populations revealed some difference in
   the shape variation of the cone scales in L. dahurica and L. cajanderi
   (See Fig. 3). The results of canonical discriminant analysis of relative
   deformations of scales showed differentiation of the populations of the
   two larch species (See Fig. 4). Eleven morphotypes were identified in L.
   dahurica cones from Evenkia and nine morphotypes in the Ingoda
   population, three of the morphotypes being common for both populations
   (See Fig. 5). The shape of L. dahurica cone scales varied from spatulate
   to oval and their apical margins from weakly sinuate to distinctly
   sinuate. The Trans-Baikal population was dominated by scales with obtuse
   (truncate) and rounded apexes. The obtained morphotypes were compared
   with 25 cone scale morphotypes previously distinguished in the Yakut and
   the Magadan L. cajanderi populations (See Fig. 3). Four similar
   morphotypes of cone scales were revealed in the North-Yeniseisk
   population of L. dahurica and the Yakut populations of L. cajanderi. The
   differences between them in the populations of the two larch species
   were nonsignificant (p > 0.01). All morphotypes of cone scales from the
   Ingoda population of L. dahurica differed significantly from L.
   cajanderi cone scale morphotypes. The results of multidimensional
   scaling phenotypic distance matrix calculated based on the similarity of
   morphotypes of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi populations were consistent
   with the results of their differentiation based on relative deformations
   of scales obtained using canonical discriminant analysis (See Fig. 4 and
   Fig. 7). In spite of the differences in the shape of the cone scales
   between the North-Yeniseisk and the Trans-Baikal populations of L.
   dahurica, they both differed from L. cajanderi populations. Thus,
   phenotypic analysis confirmed differentiation of these two larch
   species. Despite the similarities between a number of morphotypes, the
   Yakut L. cajanderi populations were differentiated from L. dahurica
   populations. Significant differences were noted between intraspecific
   groups: between L. cajanderi populations from Okhotsk-Kolyma Upland and
   Yakutia and between L. dahurica populations from Evenkia and the
   Trans-Baikal region (See Fig. 4). The similarities between species and
   intraspecific differences may be attributed to the ongoing processes of
   hybridization and species formation in the region where the ranges of
   the larches overlap with the ranges of L. czekanowskii Szafer and L.
   dahuricax L. cajanderi hybrids. Geometric morphometrics can be used as
   an effective tool for analyzing differentiation of L. dahurica and L.
   cajanderi in the shape of their cone scales. The paper contains 7

Title = {Obtaining tree stand attributes from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data:
   the case of mixed forests},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {Nowadays, due to the rapid development of lightweight unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAV), remote sensing systems of ultra-high resolution have
   become available to many researchers. Conventional ground-based
   measurements for assessing tree stand attributes can be expensive, as
   well as time- and labor-consuming. Here, we assess whether remote
   sensing measurements with lightweight UAV can be more effective in
   comparison to ground survey methods in the case of temperate mixed
   forests.
   The study was carried out at the Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Nature
   Reserve (Moscow region, Russia). This area belongs to a
   coniferous-broad-leaved forest zone. Our field works were carried out on
   the permanent sampling plot of 1 ha (100 x100 m) established in 2016.
   The coordinates of the plot center are N 54.88876 degrees, E 37.56273
   degrees in the WGS 84 datum. All trees with DBH (diameter at breast
   height) of at least 6 cm (779 trees) were mapped and measured during the
   ground survey in 2016 (See Fig. 1 and Table 1). Mapping was performed
   with Laser Technology TruPulse 360B angle and a distance meter. First,
   polar coordinates of each tree trunk were measured, and then, after
   conversion to the cartesian coordinates, the scheme of the stand was
   validated on-site. Species and DBH were determined for each tree. For
   each living tree, we detected a social status class (according to
   Kraft). Also for living trees, we measured the tree height and the radii
   of the crown horizontal projection in four cardinal directions.
   A lightweight UAV Phantom 4 (DJI-Innovations, Shenzhen, China) equipped
   with an integrated camera of 12Mp sensor was used for aerial photography
   in this study. Technical parameters of the camera are available in Table
   2. The aerial photography was conducted on October 12, 2017, from an
   altitude of 68 m. The commonly used mosaic flight mode was used with
   90\% overlapping both for side and front directions. We applied Agisoft
   Metashape software for orthophoto mosaic image and dense point cloud
   building. The canopy height model (CHM) was generated with lidR package
   in R. We used lasground() function and cloth simulation filter for
   classification of ground points. To create a normalized dataset with the
   ground at 0, we used spatial interpolation algorithm tin based on a
   Delaunay triangulation, which performs a linear interpolation within
   each triangle, implemented in the lasnormilise() function. CHM was
   generated according to the pit-free algorithm based on the computation
   of a set of classical triangulations at different heights. The location
   and height of individual trees were automatically detected by the
   function FindTreesCHM() from the package rLIDAR in R. The algorithm
   implemented in this function is local maximum with fixed window size.
   Accuracy assessment of automatically detected trees (in QGIS software)
   was performed through visual interpretation of orthophoto mosaic and
   comparison with ground survey data. The number of correctly detected
   trees, omitted by the algorithm and not existing but detected trees were
   counted. As a result of aerial photography, 501 images were obtained.
   During these data processing with the Metashape, dense point cloud of
   163.7 points / m(2) was generated. CHM with 0.5 m resolution was
   calculated.
   According to the individual-tree detection algorithm, 241 trees were
   found automatically (See Fig. 2A). The total accuracy of individual tree
   detection was 73.9\%. Coniferous trees (Pinus sylvestris and Picea
   abies) were successfully detected (86.0\% and 100\%, respectively),
   while results for birch (Betula spp.) required additional treatment. The
   algorithm correctly detected only 58.2\% of birch trees due to
   false-positive trees (See Fig. 2B and Table 3). These results confirm
   the published literature data obtained for managed tree stands. Tree
   heights retrieved from the UAV were well-matched to ground-based method
   results. The mean tree heights retrieved from the UAV and ground surveys
   were 25.0 +/- 4.8 m (min 8.2 m, max 32.9 m) and 25.3 +/- 5.2 m (min 5.9
   m, max 34.0 m), respectively (no significant difference, p-value=0.049).
   Linear regression confirmed a strong relationship between the estimated
   and measured heights (y=k{*}x, R-2 =0.99, k=0.98) (See Fig. 3A).
   Slightly larger differences in heights estimated by the two methods were
   found for birch and pine; for spruce, the differences were smaller (See
   Fig. 3B and Table 4). We believe that ground measurements of birch and
   pine height are less accurate than for spruce due to different crown
   shapes of these trees. So, our results suggested that UAV data can be
   used for tree stand attributes estimation, but automatically obtained
   data require validation.},

Title = {Volumetric characteristics of the external respiration function in ski
   racers in the annual cycle},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {The state of the external respiration system is one of the most
   important factors determining the functional capabilities of the body of
   athletes and the effectiveness of sports activities. Indicators of its
   functioning among northerner athletes are modulated not only by the
   training process, but also by climatic and geographical factors.
   Literature data on the study of the function of external respiration in
   ski racers in the annual cycle are absent, there are only works
   considering seasons or some months of the year. Therefore, the aim of
   our work is to study the volumetric characteristics of the function of
   external respiration in the annual cycle of ski racers living and
   training in the European North, which is important for understanding the
   mechanisms of adaptation to environmental conditions during sports
   activities, as well as the influence of environmental conditions on the
   success of training and competitive processes.
   Seventy people aged 16-34 years (20.2 +/- 0.6 years) participated in the
   study. Participants were professional athletes living in the territory
   of the European North (62 degrees N, 51 degrees E) practically since
   birth. Studies were carried out monthly for 7 years. Every subject's
   height and body weight were measured during the tests. External
   respiration function (FEV) was determined using microprocessor
   spirograph SPM-01-{''}R-D{''} of the All-Union Scientific Research
   Institute of Medical Instruments and Equipment (Russia) in a sitting
   position. The height of ski racers was 175.9 +/- 0.6 cm; their body
   weight was 69.4 +/- 0.7 kg. In the annual cycle, the following was
   studied: tidal volume of respiration (Vt) and minute volume of
   respiration (MV), vital (VC) and forced vital (FVC) lung capacity,
   inspiratory (IRV) and expiratory (ERV) reserve volumes, forced
   expiratory volume in 0.5 second (FEV0.5) and forced expiratory volume in
   1 second (FEV1), as well as Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (FEV1/FVC). The
   obtained data were processed using Fisher's and Student's tests with the
   Bonferroni correction. Data were presented as arithmetic mean and mean
   error (M +/- m(M)). The studies were conducted in accordance with the
   principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 1964, as modified by the WMA
   General Assemblies from 1975 to 2013. The methods were approved by the
   bioethics committee of the Komi Scientific Centre, Ural Branch, Russian
   Academy of Sciences (Syktyvkar, Russia).
   For ski racers, for the first time, the values of volumetric
   characteristics of the function of external respiration were determined
   and the ranges of annual changes in these indicators were identified,
   which are from 56.3 to 11.5\% and are most pronounced for inspiratory
   and expiratory reserve volumes, as well as the tidal volume. We
   established that ski racers who live and train in the North, compared to
   non-athletic men, are characterized by increased tidal volume (12.6\%),
   vital capacity (15.7\%) and forced vital capacity (15.5\%), inspiratory
   and expiratory reserve volumes (59.2\%), forced expiratory volume in a
   half-second and a second (0.5-25.9\%,), Tiffeneau-Pirelli index (3.4\%)
   and reduced minute ventilation (9.1\%) (See Tables 1 and 2). The annual
   dynamics of indicators of the function of external respiration made it
   possible to determine February as the month with maximum adaptation to
   the climatic conditions of the cold period of the year against the
   background of the competitive period and September-October as months
   favorable for the function of the respiratory system against the
   background of the preparatory training period (See Fig. 1 and 2).
   Apparently, for ski racers, the adaptation of the respiratory system to
   the cold period of the year occurs two months earlier than for
   non-athletic men, and the period of a more comfortable functional state
   lasts one month longer. Athletes during the annual weather - climate
   cycle have a deeper remodeling of the respiratory system, compared to
   non-athletic men, due to living in a cold climate and the training
   process. The identified features of the functioning of the respiratory
   system in ski racers allow more purposeful planning of the training
   process and measures of health correction in the North.},

Title = {Calcium-dependent changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and
   heat resistance of wheat seedlings under the influence of exogenous
   putrescine},

Abstract = {Polyamines are important stress plant metabolites involved in the
   regulation of redox homeostasis and other signaling processes.
   Polyamines can affect redox homeostasis by binding free radicals and
   participating in the regulation of gene expression of antioxidant
   enzymes. However, their metabolism produces hydrogen peroxide and other
   reactive oxygen species (ROS). A separate component of the physiological
   activity of polyamines may be their effect on the state of ion channels.
   It is known that there are complex bonds between ROS and calcium ions as
   signal mediators. However, the functional interaction between ROS and
   calcium ions in the implementation of the effects of polyamines on plant
   cells has been studied very poorly. Moreover, the question of the role
   of such interactions in the realization of stress-protective effects of
   polyamines remains open. The aim of this research was to study the
   inhibitory methods of the involvement of different pools of calcium in
   the regulation of the formation of hydrogen peroxide, the activity of
   antioxidant enzymes and inducing putrescine thermo stability of wheat
   seedlings.
   The object of the study was etiolated seedlings of soft winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) of Doskonala variety. Three-day-old seedlings
   were treated with putrescine at a concentration of 1 mM. In certain
   experimental variants, the seedlings were treated with calcium
   antagonists - EGTA (Ethylene
   glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid - extracellular
   Ca2+ chelator) and neomycin - an inhibitor of phospholipase C-dependent
   calcium intake into the cytosol from intracellular compartments, as well
   as with the indicated inhibitors in combination with putrescine. In the
   roots of seedlings some time after treatment with test compounds, we
   determined hydrogen peroxide content and the activity of antioxidant
   enzymes. One day after seedling treatment with putrescine, calcium
   antagonists and a combination of effectors, the seedlings were subjected
   to damaging heating in a water thermostat (10 mM at 45 degrees C). 5
   hours after heating, we assessed damage to the root cell membranes by
   the yield of compounds absorbing in the UV-B, as well as the activity of
   antioxidant enzymes.
   2 hours after the start of root treatment with putrescine, we noted a
   significant increase in the content of hydrogen peroxide in them (See
   Fig. 1). This effect was eliminated by treatment with EGTA, but not with
   neomycin. The treatment of seedlings with putrescine caused a change in
   the activity of all three studied antioxidant enzymes in roots
   (superoxide dismutase - SOD, catalase, and guaiacol peroxidase) (See
   Table). The increased activity of these enzymes in the roots of
   seedlings treated with putrescine was also observed after damaging
   heating. The calcium ion chelator completely eliminated the
   putrescine-induced effect of increasing the activity of all three
   studied enzymes (See Fig. 2). Neomycin almost did not affect the
   manifestation of the effect of increasing the activity of SOD, however,
   it neutralized the increase in the activity of catalase and guaiacol
   peroxidase caused by putrescine. The effect of heat stress on the
   seedlings caused an increase in the yield of substances absorbing in the
   UV from the root cells. Treatment with putrescine helped preserve the
   integrity of biomembranes. Calcium antagonists EGTA and neomycin leveled
   off the effect of reducing the yield of substances absorbing in the UV-B
   caused by putrescine (See Fig. 3). They also almost completely
   eliminated the putrescine-induced increase in survival of seedlings
   after stress.
   We can conclude that the induction of heat resistance of wheat seedlings
   by putrescine depends on the functional interaction between calcium ions
   and ROS as signaling agents. The activation process of the enzymatic
   antioxidant system, necessary for the formation of heat resistance of
   plants, depends on the formation of ROS, which occurs with the
   participation of diamine oxidase and NADPH oxidase. At the same time,
   the accumulation of the signal pool of hydrogen peroxide is dependent on
   the influx of calcium into cytosol from extracellular space. The further

Title = {Current status of the Streptopelia decaocto (Aves: Columbiformes) in
   Stavropol region},

Abstract = {The Eurasian collared dove Streptopelia decaocto is a Palearctic species
   that demonstrates an example of intensive and rapid dispersal across
   Eurasia. At the same time, the expansion of the area is combined with
   its pulsation, and the reasons for this phenomenon are not completely
   clear. The Eurasian collared dove shows synanthropic tendencies and
   prefers to occupy residential habitats and agricultural landscapes when
   settling. Conservation status of the species according to the IUCN
   category system is LC: of least concern, but requiring further study and
   systematic monitoring. All of the abovementioned makes the study of the
   species very relevant. The aim of our research is to study the current
   state of the number, distribution and ecology of the Eurasian collared
   dove in Stavropol region.
   The studies were carried out in Stavropol region in 2008-2019 within
   geographical coordinates 43 degrees 43'-46 degrees 14'N, 40 degrees
   51'-45 degrees 43E in semi-desert, steppe and forest-steppe zones and
   foothills of the southern areas (See Fig. 1). We used methods of walking
   (over 500 km) and driving (42 000 km) route counts to estimate the
   population density, numbers of nesting birds, and their landscape
   distribution. This review also includes our results obtained during bird
   counts in Stavropol region in 2015-2018, as part of the program of the
   Atlas of breeding birds of Europe. In the course of this work, we
   examined 39 50850 km squares. We studied the nesting biology of the
   species on the basis on discovering of 1167 breeding pairs, surveys of
   490 nests and detailed observations of 58 nests. We conducted mapping of
   residential nests. Describing nesting structures, we noted the biotope,
   the species and height of the tree, the height of the nest location, the
   building material, the content of the nest, the presence and proximity
   of nests of other bird species, and we performed standard egg
   measurements. We determined if the breeding was successful by
   observations of nesting pairs in the period from the beginning of egg
   laying to the departure of chicks from nests. We studied the daily
   activity of the birds during the incubation period by visual
   observations for as long as 35+ hours.
   The Eurasian collared dove Streptopelia decaocto appeared in Stavropol
   region in 1973-1978 of the last century and has digested the entire area
   of the region as a result of intensive settlement. In general, we noted
   an increase in the nesting population of the species by almost one and a
   half times over a decade (47 thousand pairs in 2006 to 65 thousand pairs
   in 2019). The highest nesting population density of the Eurasian
   collared dove was recorded for the North and North-East of Stavropol
   region where animal husbandry predominates (See Fig. 1 and 2; Table 1).
   From the landscape point of view, the species clearly prefers the steppe
   province (0.27 pairs/ha), as well as semi-desertdry-steppe (0.25); the
   density of its breeding population is lower in the forest-steppe (0.1);
   the lowest indicators are typical of foothill areas (0.05) (See Fig. 1;
   Table 1 and 2). As we showed in our research in the species' biotopic
   distribution, the main types of its habitat are rural settlements,
   forest belts (protective, roadside) and forest plantations (plantings of
   nonlinear configuration of different areas) in agricultural landscapes.
   The Eurasian collared dove prefers eastern spruce (Platycladus
   orientalis) (21.4\%) and common spruce (Picea abies) (9.6\%) for
   nesting; in total, 20 species of tree species were used. At the same
   time, we observed atypical cases of nest placement (7.7\% of all
   examined nests) on various residential buildings, power poles and other
   technical structures (See Table 3). We found the earliest clutches in
   the second decade of March, and the latest ones in late October and
   early November. The value of clutches amounted to an average of 1.57
   eggs. The average size of the egg was 30.5 mm824.6 mm (n=25). When
   observing the daily activity of the incubating females, we found that
   they spend 97.4\% of the time on the incubation process (See Fig. 3 and
   4). The Eurasian collared dove can make three or four clutches per
   season, while some of them may be repeated in case of poor nesting.
   Post-embryonic mortality in our studies was averaged 13.5\%, often due
   to nest destruction by predators (mainly cats and grey crows), as well
   as due to adverse weather conditions. The Eurasian collared dove belongs
   to sedentary species, but at the same time, we observed mass
   autumn-winter roamings of the birds with the size of flocks of up to 500
   individuals. We found that the limiting factors for the species are loss
   of clutches and chicks from predators and bad weather, as well as death
   of adult birds on the roads and as a result of abnormally low
   temperatures during winter. The results of our study confirmed the
   steady territorial expansion and growth of the Eurasian collared dove
   population in Stavropol region, mainly, due to the processes of
   synanthropization and urbanization and assimilation into agricultural
   landscapes.},

Title = {The EEG alpha rhythm frequency dynamics during the auditory perception
   of actions and its relation to intelligence level in children aged 7-10
   years},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {A number of studies have shown the possibility of taking the EEG
   individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF) as an informative
   neurophysiological indicator of the overall cognitive efficiency of the
   human brain. The main goal of the present work was to study the IAPF
   reactivity in primary school age children in the process of auditory
   perception of sounds accompanying familiar instrumental movements, and
   to measure its hypothesized correlation to the verbal and non-verbal
   intelligence development. The effects of gender and age of children on
   these interrelations have also been estimated.
   We analyzed the data pertaining to the sample of primary school children
   aged 7-10 years (62 subjects). To assess possible age-related effects,
   the sample of children was additionally divided into two groups aged 7-8
   years (24 boys and10 girls) and 9-10 years (14 boys and 14 girls).
   During the experiment, the subject and the experimenter sat at the
   adjacent places, with a monitor and a computer mouse (CM) placed on the
   table in front of each of them. A video showing the CM section of the
   experimenter's table was displayed on the monitor screen in front of the
   subject. Experimental tasks comprised a series of stages (30 s each)
   including the conditions of a passive visual fixation on the video image
   of a motionless CM, execution of self-paced circular right-hand
   movements with CM, observation of similar movements produced by the
   experimenter, real-time imitation of the experimenter's movements,
   wakeful rest with eyes closed, and auditory perception of familiar
   sounds accompanying the CM movements produced by the experimenter
   (subject's eyes still closed). In the context of the present study, we
   analyzed the EEG dynamics in subjects during the two final stages with
   eyes closed: wakeful rest (WR) and auditory perception (AP) of familiar
   CM movements produced by the experimenter. The area of interest in the
   present study was the electrical activity of the laterally located
   parietal (P3, P4) and occipital (O1, O2) EEG electrodes. JAPF values
   were calculated for each of them within 7-13 Hz frequency range and
   averaged for the sum of them for the two corresponding experimental
   stages. The reactivity of the alpha rhythm frequency was calculated for
   each subject separately as the difference between the values of the
   dominant alpha rhythm frequency in two situations: the auditory
   perception of instrumental movements and the wakeful rest. Positive
   values of the frequency reactivity indicated its increase under
   condition of auditory perception of movements, and negative values - its
   decrease. The intelligence development levels of the participants were
   assessed with the help of the Wechsler test for children (WISC). In the
   context of the present study, the verbal and non-verbal intelligence
   scores were analyzed separately.
   We can conclude that in the primary school age children, the individual
   frequency of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm in boys does not differ
   significantly between the groups aged 7-8 and 9-10 years. In girls, in
   the older group this indicator has a significantly higher value (See
   Table 1). For children aged 7-10 years, a significant positive
   correlation was identified between JAPF and non-verbal intelligence
   score. No connection with verbal intelligence has been found (See Fig.
   1). The condition of auditory perception of sounds accompanying familiar
   instrumental actions evokes the decrease in the parieto-occipital alpha
   rhythm frequency in the majority of primary school age children, which
   is most characteristic for the groups of girls aged 9-10 years (See
   Table 2). A relatively small percentage of children (similar to 18\%)
   who demonstrated an increase in the frequency of the parieto-occipital
   alpha rhythm under condition of auditory perception of familiar
   instrumental actions, are characterized by lower scores of nonverbal
   intelligence, relative to their peers (See Fig. 2). Thus, nonverbal
   intelligence development can be related to the individual developmental
   characteristics of neural network oscillators, which can be reflected in
   children as multidirectional reactions in alpha rhythm frequency.},

Title = {X-ray computed tomography of the structure of roots and dynamics of soil
   biota in the early growth stages of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The architecture of the seed bed, a certain alternation of compacted and
   loose sections of the arable horizon, largely determines the development
   of the root system of plants. The morphology and growth of the root
   system of the germinating seed in the created seed bed is also
   determined by the composition of the surrounding soil biota. Dynamic
   studies of the development of the root system and composition of the
   surrounding soil biota is an essential methodological and practical
   problem in soil cultivation, agrophysics, and soil biology. This task is
   especially important in the first few days when the root system is laid
   and the plant rhizosphere is formed. Modern tomography makes it possible
   to carry out such studies that do not violate the soil-root biological
   system, in particular, in model mesoscale experimental physical models.
   The aim of this research was to use x-ray computed tomography to study
   the structure of the roots of barley seedlings in the early stages of
   development, while simultaneously studying changes in the number and
   dominant groups of microorganisms in the basal biota.
   Barley seeds (variety Mikhailovsky) in a model physical experiment with
   a two-layer soil bed density (soil density range from 0.7 to 1.2 g /
   cm(3)) Albic Glossic Retisols (Lomic, Cutanic), WRB, 2014 were laid for
   germination at the layer boundary in a special cylindrical box with a
   volume of about 3 cm(3) at optimal humidity. The position of the seed in
   the soil of the seedbed model is shown in the tomographic image (See
   Fig. 1). During the period from planting to 7 days, the dynamics of the
   root system was studied using a Bruker X-ray microtomography ``SkyScan
   1172G{''} (Bruker, Belgium) while studying the composition of soil
   biota, which was reconstructed by microbial markers (fatty acids and
   their derivatives). Markers were determined by molecular gas
   chromatography - mass spectrometry. Computer tomography allowed to
   record the volume distribution of roots at different periods of
   germination in the aggregated and compacted layers of agro-sod-podzolic
   soil. In this case, the roots successfully mastered the entire soil
   space, regardless of the plowing architecture of soil density created at
   the initial stage of germination. The total number of bacteria also
   increased by the 5th day with the constant dominance of 3 phyla:
   Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in the biota; the other
   two, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria, were represented in relatively
   small numbers. In the phylum Actinobacteria, aerobic hydrolytics of
   complex carbohydrates Rhodococcus equi were presented in the largest
   amount on the 5th day, in the Firmicutes phylum it is anaerobic
   hydrolytic Ruminococcus sp. and the anaerobic nitrogen fixator
   Clostridium pasteurianum, in the phylum Proteobacteria-the aerobic
   nitrifier Nitrobacter sp. with a subsequent decrease in the number on
   the 7th day. The increase in these species indicates the initial
   destruction of the cellulose shell of the grain and the processes of
   fixation and conversion of nitrogen in the microbiota of the germinating
   seed, necessary for the formation of the C/N ratio.
   During the germination of the seed, pores are formed that are filled
   with water, gas, or organic matter. The structure of the microbial
   community changes in response to the ongoing processes, while the
   accumulation of metabolic products of aerobic and anaerobic species of
   microorganisms occurs. The quantitative study of the complex of
   microorganisms by the molecular method allows us to display the reaction
   of the microbiome to structural changes in the soil, since certain
   conditions stimulate an increase in the share of species with
   appropriate ecological functions in the community. The combination with
   the computer visualization obtained as a result of the application of
   the X-ray tomography method makes it possible to more clearly
   characterize the processes occurring in the rhizosphere.

Title = {Species distribution modeling for the section Xerobia Bunge of the genus
   Oxytropis DC. on the territory of Central Asia under past and future
   climate change},

Abstract = {Modern botanical studies revealing patterns of plant species
   distribution are based on analysis of big datasets. Despite publishing
   many maps of diversity and species richness on the global scale and for
   huge biogeographic regions of the world, the territories of Northern and
   Central Asia remain poorly studied.
   We elaborated a special database, including distribution of 19 Oxytropis
   species of the section Xerobia with 1353 localitites (See Fig. 1). For
   all species, we analyzed their whole distribution range, including data
   from Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China. Species distribution was detected
   according to the main foreign and Russian herbaria, online databases,
   field data and releves. Species distribution modeling was performed
   using Maxent 3.3.3k with MIROC-ESM model in resolution of 2.5
   arc-minutes. 19 BIOCLIM and 18 ENVIREM variables were analyzed. Past
   climate change was evaluated using ENVIREM variables for the
   Mid-Holocene (ca. 6.000 yr. BP) and the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 22.000
   yr. BP). Future distribution modeling was carried out basing on
   different climatic scenarios, according to IPCC AR5: RCP8.5, RCP2.6 and
   RCP6.0.
   Species distribution from the section Xerobia mostly occupied the
   territory of Central Asia (See Fig. 1). Few species, such as Oxytropis
   grandiflora (Pall.) DC. and O. leptophylla (Pall.) DC., were mostly
   found in the western part of Xerobia section distribution on the
   territory of Zabaykal'skiy region of Russia, Eastern province of
   Mongolia and Inner Mongolia province of China. The most part of Xerobia
   species have isolated distribution and often occupy specific habitats.
   In such case, using SDM with only bioclimatic variables for local
   endemic species is pointless. So, we chose species Oxytropis ampullata
   (Pall.) Pers. (See Fig. 2) with Central Asian distribution and O.
   grandiflora with Manchuro-Dahurian distribution for modeling (See Fig.
   3A). The selected species differ in their ecology: O. ampullata is a
   mountainous species, whereas most habitats for O. grandiflora are river
   valleys and mid-mountainous regions. Our analysis showed that ENVIREM
   variables provide more correct modeling results than BIOCLIM variables
   (See Fig. 2). Predictive maps on the basis of BIOCLIM variables showed
   wide potential distribution for O. ampullata, which does not correspond
   well to the species ecology. The main habitats for this species are such
   mountainous regions as the Khangai mountains, the Russian and the
   Mongolian Altai mountains, the Dzhungarian mountains, and the Tarbagatai
   ridge. Additionally, modeling showed potential distribution for the
   species in the Selenga river valley. Modern distribution of O.
   grandiflora was studied quite well; suitable habitats with new
   localities for the species can be found in the Khentii mountains (See
   Fig. 3A).
   The determinants for O. ampullata are mean annual temperature,
   isothermality and potential evapotranspiration (PET) of the driest and
   coldest quarter (See Table 1). PET parameters in the driest and the
   coldest time of the year have the key meaning because in arid conditions
   plants receive the main portion of moisture in the colder period when
   the evaporation is not intense, also it is important to conserve the
   moisture during the dry season. Distribution of O. grandiflora is
   limited by temperature and precipitation seasonality, temperature annual
   range, PET seasonality, and PET of the driest quarter (See Table 1).
   Determinants for the species with Central-Asian distribution O.
   ampullata are connected with temperature variables, whereas for
   Manchuro-Daurian species O. grandiflora precipitation matters (See Table
   1 and Fig. 3A).
   The key factors for modern distribution of the studied Xerobia species
   are mean monthly potential evapotranspiration of the driest quarter,
   continentality index and climatic moisture index (See Fig. 3B). All
   these variables were determinants for the mid-Holocene and the Last
   Glacial Maximum (See Table 2 and Fig. 4), which might give evidence of
   relatively stable environmental conditions in the studied region.
   Central Asia has not been severely affected by glaciation as more
   northern latitudes and climate conditions on that territory were
   relatively stable during a long period.
   Modeling for the past climate showed a wider distribution for Xerobia
   species in the north-west during the Last Glacial Maximum and future
   shrinking during the Mid-Holocene till modern time (See Fig. 4). The
   north-eastern territories, such as Zabaykal'skiy region of Russia and,
   partially, the central part of Siberia, are characterized by a wider
   distribution under modern climate conditions. Species habitats of that
   territory are mostly confined with mountains. It is consistent with
   previous studies that described Southern Siberia as one of the centers
   of speciation for the genus Oxytropis. This region has now high
   Oxytropis species richness with a great number of endemics.
   Predictive maps for different climate scenarios reveal insignificant
   changes in distribution of the section Xerobia, even for the maximum
   climate warming (RCP8.5 scenario) (See Fig.5). Under predicted climate
   change, potential habitats in the southwest and in the north-east of
   Xerobia distribution, as well as a slight shrinking in the south-east
   can be observed in the future.

Title = {Effect of supernatant of associative bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas
   on germination, morphogenesis and growth of Dactylorhiza incarnata (L.)
   Soo (Orchidaceae) in vitro},

Abstract = {No studies on the influence of supematant of associative bacteria on the
   growth and development of orchid temperate climate of the northern
   hemisphere in vitro have been conducted to date. However, it is
   necessary to develop technologies for the cultivation of rare and
   protected species in vitro using biologically active components of
   culture media. The aim of this research was to assess the effect of two
   supernatants of associative bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas from the
   rhizosphere of generative individuals of Dactylorhiza incarnata on seed
   germination, morphogenesis and seedling growth of this species in vitm,
   a representative of orchids in the middle part of the European part of
   Russia.
   We isolated bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas (P chlororaphis subsp.
   aurantiaca GRP225 and P. brassicacearum GRT221) from the rhizosphere of
   generative individuals of D. incamata, growing in a sedge-herb
   conununity in the middle zone of the European part of Russia (Yaroslavl
   region). Molecular genetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of 16S
   rRNA genes was used to identify the strains. Bacteria were grown on LB
   medium with constant stirring for 5-7 days at 30 degrees C. Supematant
   was obtained by separation of the bacterial mass by centrifugation (5000
   rpm, 20 min, at 4 degrees C). The content of IAA in supernatant was
   determined by the Salkovsky method {[}Tsavkelova EA et al, 2007]. For
   supernatant strain P. chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca GRP225, this
   parameter was 18.1 +/- 1.30 mg/l, for P. brassicacearum GRT221 it was
   31.1 +/- 1.94 mg/l. We carried out the study according to the following
   scheme: 1)a modified Knudson nutrient medium (control); 2) the same with
   IAA 1.75 mg/l (10 mu M); 3) the same with supernatant P chlororaphis
   subsp. aurantiaca GRP225 (10\% of volume); 4) the same with supernatant
   P. brassicacearum GRT221 (10\% of the volume). Crops of seeds were
   cultivated for 2 months in the dark and 16 months in the light (2000
   lux, 16 h). Seed germination was judged by the amount of proto-feeds
   formed. The number of germinated seeds was determined at the 3rd, 6th,
   12th and 18th months of cultivation by the number of formed protocorms.
   Full germination of seeds was determined by the number of seedlings 18
   months after sowing. We distinguished a protosome and a juvenile plant
   when describing morphogenesis {[}Kolomeytseva GL et al, 2012]. The
   morphophysiological parameters of the seedlings (linear dimensions of
   protosomes, shoots and adventitious roots, the wet weight of seedlings)
   were determined at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th months of cultivation.
   We revealed a stimulating effect of supernatant of P. chlororaphis
   subsp. aurantiaca GRP225 and P brassicacearum GRT221 for the gennination
   of mature seeds of D. incamata in vitro (See Fig. 2). Moreover, the
   effect of the first supernatant is 27\% more effective compared to the
   second supernatant and is expressed in an increase in the number of
   sprouted seeds in relation to the control 5 times and in the test with
   IAA 1.8 times. D. incarnata seedlings on nutrient media with a
   supernatant are characterized by accelerated rates of development (See
   Fig. 3). This is confirmed by the early and active formation of
   protorizomes, orthotropic shoots and accessory roots. The effect of the
   supernatant of the strain P brassicacearum GRT221 coincides with the
   action of IAA. On a medium with supernatant P. chlororaphis subsp.
   aurantiaca GRP225, more seedlings with photosynthetic leaf - juvenile
   plants are formed by the 18th month (See Fig. If). The growth parameters
   of D. incamata seedlings on nutrient media with a supernatant are high
   (See Table I and 2). For lira= sizes of protorizomes, this was noted
   from the 3rd month and amounts to 20-30\% compared with the control.
   Onhotropic shoot growth is most pronounced in seedlings on a medium with
   supernatant P. chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca GRP225. Its length is 30\%
   more than the corresponding values in other tests. On the same medium,
   seedlings have the maximum wet weight.
   Thus, the use of supernatant of associative bacteria is effective for
   accelerating the germination of mature seeds, increasing their
   germination, the rate of development of seedlings, the size of the
   orthotropic shoot and adventitious roots, as well as the accumulation of
   fresh mass. The maximum stimulating effect is shown for the supernatant
   of P chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca GRP225. This opens up prospects for
   its use in vitro cultivation of rare and protected orchid species of the
   middle zone of the European part of Russia for their conservation and
   reproduction.},

Abstract = {Currently, in Kazakhstan, chemical agents and antibiotics are widely
   used for treatment and prevention of fish diseases at fish farms. The
   use of probiotics as an alternative to antibiotics can help reduce the
   spread of antibiotic resistance in this area. The aim of the present
   study was to isolate the intestinal lactic acid bacteria of wintering
   carps. We assume that such bacteria can have more adaptive properties
   and can be used as probiotics for growing carp juveniles at fish farms.
   A probiotic characteristic of 22 lactic acid bacteria isolated from
   Common carp intestines was studied. Universal primers were used to
   determine the sequence of 16S rRNA gene fragments of lactic acid
   bacteria (LAB). Phylogenetic relationships of the isolates were
   estimated using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method in Mega 6,0. All
   identified isolates can grow in temperature range from 10 degrees C to
   37 degrees C and in presence of bile salt. The isolated bacteria were
   screened for antibacterial activity, resistance to bile, resistance to
   antibiotics and growth at low temperatures. All isolates were tested in
   vitro for their ability to inhibit the growth of Shewanella xiamenensis,
   Pseudomonas taiwanensis, Ps. aeruginosa and Aeromonas punctata. As a
   result, 7 isolates with strong antagonistic activity were selected. 16S
   rDNA gene sequencing identified 4 isolates as Lactobacillus fermentum, 2
   - as L. casei/paracasei and 1 - as Pediococcus pentosaceus. Antibiotic
   resistance profile of selected strains was studied, too. This study is
   the first attempt for Kazakhstan to isolate and study the
   representatives of the normal intestinal microflora of commercial fish
   species. Selective strains could be potential probiotics for freshwater
   aquaculture practices in Kazakhstan.},

Title = {The structure of Gluconacetobacter hansenii GH 1/2008 population
   cultivated in static conditions on various sources of carbon},

Abstract = {Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a natural polymer that has a number of
   unique properties that determine the need to synthesize large amounts of
   it and to search the ways to increase the productivity of strains and to
   optimize the nutritive media. It is known that the choice of the
   producer for BC synthesis has an impact on its final properties and on
   the productivity of this polymer production. Under static liquid phase
   cultivation conditions, all cellulose-producing bacteria form a uniform
   film on the medium surface that serves as a scaffold for cells
   immobilization, thus providing them with the access to the air/liquid
   interface, where the access to oxygen is not limited. Meanwhile, when
   cultivation goes under agitating conditions, most of Gluconacetobacter
   xylinus strains produce less cellulose in form of globules of various
   sizes, despite the better oxygen access. Several authors explain the
   lower cellulose outcome when cultivated under agitated conditions by the
   appearance of spontaneous mutants that do not produce cellulose in the
   population. It was revealed that when grown on agarized media,
   cellulose-non-producing mutants form colonies of a specific mucoid type,
   while non-mucoid phenotype cells form smooth colonies of non-mucoid
   type. To our knowledge, there is no published research on the impact of
   cultivation conditions and nutritive medium composition on the
   appearance of spontaneous phenotype mutations in the population of
   Gluconacetobacter hansenii representatives. The aim of the present
   research is to elucidate the impact of the carbon source on the
   productivity of G. hansenii strain and the appearance of
   cellulose-negative mutants under static cultivation conditions.
   We studied the strain G. hansenii GH 1/2008 (VKPM B-10547) as a BC
   source. Liquid phase static cultivation of G. hansenii GH 1/2008 was
   carried out using the modified Hestrin-Schramm (HS) medium, containing
   4\% of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) or
   disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose) as carbon sources. The
   occurrence of mutants was calculated considering phenotypes of colonies
   obtained by seeding the samples of cultural liquid and wash-offs of
   cells from films produced by the cultivation of the producer on modified
   agarized HS media. The polymer outcome was expressed as the film
   absolute dry weight (a.d.w.) per cultivation medium volume unit. We
   studied the morphology of the producer's wild type and mutant cells by
   means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) (See Fig. 8). The structural
   organization of the produced films and gel was revealed by means of
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) performed after freeze-drying. The
   composition of the fibers was checked acquiring FTIR Spectroscopy.
   We established that G. hansenii GH 1/2008 produces a dense film on media
   containing fructose, glucose and sucrose, while the polymer has gel
   consistence when grown on maltose, galactose and lactose (See Fig. 1).
   The maximal quantity (a.d.w.) of polymer was produced on fructose- and
   sucrose-containing media. The overall number of immobilized producer
   cells was considerably higher when grown on media with glucose, fructose
   and sucrose than on gels grown on those containing maltose, galactose
   and lactose (See Table 1). SEM imaging revealed considerable difference
   in the microscale organization of films and gels produced by G. hansenii
   GH 1/2008 on various carbon sources (See Fig. 2). Fructose-containing
   medium yields the densest structure with dense layers separated by 2 mu
   m thick areas filled with non-ordered BC fibrils. The microscale
   organization of sucrose- and glucose-based films were very similar and
   had a cell-like structure. In cases where the synthesized polymer had
   squeezable gel consistence, its microstructure was not layered but close
   to isotropic. The studies of gels by means of FTIR spectroscopy showed
   that the gels are also formed of BC molecules; the spectra were almost
   identical (See Fig. 4). The only difference, i.e. the intensity of the
   1638 CM-1 peak, can be explained by the presence of a higher amount of
   bound water in the latter. It is known that some strains of this species
   may produce glucuronic acid oligomers under unfavorable conditions, but
   peaks corresponding to carboxyl or carbonyl groups were not revealed in
   the spectra. This is the evidence that no detectable amounts of
   glucuronic acid were produced under conditions studied. The analysis of
   colonies of G. hansenii GH 1/2008 cultivated under static conditions on
   media containing various carbon sources revealed colonies with two
   dominating phenotypes: non-mucoid smooth convex colonies and mucoid flat
   ones (See Fig. 5). The number of cells forming smooth non-mucoid
   colonies on agarized media was maximal in the inoculations of cultural
   liquids after the cultivation on media containing fructose and sucrose,
   i.e. those carbon sources that demonstrated high productivity per 1L of
   cultural liquid (See Fig. 6). In the inoculations of the cultural liquid
   and wash-offs of cells immobilized on gels obtained by the cultivation
   on media containing galactose and lactose, the number of mucoid colonies
   was considerably higher (See Table 2). The clones forming mucoid type
   colonies did not produce BC films when reinoculated in liquid media,
   while those forming colonies of mucoid (smooth) type produce films on
   the 3rd day of cultivation (See Fig. 7). The analysis of cells shape and
   sizes by means of AFM did not reveal any statistically valid difference
   between the mutants and the wild type.
   The present research shows that the source of carbon is a selective
   factor in the formation of the inner composition of the population of
   clones of the bacterial cellulose producer Gluconacetobacter hansenii GH
   1/2008. The proliferation of cellulose-negative cells arouses
   competition for the substrate with cellulose-positive cells of G.
   hansenii GH 1/2008 that reduces the number of the latter and the
   production of the exopolymer. The paper contains 8 Figures, 2 Tables and
   38 References.},

Title = {DNA polymorphism and genetic diversity of the oak lace bug (Corythucha

Abstract = {One of the directions of insect population genetics is the study of the
   variability of the genetic structure of populations, which includes the
   assessment of genetic diversity, DNA polymorphism and genetic similarity
   of the studied objects. This makes it possible to judge the flow of
   genes, i.e. exchange of genetic material within a population or between
   populations, and determine the degree of their genetic differentiation,
   i.e. they represent different populations or one population, and in this
   case, they are intrapopulation groupings. The aim of this work was to
   study the molecular genetic structure of local populations of the oak
   lace bug C. arcuata in Krasnodar Krai using RAPD markers to assess their
   genetic similarity.
   We carried out the studies in the territories of the invasive
   distribution of the oak lace bug in Krasnodar Krai in 2020. The object
   of the research was a sample of insects (n = 20) from the areas of oak
   lace bug in the forest park zones of Krasnodar, Tikhoretsk, Krymsk and
   Sochi. The total number of samples examined was 240. We collected C.
   arcuata bugs on model trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.). The
   selection of trees was 10 oak trees from each locality. Isolation of DNA
   from whole insects (adults), amplification RAPD-PCR (random amplified
   polymorphic DNA) and electrophoresis were carried out according to the
   method we had developed earlier (Kil, 2009). Amplification was performed
   in 25 mcl reaction mix containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 50 mM KCl; 3.0
   mM MgCl2; 50 mu M of each dNTP; 0.8 mu M primer; 0.5 U Taq polymerise
   and 20 ng DNA. We evaluated DNA polymorphism of the studied samples from
   the population of bugs using three primers highly specific for the DNA
   of the oak lace bug: OPA07, OPA09, OPA18 (See Fig. 1 and Table 1). We
   assessed genetic diversity and genetic similarity using the Nei and
   Shannon information indices with the help of POPGENE computer program
   (version 1.31) (Yeh et al., 1999). The statistical significance of the
   differences between the mean values for the sample was determined by the
   Student's (-test (p < 0.05).
   Molecular genetic analysis of C. arcuata revealed high levels of DNA
   polymorphism and genetic diversity in the oak lace bug population and
   the absence of significant differences between the samples for these
   parameters (See Table 2). The studies have shown that the closest in
   genetic terms are the samples from Tikhoretsk and Krymsk (genetic
   identity (GI) = 0.998; genetic distance (GD) = 0.003), and the most
   genetically distant from others are the Krasnodar and Sochi
   intra-population groupings (GI = 0.942; GD = 0.06) (See Table 4). This
   was also demonstrated by the cluster analysis of data (See Fig. 2).
   Genetic diversity, estimated by Nei index, within four geographic
   samples (Hs = 0.275) was 93.2\% of the total genetic diversity in the
   lace bug population (Ht = 0.295) (See Table 3). This indicates a
   significant level of gene flow between intra-population groupings (Nm =
   6.98), which prevents their differentiation. The low value of the
   coefficient of genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.07) indicates that only
   6.8\% of the total genetic variability of the population is accounted
   for by the variability between intra-population groupings. Based on
   this, we can conclude that the analyzed insect samples represent
   intra-population groupings from one population of oak lace bugs, C.
   arcuata.},

Title = {Invasions of bird-dispersed shrub species in specially protected natural
   reservations of Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad Region},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {The research deals with recent invasions of bird-dispersed shrubs in
   specially protected natural reservations of St.Petersburg and Leningrad
   Region. The results of bird-dispersed woody species inventory in 5
   partial nature reserves and nature sanctuaries of the area (See Fig. 1),
   based upon the extensive phytocoenological research data of 2014-2018,
   are given (See Table 1). Out of the adventive shrub species listed, the
   two most aggressive invaders were chosen according to their constancy
   and abundance in natural forest communities. These are Lonicera nigra in
   Komarovskiy Bereg {[}Komarovo Coast] Nature Sanctuary and Amelanchier
   spicata in Lisinskiy {[}Lisino] Partial Nature Reserve.
   For this purpose, distributions of these species are traced along with
   different forest types they invade, paying attention to species
   constancy and projective cover in different layers of forest communities
   (See Tables 2 and 4). Values of intralandscape species activeness, based
   upon the proper releve sets, were also calculated for both aboriginal
   and adventitious plant species from different community types in each
   study area (See Tables 3 and 5).
   Lonicera nigra has never been detected as an invader before. It is
   presumably dispersed by robins, thrushes, and warblers, also by means of
   barochory and secondary hydrochory. The latter is proved by the
   occurrence of the oldest shrubs in riverine Norway spruce and Scots pine
   forests on the Littorine terrace of the Gulf of Finland within Komarovo
   Coast Nature Sanctuary. The results of secondary bird dispersal of this
   species are observed in sorrel spruce forests where the untypical low
   shrub layer is being formed (See Fig. 2). These plants are remote form
   brooks or drainage channels (See Table 2). L. nigra acts as one of the
   most active species in the sanctuary forest coenofloras studied (See
   Table 3). Nevertheless, floristic composition of these forest
   communities remains yet unchanged in its main features. The invasion of
   L. nigra in the sanctuary area was first mentioned in literature by NN
   Tzvelev in 2000 but it took place much earlier, as the ancestral plant
   specimens were likely to grow in a transplant nursery near the
   present-day sanctuary north-eastern border in the early XX-th century.
   According to Komarov Botanical Institute Herbarium (LE) data, the
   secondary area of L. nigra in Russia is restricted to several findings
   in the Karelian Isthmus.
   Amelanchier spicata, the June berry, listed among the most aggressive
   plant invaders in European Russia, is dispersed by thrushes along roads
   in forests and then invades sorrel and horsetail-peatmoss spruce and
   pine forests on southern-boreal watersheds in Lisino Reserve, often as a
   gap-filling species. It is less common and abundant in secondary birch
   and aspen forests. In contrast to Lonicera nigra, it is infrequent and
   never abundant in riverine forests (See Table 4), the fact probably
   explained by difference in prevailing bird distributor species. A.
   spicata is never found in feathermoss pine forests on fluvial-glacial
   sand as well as in dwarfshrub-peatmoss pine bog forests. The invasion of
   this species in the reserve area probably took place after 1984-1987
   when the species was not registered in forest communities of the area
   according to the author's personal observations. In 2017, the activeness
   of A. spicata is low in all the forest types it inhabits, being compared
   to that of the dominant aboriginal species (See Table 5).
   As follows from the correlation analysis results, no one of the
   discussed invaders affects the projective cover of any of the native
   plant species in both protected areas significantly. Speaking of
   Amelanchier spicata, it is in fact far less aggressive than in the more
   southern areas of Central and Southern Russia where the species
   transforms forest communities actively and affects aboriginal field- and
   ground-layer plants negatively, even as far as to the extinction of some
   of the latter, as it is well-known from the literature on the subject.
   We are just at the beginning of the invasion process in the forests of
   the Russian North-West yet.
   The invasion of both species studied is likely to be connected with the
   climate change processes. The research reveals that a neglected
   adventive species, persisting long within a given area, may also
   suddenly become an aggressive invader (the case of Lonicera nigra). The
   invasion of adventive shrubs into the paludified forest communities,
   including those of the boreal peatmoss spruce forests which served as
   etalons of floristic stability quite recently, is also alarming.},

Title = {Accumulation and toxic effects of boron-containing drugs in SW-620
   models},

Abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, colorectal cancer is one of
   the three leading causes of death among other tumors. Boron neutron
   capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising method for the treatment of
   oncological diseases. It is an experimental method of radiation therapy
   which is based on the capture reaction of a thermal neutron by an
   isotope B-10 and results in the B-10(n, alpha)Li-7 fission reaction. The
   high linear energy transfer from alpha particle and Li-7 nucleus has a
   short path length, thus the energy released is limited to the size of
   one cell. Previously, BNCT was actively used to treat patients with
   glioblastoma, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and other malignant
   neoplasms of various localization. The aim of this work is to determine
   the safe concentrations of boronphenylalanine (BPA) and sodium
   borocaptate (BSH) drugs for the SW-620 cell line and to assess the B-10
   biodistribution after administration of these compaunds to
   immunodeficient SCID mice with heterotopic SW-620 xenografts.
   To evaluate the possibility of using BNCT as a therapy for patients with
   colorectal cancer, we carried out preliminary in vitro and in vivo
   studies on the model of human colorectal adenocarcinoma SW-620. Firstly,
   the cytotoxicity of boron compounds BPA and BSH at B-10 concentrations
   of 10-1280 mu g/ml was investigated using MTT test. All animal
   experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of humane
   treatment of animals in compliance with the directive of the European
   Community (86/609 / EEC) and correspond to the principles of the Guide
   for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH USA, No 85-23, rev.
   1985). To determine the toxicity of BPA and BSH in standard dosages,
   drugs were intravenously injected into the retroorbital sinus: BPA at a
   concentration of 350 mg/kg and BSH at 100 mg/kg. The control group of
   animals were injected intravenously with sodium chloride 0.9\%. After 2
   months of observation planned euthanasia was done, organs (kidneys,
   liver, lungs, brain and heart) were sampled for pathomorphological
   study. Biodistribution of B-10 in the tumor and organs of interest was
   performed on mice with SW-620 heterotopic xenograft. Boron containing
   drugs were injected at the dosages described earlier intravenously into
   the retroorbital sinus. Euthanasia was performed 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours
   after injection, tumor tissue, blood, brain, liver and kidneys were
   sampled. The boron concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled
   plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP AES).
   As a result of the MTT test, we revealed that incubation of SW-620 cells
   with BPA and BSH for 24 and 48 hours at B-10 concentrations of 10-320 mu
   g/ml had no cytotoxic effect. When incubated for 48 hours with BPA at a
   concentration of 320 mu g/ml, survival rate did not differ significantly
   from control. The maximum safe concentration for BSH can also be
   considered 320 mu g/ml of B-10, since the cell survival in the
   experimental groups was 96 and 95.5\% for 24 and 48 hours of incubation
   with the drug, respectively. The first significant cytotoxic effects
   were noted during incubation with both boron-containing drugs at a B-10
   concentration of 640 mu g/ml. For the BPA group, the percentage of
   survived cells was 65 (incubation for 24 hours) and 51 (48 hours), BSH
   had less cytotoxic effect: cell survival decreased to 87\% and 80.5\% at
   points 24 and 48 hours, respectively (See Fig. 1). Intravenous
   administration of BPA at a concentration of 350 mg/kg and BSH at a
   concentration of 100 mg/kg to SCID mice turned out to be safe: no
   pathological reactions were detected within 2 months of observation, all
   animals were alive. According to the pathomorphological study, no
   macroscopic and structural changes in the organs were found (See Fig.
   2). The biodistribution of B-10 was assessed in SCID mice with
   subcutaneous xenografts SW-620 after intravenous administration of boron
   drugs at standard concentrations. As a result of the analysis, we found
   out that after intravenous administration of BPA at a safe dosage, the
   maximum concentration of B-10 in the tumor was recorded at the time
   points of 1 and 2 hours (8.0 and 8.7 mu g/g, respectively). In this
   case, the concentration ratio of B-10 in the tumor and blood samples was
   determined as 0.6 for the 1 hour point and 1.7 for the 2 hour point. We
   also demonstrated that the kidneys were the organ with the highest boron
   accumulation throughout the experiment (See Fig. 3). Thus, the time
   point of 2 hours can be considered potentially the most suitable for
   BNCT, but the concentration of boron in the tumor tissue is not
   sufficient. For BSH the maximum concentration was recorded at the time
   point of 1 hour (5.7 mu g/g). The liver, kidneys and blood contained the
   highest concentration of B-10 (See Fig. 4).
   Thus, apparently, further investigations on increasing the dose of the
   drugs and choosing different ways of boron agents administration can
   increase the accumulation of B-10 by the tumor and reduce its
   concentration in the surrounding tissues and blood. The use of
   additional drugs that improve the penetration of boron into the tumor
   may also be effective and should be taken into account.},

Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The indirect collecting of quatitative data on the rates of the main
   abiotic factors by the parameters of the vegetation opens up the
   possibility of identifying ecological ranges for poorly studied
   hard-to-reach species, especially rare high-mountain plants. The
   ecological plasticity of the genus Ranunculus L. in contrasting
   conditions of high mountains acquires the properties of adaptability,
   which contributes to the formation of endemic species. Therefore, a
   necessary aspect in addressing the issues of regional diversification of
   the genus Ranunculus is taking into account and assessing environmental
   factors as triggers of intrageneric ecological differentiation of the
   genus. The aim of the study is to test an indicator values method to
   determine the synecological areas of high mountain taxa Ranunculus
   akkemensis Polozhij et Revjakina (See Fig. 1) and R. lasiocarpus C.A.
   Mey. (See Fig. 2) from the section Auricomus Schur., subsection
   Altimontana Schegol., endemic to the Altai-Sayan floristic province
   (ASP).
   To obtain the initial geobotanical material, we used the ``Database of
   Siberian Vegetation (DSV){''} computer database of releves of Siberian
   vegetation, registered in the international metabase ``Global Index of
   Vegetation-Plot Databases{''} as ASRU-002 and implemented in the
   integrated botanical information system IBIS v.7.2. All calculations
   with indicator values were performed in the gradient analysis module of
   this information system, alongside with combined taxonomic lists
   generation. MS Excel 2013 and Past v.3.26 software served as auxiliary
   tools for data preparation, statistical processing and visualization of
   results.
   Geographic location of the releves: Altai Republic: Seminsky, Kuraisky,
   NotrthChuisky ridges; Altai Krai: Tigirek ridge; Tuva Republic: Sangilen
   ridge. The source of the initial ecological information was the combined
   indicator value scales for Siberia by Ivan Tsatsenkin et al. (1974,
   1978). These scales inherit the amplitude-optimum format of the
   indicator school by Leontiy Ramensky. Of the four available
   environmental factors, moisture (120-grade scale) and richness-salinity
   (nutrients availability, or fertility) of soils (30-grade scale) were
   selected as the most significant for the differentiation of ecotopes of
   mountain plants.
   The ecological characteristics of habitats, where these Ranunculus
   species were recorded, were calculated in accordance with the previously
   presented methodology: weighted averaging (by cover and environmental
   tolerance) of all indicator taxa in a releve; the cover of taxa was
   expressed in a 9-grade geometric scale. Individual species indicator
   value optima were calculated according to our published algorithm - as
   weighted averaging taking into account environmental consensus index,
   rarity of the scale's grade in total sample, number of indicators per
   each releve. When compiling probabilistic ecological profiles for
   combined floras of coenoses with a selected taxon, an unimodal model was
   used, and the indicator value optimum statuses of indicator taxa were
   weighted by the sums of the percentages of their occurrence in such
   combined floras.
   Comparative analysis of the obtained values for the factors of soil
   moisture and fertility showed significant differences in the reaction of
   the coenotic environment of the model species to the level of these
   factors in habitats (See Fig. 3). Simultaneous mapping of phytocenoses
   with the participation of the studied species in the axes of soil
   moisture and fertility factors made it possible to assess and compare
   their ecological areas (See Fig. 4). The exact values of individual
   statuses (minimum, optimum, maximum) of the model species were
   calculated. When comparing the obtained quantitative parameters with
   earlier results of our ecological analysis of the genus Ranunculus in
   ASP, which took into account the confinement to a certain type of
   habitat and some morphophysiological properties of the species, the
   ecological characteristics of these species underwent changes. The
   results of the study enabled us to reasonably determine the belonging of
   R. akkemensis and R. lasiocarpus to particular ecological groups, as
   well as to prove the efficiency of the indicator value correction method
   on relatively small samples of geobotanical data. The study for the
   first time allowed quantifying the ecological parameters of two rare
   alpine species of the genus Ranunculus according to the factors of soil
   moisture and nutrient availability.},

Abstract = {The lepidopteran pest community composition on cabbage (Brassica
   oleracea L.) as the main vegetable crop in the conditions of
   southwestern Siberia was presented. In 2015-2019, the dominant cabbage
   pests were diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) and cabbage moth
   (Mamestra brassicae L.). The continuous application of insecticides
   against the cabbage pests along with climatic factors led to a change in
   insect species community composition. This was manifested as an increase
   in the number of the diamondback moth and a decrease in the abundance of
   other Lepidoptera species. The mean number of diamondback moths varied
   from 0.06 (in a year of low numbers) to 1.4 specimens per plant (in
   years ofoutbreaks), and for cabbage moth - 0.12 (2015) and 0.43 (2016),
   respectively. In commercial cabbage field, both egg-laying and
   caterpillars of Pieris brassicae L. and P. rapae L. were found as a
   single individual. During the years of research, we noted earlier
   diamondback moth and cabbage moth appearance dates in the field. More
   frequent diamondback moth outbreaks were observed. The period of cabbage
   damage by the diamondback moth lasted longer than usual during the
   growing seasons due to an increase in the number of insect generations
   in the conditions of the southwestern Siberia.},

Title = {The influence of co-treatment with Bacillus thuringiensis B-5351 and
   salicylic acid on the resistance of potato plants to Phytophthora
   infestans (Mont.) de Bary},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Pages = {109-130},
Abstract = {Biocontrol agents based on strains of microorganisms that participate in
   mutualistic relationships with host plants, including those based on
   strains of endophytic bacteria, can be an alternative to chemical
   pesticides. There are endophytic B. thuringiensis strains that produce
   insect-toxic proteins and induce systemic resistance of plants to
   pathogens. An important issue is the possibility of regulation of the
   relationship of endophytic bacterial strains with the host-plant and
   their ability to induce plant defense reactions against pathogens by
   signaling molecules, including salicylic acid (SA). The aim of this work
   was to study the effect of SA and the endophytic bacterial strain B.
   thuringiensis B-5351 on the activity of potato plants reactions
   associated with signaling and biosynthesis of SA, as well as the
   activity of a potato trypsin inhibitor upon infection with the late
   blight pathogen.
   We used sterile test tube potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) of the
   Early Rose cultivar. 20-days-old potato plants were inoculated with a
   bacterial suspension of B. thuringiensis B-5351 (1{*}10(8) cells / ml)
   in distilled water, or in 1 mu M SA solution by applying 5 mu l of
   bacterial suspension to 4 upper leaves (20 mu l / plant). Control plants
   were treated with distilled water, and some plants were treated with 1
   mu M SA solution in the same volume. On the 7th day after inoculation
   with B. thuringiensis B-5351, the plants were infected with oomycete P.
   infestans spores (5 mu l of 1{*}10(5) spore/ml suspension per leaf). To
   assay the damaged area, leaves were photographed; the images were
   analyzed using the ImageJ software. 24 h after infection with late
   blight pathogen spores, plants were fixed to assess the transcriptional
   activity of PR6, PR1 and PAL genes (See Table 1) (using CFX Connect
   Real-Time PCR Detection System Bio-Rad (USA)), and after 6, 24 and 48 h
   - to analyze the activity of plant proteinase inhibitors and the content
   of hydrogen peroxide. We estimated the number of colony-forming units
   (CFU) of microorganisms in plant tissues after their surface
   sterilization on the 7th day after inoculation of plants with B.
   thuringiensis B-5351 bacteria. The significance of the differences
   between the samples was accessed using Student's t-test (p<0.05). Tables
   and Figures show data as the mean of the replicates and their standard
   deviations (M +/- SD). All experiments were conducted in three-five
   biological and three analytical replicates.
   In this work, we showed that SA presence increased the content of living
   cells of B. thuringiensis B-5351 bacteria in the internal tissues of
   plants (2,3 +/- 1,5x10(6) CFU/g) as compared to individual treatment
   with the bacterial strain under investigation (7,3 +/- 1,6x10(5) CFU/g)
   (See Table 2). Using the method of RAPD analysis, we established the
   identity of bacteria isolated from internal tissues of potato plants and
   the initial strain of B. thuringiensis B-5351 (See Fig. 1). Apparently,
   such titer of bacterial population regulated by plant signaling
   molecules in plant tissues is an important factor in the formation of
   plant resistance. Thus, we did not observe a decrease in the area of
   late blight symptoms on the leaves of potato plants treated only with B.
   thuringiensis B-5351, while under the individual action of SA this
   parameter decreased by half, and upon combined treatment of plants with
   SA and bacteria B. thuringiensis B-5351 almost 4 times as compared to
   water-treated plants (See Fig. 2). Treatment with bacteria B.
   thuringiensis B-5351 increased the activity of proteinase inhibitors in
   potato plants only 6 h after infection with the late blight pathogen; in
   plants treated with bacteria cells of B. thuringiensis B-5351 together
   with SA, there was an almost a twofold increase in the activity of
   proteinase inhibitors after 6 and 24 h after infection with oomycete P.
   infestans. Under the influence of SA, a 15-20\% increase in the content
   of H2O2 in intact plants was observed in all variants. In infected
   plants treated with SA, the H2O2 content exceeded the control values by
   more than 40\%. In plants treated with a suspension of bacteria B.
   thuringiensis B-5351 and SA plants, the presence of the late blight
   pathogen caused a threefold increase in the H2O2 content 6 h after
   infection (See Fig. 3). In the variant with combined treatment with SA
   and bacteria B. thuringiensis B-5351 of noninfected plants, the content
   of PR6 gene transcripts exceeded the control level by 25\%, as in
   infected plants treated with SA. Treatment of plants with SA together
   with bacteria B. thuringiensis B-5351 increased the number of PR6 gene
   transcripts by more than 50\% relative to water-treated non-infected
   plants (See Fig. 4). In this work, we found that the strain of
   endophytic bacteria under investigation promoted the accumulation of
   transcripts of genes encoding PR1 and PAL proteins to the same extent as
   SA, both individually and when used together. In the presence of the
   late blight pathogen, more than a twofold (relative to this level in
   water-treated intact plants) increase in the content of PAL gene mRNA in
   potato plants was observed in cases of both individual and combined
   application of SA and B. thuringiensis B-5351 cells. Thus, treatment
   with B. thuringiensis B-5351 bacteria together with SA induces
   salicylate-dependent defense reactions (PR1, PAL), as well as an
   increase in the transcriptional activity of the PR6 gene, which,
   according to the literature, is a jasmonate-dependent gene.
   Our results showed the effectiveness of the composition based on live
   bacteria B. thuringiensis B-5351 and SA in protecting potato plants from
   late blight by inducing systemic defense responses in plants. Taking
   into account the insecticidal activity of the strain under investigation
   against Russian wheat aphids and Colorado potato beetle, which we
   previously described, the possibility of increasing plant resistance to
   late blight by biocontrol agent combining B. thuringiensis B-5351 with
   SA can open one of the approaches to the development of multifunctional
   protection of plants from biotic influences. The paper contains 4
   Figures, 2 Tables and 34 References.},

Title = {Detection of the tree root system architecture using Ground penetrating
   radar},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {51},
Pages = {179-204},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experiment measuring the tree root
   system architecture using ground-penetrating radar. Despite the
   importance of this issue, the knowledge of the root system of trees
   remains incomprehensive due to various reasons including the limitations
   of research methods. The basic approach to the exploration of the root
   system of plants is the root zone excavation method. However, this
   method inflicts substantial damage to plants and can lead to their
   destruction. In some cases, excavation is impossible or prohibited, i.g.
   in cities or protected natural areas. Studying the tree root systems is
   an urgent issue at the moment and new methods are systematically used to
   tackle it. The non-invasive approach to study the root architecture
   includes using the methods of geophysics, ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
   in particular. The root system of plants tends to adapt to the
   environment, which includes interaction with the accommodating soil. One
   of the natural factors influencing the growth is the level of the
   impenetrable soil horizon, which changes both the structure of the root
   system and the aerial part of a plant. The aim of this paper is to study
   the root architecture of mature trees using GPR, rather than root
   excavation method, to determine its configuration depending on the
   bedding of bedrocks and to justify how changes in the bedrock depth
   affects the development of the aerial parts of trees.
   The principle of GPR is to examine the propagation of an electromagnetic
   wave in a medium by emitting a probing signal and receiving a reflected
   signal. Underground objects such as roots are distinguished by
   diffracted waves (See Fig. 1). The summary of literature data shows that
   roots up to 0.5 cm in diameter can be found by a high frequency antenna
   (See Table 1). We carried out a field experiment on an apple tree (Malus
   domestica Borkh) which grows on the territory of the Botanic Garden of
   Petrozavodsk State University (See Fig. 2). This territory is
   characterized by a thin soil cover and underlying moraine soils. Below
   are metatuff bedrocks. We studied two separate samples. The choice was
   made due to external differences (See Fig. 3). The trees growing on Plot
   2 (Sample 2 of the experiment) have a conspicuous compound curvature of
   the trunk and a lower height than plants from Plot 1 - sample 1 (See
   Table 2). The two trees underwent annual average phenological stages
   simultaneously. They are 29 years old. No significant differences in the
   annual number of ripening fruits was revealed. Thus, the experiment was
   carried out on the two samples growing in equal conditions but having
   differences in appearance and biometrics. Literature data show that an
   apple tree usually has 4 perpendicular skeletal roots and 4 diagonal
   skeletal roots 1-2 cm in diameter in horizontal slice. As for vertical
   slice, tree roots usually lie at a depth of 20-60 cm (See Fig. 4).
   The measurements were carried out with OKO-2 GPR by ``Logis-Geotech{''}
   (Russia) with antenna unit (center frequency of 1700 MHz) on a regular
   rectangular grid with a space between profile lines of 50 cm. As a
   result, 26 profiles (13 horizontal and 13 vertical ones) were obtained
   for each sample (See Fig. 5). We processed the obtained radargrams using
   signal filtering operations, searching for the diffraction hyperbola,
   migration procedure to localize the source object and the Hilbert
   Transform to examine the energy of the reflections (See Fig. 6). The
   analysis of the hyperbolas has determined the relative permittivity of
   the studied soil and underlying metatuffs. It is 9 and 6, respectively.
   The electromagnetic wave length in the soil body is 5 cm, which implies
   the possibility to distinguish objects sized 1.5-5 cm. This range is
   consistent with the expected size of the apple tree taproots. After the
   processing of each profile, the roots were localized using hyperbolas
   and the surface of bedrocks was determined (See Fig. 7).
   We found out that the soil profiles of the two experimental samples were
   different. In the first case, the average depth of bedrocks bedding is
   60 cm, and there is a v-shaped decrease in the identified hyperbolas
   with depth. In the second case, the average depth is 45 cm and most of
   hyperbolas are located in the first 30 cm. The examination of the
   location of the roots in horizontal slices within an interval of 10 cm
   shows a change in the density of the roots distribution as we go deeper
   (See Fig. 8). The quantity of roots of Sample 1 gradually decreases with
   depth as well as the occupied area. In addition, the roots tend to
   concentrate near the trunk. Sample 2 has many roots in the upper part of
   the profile (0-30 cm) and they occupy a significant area. However, the
   quantity of roots in the lower part decreases sharply. In both cases, we
   detected a predisposition of the root locations to the areas of the
   immersion of the roof of the bedrocks. In addition, a study was
   conducted concerning the intensity of the reflection amplitudes of both
   samples at different depths (See Fig. 9). At the near-surface level (20
   cm) there are high-energy reflections. They occupy most of the studied
   area, and this corresponds to a horizon full of roots. A different
   picture emerges at a depth of about 40 cm. The samples vary in both the
   reflection intensity and the occupied area. The revealed changes are due
   to the decrease in the roots quantity and apparently to the medium size
   of the roots. We examined the correlation between the morphology of the
   bedrocks top surface and the spatial root architecture of the samples
   with three-dimensional models made in the form of a cloud of points as a
   set of established root locations in the XYZ-coordinate system (See Fig.
   10).
   Our studies have demonstrated the possibility to describe the tree root
   architecture by means of GPR. Using the two samples of the apple tree as
   an example, the structure of the root system in the soil-ground massif
   was determined. Also, we established the influence of the bedding roof
   depth of crystalline rocks on the ontogenesis of a tree. The results
   obtained prove that GPR is a promising method for studying the
   underground areas of trees, which provide the possibility to analyze the
   root system without excavation. Such studies may prove useful in the
   future for both solving agricultural technology and forest management
   tasks, as well as for green spaces control in urban areas.},

   upper Yenisei to northern Japan, Korea, Mongolia and China in the south
   to the Chukchi Peninsula in the north. Despite its wide distribution, it
   remains the least studied and almost unused to ``green building{''} even
   within its range. Data on intraspecific variability of P. suaveolens are
   fragmentary, and studies of the variability of species-specific traits
   at the population level are insufficient. Such trait as basal glands
   (glands from above at the junction of petiole and blade) has been
   recorded recently and only in one part of the range. As a consequence,
   there is no clear understanding of the scope of the taxon, the
   boundaries of its range and natural hybridization with neighboring
   species of the Tacamahaca section. Since hybridization introduces some
   difficulties in studying intraspecific variability in species of the
   genus Populus, it is of theoretical and practical interest to study
   variability in populations remote from its current zones. One of such
   regions of P. suaveolens range is Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, where it
   grows in the floodplains of rivers in periodically flooded areas,
   forming with Chosenia arbutifolia (Pall.) A.K. Skvortsov poplar-chosenia
   forests. The aim of this study is to characterize the variability of
   morphological traits of vegetative organs of P. suaveolens in
   populations of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.
   We studied P. suaveolens populations in 2020 in Bilibinsk district of
   Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The study area is characterized by a
   low-mountain relief: with increasing altitude of the terrain a change in
   vegetation belts is traced. Forest communities occupy river valleys and
   the lower parts of the slopes of hills. Poplar-chosenia forests grow on
   sandy-pebble substrates along the river floodplains in small strips. As
   our observations have shown, P. suaveolens is widely used in landscaping
   of settlements of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Magadan Region. Three of
   the studied populations: ``Baimka{''}, ``Tallag{''} and ``Peschanka{''}
   are located at the latitude of the Arctic Circle in the floodplains of
   the eponymous rivers in the river basin Bolshoi Anyui. All of them are
   isolated from each other by mountains. The northernmost population
   ``Bilibino{''} is confined to the right bank of the Bolshoi Keperveem
   River (Maly Anyuy River basin) on the border of Bilibino, it is 200 km
   distant from the others. All populations were sampled in poplar-chosenia
   floodplain forests with varying degrees of anthropogenic transformation
   of the territory (Table 1).
   To exclude age variability, we collected herbarium material only from
   shortened shoots of the southern side of the middle part of the crown of
   reproductively mature trees. The tendency of balsamic poplars to form
   clones was taken into account, and repeated collections within a clone
   were carefully avoided. From each individual, fifteen fully developed,
   undamaged leaves were taken. The main morphometric traits, as well as
   the derivatives (indices) were measured on each leaf. A total of 1800
   leaves were used for morphological study. We studied a complex of
   traits: blade shape, its apex and base, presence of basal glands, and
   petiole pubescence.
   Poplar-chosenia forests in the studied area grow in a narrow strip on
   alluvial sandy-pebble deposits in the floodplains of rivers (See Fig.
   1). The stand formed by P. suaveolens is 12-14 m high, 16-20 cm in
   diameter; trunks are straight and with low taper. Bark in a lower part
   is oblong-cracked at the height of 1-1.5 m, above it is smooth and
   whitish-gray. The crown is usually compact, spreading in older trees;
   branches are of medium thickness. Clearance from dry branches is good.
   Leaf blades on shortened shoots are bent upwards at the edges and folded
   in the form of a ``boat{''} in all the studied plantings. This is
   probably due to the absence of stomata on the upper side of the blades
   and this ``folding{''} facilitates transpiration. Perhaps it is an
   important adaptation in the subarctic conditions of the region. P.
   suaveolens in all four populations is characterized by two blade forms:
   obovate and elliptic (See Table 2). As in other Populus species
   investigated, several forms can be observed at the endogenous level
   (within the individual), but one - obovate, with the maximum width above
   the middle of its length (57-70\%) prevails. On shortened shoots in the
   middle part of the crown, all leaves of one tree always have only one
   shape of the apex and base of the leaf blade. In all studied populations
   of P. suaveolens, individuals with a shortly pointed (sharply pointed)
   apex dominated, but in 4-6 trees in the plantation the leaves had a
   gradually pointed shape. Only in Baimka population, plants with a
   wedge-shaped base of the leaf blade prevailed, in the rest these were
   roundly wedge-shaped ones (See Table 2). As noted above, one of the
   morphological traits of leaves characteristic of P. suaveolens is a
   differently expressed cordate base of the blade and the presence of a
   small notch. The notch at the base of leaves of shortened shoots is a
   quite frequent trait, especially in leaves with a rounded wedge-shaped
   base; it often overlaps with rounded lobes. In our opinion, it is caused
   by the character of petiole-to-leafplate transition. The fact is that
   the petiole of P. suaveolens is located in different planes with the
   blade and enters it at an angle from below, at some distance from the
   base edge (See Fig. 2). The groove, expressed on the upper side of the
   petiole, continues to be seen at some distance on the main vein,
   gradually tapering conically. Here, the first lateral veins branch off
   at the place where the groove enters. The levels of variability of the
   considered morphological traits in the populations studied differ in the
   development of basal glands (See Tables 3 and 4). At the endogenous
   level, this trait varies greatly from complete absence to 1-4 glands at
   the base of the blade. However, only in populations ``Bilibino{''} and
   ``Baimka{''}, 3 individuals (10\%) with leaves without glands were
   noted, and on the contrary, in ``Peschanka{''} leaves with developed
   glands prevailed on all plants (See Table 2). In the first two
   plantations, the greatest number of trees with developed glands on less
   than 50\% of leaves was noted. Leaf blades with two glands (32.2\% to
   67.7\% in the population) and one (8.8\% to 17.3\%) were typical (See
   Fig. 3).
   The proportion of leaves without them in the populations ranged from
   18.6\% to 52.2\%. Leaves with three and four glands were noted
   singularly in all populations except ``Bilibino{''}. Consequently, the
   sign of the presence of basal glands varies both at the endogenous and
   individual levels. In our opinion, its occurrence in the populations of
   North-East Russia is caused by ancient introgressive hybridization
   (possibly repeated) of this taxon with P. balsamifera in the
   Pliocene-Pleistocene on the territory of Beringia. Obtained as a result
   of introgression by the fragrant poplar, this trait gradually spread as
   a result of intraspecific interbreeding from the east deep into the
   continent. Consequently, the presence of basal glands as a trait in
   modem populations of P. suaveolens of North-East Russia can be
   considered as evidence of the existence of Eurasian-American syngameon
   at certain stages of evolution of the genus. Weak differentiation of the
   studied populations, despite their considerable remoteness, indicates
   that modem poplars in the territory of North-East Russia are the result
   of postglacial recolonization.},

Title = {Salicylic acid and formation of plant adaptive responses to abiotic
   stressors: role of signaling network components},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {55},
Pages = {135-165},
Abstract = {Salicylic acid (SA) is one of the key phytohormones. A lot of signaling
   pathways are activated under its influence. SA takes part in regulation
   of physiological processes such as seed germination, flowering,
   synthesis of other hormones, photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration,
   thermogenesis, responses to infection with pathogens, as well as in
   adaptation to action of various stressors. Numerous data show an
   increase in endogenous SA content in plants at the early stages of
   stress response. Under SA influence, there is antioxidant system
   activation, as well as synthesis of stress proteins (heat shock
   proteins, dehydrins, PR- (pathogenesis related) proteins), and
   accumulation of multifunctional low-molecular-weight protective
   compounds (proline, glycine betaine, sugars, secondary metabolites).
   Also, SA has an ability to induce stomatal closure in plants.
   We discussed the role of NPR1 protein, which is considered a key
   transcriptional regulator of SA signaling. We noted that the interaction
   of SA with this protein occurs in at least two ways: through direct
   binding and through SA-induced changes in cell redox homeostasis,
   leading to the NPR1 transition from an oligomer state to a monomer form.
   For NPR1 monomerization in the cytosol, there must be a sufficient pool
   of reducing agents, but their nature is not fully understood. At a low
   SA concentration in cells, NPR1 protein forms an oligomer and remains in
   the cytosol (See Fig. 1). Wherein proteins NPR3 and NPR4 bind residual
   NPR1 in the nucleus and limit its functional activity. With an increase
   in the SA concentration, NPR1 transforms into a monomer state and
   penetrates into the nucleus. In addition to the redox-dependent
   monomerization of NPR1, the increased SA concentration blocks the
   activity of NPR3 and NPR4, which in the absence of SA act as repressors
   of transcription regulated by the TGACG-binding factor in SA-sensitive
   promoters. Thus, blocking NPR3 and NPR4 leads to the activation of the
   expression of SA-induced genes. However, the list of SA-binding proteins
   is not limited to NPR. Data on the participation in SA binding of
   methylesterase, carbonic anhydrase, several isoenzymes of glutathione
   S-transferase, chloroplast thioredoxin-m1, some enzymes of the Krebs
   cycle, and a number of other proteins, including those with unknown
   functions, have been obtained. In this regard, the hypothesis of
   multinodular (decentralized) SA perception by a plant cell is discussed.
   In addition to specific proteins, calcium ions, reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide are involved in SA signaling
   (See Fig. 2). However, the relationships between most of these mediators
   during SA signal transduction have not been sufficiently studied. We
   found out that calcium ions in signaling chains are located both below
   the SA (involved in the transduction of its signals) and above (involved
   in the induction of SA synthesis). We considered the participation of
   cationic channels of the CNGC type (cyclic nucleotide-gated calcium
   channels) in the activation of SA synthesis in plant cells under an
   action of stressors. The entry of calcium through them into the cytosol
   leads to the activation of calmodulin, and then protein kinases
   dependent on calmodulin and calcium. These calcium sensor proteins
   modulate the activity of transcription factors CBP60g and CAMTA3/SR1,
   which are positive regulators of the expression of isochorismate
   synthase gene and other genes that provide the process of SA synthesis.
   On the other hand, treatment of plants with exogenous SA or an increase
   in its content in cells due to stress-induced enhancement of synthesis
   leads to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic calcium, which is
   necessary for transduction of the SA signal into the genetic apparatus
   and the realization of its physiological effects.
   SA can also be involved in the implementation of action of signaling
   mediators such as ROS and nitric oxide. In this case, however, not all
   of their physiological effects are realized with the participation of
   SA. In particular, our work provides examples of the successful
   induction of salt tolerance of salicylate-deficient transformants of
   Arabidopsis NahG by the action of hydrogen peroxide and the nitric oxide
   donor sodium nitroprusside.
   On the other hand, ROS, nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide can act as
   intermediaries in the implementation of the SA action. This review
   analyzes new information on the effect of SA on functioning of enzymatic
   systems that generate ROS (NADPH oxidase, extracellular peroxidase),
   hydrogen sulfide (L- and D-cysteine desulfhydrases) and that synthesize
   nitric oxide by the reductive and oxidative pathways.
   We considered the effects of enhancing stress-protective effect of SA on
   plants when combined with donors of signaling
   molecules-gasotransmitters. We noted that the low cost and environmental
   safety of SA as a natural compound should contribute to the expansion of
   the scope of its practical application, primarily as a growth regulator
   of stress-protective action.},

Title = {Comparison of methods for RNA extraction from potato plants for
   real-time PCR},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {51},
Pages = {123-140},
Abstract = {Molecular methods allow solving both fundamental and applied problems of
   biology. The use of these methods makes it possible to determine not
   only the systematic position of the organism, but also to reveal the
   differential expression of certain groups of genes in response to the
   action of regulatory factors. RNA extraction involves the following main
   stages: cell lysis (destruction), deproteinization and RNA purification.
   The main methods for their implementation were described in 1987, and in
   2009 the minimum requirements for publishing the results of real-time
   PCR (RT-PCR) - MIQE (Minimum Information for publication of Quantitative
   real-time Experiments) were developed. There are requirements for RNA
   samples and DNA- allowable presence of protein and polysaccharide
   contaminants, concentration and integrity of the nucleic acid sample.
   Nucleic acid extraction is a major step in molecular biology. Currently,
   a large number of protocols and guidelines for the extraction of RNA and
   DNA from different groups of organisms are described. Among the
   methodological articles devoted to molecular research in the field of
   plant physiology, interest is mainly focused on methods for the
   extraction of total RNA using phenol in a buffer with a low pH value
   (for example, TRIzol (TM) and Tri Reagent (R) reagents (Invitrogen,
   USA)), chloride lithium and/or sodium chloride, as well as silicon
   dioxide (including columns for centrifugation from companies such as
   Qiagen (Germany), Norgen Biotek (Canada) and Invitrogen (USA)).
   The complexity due to extraction is directly determined by the general
   chemical composition of the plant. There are no universal methodological
   recommendations for each type of plant; therefore, researchers are
   forced to carry out comparative analysis of extraction methods based on
   their own research objects and, if necessary, carry out stage
   modifications aimed at improving the quality of the nucleic acid
   preparations released, since their purity depends on the correctness and
   reliability of the results of molecular studies and their practical
   applications. The high content of polysaccharides in plants complicates
   the isolation and purification of total RNA. Their excessive content in
   RNA disrupts the optimal real-time PCR and can lead to an erroneous
   assessment of the level of expression of target genes. There is a need
   to assess the quality of the obtained nucleic acid preparation for the
   test samples due to the low repeatability of the experiments. Regarding
   potato plants, there is currently no standard method for extracting
   nucleic acids. At the same time, potato, being one of the important
   objects of study, is characterized by a high content of polysaccharides,
   which complicates the extraction of high-quality RNA from potato
   tissues. In this connection, for the first time, we compared the
   effectiveness of the three methods of RNA extraction from the leaves of
   potato plants with the aim of subsequent real-time PCR in accordance
   with the recommendations of MIQE. The first method is based on the use
   of a surfactant - SDS and a monovalent metal salt - lithium chloride to
   inhibit the activity of Rnase. This method was described by Manickavelu
   et al. in 2007 and modified by a team of scientists from the Institute
   of Plant Physiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2020. The
   second is based on the mechanism of binding nucleic acids with silica
   gel membrane in commercial columns RNeasy (R) Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
   Germany) in the presence of chaotropic. The third is based on using the
   TRIzol (TM) reagent in which phenol with a strong oxidizing agent -
   guanidine thiocyanate is included in the extraction buffer and act as a
   lysing agent and an RNase inhibitor.
   To assess the quality of total RNA, the following was used: (1) agarose
   gel electrophoresis, which demonstrates the integrity of RNA; (2)
   measuring the concentration of RNA and evaluating the ratios (A(260/280)
   and A(260/230)) with a spectrophotometer, which indicates the RNA yield
   and the degree of purification of the sample from proteins and
   polysaccharides; and (3) real-time PCR using the ten-fold dilution
   method to detect the presence of additional compounds in RNA samples
   that affect the functioning of the enzymes and as a consequence, the
   efficiency of the reaction.
   In the process of choosing the method of RNA extraction, it is important
   to take into account not only the chemical composition of the reagents,
   but also the requirements for the method, such as the quantitative yield
   of the obtained RNA, duration of extraction, throughput, or quality of
   the final reaction product.
   Methods requiring self-preparation of reagents, the first (Manickavelu
   et al.) and the third methods (using the TRIzol (TM) reagent), were time
   consuming and had a significant risk of contamination, but were more
   cost effective. In addition, they were distinguished by the need to use
   phenol, which forms stable complexes with nucleic acids as a result of
   the oxidation reaction. These compounds can lead to darkening of the
   sample, reduce the total quantitative yield of RNA and inhibit key
   enzymes for real-time PCR.
   During our research, we demonstrated that the use of the TRIzol (TM)
   reagent needs additional steps for RNA purifying from impurities, which
   negatively affects the ratios A(260/280) and A(260/230) for the RNA (See
   Table 1) and optimal real-time PCR (See Table 2 and Fig. 2). The use of
   the commercial RNeasy (R) Plant Mini Kit spin-columns significantly
   reduces the time of RNA extraction and contributes to the most optimal
   amplification reaction (See Table 2 and Fig. 2), but is not suitable for
   the extraction of short-sized mRNAs. The Manickavelu' s method, despite
   its duration, allows to reduce the degree of contamination of the RNA
   with proteins and polysaccharides (See Table 1), as well as visualizes
   small RNAs in an agarose gel (See Fig. 1), which indicates the sparing
   effect of the reagents on the RNA and allows to preserve the integrity
   of the molecules or a more complete extraction. However, this method
   requires additional purification from the components of the buffer
   and/or other reagents involved in the extraction in order to exclude
   inhibition of real-time PCR.},

Title = {Black carbon as a factor in deglaciation in polar and mountain
   ecosystems: A Review},

Abstract = {Black carbon is considered a product of the incomplete combustion of
   fossil fuels and materials that originated from volcanic eruptions or
   were emitted during wildfires. It is a strong light-absorbing component
   that has many atmospheric and surface effects in terrestrial and glacial
   ecosystems. Normally, black carbon is presented as a solid particle,
   consisting mainly of pure carbon, which absorbs solar radiation at all
   wavelengths. Some black carbon particles are amended by a mineral
   compound, though black carbon substances are normally dark or greyish
   dark. Black carbon is the most active part of suspended particles in the
   atmosphere and on glacial surfaces, absorbing solar radiation, the main
   component of ash, which consists of carbon particles with impurities in
   the form of mineral particles and also contains carbon of biogenic
   origin. In this paper, we have analyzed the literature on black carbon
   and its effect on deglaciation processes in the Earth's polar and
   mountainous regions. The physical, chemical, and microbiological
   composition of black carbon accumulations were studied using the
   examples of the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the Central Caucasus.
   Potential sources and conditions of the transportation of black carbon
   into the polar zone and their effect on ice and snow have also been
   discussed.

Title = {The role of mirror neurons in the interpretation of actions and
   intentions},

Abstract = {The study of mirror neuron functions is an important problem of modern
   neurophysiology. According to the currently popular hypothesis, mirror
   neurons can serve as the neural basis for interpreting actions,
   mimicking the learning process, and imitating other people's behavior.
   However, not all researchers share this view point. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the role of mirror neurons in interpreting the
   actions and intentions. The aim of the research was to study the
   activity of ``motor{''} and ``communicative{''} mirror neurons, as well
   as cortical interactions at the frequency of the mu rhythm in men and
   women when observing and reproducing the rhythm, as well as when
   observing and pronouncing words. Depression of mu rhythm EEG cortical
   interactions at the frequency on the mu-rhythm band and the results fMRT
   brain scanning were used as mirror neuron activity markers.
   The electroencephalographic study involved volunteers, practically
   healthy men (31) and women (34), students aged 18 to 23 years. During
   the preliminary examination, we used the Annett questionnaires to
   identify the leading hand. In the first series, the subject observed the
   operator's hand and at the start memorized a five-second rhythm, then
   with the middle and forefinger of the dominant hand reproduced this
   rhythm, periodically pressing the space bar. The period of the rhythm
   was set by a visual stimulus (a white square with a side of 2 cm,
   periodically appearing for 200 ms in the center of the black screen). In
   the second and third series, the subject at the start memorized a
   five-second rhythm, after which he reproduced this rhythm with the
   fingers of his left hand, and then with the right hand. In the fourth
   series, the subject watched the operator who silently uttered the word
   ``RAZ{''} with his lips only when the stopwatch hand on the monitor
   screen crossed divisions 0, 5, 10, etc. seconds. In total, the stopwatch
   hand made 5 revolutions. In the fifth series, the subject himself
   silently pronounced the word ``RAZ{''} at the indicated times. Before
   performing the proposed activity and during its implementation, EEG was
   recorded monopolar in the frontal (F3, F4, Fz, F7, F8), central (C3, C4,
   Cz), temporal (T3, T4, T5, T6), parietal (P3, P4, Pz) and occipital (01,
   02) leads according to the ``10-20\%{''} system. When processing the
   obtained data, the maximum values of the cross-correlation functions
   were calculated and the spectral power was estimated for short (1.5 s),
   free of artifacts EEG recording segments before 3 s ({''}Background{''})
   and 1.5 s ({''}Preparation{''}) until the moment of transitive action
   (pressing a key) or speech action and immediately after the specified
   event 1.5 s ({''}Performing an action{''}).
   In a part of the experiments in the series, observation and reproduction
   of the rhythm and observation and pronunciation of words allowed us to
   study the activity of the brain using the fMRI method. These studies
   involved volunteers: 20 men and 20 women, aged 19 to 27 years,
   university students. During the preliminary examination, using the
   Annett questionnaire, the leading hand was identified. The fMRI results
   were obtained on a SIEMENS Magnetom Verio 3 Tesla tomography. All fMRI
   data were pre-processed using the SPM8 package. Within each of the
   paradigms, pairwise comparisons were performed based on Student's t-test
   and individual and group maps were obtained with a significance level of
   P < 0.001. All obtained statistical maps were plotted on a template T-1
   image and anatomical binding of the ``active{''} voxels to the CONN
   atlas was made.
   Our studies have shown that cognitive activity associated with the
   observation and reproduction of the rhythm, with the observation and
   pronunciation of words (See Fig. 2, 3, 5 and 6), is accompanied by
   depression of the mu rhythm at certain frequencies and, most often, an
   increase in the levels of cortical connections at the frequency of this
   rhythm between the central and other zones of the cortex. The nature of
   these changes significantly depends on gender differences, the frequency
   of the mu rhythm, as well as the type and stage of the performed
   activity (See Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). The results of fMRI scanning of the
   brain showed that the observation of transitive actions associated with
   the reproduction of a five-second rhythm and speech actions associated
   with the pronunciation of words is accompanied by the activation not
   only of those areas of the cortex where the corresponding ``motor{''} or
   ``communicative{''} mirror neurons are located, but also other zones of
   the associative, sensory and motor cortex, as well as the basal ganglia
   (See Fig. 2 and Fig. 5). The obtained data indicate that mirror neurons
   by themselves do not provide an understanding of actions and intentions,
   although they take part in these processes. It is assumed that mirror
   neurons are involved in mediating interactions between the prefrontal
   cortex, sensory and motor cortical regions, as well as storage sites of
   motor programs in the brain. The interaction of these structures appears
   to result in an understanding of actions and intentions of other people.
   This << mediating{''} function of mirror neurons allows us to understand
   their involvement and activity in observing, performing and mental
   reproducing of actions.},

Title = {Mycobiota of the pelagic zone of Odessa region in the northwestern Black
   Sea},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {140-163},
Abstract = {Mycobiota of the marine area of Odessa region was studied (30 degrees
   70'00''-31 degrees 00'00''N, 46 degrees 23'00''-46 degrees 60'00''E)
   (See Fig. 1). Hydrological and hydrochemical regimes of the marine area
   of Odessa region in the northwestern Black Sea are affected by the
   discharge of the Dnieper (93.4\%) and the Southern Bug (5.7\%) rivers,
   the permanent anthropogenic discharges of the cities of Odessa,
   Chernomorsk (Ilyichyovsk), Yuzhnyi species composition, the number of
   colony forming units (CFU) and the dynamics of the spatiotemporal
   distribution of reared microfungi as a function of abiotic factors and
   the trophic level of seawater in this area. Water samples were taken in
   summer and autumn 2008-2012 in the surface (1 m depth) and bottom (7-24
   m depth) layers. The samples were taken, at least, in three replicates.
   The results of processing 258 samples from 22 stations were analyzed.
   The effects of environmental factors (water temperature, salinity,
   dissolved oxygen, five-day biochemical oxygen demand, petroleum
   hydrocarbons, dissolved metals Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd and suspended particulate
   matter) were studied in 140 samples (See Table 1). Micromycetes were
   isolated on Czapek's medium prepared in sea water. 1 ml of sample water
   was added to a Petri dish and filled with medium cooled to approximately
   36-40 degrees C. To suppress the growth of bacteria, 0.03\%
   chloramphenicol was added to the medium (by volume of the medium).
   Cultivation was carried out at a temperature of 18-20 degrees C. for 2-8
   weeks. Micromycetes were identified by morphological and cultural
   characteristics according to Vera Bilay and Eleonora Koval' (1988) and
   GS De Hooh ea tl. (2000). Nomenclature, and taxonomy of fungi correspond
   to The Index Fungorum database. The ecological analysis of mycocomplexes
   was carried out according to: species composition, the number of species
   in complexes, frequency of occurrence of a species and the number of
   colony-forming units(CFU / L).
   In this research, 50 fungal species of 19 genera, 14 families, 9 orders,
   4 classes of the division Ascomycota were revealed. Fungal taxa from
   Odessa region were grouped into families. The family Aspergillaceae
   included the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces (27
   species); the family Pleosporaceae included the genera Alternaria and
   Stemphylium (8); and there were 3 species of the genus Cladosporium from
   the family Cladosporiaceae. In total, 76.0\% of species found were from
   the three families (See Table 2). Using Average Taxonomic Distinctness
   index, AvTD (Delta+), and Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness index,
   VarTD (Delta+), features of the taxonomic diversity of mycocomplexes
   were revealed. These indices were calculated from a matrix of
   micromycete species from the region under study combined with the fungi
   list (master list, 219 species) of the Black Sea pelagic zone. In the
   analysis, the taxonomy levels from Species to Kingdom were included. For
   the indices Delta+ and Delta+, 95\% probability funnel graphs were
   plotted, and their mean expected values were calculated for mycobiota of
   the region under study and for mycocomplexes from each station. It was
   found out that the mean expected values of the index Delta+ for
   mycobiota of the marine area of Odessa region and the stations are
   considerably lower, and index Delta+ values are higher than those for
   the sea as a whole (See Fig. 2 and 3). According to literature sources,
   no significant seasonal and inter-annual changes in the trophic status
   of the region occurred in 1992-2010. It was transitional between
   mesotrophic and eutrophic. The long-term mean TRIX value was 5.3 (4-5:
   medium trophic level; 5-6: high trophic level and poor water quality).
   In the species composition and numerical structure of mycocomplexes of
   the mesotrophic and eutrophic zones, no significant differences were
   detected. Over the entire period of this research, a relatively uniform
   distribution of the mean abundance of fungi over the area and depth was
   noted (See Table 3). No significant correlation was found between
   abiotic parameters under study and micromycete abundance over the
   horizons, seasons, sampling dates, location of stations, as well as
   mesotrophic and eutrophic zones.
   In the region, 44\% of fungi-indicators of different kinds of pollution
   were registered. In the areas of stormwater runoff and wastewater
   treatment plant discharges, the indicator value (IndVal) was the largest
   for melanin-containing fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides (28.3\%),
   Alternaria alternata (17.5\%), and Aspergillus niger (12.3\%), which are
   resistant to several adverse environmental factors. In the eutrophic
   zone, large values of the indices were found in Aspergillus clavatus
   (21,2\%), Penicillium expansum (17,7\%), Penicillium citrinum (16,1\%),
   Al. tenuissima (12,5\%), and in A. fumigatus (60\%), Al. alternata
   (40\%) and A. niger (35,7\%) in places of local oil pollution. It is
   established that in the entire marine area of Odessa region, the formed
   mycocomplexes have a high similarity in species and numerical structure,
   and therefore, they can be considered as a single community.

Title = {Monitoring the development of the oak lace bug (Corythucha arcuata Say)
   based on the use of atmospheric heat content},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {In recent years, a negative situation has developed as a result of mass
   invasions of adventive pests on the lands of the forest fund, among
   which the oak lace bug Corythucha arcuata Say (Heteroptera: Tingidae)
   requires special attention. The pest poses a great danger to the
   survival and productivity of oak forests and forest plantations in the
   South of Russia. The existing methods of pest monitoring do not always
   reflect the real constants of the phenology of target objects, which
   leads to errors in determining the optimal timing of protective measures
   and a decrease in their effectiveness. Hence, research in the
   development of precision methods for phytosanitary monitoring of harmful
   species is an important problem of plant protection, especially
   biological. The study of the phenology and dynamics of the oak lace bug
   will allow optimizing protective measures, taking into account the most
   vulnerable phases of phytophage development and the timing of
   treatments. The aim of this study was to develop precision methods for
   monitoring the dynamics of the number and age structure of the oak lace
   bug population based on the use of the heat content of the atmosphere.
   The studies were carried out in the central (Krasnodar), northeastern
   (Tikhoretsk) and western (Krymsk) zones of Krasnodar Krai belonging to
   the temperate climatic zone, as well as the Black Sea zone (Sochi),
   located in the subtropical climatic zone. The choice of localities for
   the research was carried out taking into account the territories of
   invasive distribution of the oak lace bug and the differences in
   climatic conditions from moderate continental to subtropical. The
   calculation of the heat content (enthalpy) of air was carried out using
   a modified Ramzin nomogram (See Fig. 1). Phenological observations and
   counting of the number of C. arcuata bugs were carried out on model
   trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.) (See Fig. 2). The reference date
   was chosen empirically based on the use of heat content indicators that
   are different in terms of reference periods and corresponding to these
   periods (See Table 1).
   As a result of the studies carried out during 2018-2020, the actual
   dates of the onset of the phenophases of the oak lace bug and the
   corresponding enthalpy of air (the heat content) were determined (See
   Table 2). We calculated the amount of heat required for the emergence of
   the oak lace bug after winter diapause (140-145 kcal/kg air) and passing
   through the preimaginal stages of development from egg-laying (158-167
   kcal/ kg), hatching of larvae (180-194 kcal/kg) before fledging of
   adults of a new generation (136-145 kcal/kg). The sum of effective
   temperatures (SET) was calculated according to the generally accepted
   method (Chernova, Bylova, 2004; Zamotajlov et al., 2009) (See Table 3).
   We have shown that the enthalpy of air is the most preferable indicator
   for assessing thermal characteristics for determining the timing of the
   appearance of overwintered individuals, the passage of phenophases of
   insects and the number of their generations in comparison with the sum
   of effective temperatures (See Table 2 and 3). We found that the number
   of generations of oak lace bug in the central, western and northeastern
   zones (temperate climatic zone) of Krasnodar Krai, which is directly
   dependent on the heat content of the air, was three, and in the Black
   Sea zone (subtropical climatic zone) there were four generations per
   seasonal cycle. To improve the reliability of predicting the timing of
   phenological phases of the oak lace bug, a method for monitoring
   phenophases of the pest based on calculating the heat content of the air
   has been developed, which can be used for practical purposes to optimize
   protective measures associated with the use of insecticides, growth and
   development regulators of insects, entomopathogens and entomophages in
   agricultural and forest cenoses.
   Thus, distribution, development rate, number dynamics and harmfulness of
   the species to the greatest extent depend on the ecological resource of
   the inhabited territory, determined by the enthalpy of the air. On the
   basis of enthalpy, the rate of passage of phenophases and the number of
   generations of the pest, which determine its invasive development in
   large areas, are reliably calculated.},

   irrigation},

Abstract = {The dry subtropical zone of Azerbaijan is located in an
   erosion-hazardous zone, and irrigation erosion manifests itself on an
   area of more than 255 thousand hectares. The damage caused by irrigation
   erosion to the agriculture of the republic is manifested not only in the
   destruction of the soil structure, but also in the removal of nutrients
   from the soil. At the same time, the patterns of change in the
   anti-erosion resistance of grey Cirmomanic soils /Luvic Calcisols
   /Luvic-Calcic Kastanozems (according to the classification of the USSR),
   grey Cinnamonic soils (according to the classification of Azerbaijan),
   (on WRB (2014)-Haplic Kastanozems / Haplic Calcisols) in the dry
   subtropical zone of Azerbaijan, depending on the age of irrigation, are
   diverse and not fully studied. Therefore, conducting research in this
   direction and assessing the antierosion resistance of grey Cinnamonic
   soils is relevant for Azerbaijan.
   The aim of this research is to study the changing of the anti-erosion
   resistance of irrigated grey Cinnomanic soils in the foothill and plain
   areas of the dry subtropical zone of the republic, depending on the age
   of irrigation. Based on the results obtained, the place of grey
   Cinnomanic soils in the international classification system WRB (2014)
   was determined. The research was carried out on grey Cinnomanic soils of
   heavy loamy and light clayey granulometric composition of the foothills
   and plains of the dry subtropical zone of different irrigation periods,
   in the territories: Grey Cinnomanic (virgin soils) - Beylagan (39
   degrees 46'02.2 `' N, 47 degrees 36'13.3 `' E) and Yevlakh region (40
   degrees 60'67.75 `' N, 47 degrees 17'02.71 `' E); Newly Irrigated Grey
   Cinnamonic (20-25 years old) - Agdash region (40 degrees 63'24.62 `' N,
   47 degrees 49'11.92 `' E) and Geokchay region (40 degrees 37'10.5 `' N,
   47 degrees 44'29.5 `' E); Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (about 100 years
   old) - Bilasuvar (39 degrees 48'36.49 `' N, 48 degrees 43'35.24 `' E),
   Yevlakh (40 degrees 4434.18 `' N, 46 degrees 96'51.13 `' E), kshu (40
   degrees 55'39.53 `' N, 48 degrees 35'04.18 `' E), and Aghstafa region
   (41 degrees 06'11.17 `' N, 45 degrees 28'07.32 `' E); For a Long
   Time-Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (about 300 years old) - Bilasuvar (39
   degrees 44'25.56 `' N, 48 degrees 42'52.72 `' E) and Beylagan region (39
   degrees 76'45.13 `' N, 47 degrees 59'13.50 `' E).
   The research methods are comparative-geographical (geographical patterns
   of distribution of these soils according to the granulometric
   competition and humus content of the arable horizon) and
   comparative-analytical. On the plots, soil sections were laid, a
   morphological description was carried out, soil samples were taken from
   the genetic horizons (Field guide of soils in Russia (2008), FAO.
   Guidelines for soil description (2006), IUSS Working Group WRB. World
   Reference Base of Soil Resources 2014, update 2015, Kailas and
   Tanzybayev (2001)). The anti-erosion resistance of soils was determined
   by the bottom erosion flow rate-according to Kuznetsov MS. (1981), the
   water resistance of the aggregates - by methods of dry and ``wet{''}
   aggregate analysis according to Savvinov, the specific gravity of the
   solid phase - by the pycnometric method, the granulometric compotition -
   by the pipette method, soil density - with a drill according to the
   generally accepted method (Arinushkina, 1970; Vadyunina and Korchagina,
   1986]. The value of the protrusions of soil roughness was determined by
   the ratio Delta = 0.7 (d) over barw, where (d) over barw is the weighted
   average diameter of the water-resistant aggregates. The value (d) over
   barw was calculated based on the results of the structural analysis of
   the soil by the Savvinov method at the initial moisture content W
   (Grigoryev and Makkaveev, 1979), the content of total humus - according
   to Tyurin, modified bu Nikitin, cellulolytic activity - by application
   method for the decomposition of cotton canvases (Kazeev, Kolesnikov and
   Valkov, 2003).
   Depending on the age of irrigation, we revealed changes in the
   morphological profile of soil and qualitative indicators of
   physical-chemical properties of grey Cinnamonic soils during
   cultivation. in newly irrigated grey Cinnamonic soils, the cultivated
   layer (25-30 cm thick) is not fully formed, new arable (A1-22-27 cm) and
   subsurface horizons (A2-15-16 cm) have been formed and are somewhat
   compacted, the structure is deteriorated, the level of carbonate and
   gypsum horizons is lowered. The profile of irrigated soils differs
   sharply from virgin and newly irrigated soils, has a clear colour
   differentation; a cultivated layer is formed (thickness - 52-56 cm), the
   arable horizon is A1-25-28 cm, subsoil - A2-24-26 cm, the
   illuvial-carbonate horizon is poorly expressed, down to 96-101 cm. Long
   time-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils under the influence of
   long-term irrigation with turbid waters and constant cultivation have
   lost the signs of zonal primary soils and acquired a special type of
   soil profile - a monotonous grayish-brownish colour, uniformity of
   profile and composition, a fully formed cultivated layer with a
   thickness of 65-70 cm; burried horizons are found at a depth of 61-83
   cm. A distinctive feature of the irrigated and irrigation-accumulative
   (long-irrigated) variants of grey Cinnamonic soils - an increase in the
   microaggregates content, a high content of physical clay (60.8-64.3\%),
   which, when compared with the non-flush type of water regime (virgin),
   causes not very high humus content of the upper (0-25 and 25-50 cm of
   soil) horizons (2.29 and 1.78\% humus), their weak resistance to the
   destructive action of water (See Tables 2 and 3). The content of
   water-resisant aggregates >0.25 mm in layers (0.25 cm) of the soil in
   comparison with virgin (54.08\%) decreases to 35.83\% in newly
   irrigated, in irrigated - to 38.23 \% and in irrigation-accumulative
   (long-irrigated) - up to 40.40\% (See Table 4); the highest values of
   the coefficient of variation of density (CV = 13.54), with a standard
   deviation (SD = 0.161) are observed in newly irrigated soils (See Table
   5).
   A high bottom erosive flow rate was noted in virgin soils is 0.070-0.072
   m/s, somewhat less - in irrigated (0.050-0.063 m/s), in long-irrigated
   (irrigation-accumulative) (0.048-0.050 m/s) and in newly irrigated soils
   - 0.048-0.049 m/s (See Table 6). The highest value of porosity, with a
   solid phase density of 2.65-2.67 g/cm(3), is noted on non-irrigated
   (virgin) soils (49-55\%), in long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative)
   soils, it decreases to 47-49\%, and on irrigated at a solid phase
   density of 2.66-2.77 g/cm(3) corresponded within the permissible values
   (51-52\%) (See Table 6). The values of the weighted average diameter of
   water-resistant aggregates decreased from virgin to newly irrigated and
   to long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils (from 0.670.74 mm to
   0.27-0.31 mm) (See Fig. 1). The highest value of the ratio of
   anti-erosion resistance to erosion flow velocity was observed for virgin
   grey Cinnamonic soils (0,0710 +/- 0,102 m/s). The maximum average height
   of roughness protrusions was noted in long-irrigated
   (irrigation-accumulative) soils (0.27 mm), then irrigated (0.25 mm), and
   the smallest - in newly irrigated (0.19 mm) soils (See Table 7).
   We revealed that depending on the age of their irrigation, the
   anti-erosion resistance of grey Cinnamonic soils, as the bottom erosion
   flow rate and anti-erosion resistance decrease, can be arranged in the
   following row: virgin soils -> irrigated -> longirrigated -> newly
   irrigated.
   Based on the results obtained, we determined the place of grey
   Cinnamonic soils in the international classification system WRB (2014):
   Virgin soils - Saturated gley calcareous heavy loamy - Duric Gleyic
   Calcic Kastanozems (Loamic); Newly irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (20-25
   years old) - Powerful new irrigated calcareous heavy loamy Grey
   Cinnamonic - Someric Calcic Kastanozems (Loamic); Irrigated Grey
   Cinnamonic (about 100 years old) - Powerful cultivated irrigated
   calcareous heavy loamy - Someric Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic); For a
   long time-irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (over 300 years old) - Powerful gley
   cultivated for a long time irrigated calcareous heavy loamy Grey
   Cinnamonic - Gleyic Petrocalcic Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic).},

Title = {Estimation of genomic DNA damage in populations of the marsh frog
   (Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771) of the Belgorod agglomeration by
   DNA comet assay},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic pollution of water bodies is a serious problem for the
   sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. The main sources of pollution of
   water bodies are wastewater, washouts from agricultural fertilizers,
   pesticides and roads. Many of highly persistent pollutants are dangerous
   mutagens and carcinogens. The disruption they cause to the DNA and RNA
   structure and properties of organisms can have long-term consequences
   and can affect the livelihood of future generations. Among existing DNA
   damage estimation methods, DNA comet assay is the most widespread due to
   its accuracy and reliability. In our study, the marsh frog (Pelophylax
   ridibundus Pallas, 1771) was chosen as an object of study. This species
   is adapted to life under anthropogenic influence and actively inhabits
   transformed biotopes. The aim of our work was to estimate the level of
   DNA damage by DNA comet assay of P. ridibundus inhabiting Belgorod city
   and its suburbs.
   We studied a total of 6 marsh frog populations, with collection sites
   differing in the degree of anthropogenic pressure (See Table 1 and Fig.
   1), and we selected 5 individuals of P. ridibundus from each locality.
   The experimental animals were handled in accordance with international
   ethical standards. Animal liver was used as the material for the study
   and analysis was performed on the day of collection. Tissue was
   homogenized in phosphate-salt buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mMEDTA-Na2
   and 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at +4 degrees C. To precipitate large
   fragments, tubes were incubated for 5 mM at room temperature before
   transferring 1.5 ml of the top layer to microcentrifuge tubes and
   centrifuged in a 5415 R Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Germany) at 1000 g
   for 10 mM at +4 degrees C. The supernatant was removed and the cell
   precipitate was diluted in 1 ml of phosphate salt buffer cooled to +4
   degrees C. To obtain microarrays, 60 mu l of cell suspension was mixed
   with 240 mu l of 1\% fusible agarose solution (t<42 degrees C). The
   lysis was performed for at least one hour at +4 degrees C (lysis buffer:
   10mM Tris-HCl (pH 10) 2.5M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA-Na2 and 1\% Triton X-100
   with 10\% DMSO). Electrophoresis was performed in a darkened room in
   Tris-EDTA-borate electrode buffer (TBE) for 20 mM at a voltage of 1V/cm.
   At the end of electrophoresis, the preparations were fixed with 70\%
   ethanol for 15 mM. The preparations were stained with SYBR Creen I dye,
   with subsequent analysis using a luminescent trinocular microscope
   MIKMED-2 of Lomo (Russia), with at least 100 cells analyzed from each
   preparation, which were divided into 5 types; cells in the state of
   apoptosis were counted separately (Durnev, et al., 2006). The degree of
   DNA damage was estimated using the Kruskel-Wallis criterion ({''}DNA
   comet index{''}) (Struwe et al., 2007; Filippov, 2014). To determine the
   statistical significance of differences between the studied populations
   we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); statistically significant
   differences were considered at p < 0.05.
   According to the data obtained, in all studied populations, the mean
   value of the DNA damage index (DDI) did not exceed the first threshold
   of DNA degradation (See Table 2). This may indicate, on the one hand,
   the absence of high concentrations of genotoxic pollutants here (which
   is highly doubtful) and, on the other hand, the efficient operation of
   the reparative system of marsh frog. Nevertheless, the calculated DDI
   values made it possible to construct a gradational scale of DNA
   destruction level in the studied groups of frogs depending on the degree
   of pollution and proximity of residential and industrial buildings (See
   Table 2-4). Various chemical compounds from industrial production,
   particularly nitrogen compounds, are known to have genotoxic effects.
   Due to the lack of possibility to perform chemical analysis of water to
   identify concentrations of genotoxic pollutants, we analysed data on
   surface water pollution in some of the investigated locations from open
   literature sources. As a result of this analysis, we revealed the
   dynamics of surface water pollution. All investigated points by the mean
   value of the statistical DDI surpassed reliably the least polluted site
   ``Sevrukovo{''}, which is located in the green zone and at a
   considerable distance from urbanized areas (See Table 2-4). High values
   of DDI were fixed in a zone of industrial and multi-storey buildings,
   localities ``Seversky Donets{''} (DDI = 0.454) and ``Veselka{''} (DDI =
   0.416). Exceeding maximum permissible concentration of nitrogen
   compounds is observed in the above mentioned rivers. Noteworthy is the
   fact that the highest value of the DDI (0.521) was recorded in the
   estuary of the Razumnaya River remote from the industrial part of the
   city ({''}Razumnoye{''}). It should be noted that in this locality there
   is the greatest number of damaged cells, including apoptosis (See Table
   2, Fig. 2 and 3). The highest DDI value is due to the high level of
   pollutants, since the predominant part of the river is occupied by
   ``non-sewered{''} private low-rise buildings, as well as arable land. At
   the same time in the upper part of the river ({''}Sevryukovo{''}) due to
   the lack of obvious pollutants and the intensive current contributing to
   self-purification of the river, we recorded the minimum value of the DDI
   (0.057) and the absence of cells in the state of apoptosis.
   Thus, the present study revealed an increase in the degree of DNA
   destruction in populations of marsh frogs in the impacted areas of the
   city of Belgorod and its surroundings. At the same time, increased
   levels of toxic substances may contribute to a decrease in the viability
   of individuals of both analyzed species and other hydrobiont species,
   which will negatively affect the biodiversity of the region as a whole.},

Title = {Identification of sedentary and migrating graylings in the Yenisei River
   using scales},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {56},
Pages = {152-169},
Abstract = {The regulation of river flow by dams of hydroelectric power plants
   (HPPs) has a significant impact on the populations of migratory fish
   species, preventing their movement between the upstream and downstream
   sections. Violation of the level and thermal regime of the river in the
   downstream of the HPP can also lead to a modification of the migration
   process, both within the main channel and between the main channel and
   its adjoining system. It is assumed that after the construction of the
   dam of Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station, a significant part of
   the population of the Baikal grayling Thymallus baicalensis in the
   downstream section switched to a sedentary lifestyle. However,
   quantitative assessments of this phenomenon have not yet been carried
   out. The middle course of the Yenisei River in the downstream of the HPP
   is a specific watercourse with a smoothed seasonal amplitude of water
   temperatures and a high biomass of benthic invertebrates, up to 10-30
   g/m(2). Such conditions provide an increase in the growth rate of
   grayling in the main channel of the Yenisei, and lead to the formation
   of the structure of its scales, which differs from fish from the
   tributaries of the Yenisei. An additional feature of the Yenisei in the
   downstream of the HPP is that the content of technogenic radionuclides,
   in particular, radiocesium, Cs-137, increased compared to the background
   levels, below the point of radioactive discharges of the
   Mining-and-Chemical Combine ROSATOM (MCC) located near the town of
   Zheleznogorsk (See Fig. 1). Thus, high growth rates, a unique structure
   of scales, and an increased concentration of radiocesium can be
   considered as markers of graylings that constantly inhabit the main
   channel of the Yenisei in the downstream of Krasnoyarsk HPP. Within the
   framework of this work, we, for the first time, attempted to assess the
   ratio of settled and migrated individuals of the Baikal grayling from
   the tributaries in the thermally altered section of the Yenisei on the
   basis of the structure of the scales. As a verification of the proposed
   marker, we used the linear dimensions of fish and the content of
   radioactive cesium in their tissues.
   A sample of 161 individuals of the Baikal grayling was used in this
   work. Fish were collected in the section of the main channel of the
   Yenisei near the mouth of the Kan River, near the village of Khloptunovo
   (56 degrees 28'05 `' N, 93 degrees 38'53 `' E) in July-November 2019.
   When working with animals, the authors followed the recommendations of
   Directive 2010/63 / EU of the European Parliament and the Council of the
   European Union. Fork Length and total weight of fish were measured.
   Grayling scales taken in the lateral line region were photographed and
   then used to count the number of sclerites in the completed annual
   rings. The principle of differentiation of grayling individuals by their
   origin is based on previously obtained results on an increased number of
   sclerites on the scales of fish (primarily in the second annual ring)
   inhabiting a thermally altered section of the middle reaches of the
   Yenisei. Within the framework of this study, we assumed that individuals
   of grayling with more than 15 sclerites in the second annual ring of
   scales constantly inhabit the main channel of the thermally altered
   section of the Yenisei. Further, these individuals are designated by the
   term ``sedentary{''}. Individuals with a smaller number of sclerites,
   designated as ``migrants,{''} spent at least the second year of their
   life in tributaries. To measure the content of technogenic
   radionuclides, fish of the two indicated types were isolated from the
   total sample. In the pooled samples of sedentary grayling for each
   month, the number of individuals varied from 12 to 31 (total 125), in
   the samples of migratory ones - from 3 to 8 individuals (total 18).
   Samples were prepared from muscles taken from the axial skeleton of
   fish, dried and ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 degrees C. The content
   of gamma-emitting radionuclides in the ash samples was measured using a
   gamma spectrometer with a hyper-pure germanium detector GX2320
   (Canberra). The spectra were analyzed using the Genie-2000 software
   (Canberra).
   The number of sclerites in the second annual ring of the studied
   grayling varied from 9 to 24. The share of individuals with 9 to 14
   sclerites, and designated in our work as migrants, was 18.6\% of the
   entire sample (See Fig. 2). The highest percentage of migrating
   individuals was recorded in July (24\%); in August-September it was
   about 20-22\%, in October - 15\%, and in November such grayling was not
   found. To assess potential differences in the growth rates of sedentary
   and migratory fish, the samples were divided into groups by age and
   month of capture. The linear dimensions of the sedentary grayling aged
   2-3 + were 3-5 cm higher (p < 0.05) than the linear dimensions of
   migrating fish in July-August (See Fig. 3). There were no differences in
   FL in 4+ year old fish in July, as well as in 3-year-old fish in
   September-October. Of the technogenic gamma-emitting radionuclides, only
   radiocesium was registered in the muscles of grayling ( Cs-137,
   half-life - 30.1 years). The content of Cs-137 in grayling muscles
   varied in the range of 0.9-7.2 Bq/kg. The maximum content of Cs-137 was
   noted in sedentary fish in August, which exceeded the content of this
   radionuclide in the sample of migrants six times (See Fig. 4). In the
   rest of the months, the samples of sedentary and migrating individuals
   contained a similar specific activity of Cs-137. In July, the content of
   radiocesium in the sample of migrating individuals was not measured. The
   content of radiocesium in the muscles of graylings caught in the
   background site of the Yenisei did not exceed the detection limits.
   Thus, for 2-3-year-old fish, caught in the summer period, the assumption
   about the differences in the growth rates and the content of
   radionuclides in the tissues of residential and migratory individuals
   was confirmed. To explain the absence of differences between individuals
   of the two strategies in other months, a temperature model of the
   distribution of grayling in the tributaries of the Yenisei was proposed.
   According to our assumption, when the water temperature rises to the
   physiological optimum (17-18 degrees C) in the lower and middle reaches
   of the tributaries in July-August, part of the local fish rises
   upstream, and part rolls down into the colder Yenisei (summer
   temperatures no more than 12 degrees C). It is during this period that
   the most dramatic differences between the Yenisei fishes and migrants
   can be diagnosed. By mid-late autumn, such differences are leveled, and
   the migrants themselves are scattered among the Yenisei fish (See Fig.
   5).
   The reason for the increased content of Cs-137 in sedentary graylings in
   August is not clear to us, but, possibly, it is due to the dynamics of
   permitted radioactive discharges into the Yenisei, the frequency of
   which during the year is not known to the authors, since it is not
   published in the annual radioecological reports. Cesium, being a
   chemical analogue of potassium, behaves in the body of fish similarly to
   this biogenic element. The main deposits of cesium are found in fish
   muscles. When balancing the intensity of consumption and excretion of
   radiocesium, its content in the tissues of sedentary individuals reaches
   a stationary level, which we observed in September-November.
   The results of the work show that fish isolated from the general sample
   on the basis of a smaller number of sclerites in the second annual ring
   can indeed be considered migrants from tributaries. The approach we used
   reveals predominantly immature and first maturing individuals settling
   from tributaries, but is unsuitable for identifying sexually mature fish
   that carry out short-term intra-river migrations. In the thermally
   altered section of the Yenisei in the downstream of the HPP, tributaries
   can still make a significant contribution to the grayling population. In
   the area of the mouth of the Kan River, one of the largest tributaries
   of the middle Yenisei, the percent of migrants in the summer-autumn
   period of 2019 was about 20\% of the total grayling population. The need
   to separate sedentary and migratory individuals is important for
   obtaining homogeneous samples of grayling, which is traditionally used
   as a model object in analyzing the distribution of technogenic
   pollutants in the river, as well as for studying the nutritional value
   of grayling and environmental risks for the population associated with
   its consumption.},

Title = {The effect of cadaverine on redox homeostasis of wheat seedling roots
   and their resistance to damage heating},

Abstract = {Polyamines are plant metabolites involved in many processes under
   physiologically normal and stressful conditions. Cadaverine is one of
   the least studied plant polyamines. The relationship between its
   physiological effects and the formation of signaling mediators, in
   particular, reactive oxygen species (ROS), has hardly been specially
   studied. The aim of this work was to study the possible protective
   effect of cadaverine on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings under
   heat stress and its relationship with the formation and detoxification
   of ROS by antioxidant enzymes. Etiolated seedlings of soft winter wheat
   variety Doskonala were used in the work. We treated three-day-old
   seedlings with cadaverine at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 mM
   by adding it to the root incubation medium. In some variants of the
   experiment, we treated seedlings with a hydrogen peroxide scavenger
   dimethylthiourea (DMTU - 150 mu M), a diamine oxidase inhibitor
   aminogunidine (1 mM) or an inhibitor NADPH oxidase imidazole (10 mu M),
   as well as the indicated inhibitors in combination with cadaverine. The
   hydrogen peroxide content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were
   determined in the roots of seedlings a certain time after treatment with
   the studied compounds. One day after the treatment of seedlings with
   cadaverine, ROS antagonists, and a combination of effectors, the
   seedlings were subjected to damaging heating in a water thermostat (10
   min at 45 degrees C). 24 h after heating, we assessed the content of the
   products of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the roots and, after 3 days, the
   survival of seedlings.
   Incubation in the presence of cadaverine increased the resistance of
   seedlings to damaging heat (See Fig. 1). The highest relative number of
   surviving seedlings was observed in the variant with 1 mM cadaverine
   treatment. Under the effect of cadaverine, the content of hydrogen
   peroxide in the roots increased (See Fig. 2). We observed a noticeable
   effect 1-4 h after the start of treatment, with a maximum after 2 h.
   Treatment of seedlings with a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide DMTU
   removed the manifestation of the effect of an increase in the content of
   H2O2 in the roots caused by the action of cadaverine (See Fig. 3). This
   effect was also completely eliminated by the diamine oxidase inhibitor
   aminoguanidine and was almost unchanged in the presence of the NADPH
   oxidase inhibitor imidazole. The effect of heat stress on seedlings
   caused an increase in the content of the LPO products in them. Treatment
   with cadaverine markedly reduced this manifestation of oxidative stress.
   The antioxidant DMTU and the diamine oxidase inhibitor aminoguanidine
   largely neutralized the protective effect of cadaverine (See Fig. 4a).
   At the same time, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor imidazole had almost no
   effect on the manifestation of the effect of cadaverine on the LPO
   products content in roots. Under the influence of DMTU and
   aminoguanidine, but not imidazole, the positive effect of cadaverine on
   the survival of seedlings after damaging heating was also leveled out
   (See Fig. 4b). The treatment of seedlings with cadaverine caused a
   change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the roots (superoxide
   dismutase - SOD, catalase, and guaiacol peroxidase) (See Fig. 5). DMTU
   and aminoguanidine neutralized the effect of cadaverine-induced increase
   in the activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase, but had almost no
   effect on the increase in SOD activity in roots induced by this diamine
   (See Fig. 6). The NADPH oxidase inhibitor imidazole did not
   significantly affect the manifestation of the effect of increasing the
   activity of antioxidant enzymes when seedlings are treated with
   cadaverine.
   We can conclude that one of the signaling mediators involved in the
   regulation activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase and in the
   induction of heat resistance of wheat seedlings by exogenous cadaverine
   is hydrogen peroxide, which is formed during the oxidation of cadaverine
   by diamine oxidase. At the same time, the modification of SOD activity
   in the roots of wheat seedlings with cadaverine, apparently, can occur
   without the participation of ROS.},

Abstract = {For hundreds of years, humans have been a soil formation factor. With
   the recent industrial development of vast territories, the formation of
   soils in technogenic and post-anthropogenic conditions requires more
   attention. This study reviews the literature on the soils of
   human-transformed or human-made landscapes (technogenic landscapes), in
   which soil formation starts on a new technogenic substrate. Such soils
   may occur in different bioclimatic conditions. We focused on processes
   that govern soil morphology and the subsequent transformation of these
   soils. Often, the soils of technogenic landscapes are characterized by
   high bulk density values and by the presence of dense contact. Their
   properties are affected mainly by organic matter accumulation (humus,
   litter; and peat). The paper also covers approaches to the reclamation
   of technogenic landscapes, the main stages, and partly the reclamation
   options. It is noted that the efficiency of reclamation activities
   depends on the available resources and timely decision-making. We
   assessed the efficiency of soil reclamation methods and suggested
   technogenic landscape survey techniques. The major approaches to soil
   classification in technogenic landscapes in national and international
   soil classification systems are briefly discussed, and an approximate
   correlation of soil names used in different systems is suggested. All
   considered classifications provide the opportunity to assess the soil
   properties and specifics of soil formation in technogenic landscapes.
   However; in most studies, the soil diagnostics are limited to top-order
   taxa only.},

Title = {Chromosome numbers of wormwoods (Artemisia L.) from Central Kazakhstan},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},
Number = {51},
Pages = {223-229},
Abstract = {The subgenus Seriphidium (Besser. ex Less.) Four., which includes more
   than 100 species, is one of the largest subgenera within the genus
   Artemisia L. (Asteraceae Bercht. et J. Presl.). The aim of this work was
   to study the chromosome numbers of some wormwoods species of the
   subgenus Seriphidium to clarify their systematic position.
   The paper presents the chromosome numbers of 4 species (Artemisia
   turanica (Krasch.) Poljakov, A. juncea Kar. et Kir., A. terrae-albae
   Krasch., and A. semiarida (Krasch. et Lavrenko) Filatova) of the
   subgenus Seriphidium. The materialobjects of the study was mature seeds
   collected during field survey (2013-2016) in the territory of Central
   Kazakhstan (Karaganda Region, Ulytau District, Sarysu River valley,
   wormwood and hawthorn semi-desert) with 10 specimens of each species
   close in age. This study compares the literature data with the authors'
   results of chromosome numbers. During the study, the chromosome numbers
   were determined for the first time for 2 wormwood species in the
   Kazakhstan population: A. juncea (2n=18) and A. turanica (2n=18). The
   obtained results show the homogeneity within the population of these
   species in the territory of Central Asia since for the Uzbekistan
   population, according to the data of Valles et al., A. turanica and A.
   juncea also have a diploid set of chromosomes. To clarify the systematic
   position and identify the intraspecific polymorphism of A. terrae-albae
   and A. semiarida, the morphological variability, geographical
   distribution, and chromosome numbers of these species were studied.
   Diploid and tetraploid sets of chromosomes were found in these species.
   The A. semiarida population has an exclusively diploid set of
   chromosomes (2n=18). According to the literature data for A.
   terrae-albae, a diploid set of chromosomes is given, but along with
   diploid individuals in the same region, we also found populations with
   tetraploid individuals (2n=36). The study of the morphological
   differences of these species made it possible to reveal that they differ
   only in quantitative traits (plant height, size of leaves and lateral
   branches) which depend on weather conditions. In years with a relatively
   high amount of precipitation, plants develop rather quickly, reaching
   larger sizes. The endemic species of Central Kazakhstan A. semiarida has
   an area that coincides with the area of A. terrae-albae. Populations of
   these species often grow together.
   Thus, the study of the morphological variability, chromosome numbers,
   and geographical distribution of these species made it possible to
   change the status of A. semiarida and consider it as a variety of the
   more widespread species A. terrae-albae, which can be represented by
   both diploid and tetraploid species.},

Title = {Vaccinium myrtillus L. in Kirov region (southern taiga subzone):
   phytocoenotic confinement and ecological preferences},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {53},
Pages = {68-88},
Abstract = {Vaccinium myrtillus L. is an important component for forming
   phyto-environment in boreal forest ecosystems, in which it develops
   various consortium connections. Being a mycorrhizal species, V.
   myrtillus improves nutrition and stimulates the growth of plants of all
   layers, supporting inter- and intra-specific connections of different
   layers of forest communities. In order to estimate the
   environment-forming role of V. myrtillus in ecosystems it is essential
   to acquire data on quantitative presence of the species in plant
   communities composition and on ecological-phytocoenotic peculiarities
   within its range. The aim of the study is to define phytocoenotic
   parameters and ecological conditions of V. myrtillus habitats within the
   southern taiga part of its range (Kirov region).
   We collected the material during the growing seasons of 2009-2015 and
   made 110 geobotanical descriptions according to common geobotanical
   methods (Methods of studies., 2002). Ecological conditions were
   estimated based on species compositions in communities using 10
   ecological scales by Dmitry Tsyganov (1983). The ecological discomfort
   index was determined for each habitat (Klimenko, 2012). Common methods
   of soil analyses were used for different biotopes of the studied species
   (Arinushkina, 1962). Hemeroby was determined by the species composition
   in plant communities, in which every species has individual human impact
   tolerance spectre (Frank and Klotz, 1990).
   V. myrtillus acts as a dominant or codominant of the herbaceous-shrub
   synfolium of boreal coniferous and mixed forest communities with 30-70\%
   cover. It is accompanied by the following species: Vaccinium vitis-idaea
   L., Rubus saxatilis L., Juncus filiformis L., Calamagrostis epigeios
   (L.) Roth., Thelypteris palustris Schot, Melampyrum sylvaticum L., and
   Majanthemum bifolium (L.) F. Schmidt. The species is found on gley and
   gleyic podzolic soils, mostly sabulous, rarely-sandy; and on peaty-gley
   and sod-podzolic soils (See Table 1). Bilberry is common on high acidity
   soils with pH varying from 2.54 to 4.93. The concentration of organic
   carbon in bilberry forest litter varies from 5.71 to 69.2\% (See Fig.
   1).
   V. myrtillus is a mesobiont species whose average ecologic valency
   coefficient reaches 55\%. In the investigated coenopopulations, the
   species achieves 8.15 to 50.10\% of its potential capabilities regarding
   the studied factors. V. myrtillus is a hemieurybiont by climatic factors
   (0.58 points). It achieves its maximum on ombroclimatic scale (44.5\%).
   According to climatic scales, ecological conditions of the studied
   habitats occupy the central position of all possible. The generalized
   spectrum of soil scales shows the species as a mesobiont (It-0.45). This
   allows widening V. myrtillus soil humidity scale 1.27 point left and
   soil moisture variability scale 0.80 points right. On other scales, the
   environmental position of the studied coenopopulations are within the
   data given by Dmitry Tsyganov for the species (See Table 2 and Fig. 2).
   The discomfort index is also given to estimate habitat ecological
   conditions. Based on phytoindication data and according to the
   discomfort index, we defined that the most favorable conditions of
   edapho- and climatopes for V. myrtillus are formed in sphagnum
   phytocoenoses. The least favorable conditions were noted in bilberry
   pine and bilberry-pleurocarpous moss pine-spruce forest types.
   The study of hemeroby showed that oligo-mesohemerob species (highly
   sensitive to anthropogenic factors) prevail in all V. myrtillus
   coenopopulations, i.e. 41\%. A-hemerob, a-euhemerob and polyhemerob
   species were not noted in any of the studied CPs (See Table 3 and Fig.
   3). This proves that the species is of low resistance to anthropogenic
   influence and can survive moderate intensity human impact. The studied
   plant communities with V. myrtillus are low-hemerobic. The paper
   contains 3 Figures, 3 Tables and 46 References.},

Title = {Features of Cd and Ni accumulation by Larix sukaczewii Dyl. under
   technogenesis},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {In industrially developed cities, sanitary-protective afforestation
   promotes the deposition of aeropollutants, as well as the absorption of
   toxicants from the soil. However, performing a function of a phytofilter
   for a long time negatively affects the vitality of the trees themselves.
   Among numerous pollutants of technogenic origin, the most toxic for
   living organisms, including plants, are heavy metals. Studying the
   absorption capacity of different species of woody plants and their
   reaction to increased concentrations of toxicants allows us to predict
   the stability of protective forest stands and design forestry measures.
   One of the species, widely used in creating sanitary protection zones in
   the Republic of Bashkortostan, is Larix sukaczewii Dyl., characterized
   by its resistance to extreme environmental factors. The adaptive
   abilities of this species to an increased content of heavy metals remain
   poorly studied. The aim of this study is to identify the features of the
   accumulation and distribution of heavy metals (Cd and Ni) by Larix
   sukaczewii and assess the relative living condition of the stand in
   Sterlitamak industrial center.
   We conducted studies in 2007-2018 in the city of Sterlitamak (53 degrees
   38'00 `' N, 55 degrees 57'00 `' E), a major center of the chemical and
   oil refining industry of the Russian Federation. The establishment and
   description of trial plots was carried out according to generally
   accepted methods {[}Andreeva EN et al., 2002; Forest ecology..., 2007].
   Permanent trial plot No. 1 measuring 20x50 m was located 1-2 km from
   sources of petrochemical and chemical pollution (See Fig. 1). Permanent
   trial plot No. 2 measuring 18x50 m was located in the area of
   conditional control (25-30 km from pollution sources). Trial areas were
   laid in coeval (about 55 years) and clean tree stands (See Table 1). The
   category of the vital state of an individual tree was determined by the
   auxiliary table (See Table 2). After summing up the number of trees by
   categories, we assessed the relative living conditions of the entire
   stand {[}Alekseev VA, 1990]. At a rate of 100\% to 80\%, the stand was
   assessed as ``healthy{''}, at 79-50\% as ``weakened{''}, at 49-20\% as
   ``strongly weakened{''}, and at 19\% and below as ``completely
   destroyed{''}. The study of the soil saturation with absorbing roots was
   carried out by the method of soil sections 1x1x1 m in size {[}Root
   Methods, 2000]. The roots were sorted by fractions: less than 1 mm in
   diameter (absorbing roots), 1-3 min (half-skeletal roots), and more than
   3 min (skeletal roots). We determined the weight of the roots in the
   air-dry state. To study the metal content, annually during the growing
   season, we performed repeated re-selection of needles, branches and
   roots. At the same time, we took soil samples from the depth of 0-20 cm.
   The samples were dried to an air-dry state and analyzed on a
   ``ZEEnit-650{''} atomic absorption spectrometer (Germany) {[}Hill SJ,
   Fisher AS, 2017]. In soil samples, we determined gross and mobile forms
   of metals. Data are presented as arithmetic mean +/- standard deviation
   (M +/- SD). Differences were considered statistically significant at p <
   0.05.
   We found that at the permanent trial plot No. 1, the trees are more
   weakened in comparison to the conditional control. External signs of
   oppression were expressed in a crown density decrease to 75-80\%, an
   increase in the number of dead branches to 25-30\%, and damage to the
   assimilation apparatus by chlorosis and necrosis (on average by 15\%).
   Trees classified as ``weakened{''} accounted for 55\% of the stand, and
   deadwood reached 10\%. The relative vital condition of the entire stand
   was characterized as ``weakened{''} (See Table 3). In the area of
   conditional control, the forest stand corresponded to the ``healthy{''}
   category. Moreover, the trees had a better formed crown (average density
   is 82\%) and fewer dead branches on the trunk (21\% on average). Needles
   damage by chlorosis was not more than 11\%. The results of chemical
   analysis of soil samples revealed statistically significant differences
   (p < 0.05) between the content of the metals in the zone of influence of
   the industrial center of Sterlitamak and in the area of conditional
   control (See Table 4). Higher concentrations of cadmium and nickel were
   found at the permanent trial plot No. 1. The leached chernozem prevailed
   in the soil cover. The pH of the soil according to many years of
   research ranged from 6.55-6.90 units. The bulk of the absorbing larch
   roots was located at a depth of 0-30 cm (See Fig. 2). Moreover, in the
   control area, the root saturation of the soil reached 78.51 +/- 4.10 g /
   m(2). In the influence zone of Sterlitamak industrial center, we
   observed a decrease in the proportion of absorbing roots: in healthy
   trees 2 times and in weakened trees 2-3 times. Perhaps, this is due to
   higher concentrations of metals in the surface of soil layer at a
   permanent trial plot No. 1, which led to a significant restructuring of
   the larch suction root apparatus. Chemical analysis of plant samples
   showed that in the contaminated area the content of cadmium in needles
   and branches is statistically significantly (p < 0.05) higher by 5-6
   times and that of nickel by 3-4 times. In underground organs, the
   content of elements in comparison to the conditional control increased
   2.5-4 times (p < 0.05). Besides, in the underground part, nickel is
   mainly accumulated in absorbing roots, and cadmium in absorbing and
   semi-skeletal ones (See Fig. 3 and 4). The movement of nickel from
   absorbing roots to conductive roots is less expressed than cadmium. In
   the aerial part of trees, the metal content in the branches is higher
   than in the needles (See Fig. 5 and 6). At the same time, in healthy
   trees, the barrier function of the root system is preserved, which
   prevents the excess intake of pollutants in the aboveground organs.
   Despite the fact that the relative vital condition of the stand at the
   contaminated site is characterized as ``weakened{''}, there is no
   decrease in the quality class. It is not required to carry out
   operational forestry activities in the sanitary-protective larch
   plantations. Timely sanitary felling and further monitoring are
   recommended.},

Title = {Patterns of the EEG theta rhythm modulations when attending to speech by
   orphans in early childhood},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {86-104},
Abstract = {The first years of a child's life are a critical period for the
   development of cognitive functions, in particular, a capacity for
   speech. Rearing conditions when applied to orphans may have an effect on
   neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their speech understanding,
   which is reflected in the EEG theta rhythm power changes. Individual
   theta rhythm frequency ranges are to be determined first, as they may
   vary for each child depending on age and individual characteristics of
   the central nervous system. The aim of our work was to analyze the EEG
   theta rhythm power reactivity in its individually determined frequency
   ranges when institutionally reared early-aged orphans attended to normal
   speech and speech-like signals, compared to their peers reared in their
   biological families.
   The study involved 107 children aged 24 to 42 months. The main group
   included 54 children (19 girls and 35 boys) brought up in the orphanage.
   The control group comprised 53 children (21 girls and 32 boys) reared by
   their biological parents. The EEG was recorded at frontal (F3, F4, F7,
   F8), central (C3, C4), temporal (T3, T4, T5, T6) and parietal (P3, P4)
   sites in three experimental conditions: in a wakeful rest state with
   open eyes (baseline EEG, duration 20-30 s); when listening to a normal
   speech (a verse with animal-characters, duration 20 s, female voice);
   when listening to the same speech reversed with the help of the Wave
   Editor software application (reversed speech). The order of presentation
   for the second and third conditions was randomized. To determine
   individual theta rhythm frequency bands, we calculated means of spectral
   density power, first log-transformed to help normalize distributions. To
   compare the EEG theta rhythm power reactivity when children in both
   groups attended to the normal and reversed speech stimuli relative to
   the baseline condition, power reactivity indices were calculated for
   each of the EEG sites. Significance of changes in the EEG theta rhythm
   power when attending to the normal or reversed speech relative to the
   baseline, as well as inter-group differences in reactivity indices, were
   assessed with the repeated measures ANOVA.
   The study revealed the patterns of the EEG theta rhythm power changes
   depending on experimental situations and EEG sites characteristic for
   children in both groups (See Table 1). We found ssignificant theta
   rhythm power changes yet of opposite directions for the control group
   under the normal speech condition. Theta rhythm power increased in the
   right frontal locus, the left anterior temporal locus and the parietal
   loci in both hemispheres, and decreased in the left frontal and
   posterior temporal loci and the right central and posterior loci (See
   Fig. 1, a). It seems plausible that the process of speech perception in
   typically developing children is associated both with searching one's
   memory for phonological, syntactic and semantic features in heard words
   and their integration into a holistic message, and with attentional
   processes, associated with increases and decreases in theta rhythm power
   in different areas of the cerebral cortex. Compared to normal speech,
   presentation of a reversed signal to the control group children caused a
   more pronounced and widespread theta activity growth in different cortex
   areas. This phenomenon is likely to be associated with an increase in
   load on memory when children tried to recognize familiar words in a
   reversed audio signal. In the group of institution-reared children, when
   they attended both to the normal and reversed speech stimuli,
   significant changes in theta rhythm power were found at fewer sites
   compared to the control group children. When they attended to the normal
   speech, a significant power increase occurred only at the right
   posterior temporal site. When attending to the reversed signal, theta
   rhythm power increased in the frontal (F3, F8) and posterior temporal
   (T5, T6) loci (See Fig. 1, b). We found differences in theta rhythm
   reactivity indices under conditions of attending to the normal and
   reversed speech in children as depending on group and site factors (See
   Table 2). Theta rhythm reactivity when attending to the normal and
   reversed speech in the main group compared to the control revealed a
   large number of significant differences at different sites (See Fig. 2).
   It is suggested that when recognizing or trying to recognize individual
   words, meaning and emotional load in sentences, institutionally reared
   children tend to contribute considerably less cognitive resources than
   family-reared children. We consider the reduced orphans'capacity to
   engage cognitive resources in mentioned situations to be the result of
   insufficient experience of close social interactions with adults. Given
   the established association between theta oscillations and memory
   processes, we can assume that speech memory traces in children belonging
   to the studied groups are represented differently in various neocortex
   areas due to a different experience of their formation when raised in
   the family and the orphanage.},

Title = {Mortality of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamark, 1819)
   depending on sex},

Abstract = {The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is one of the most popular species
   forcultivation globally and is one of the most abundant mollusc species
   in the Black Sea. In recent decades, there have been changes in the sex
   structures of the Black Sea settlements of M. galloprovincialis,
   trending towards an increase in the number of males. However; data on
   the effects of male and female mortality on the sex ratio in the
   population of M. galloprovincialis are insufficient. Therefore, this
   study aimed to assess how sex impacts the mortality of M.
   galloprovincialis. Mussels with shell lengths of either 30 or 55 mm were
   selected during the mass spring spawning. A total of 580 specimens were
   collected for the study. The separation of molluscs by sex was performed
   individually for each specimen via temperature stimulation of spawning.
   Each mussel was labelled according to its sex. The mortality of the
   mussels was studied in natural and laboratory experiments. In the
   natural experiment, different-sized females and males were selected and
   placed in cages that were hung in polluted harbour water. After 6
   months, the number of dead mussels was recorded. In the laboratory
   experiment, sex-labelled mussels were placed in aquariums. The
   laboratory experiment was terminated after the death of 50\% of the
   mussels. The mortality of females was found to be significantly higher
   than that of males. In the natural experiment, the mortality of females
   compared to males in the 55 mm size group was 23\% higher and 18\%
   higher in the 30 mm size group. In the laboratory experiment, the
   mortality of females in both size groups was 16\% higher than that of
   males. Therefore, it was established that one of the reasons for the
   increase in the number of males in the settlements of M.
   galloprovincialis in the Black Sea is the higher mortality rate of
   females compared to males.},

Title = {The structure of tree stands and features of their phytomass
   accumulation on the steppified slopes of the Kraka Mountain massif
   (Southern Urals)},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Abstract = {Against the general background of an increase in global temperature and
   spatio-temporal rearrangements in the distribution of precipitations in
   the 20th century, there are significant changes in the structure and
   properties of terrestrial ecosystems at all levels of biosphere
   organization, while their carbon-depositing role is widely discussed in
   connection with an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   in the last century. In the massif of the Kraka mountains (South Urals),
   extrazonal mountain (petrophytic) steppes are located on the southern,
   highly insolated slopes of the ridges, where peculiar harsh conditions
   are formed that restrict the growth of woody plants. Due to climate
   change, forests are expanding to mountain steppes and their area is
   increasing. The aim of our research is to study the contemporary
   structure of tree stands and the features of their phytomass
   accumulation in the transition zone between the forest and mountain
   steppes on the slopes of the Kraka mountains (53 degrees 15' - 53
   degrees 50'N, 57 degrees 36' - 58 degrees 12'E), as well as to assess
   their changes in the last decades (See Fig. 1).
   In the massifs of the North and South Kraka mountains on the
   forest-mountain steppe ecotone, 8 altitudinal transects were installed,
   with division into levels depending on the crown density: the upper
   (first) - at the upper border of the sparse tree stands (groups of trees
   with crown density 0.05-0.1), middle (second) - at the upper border of
   open forests (crown density 0.2-0.3), lower (third) - at the upper
   border of closed forests (crown density 0.4-0.5). At the lower and
   middle altitudinal levels, 3 plots with a size of 20 X 20 m were
   installed. At the upper level, polygons were set up in the form of a
   rectangle with a size of 1-3 hectares. On Bashart Mount, a polygon
   profile was installed, without division into levels due to the mosaic
   distribution of trees along the entire profile. For each tree, the
   following parameters were determined: height, trunk diameter at the base
   and at a height of 1.3 m, crown projection diameter in two directions,
   and vital state. To determine the age of trees with a diameter of more
   than 3 cm, a bored wood sample (core) was taken. The age was determined
   using standard dendrochronological methods. The data on the phytomass of
   16 model pine trees and 12 larch trees were obtained with subdivision
   into the following fractions: phytomass of the trunk, branches, needles
   and generative organs. The trunk phytomass in the bark was determined by
   direct weighing in the field with an accuracy of 50 g, for which the
   trunk was cut into meter sections. The percentage of dry matter, both in
   the wood and in the bark, is determined by the discs cut from the ends
   of the sawn sections. Wood and bark from the discs were weighed with an
   accuracy of 0.1 g at the site, and then they were sent to the laboratory
   for further drying and determination of their weight in an absolutely
   dry state. When determining the phytomass of the crown and its
   structural parts, all branches from the trunk were chopped off. The
   total weight of the crown was determined by direct weighing at the site
   in the field, after which the crown was divided into parts covered with
   needles and without them, and they were weighed separately. A sample of
   up to 20-30\% of the total weight was taken. The needles in the sample
   were separated from the branches and weighed. To determine the
   absolutely dry matter, a sample weighing 30-60 g was taken from each
   crown fraction for subsequent drying to an absolutely dry state in
   laboratory conditions.
   The assessment of the scale of changes in the area of treeless
   territories on the slopes of the Kraka mountain ranges was carried out
   using the functionality of the SAS.Planet 160707 program. Using the
   ``tools{''} from the ``Tags{''} tab, on the basis of the images in the
   layers of modem (2015) satellite images of sub-meter resolution and maps
   (similar to 1986) of the GosGisCentre (M 1: 25000), all non-forested
   areas were identified where the forest stands below 35-40\%. For each
   treeless territory, its area was estimated in 1986 and 2016.
   Comparative characteristics of the habitat within the ecotone between
   closed forests and the mountain steppe and the patterns of changes in
   the morphometric parameters of tree stands at different altitude levels
   on the slopes of the South Kraka massif showed that the trunk diameter,
   height and age of trees increase from the lower to the upper level. At
   the upper level, single, old-growth, strongly intermittent trees are
   most often found. Down the slope, the number of trees at the middle
   level increases 15 times, and 40 times at the lower level. At the same
   time, the average age and diameter of trees decrease, while the height
   increases. In the North Kraka, the average values of the diameter,
   height and age, on the contrary, decrease from the lower to the upper
   level. Here the number and the average age of trees are significantly
   lower than in the South Kraka, especially at the upper levels (See Table
   2).
   On the basis of the set of model trees of Scots pine and Sukachev larch,
   we studied the dependences of the aboveground phytomass and fractional
   structure (trunk, crown, needles) between different parameters of trees.
   We developed regression equations for the total aboveground phytomass of
   trees, as well as of the trunk, crown and needles from the diameter at
   the base and the height of the trunk (See Fig. 2 and 3; Table 4). On the
   basis of the equations, the reserves of aboveground phytomass were
   calculated for all altitudinal levels of the studied transects, and
   separately for the South and North Kraka mountains. The revealed
   features of the accumulation of phytomass of various fractions of trees
   and their ratio depend on the altitudinal position in the ecotone, the
   age and tree species.
   We found out that the total aboveground phytomass of stands at the upper
   border of closed forests on average for all profiles in the South Kraka
   is 72.9 ton /ha and ranges from 45.4 to 106 ton /ha. When moving to the
   upper border of open forests, it decreases 1.8 times and averages 40.1
   ton / ha (37.7-42.4 ton / ha). Towards the border of sparse tree stands,
   the aboveground phytomass of stands is reduced by almost 16 times - to
   4.4 ton/ ha (2.4-7.4 ton / ha). In the North Kraka mountain massif, the
   aboveground phytomass of stands at the border of closed forest and open
   woodlands is significantly higher than in the Southern Kraka, averaging
   98.7 and 42.1 ton / ha, respectively, with a 2.3-time decrease in
   phytomass. In the sparse tree stands, on the contrary, the phytomass of
   stands is lower than in the South Kraka, averaging 1.69 ton / ha across
   all transects, which is almost 60 times less than at the third
   altitudinal level (Table 5).
   Analysis of climate change over the past 80 years showed that in the
   study area there was a 1.3 degrees C increase in air temperature and an
   increase in precipitations by 41 mm, which are most pronounced during
   the cold season. Climate change had a favorable effect on the growth of
   woody plants, which led to an active overgrowth of mountain steppes with
   forests, as well as an increase in the density of woodlands. Over the
   past 30 years, there has been a decrease in the total area of treeless
   territories on the slopes of the mountains in the Kraka massif by more
   than 2 thousand hectares (17.6\%).
   The overgrowth of mountain steppes with woody vegetation in the Kraka
   mountains led to an increase in the area of forests and the stock of
   phytomass concentrated in them equals to 92.3 thousand tons. This is
   equivalent to the long-term binding of appoximately 42.6 thousand tons
   of free carbon of the Earth's atmosphere.},

Title = {Influence of multiple deficiency of vitamins, calcium, magnesium and
   iodine on cognitive function in growing rats},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Due to the prevalence of multiple deficiency of vitamins and some
   minerals among the population, as well as the role of micronutrients in
   maintaining cognitive functions, the aim of the research was to study
   the effect of combined deficit of vitamins and/or calcium, magnesium and
   iodine in the diet of growing Wistar male weaning rats on the
   manifestation of an unconditioned reflex and ability to learn in
   response to an electric shock.
   Mice for the experiment were obtained from Stolbovaya nursery, Federal
   State Budgetory Scientific Institution Scientific Center of Biomedical
   Technologies of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency (Moscow region,
   Russia). After a 5-day feeding on a complete semi-synthetic diet, rats
   with an initial body weight of 51.4 +/- 0.5 g were randomly (according
   to body weight and the results of the ``Elevated Plus Maze{''} test)
   divided into four groups (10-12 animals in each group). Subsequently,
   within 23 days, the animals of the control group (I) received a complete
   semi-synthetic diet, the rats of Group II (- Ca, Mg, I) were fed on the
   same diet, but with a 50\% reduction in the amount of calcium, magnesium
   and iodine in the mineral mixture, the rats of Group III (- Vit)
   received a diet containing 100\% of minerals with a reduced amount of
   vitamin mixture up to 20\% with the complete elimination of vitamin E
   from it. The animals of Group IV (- Vit, Ca, Mg, I) were kept on a diet
   simultaneously deficient in vitamins and mineral substances. The
   manifestation of the unconditioned reflex was studied in the ``Elevated
   plus maze{''} test before feeding the animals on experimental diets and
   on the 21st day of feeding. The behavior and memory of animals were
   evaluated in the test ``Conditioned reflex of passive avoidance{''} on
   the 7th day of feeding on experimental diets in response to
   electrocutaneous irritation of paws (current 0.4 mA, not more than 8
   sec.) when entering the dark compartment (development of a conditioned
   reflex), on the 8th day a test of training (a memorable trace), and on
   the 21st day - an assessment of longterm memory. Pre-anesthetized with
   ether, the rats were taken out of the experiment by decapitation, and
   the content of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) was determined by HPLC,
   vitamins B-1 and B-2 were measured fluorimetrically in the whole
   lyophilized brain.
   In this research, we revealed, that throughout the experiment, the
   general condition of all animals (appearance and fur) and the body
   weight did not differ. Reducing the content of vitamins in the diet led
   to a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the brain content of
   selectively measured vitamins B-1 and E at the end of the experiment
   (See Table 1), that indicated the development of micronutrient
   deficiency in them. Micronutrient deficiencies for 21 days did not
   affect the degree of anxiety of the growing rats, assessed in the
   ``Elevated Plus Maze{''} test. However, the rats from the groups
   deficient in vitamins (group - Vit and group - Vit, Ca, Mg and I) had a
   higher motor activity than the animals of the control group and the
   animals fed on a diet deficient in calcium, magnesium and iodine (group
   - Ca, Mg and I), which significantly less moved through the maze (See
   Table 2). In this research, we found out that on the 7th day of the
   development of micronutrient deficiency in rats the reproduction of the
   unconditioned reflex (photophobia) worsened (See Fig. 1). In the rats
   with vitamin deficiency (group - Vit), the time spent in the open
   compartments increased 3.0 times compared to the control, whereas in the
   rats with mineral deficiency (group - Ca, Mg and I) and combined
   deficiency (group - Vit, Ca, Mg and I) it increased 1.85 and 1.95 times,
   correspondingly (p < 0.05), while no differences were detected when
   playing a conditioned reflex 24 hours after training (See Fig. 1). In
   this research, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in long-term memory
   have been discovered in the animals fed on a vitamin-deficient diet
   (group - Vit) and in the rats fed on a diet with simultaneously reduced
   levels of vitamins, calcium, magnesium and iodine (group - Vit, Ca, Mg
   and I). On the basis of the latent time of entry into the dark
   compartment after 24 hours and 2 weeks, we established that the memory
   deterioration was due to a decrease in the vitamin content in the diet,
   whereas the deficit of mineral substances did not affect these
   parameters (See Fig. 2). In this research, we revealed that multivitamin
   deficiency in rats exerted an amnestic effect and made a major
   contribution to impaired learning and long-term memory. This findings
   suggest the importance of adequate provision of the organism with all
   vitamins and mineral substances to maintain cognitive functions and
   memory.},

Title = {Distribution, population status and protection of rare ephemeroids in
   the Komi Republic},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {53},
Pages = {89-108},
Abstract = {Here, we report the data on modern state and protection prospects of
   plant species Anemone altaica Fisch. ex C.A.Mey., Anemone nemorosa L.,
   Anemone ranunculoides L., Ficaria verna Huds. (Ranunculaceae), Corydalis
   solida (L.) Clairv. (Papaveraceae) and Gagea samojedorum Grossh.
   (Liliaceae) in the taiga zone of the Komi Republic. These ephemeroid
   species require a special research due to their biological features
   (short periods of vegetation in the spring and subtle presence in
   communities at later dates) and geographic localization. One of the
   species, Gagea samojedorum is an endemic of the Urals, other species are
   presented by populations on the border of their distribution areas.
   Until recently, studies of early-flowering ephemeroids in the north-east
   Russia have not been performed. However, such studies become more and
   more important due to an active industrial development of the North.
   To assess the prospects for the conservation of rare early-flowering
   ephemeroids, we carried out work to clarify the number of locations of
   species on the territory of the Komi Republic, compiled maps of their
   distribution (See Fig. 1), collected and summarized information about
   the area, the number and the structure of 44 coenopopulations (See
   Tables 1 and 2), as well as identified limiting factors. It is shown
   that at the edge of the distribution area, ephemeroid species often have
   fragmented habitat range due to ecological and phytocoenotical
   preferences. They occur sporadically in the river and stream floodplains
   (sometimes at limestones) where soils are moist and fertile. In the
   floodplain meadows and forests, ephemeroids can form one-two species
   ecotopical assemblages. The populations of ephemeroids are linear, often
   with a high number of individuals. Self-recovering of short-root Anemone
   altaica, A. nemorosa, A. ranunculoides and root-tuber Ficaria verna is
   made, mainly, by vegetative reproduction. Tuber species Corydalis solida
   is propagated only by seeds. The ontogenetic structure of populations
   indicates a decline in seed and vegetative reproduction rate in these
   species at the edges of distribution areas (See Fig. 2 and 3). The Ural
   endemic Gagea samojedorum occurs in herbal habitats and sparse forests
   in foothill and mountain areas of the Ural Mountains, where it forms
   abundant populations with the prevalence of young individuals. A high
   reproduction rate of Gagea samojedorum is due to the variability of
   vegetative reproduction.
   In the Komi Republic, the anthropogenic impact on the ephemeroid species
   is low due to a low level of industrial development and population.
   Natural abiotic and biotic factors are more significant here and may
   weaken species positions in plant communities, as well as limit the
   growth, development and self-recovering of the populations. By now,
   Anemone altaica, A. nemorosa, A. ranunculoides, Corydalis solida,
   Ficaria verna and Gagea samojedorum have been included in regional Red
   Books of plants with the protection category 3 (rare). The main reasons
   for their inclusion are the edge location, small number, isolation of
   the local populations and often relic origin. Gagea samojedorum is also
   an endemic species. The object of the UNESCO World Heritage List
   ``Virgin Komi Forests{''} and the number of regional reserves are
   important for the preservation of ephemeroid plants in the North. The
   paper contains 3 Figures, 2 Tables and 44 References.},

Title = {Ulmus japonica (Ulmaceae) communities in Western Transbaikalia:
   Distribution, value for biodiversity conservation and perspectives of
   protection},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {105-129},
Abstract = {The East Asian tree Ulmus japonica (Rehder) Sarg. is a nemoral relict
   species for Western Transbaikalia (See Fig. 1). A few localities of this
   tree are known in the region, those in the lower reaches of the Selenga
   River (Yugovo site; Republic of Buryatia) and the Chikoy River (Zhindo
   site; Zabaikalskii Krai), remote from the main distribution area (See
   Fig. 2). The study aimed to verify the distribution of U. japonica and
   to estimate the value of U. japonica communities for biodiversity
   conservation in the region. Based on the data collected, we discussed
   some opportunities and suggested approaches for the protection of these
   unique ecosystems. During the fieldwork in 2018 and 2019, we studied all
   known localities of U. japonica in Western Transbaikalia and revealed a
   pleiad of new locations within the site Yugovo as well as a new location
   (the site Murochi) in the Chikoy River valley within the Republic of
   Buryatia (See Fig. 2 and 3). Information on the occurrence of U.
   japonica in the vicinity of Podlopatki village (in the Khilok River
   valley) was not confirmed. Also, our attempts to find this species at
   the site within the Barguzin River valley according to the label of the
   existing herbarium specimen failed. Based on 93 releves, we examined
   species composition in woodlands where U. japonica is a codominant
   species and revealed the main features and peculiarities of the
   communities in the region.
   At all sites, monodominant coppices of U. japonica and coenoses where it
   is mixed with Padus avium Mill. occurred. Nevertheless, Ulmus japonica
   communities from the site Yugovo differ from those of Zhindo and Murochi
   in a greater phytocoenotic diversity and the composition of
   characteristic plant species. Additionally, at Yugovo rather
   xeromesophytic sparse communities where U. japonica is mixed with Pinus
   sylvestris L. and Betula platyphylla Sukaczev were found. Characteristic
   species of shrub and herbal layers at Yugovo site are Carex arnellii
   Christ ex Scheutz, Circaea lutetiana L., Elymus pendulinus (Nevski)
   Tzvelev, Festuca extremiorientalis Ohwi, Filipendula palmata (Pall.)
   Maxim., Hesperis sibirica L., Lamium album subsp. orientale Kamelin \&
   A.L. Budantzev, whereas at Zhindo and Murochi they are Anemonidium
   dichotomum (L.) Holub, Carex sordida Van Heurck \& Mull. Arg,
   Menispermum dauricum DC., Rhamnus davurica Pall., and Rubia cordifolia
   L. According to our studies supplemented with data from the literature
   sources, there are 16 species of vascular plants, lichens, beetles, and
   lepidopterans registered in Ulmus japonicaforests that are included in
   the Federal and/or in regional Red Data Books (See Table 1). We have
   revealed 31 additional rare and relict species of plants, fungi and
   insects (See Table 2). In total, 19 species were found in Western
   Transbaikalia or within this plant community type for the first time.
   The newly revealed rare and relict species could be recommended for
   listing in the regional Red Data Book or inclusion in the list of
   species of special surveillance. As a perspective of the protection of
   communities with U. japonica, we propose to maintain them as distinct
   clusters under the management of the existing protected areas. Namely,
   the site Yugovo can be protected as a separate cluster of the Baikal
   Natural Reserve, likewise, the protection of the site Zhindo can be
   managed by the Chikoy National Park. The newly discovered site Murochi
   might be included in the preliminarily proposed Russian-Mongolian
   trans-boundary Selenga protected area.

Title = {Cenopopulation structure of the key species in Siberian Pine

Abstract = {Understanding of the key species coenopopulations structure of
   late-successional forest communities serve as a model of the forest
   ecosystems state and stability in the organization of sustainable forest
   management and conservation of biological diversity. The ontogenetic and
   age structures of cenopopulations of the key species, Pinus sibirica
   DuTour and Abies sibirica Ledeb., were studied in a climax S Siberian
   pine forest with Vaccinium myrtillus L. and green hypnum mosses (the
   most common forest type among taiga forests of the East Sayan
   mountains). The permanent sample plot (50x50 m) was located in the
   northeastern part of the Idarskoe Belogorye ridge of the East Sayan in
   the middle part of a westerly slope with a steepness of 2 degrees, at an
   elevation of 1000 m a.s.l. (54 degrees 44'N, 96 degrees 07'E). The
   forest stand had low productivity (quality class V), high closeness of
   crowns (about 1.0) and mixed composition with predominance of P.
   sibirica, which are characteristic of the mountain-taiga cedar forests
   of the Eastern Sayan (See Table.). We performed general geobotanical
   description, measurement of size and age, assessment of ontogenetic and
   sanitary states of each tree, as well as assessment of reforestation on
   the sample plot.
   P. sibirica coenopopopulation had a wide age amplitude (from 1 to 200
   years) and absolutely uneven-aged structure, mass reforestation (more
   than 3000 ind./ha), large sizes of mature individuals (maximum diameter
   - 58 cm, height - 21.3 m), predominance of the number (70\% of the total
   density of the forest stand) and timber stock (95\%). The ontogenetic
   structure of P. sibirica cenopopulation was characterized by a normal
   state (See Fig. 1 and 2) with a sharp peak of the distribution and
   distinct left-handed skewness (coefficient of asymmetry - 2.0; kurtosis
   - 4.1). This corresponds with the concept of consistent
   self-reproduction and stability of forest ecosystems. A. sibirica was
   inferior in terms of the reforestation number (1575 ind./ha), life
   expectancy (up to 110 years) and the size of mature trees (maximum
   diameter - 22.7 cm, height 16 m). The ontogenetic structure of A.
   sibirica cenopopulation (See Fig. 1 and 3) is characterized by a
   complete spectrum and more distinct left-handed skewness.
   Thus, P. sibirica had a clearly expressed competitive population
   strategy. A. sibirica showed indications of phytocenotic tolerance. It
   is obvious that sustainable forest ecosystems in the absence of
   anthropogenic pressure in the mountain-taiga forest belt conditions is
   formed in the process of continuous change of P. sibirica age
   generations.

Title = {Spruce forests of the Koptu River valley (the Republic of Tuva) as a
   relict of Late Pleistocene vegetation},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {54},
Pages = {45-63},
Abstract = {Spruce forests of the Tuva Republic are not sufficiently described in
   literature. Spruce forests occupy small areas, but they are
   characterized by high species diversity. Enclaves of forest communities
   outside the forest belt are particularly interesting. The actual problem
   concerns species composition which forms plant communities existing
   under environmental and climate conditions that are not favorable for
   it. The aim of the research is to describe the communities of the valley
   dark coniferous forests in the model river valley in Central Tuva, to
   assess their diversity, to analyze species composition and to identify
   the main factors determining it.
   In the course of the fieldwork in 2020, we examined coniferous forests
   along the Koptu river, on the southern slope of the Academic Obruchev
   range (See Figures). In this part of the range, the foothills are
   occupied by steppe vegetation; forest-steppe landscapes prevail at
   altitudes of 800-1000 m; above there is the taiga belt, the upper border
   of the forest is about 1900 m above sea level. Two key areas were
   investigated; one of them is located in the middle course of the river
   within the taiga belt (51.90-51.92 degrees N; 95.45-95.48 degrees E,
   1400-1500 m above sea level), the other is in the lower course of the
   river in the forest-steppe belt (51.55-51.70 degrees N; 95.34-95.45
   degrees E, 700-900 m above sea level). In total, 11 releves were made on
   plots of 20 x20 m by the standard method.
   We established that the forests are rich in species: 98 taxa were
   registered (See Table). It could be expected that coniferous forests in
   the river valley within the forest-steppe belt are a continuation of the
   above located communities, a continuation of communities from the taiga
   belt. However, our materials have demonstrated that it is not so. We
   revealed that, despite the physiognomic similarity, the dark coniferous
   communities growing in the river valley in its lower course differ
   significantly from those growing within the taiga belt (See Table).
   Larix sibirica is abundant everywhere; but in the taiga belt Pinus
   sibirica dominates in the valley communities, and Picea obovata
   prevailes in the river valley in the forest-steppe belt. Apart from it,
   the communities of these two key sites differ significantly in their
   species composition. Analysis of the ecology of differentiating species
   shows that the difference is due to a complex of factors. Four groups of
   species can be distinguished in the investigated forests:
   I. Taiga species which are only encountered in forests of the upper part
   and are absent below (Aegopodium alpestre, Carex iljinii, Cerastium
   paucillorum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. uliginosum).
   II. Meadow species, symmetrically, only occur in the forests of the
   lower part and are absent in the taiga belt (Galium boreale, Lathyrus
   pratensis, Rubus saxatilis and Vicia cracca, Achillea asiatica, Adonis
   sibirica, Artemisia laciniata, Iris ruthenica).
   The two groups mentioned above reflect the difference in altitude as
   well as the influence of the zonal environment.
   III. A series of species in the downstream valley forests reflect a
   waterlogging process, which takes place there due to the altitudinal
   gradient declining and surface flattening (Angelica tenuifolia, Caltha
   palustris, Carex cespitosa, C. dioica, Equisetum scirpoides, Delphinium
   crassifolium, Galium uliginosum, Lathyrus palustris, Parnassia
   palustris, Ribes procumbens; among mosses - Calliergonella cuspidata,
   Helodium blandowii, Timmia megapolitana, Tomentypnum nitens).
   IV. A number of species with mainly taiga or Arctic-Alpine distribution
   were recorded only in larch-spruce forests in the river valley in the
   forest-steppe belt and they are absent in the forests of the upper key
   area (Carex alba, Bistorta vivipara, Carex sedakowii, Orthilia obtusata,
   Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum, Saussurea alpina, Schizachne callosa).
   For these species, it is impossible to explain their presence in the
   forest-steppe belt by modem ecological conditions. Their presence in the
   valley spruce forests has historical reasons and could be caused by the
   conditions of the Late Pleistocene cooling. So, we can draw a conclusion
   that the massif of valley spruce forests in the lower part of the Koptu
   river is a relict community formed in the Late Pleistocene periglacial
   environment on permafrost soils. In present conditions, it is in
   unstable equilibrium.
   The massif is the habitat of a number of rare species. In particular,
   the Orchidaceae taxa were found here, four of which are included in the
   Red Book of the Republic of Tuva (Cypripedium calceolus, Dactylorhiza
   sibirica, Epipogium aphyllum, Neottianthe cucullata). The valley forest
   of the lower part of the Koptu river can be nominated as a high
   conservation value forest and recommended to be included in the list of
   the Important Plant Areas of the Altai-Sayan region. The massif is under
   the strong anthropogenic pressure; in order to avoid extinction, it
   needs to be protected.},

Title = {Induction of somatic embryogenesis in Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) in
   in vitro culture},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Number = {54},
Pages = {6-20},
Abstract = {The biotechnology of somatic embryogenesis in in vitro culture is the
   most promising direction in the reproduction of conifers. The use of
   this technology makes it possible not only to massively propagate the
   best genotypes of trees, but also serves a model for studying the
   structural, physiological and molecular and genetic mechanisms of both
   somatic and zygotic embryogenesis in conifers. The main aim of this
   research was to obtain embryogenic cultures (ECs) producing somatic
   embryos and embryonic suspension mass (ESM) of Picea obovata.
   The studies were carried out in 2014-2019 on 30 Siberian spruce trees
   growing in the vicinity of the city of Krasnoyarsk. To detect genotypes
   competent for somatic embryogenesis, new donor trees were selected every
   year for the experiment. 3-10 cones were collected from each tree at
   different stages of embryo development: globular embryo (the first
   decade of July), the initiation stage cotyledons (second decade of
   July), the stage of developed cotyledons (third decade of July) and
   mature embryos (August). Sterilized explants (zygotic embryos at
   different stages of development) were introduced into in vitro culture
   on basic media DCR (Gupta PK and Durzan DJ, 1985), 1/2LN (Litvay JD et
   al., 1985), MS (Murashige T and Skoog F, 1962) and AI (Tretyakova IN,
   2012). All media were supplemented with myo-inositol - 100 mg/L, casein
   hydrolyzate - 500-1000 mg/L, L-glutamine - 500 mg/L, sucrose - 30 g/L
   and agar - 7 g/L. Ascorbic acid at a concentration of 400 mg/L was used
   as an antioxidant. The level of growth regulators was:
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) - 2 mg/L and N-6-benzoaminopurine
   (BAP) - 1 mg/L. For the proliferation of the ESM, DCR and AI basic media
   containing 2,4-D (2 mg/L), BAP (0.5 mg/L) and sucrose (20 g/L) were
   used. The pH was adjusted to pH = 5.8. All culture medium and components
   were sterilized depending on their termolabile properties. Under aseptic
   conditions, embryos were removed from megagametophytes and inoculated
   into nutrient media, 10 explants per flask in 25 replicates. The
   cultures were incubated in the dark at 24 +/- 1 degrees C.
   Subcultivation to fresh nutrient medium was carried out every 14 days.
   To control the quality of cell lines (CL) during subculturing, we
   performed cytological analyzes using temporary preparations (3-5
   preparations for each CL). We evaluated the quality of the
   embryogenicity of the cultures by the presence of even single structures
   with pronounced polarity - a globular embryo with a suspensor.
   The results of the study showed that the induction of callus cultures of
   Siberian spruce is influenced by such factors as the development stage
   of the explant, the nutrient medium and the genotype of the donor tree.
   The introduction of P. obovata immature zygotic embryos into in vitro
   culture at the stage of the globular embryo, both with megagametophytes
   and extracted from them, turned out to be ineffective. The induction of
   callus cultures in Siberian spruce was significantly reduced when mature
   zygotic embryos were introduced into the culture in vitro. The highest
   response of explants of Siberian spruce was at the stage of developed
   cotyledons (See Table 1). In the DCR medium, 90\% of explants formed
   callus (See Table 2). The mineral composition of the media did not
   significantly affect the induction of callus formation in Siberian
   spruce. The exception was the MS medium, in which callus cultures were
   formed only in 41\% of explants (See Table 2). The growth of callus
   cultures was most active in the DCR medium. After 6 months of
   cultivation, 15-32\% of calli remained viable (See Table 2). Cytological
   analysis of callus cultures showed that they include cells of different
   types (See Fig. 1 and 2). The first type of cells consisted of elongated
   cells reaching a length of 10 +/- 3 gm, others consisted of isodiametric
   cells with a diameter of 60 +/- 3.5 gm. The somatic embryo globule and
   embryonic tubes were formed from elongated cells. Isodiametric cells
   were actively dividing and forming callus. Only 3 cell lines (out of 300
   cell lines) belonging to two donor trees had an active ability to
   proliferate. Globular somatic embryos were actively forming in these
   cell lines (See Fig. 3). An actively proliferating ESM was formed.
   Thus, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of the factors
   influencing the induction of somatic embryogenesis in Siberian spruce.
   The results obtained indicate that for the successful formation of
   somatic embryos, the determining factor is not only the choice of donor
   plants, but also the development stage of the explant. We found that the
   best stage in the development of zygotic embryos when introduced into in
   vitro culture of Siberian spruce is the stage of immature embryos with
   formed cotyledons, while the DCR, 1/2LN and AI nutrient medium
   supplemented with growth regulators (2.4-D and BAP) is optimal.},

Abstract = {Objectives The little known guenon Cercopithecus dryas has a
   controversial taxonomic history with some recognizing two taxa (C. dryas
   and C. salongo) instead of one. New adult specimens from the TL2 region
   of the central Congo Basin allow further assessment of C. dryas
   morphology and, along with CT scans of the juvenile holotype, provide
   ontogenetically stable comparisons across all C. dryas and ``C.
   salongo{''} specimens for the first time.
   Materials and Methods The skins and skulls of two newly acquired C.
   dryas specimens, male YPM MAM 16890 and female YPM MAM 17066, were
   compared to previously described C. dryas and ``C. salongo{''}
   specimens, along with a broader guenon comparative sample (cranial
   sample n = 146, dental sample n = 102). Qualitative and quantitative
   assessments were made on the basis of commonly noted pelage features as
   well as craniodental characters in the form of shape ratios and
   multivariate discriminant analyses.
   Results All C. dryas specimens, including the TL2 adults, are
   comparatively small in overall cranial size, have relatively small
   I(1)s, and display tall molar cusps; these osteological characters,
   along with pelage features, are shared with known ``C. salongo{''}
   specimens. Discriminant analyses of dental features separate C.
   dryas/salongo specimens from all other guenons.
   Discussion In addition to pelage-based evidence, direct osteological
   evidence suggests ``C. salongo{''} is a junior synonym of C. dryas.
   Combined with molecular analyses suggesting C. dryas is most closely
   related to Chlorocebus spp., we emend the species diagnosis and support
   its transfer to Chlorocebus or possibly a new genus to reflect its
   distinctiveness.},

Title = {Adiposity and pathogen exposure: An investigation of response to iron
   supplementation and hypothesized predictors in anemic pre-school-aged
   children living in a dual burden environment},

Abstract = {Objectives Peruvians are experiencing rapid dietary and lifestyle
   changes, resulting in a phenomenon known as the ``dual burden of
   disease.{''} A common manifestation of the dual burden in individuals is
   the co-occurrence of overweight and anemia. Despite recent initiatives
   introduced to address these concerns, rates continue to be public health
   concerns. This study investigates the relationship between immune
   activation and lack of response to iron supplementation after 1 month of
   treatment and explores variation in body fat stores as a potential
   moderator between immune function and response to treatment.
   Methods Data come from children, aged 2-5 years (n = 50) from a
   peri-urban community in Lima, Peru. Multivariate logistic regression
   models were used to explore the associations between response to
   treatment (Hb > =11.0 g/dl) after 1 month of treatment), markers of
   immune activation (C-reactive protein {[}CRP] and reported morbidity
   symptoms), and measures of body fat (waist-to-height ratio, triceps
   skinfold thickness, and body mass index {[}BMI]).
   Results We found that high CRP is associated with a lack of response to
   iron supplementation after 1 month of treatment and that BMI z-score may
   moderate this association. Generally, larger body size is associated
   with response to iron supplementation whether or not the children in
   this sample have high immune activation. However, the probability of
   anemic children responding to iron supplementation treatment differed
   across adiposity measures.
   Conclusions Our finding suggesting that adiposity and CRP influence
   response to iron supplementation, furthers our understanding of the
   relationship between inflammation and anemia treatment in children and
   has both theoretical and public health implications.},

Abstract = {Objectives Stable isotope analysis can provide crucial insight into the
   function and development of early state-level societies on the north
   coast of Peru.
   Materials and Methods Multi-tissue (bone collagen, tooth enamel, hair,
   nail, skin, and tendon) stable isotope analyses (carbon, nitrogen,
   sulfur, and strontium) were conducted for 13 individuals from the lower
   Viru Valley.
   Results Non-seasonal changes in a predominantly C-4-based terrestrial
   diet, with minimal inputs of marine foods were identified. One
   individual (Burial 5), however, had a stable isotope signature unlike
   any previously found on the north coast of Peru, indicating both a large
   contribution of C-3-terrestrial resources to their diet and an
   Sr-87/Sr-86 value suggestive of highland residence during childhood.
   Discussion This research provides the first strong stable isotope
   evidence of a highland individual within a coastal burial in northern
   Peru, new insight into the ritual killing event at Huaca Santa Clara
   during the late middle horizon and supporting evidence of the importance
   of C-4 terrestrial resources to the developing Viru polity during the
   early intermediate period.},

Title = {Total body and regional surface area: Quantification with low-cost
   three-dimensional optical imaging systems},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {865-875},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Body surface area (SA) is a widely used physical measure
   incorporated into multiple thermophysiology and evolutionary biology
   models currently estimated in humans either with empirical prediction
   equations or costly whole-body laser imaging systems. The introduction
   of low-cost 3D scanners provides a new opportunity to quantify total
   body (TB) and regional SA, although a critical question prevails: can
   these devices acquire the quality of depth information and process this
   initial data to form a mesh that has the fidelity needed to generate
   accurate SA estimates?
   Materials and methods This question was answered by comparing SA
   estimates calculated using images from four commercial 3D scanners in
   108 adults to corresponding estimates acquired with a whole-body laser
   system. This was accomplished by processing initial mesh data from all
   devices, including the laser system, with the same universal software
   adapted specifically for repairing mesh gaps, identifying landmarks, and
   generating SA measurements.
   Results TB SA measured on all four 3D scanners was highly correlated
   with corresponding laser system estimates (R(2)s, 0.98-0.99; all p <
   0.001) with some small but significant mean differences (-0.19 to 0.06
   m(2)); root-mean square errors (RMSEs) were small (0.02-0.03 m(2)); and
   significant bias was present for one device. Qualitatively similar
   results (e.g., R(2)s, 0.78-0.95; mean Delta s, -0.05 to 0.02 m(2);
   RMSEs, 0.01-0.03 m(2)) were present for trunk, arm, and leg SA
   comparisons.
   Discussion The current study observations demonstrate that low-cost and
   practical 3D optical scanners are capable of accurately quantifying TB
   and regional SA, thus opening new opportunities for evaluating human
   phenotypes and related physiological characteristics.},

Title = {The effect of high wear diets on the relative pulp volume of the lower
   molars},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {804-811},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives One role of dental pulp is in the upkeep and maintenance of
   dentine. Under wear, odontoblasts in the pulp deposit tertiary dentine
   to ensure the sensitive internal dental tissues are not exposed and
   vulnerable to infection. It follows that there may be an adaptive
   advantage for increasing molar pulp volume in anthropoid primate taxa
   that are prone to high levels of wear. The relative volume of dental
   pulp is therefore predicted to covary with dietary abrasiveness (in the
   sense of including foods that cause high degrees of wear).
   Materials and Methods We examined relatively unworn lower second molars
   in pairs of species of extant hominoids, cebids, and pitheciids that
   vary in the abrasiveness of their diet (n = 36). Using micro-CT scans,
   we measured the percent of tooth that is pulp (PTP) as the ratio of pulp
   volume to that of the total volume of the tooth.
   Results We found that in each pair of species, the taxa that consume a
   more abrasive diet had a significantly higher PTP than the closely
   related taxa that consume a softer diet.
   Conclusions Our results point to an adaptive mechanism in the molars of
   taxa that consume abrasive diets and are thus subject to higher levels
   of wear. Our results provide additional understanding of the
   relationship between dental pulp and diet and may offer insight into the
   diet of extinct taxa such as Paranthropus boisei or into the adaptive
   context of the taurodont molars of Neanderthals.},

Title = {Female reproductive energetics in mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta
   palliata): A follow-up study},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {3},
Pages = {396-406},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: Reproduction entails several challenges to primate females,
   among which energetic costs are remarkable at certain stages of the
   reproductive cycle. Still, females may use behavioral and physiological
   strategies to cope with those challenges. We had previously reported
   covariation between female energetic condition through the reproductive
   cycle and time-budget adjustments in mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta
   palliata). Accordingly, we suggested that behavioral flexibility allowed
   coping with the energetic challenges of reproduction. Subsequent
   evidence from the same population, however, suggested otherwise, so we
   performed a follow-up study on the variation in female reproductive
   energetics based on a larger sample of females.
   Methods: We studied 48 free-ranging adult females at Los Tuxtlas
   (Mexico). We assessed energy balance via urinary C-peptide
   concentrations (2717 urine samples), behavioral energy intake and
   expenditure (5728 sampling hours), and physiological energy expenditure
   via fecal triiodothyronine metabolites (fTH3; 3138 fecal samples).
   Results: We found that energy balance varied among reproductive states:
   (a) cycling was a period of low C-peptide concentrations; (b) the
   highest C-peptide concentrations occurred during gestation; and (c) the
   beginning of lactation marked a notable decrease in C-peptide
   concentrations, which then improved at mid-lactation to again decline at
   lactation offset. These peaks and valleys in energy balance did not seem
   to be associated with variation in energy acquisition but were rather
   mirrored by activity levels and fTH3 during lactation.
   Discussion: Energy balance was not preserved through the reproductive
   cycle, supporting previous contentions that the reproductive performance
   of female mantled howler monkeys may be energetically constrained. The
   contrast between these and results that we have previously reported,
   highlights the importance of conducting follow-up studies to continually
   improve our understanding of the reproductive energetics of primate
   females.},

Abstract = {The mainstream of American physical anthropology began as racist and
   eugenical science that defended slavery, restricted ``non-Nordic{''}
   immigration, and justified Jim Crow segregation. After World War II, the
   field became more anti-racial than anti-racist. It has continued as a
   study of natural influences on human variation and thus continues to
   evade the social histories of inequitable biological variation. Also
   reflecting its occupancy of white space, biological anthropology
   continues to deny its own racist history and marginalizes the
   contributions of Blacks. Critical disciplinary history and a shift
   toward biocultural studies might begin an anti-racist human biology.},

Title = {Wild chimpanzee offspring exhibit adult-like foraging patterns around
   the age of weaning},

Abstract = {Objectives The prolonged juvenile period exhibited by primates is an
   evolutionary conundrum. Here we examine wild chimpanzee feeding
   development in the context of two hypotheses regarding prolonged
   development in primates: the needing-to-learn hypothesis and the
   expensive brain hypothesis.
   Material and Methods We studied wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes
   schweinfurthii) offspring at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We analyzed
   41 years of observational behavioral data collected between 1975 and
   2016 from 81 offspring. We characterized feeding development in the
   first 10 years of life via four different measures: (1) proportion of
   observation time spent feeding; (2) diet composition; (3) diet breadth;
   and (4) diet maturity as measured by similarity to maternal diet. We
   used mixed effects models to examine changes with age and by sex, while
   controlling for season.
   Results Feeding time, diet breadth, and diet maturity exhibited the most
   substantial increases with age in the first 6 years, with no significant
   change thereafter. Males and females showed different patterns of change
   in diet breadth by age, but did not differ by age 10. Diet composition
   did not change significantly with age and did not differ by sex.
   Discussion We found that chimpanzee offspring attained adult-like
   feeding behaviors between 4 and 6 years of age, concomitant with the
   completion of weaning. Thus, our data do not support the
   needing-to-learn feeding skills hypothesis of a prolonged juvenile
   period, but additional data are needed to evaluate how and when
   adolescent chimpanzees are able to make foraging decisions independent
   of their mothers. Existing data on growth provides support for the
   expensive brain hypothesis, however, these hypotheses are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive. As more studies across taxa accumulate
   sufficient datasets on a range of developmental metrics, we will be able
   to achieve a more robust understanding of prolonged development in
   primates.},

Title = {Uncloaking a lost cause: Decolonizing ancestry estimation in the United
   States},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {422-436},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since the professionalization of US-based forensic anthropology in the
   1970s, ancestry estimation has been included as a standard part of the
   biological profile, because practitioners have assumed it necessary to
   achieve identifications in medicolegal contexts. Simultaneously,
   forensic anthropologists have not fully considered the racist context of
   the criminal justice system in the United States related to the
   treatment of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color; nor have we
   considered that ancestry estimation might actually hinder identification
   efforts because of entrenched racial biases. Despite ongoing criticisms
   from mainstream biological anthropology that ancestry estimation
   perpetuates race science, forensic anthropologists have continued the
   practice. Recent years have seen the prolific development of retooled
   typological approaches with 21st century statistical prowess to include
   methods for estimating ancestry from cranial morphoscopic traits,
   despite no evidence that these traits reflect microevolutionary
   processes or are suitable genetic proxies for population structure; and
   such approaches have failed to critically evaluate the societal
   consequences for perpetuating the biological race concept. Around the
   country, these methods are enculturated in every aspect of the
   discipline ranging from university classrooms, to the
   board-certification examination marking the culmination of training, to
   standard operating procedures adopted by forensic anthropology
   laboratories. Here, we use critical race theory to interrogate the
   approaches utilized to estimate ancestry to include a critique of the
   continued use of morphoscopic traits, and we assert that the practice of
   ancestry estimation contributes to white supremacy. Based on the lack of
   scientific support that these traits reflect evolutionary history, and
   the inability to disentangle skeletal-based ancestry estimates from
   supporting the biological validity of race, we urge all forensic
   anthropologists to abolish the practice of ancestry estimation.},

Title = {Elevated diversity in loci linked to facial morphology is consistent
   with the hypothesis that individual facial recognition is important
   across hominoids},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {785-791},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: The ability to use visual signals to identify individuals is
   an important feature of primate social groups, including humans. Sheehan
   and Nachman (2014) showed that loci linked to facial morphology had
   elevated levels of diversity and interpreted this as evidence that the
   human face is under frequency-dependent selection to enhance individual
   recognition (Nature Communications 5). In our study, we tested whether
   this pattern is found in non-human ape species, to help understand
   whether individual recognition might also play a role in species other
   than humans.
   Materials and methods: We examined levels of genetic diversity in an
   available population genomic dataset of humans, chimpanzees, bonobos,
   gorillas, and orangutans for three sets of loci, (1) loci linked to
   facial morphology, (2) loci linked to height, and (3) neutrally evolving
   regions. We tested whether loci linked to facial morphology were more
   variable than loci linked to height or neutrally evolving loci in each
   of these species.
   Results: We found significantly elevated diversity in loci linked to
   facial morphology in chimpanzees, gorillas, and Sumatran and Bornean
   orangutans.
   Discussion: Our findings closely parallel those of Sheehan and Nachman
   and are consistent with the idea that selection for facial diversity and
   individual recognition has not only shaped the evolution of the human
   face, but it has similarly shaped the evolution of most of our closest
   primate relatives. We also discuss alternative hypotheses for this
   pattern.},

Title = {More severe stress markers in the teeth of flanged versus unflanged
   orangutans (Pongo spp.)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {4},
Pages = {625-637},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives We compared an early life stress indicator, linear enamel
   hypoplasia (LEH), in the canine teeth of two male orangutan (Pongo spp.)
   morphs. Flanged males have large bi-discoid cheek pads and a laryngeal
   throat pouch, and they exhibit either the same or higher levels of the
   stress hormone cortisol throughout development compared with unflanged
   males, which lack secondary sexual characteristics. Such ``developmental
   arrest{''} is hypothesized to either reflect a response to experienced
   high stress (Hypothesis 1), or an adaptation to avoid elevated stress
   levels and/or having experienced lower stress levels (Hypothesis 2)
   during early life. As LEH defect depth has been shown to reflect the
   severity (i.e., intensity and/or duration) of early life stress events,
   we examined whether unflanged males have shallower LEH defects than
   flanged males. Materials and methods Flanging status was assessed by
   measuring the faces of preserved skins. Canine height (N = 37) was
   measured in the same individuals to assess commonality between morphs.
   LEH defect depths were analyzed using a standardized confocal
   profilometry method (N = 34). Results Flanged males have significantly
   deeper LEH defects than unflanged adult males. Canine projected crown
   heights are similar across males regardless of morph. Conclusions
   Evidence from great apes shows that, when comparing canines with similar
   growth patterns, deeper defects reflect more severe stress events during
   development. Thus, our results suggest that ``developmental arrest{''}
   of unflanged males is not a response to having experienced stress, but
   rather an adaptation to avoid the physiological impacts associated with
   chronic stress and/or experiencing lower stress levels.},

Title = {In vivo deciduous dental eruption in LuiKotale bonobos and Gombe

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {4},
Pages = {684-691},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives Existing data on bonobo and chimpanzee dental eruption timing
   are derived predominantly from captive individuals or deceased wild
   individuals. However, recent advances in noninvasive photographic
   monitoring of living, wild apes have enabled researchers to characterize
   dental eruption in relatively healthy individuals under naturalistic
   conditions. At present, such data are available for only one population
   of wild chimpanzees. We report data for an additional population of wild
   chimpanzees and the first dental eruption data for wild bonobos.
   Materials and Methods We collected photographs and video footage of
   teeth from the open mouths of wild bonobos and East African chimpanzees
   of known age from LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gombe
   National Park, Tanzania, respectively. We scored the presence and
   absence of deciduous teeth from photographs and video footage to
   characterize deciduous dental eruption timing in these two populations.
   Results Deciduous dental eruption ages in our sample fall within the
   range of variation previously documented for captive chimpanzees, but
   eruption ages are later in wild than in captive contexts. We found
   substantial variation in deciduous canine eruption timing, particularly
   among bonobos. One bonobo had a deciduous canine present by 227 days old
   while another did not have a deciduous canine present at 477 days old.
   Discussion Our data indicate that deciduous teeth erupt later in wild
   individuals than in captive individuals. We also found that deciduous
   dental eruption timing varies considerably between individuals within
   our study populations, a pattern that is consistent with previous
   studies. Future studies should consider sources of variation in
   deciduous canine eruption timing and relationships with other aspects of
   life history as additional data become available.},

Title = {Functional and phylogenetic variation in anthropoid incisor size},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {3},
Pages = {390-401},

Abstract = {Objectives Previous studies have shown that frugivorous anthropoids have
   wider incisors than folivores relative to body mass, and that
   catarrhines have relatively wider incisors than platyrrhines. This study
   reexamines these contrasts using mandibular length as a biomechanical
   standard to quantify relative incisor width. Materials and Methods
   Dental, mandibular, and body-mass data for 86 anthropoid species were
   taken from the literature. Incisor width was size-adjusted using shape
   ratios, with mandibular length and body mass as the denominators.
   Dietary and phylogenetic effects were examined using phylogenetic
   generalized least squares. Results Mandible-based ratios provide a
   signal that is very similar to the one derived from ratios computed
   using body mass. Frugivores have relatively wider incisors than
   folivores, as expected. There is limited support for a stronger dietary
   effect in platyrrhines when mandible-based ratios are used, but neither
   type of ratio indicates an overall difference between platyrrhines and
   catarrhines. Discussion Although both ratios support a link between
   incisor size and diet, there is some evidence indicating that
   mandible-based ratios are more sensitive to dietary variation at smaller
   phylogenetic scales. Understanding why the signals from the two ratios
   diverge at such scales may help clarify the functional significance of
   variation in incisor width. The results of this study undermine the view
   that platyrrhines, as a group, tend to have narrower incisors than
   catarrhines, regardless of diet. Instead, the difference between the two
   clades noted in previous studies can be explained by greater incisor
   functional diversity in platyrrhines.},

Title = {Tooth chipping prevalence and patterns in extant primates},

Volume = {175},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives: A tooth chip occurs when a hard object forcefully contacts
   the surface of the tooth, typically removing enamel from the occlusal
   edge. In this study, chipping patterns in extant primates were compared,
   and hard-object-feeding assessed alongside other factors (e.g., grit
   mastication and dental properties), to elucidate dietary and behavioral
   inferences in archeological and paleontological samples.
   Materials and methods: Thirteen species of extant primates were studied,
   including eight species within the Cercopithecidae, two within the
   Ceboidea, and three within the Hominoidea. Four additional species were
   also incorporated from the literature for some of the analyses. The
   severity (Grade 1-3), position (buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal) and
   number of tooth fractures were recorded for each specimen.
   Results: Species considered hard-object-feeding specialists presented
   higher rates of chipping, with sakis, mandrills, sooty mangabeys and
   Raffles' banded langurs having high chipping rates (28.3\%, 36.7\%,
   48.4\%, and 34.7\% of teeth, respectively). Species that seasonally eat
   harder foods had intermediate chipping frequencies (e.g., brown woolly
   monkeys: 18.5\%), and those that less commonly consume hard food items
   had the lowest chipping frequencies (e.g., Kloss gibbon: 7.3\%;
   chimpanzees: 4.4\%).
   Discussion: The results suggest hard food mastication influences
   differences in chipping prevalence among the species studied. Although
   Homo fossil samples show high rates of chipping comparable to
   hard-object-feeding extant primates, they display a different pattern of
   chipping, supporting the hypothesis that these fractures are mostly
   non-food related (e.g., grit mastication in Homo naledi; non-masticatory
   tooth use in Neanderthals).},

Title = {Hand preference in unimanual and bimanual coordinated tasks in wild
   western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) feeding on African
   ginger (Zingiberaceae)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {531-545},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: Bimanual coordinated behaviors are critical for detecting
   robust individual hand preference in nonhuman primates but are
   particularly challenging to observe in the wild. This study focuses on
   spontaneous feeding behavior on African ginger (Aframomum sp. and
   Renealmia sp.), which involves a unimanual task (reaching and pulling
   out a ginger stem) and a bimanual coordinated task (extracting pith from
   a ginger stem) by wild western lowland gorillas.
   Materials and methods: Study subjects were 21 gorillas in the
   Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. We examined whether they exhibit
   significant hand preference at the individual and group levels for both
   tasks.
   Results: Sixteen gorillas showed significant hand preference in the
   unimanual task, whereas all 21 individuals showed significant hand
   preference in the bimanual coordinated task. Hand preference was
   significantly stronger in the bimanual coordinated task than in the
   unimanual task. It is noteworthy that gorillas showed a significant
   right-hand preference at the group level for the bimanual task (roughly
   70\% of the subjects).
   Discussion: This study confirmed that bimanual coordinated tasks are
   more sensitive in detecting hand preferences in nonhuman primates. In
   addition to the bimanual nature of the task, the precision grip for
   processing and the importance of African ginger as a food resource might
   influence the expression of hand preference. Evidence of a group-level
   right-hand preference may support the ``postural origins theory.{''}
   Because all wild African great apes feed on the pith of African ginger,
   comparing this task and its hand preferences can contribute toward a
   better understanding of the evolution of handedness in Hominidae.},

   well-preserved crania. The Wilson-Leonard 2 (WL-2) Paleoindian skull
   from Texas has never been fully analyzed because it is crushed and
   cannot be physically reconstructed. This study employs a digital
   restoration for comprehensive assessment and analysis of WL-2.
   Materials and methods: High-resolution CT data and geometric
   morphometrics are used to restore the WL-2 skull and analyze its
   morphology using 65 craniometric measurements acquired on the
   restoration. These data allow for a full morphological description and
   multivariate (Mahalanobis Distance and Principal Component) comparisons
   to other Paleoindians and recent populations.
   Results: WL-2 has a long, narrow braincase, and a short, modestly
   prognathic face. Compared with other Paleoindians, she is individually
   similar to several skulls from Brazil, but aligns most closely with
   pooled samples from the US and Mexico. WL-2 is most similar to recent
   populations from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and markedly different
   to those from Africa and Australia.
   Discussion: The overall morphology of WL-2 and her association with
   Asians and Europeans align well with trends identified in other CFM
   analyses. Her affinity to recent Amerindians contrasts with the findings
   of many previous CFM studies, but is seemingly consistent with molecular
   analyses suggesting a close relationship between some Paleoindians and
   modern American Indians. This study demonstrates the potential for using
   digital anthropological methods to study other Paleoindian crania whose
   data value is limited by physical destruction and/or deformation.},

Title = {An improved method for measuring molar wear},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {832-838},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Standard methods of recording occlusal dental wear are
   problematic in that they either do not allow for individual variation of
   wear or are not designed to allow for comparisons of wear patterns. In
   this article, we (a) present a novel method for recording and analyzing
   molar wear, and (b) evaluate this method in light of existing methods.
   Materials and methods Eighty-two lower mandibular first molars from two
   regions (medieval Denmark, prehistoric Ohio Valley) were used to assess
   the method for replicability (intra and inter observer error) and
   accuracy (comparison to established methods of recording wear). Wear
   scores were recorded using the MolWear Android App (Beta) by both
   authors, and established methods of Smith and Scott by the first author.
   Intraobserver and interobserver error and comparison of the three
   methods were compared using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
   Results The MolWear method presented high intraobserver (r = 0.985, p <
   0.01) and interobserver (r = 0.978, p < 0.01) repeatability. Compared to
   other methods, the method was strongly correlated with Smith (r = 0.962,
   p < 0.01) and Smith (r = 0.891, p < 0.01).
   Discussion The new MolWear method provides an improved way of measuring
   occlusal molar wear. This method bridges the gaps between established
   methods, performing comparatively while capturing more information about
   the distribution of wear in addition to the extent of wear. This method
   should be used for research comparing interpopulation or intrapopulation
   quantity of dental wear. While designed for a bioarchaeological
   population, this method could extend to any Y5 molar including nonhuman
   primates and hominins.},

Title = {Preferential snake detection in a simulated ecological experiment},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {895-904},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: According to Isbell's snake detection theory (SDT), the need
   to rapidly detect and thus avoid snakes had a major impact on the
   evolution of the primate visual system, and thus the origin and
   evolution of the primate lineage, as expansion of the visual sense is a
   key characteristic of primates. The SDT rests on the assumption that
   there are both cortical (conscious) and subcortical (unconscious) brain
   structures and pathways that are responsible for rapid visual detection
   of and quick avoidance reactions to snakes. Behavioral evidence for the
   SDT primarily comes from visual search tasks and presentations of images
   on a computer screen; our aim was to evaluate the SDT under more
   ecologically valid circumstances.
   Materials and methods: We asked participants to take a virtual hike in
   which a realistic model of a snake, rabbit, or bottle had been placed on
   the trail. Subjects were instructed simply to imagine themselves as the
   hiker while watching the video. We measured heart rate and skin
   conductance reactions while the participants viewed the video. After the
   video, the participants were shown pictures of the three stimuli and
   asked if they had seen any of them.
   Results: We found that snakes were detected more often than rabbits or
   bottles, and that participants showed greater changes in heart rate and
   greater skin conductance responses in the snake condition than in the
   other two conditions, even when the participant did not report having
   seen the snake.
   Discussion: A critical component of the SDT is that primates must be
   able to quickly detect snakes even when their attention is directed
   elsewhere. Using a novel experimental context-a simulated hike-we
   assessed arousal and detection without directing participants to attend
   to any particular stimulus or event. Our data support the SDT by
   providing evidence of enhanced detection and autonomic arousal even in
   the absence of detection. Replication of these results using additional
   controls and experimental contexts will help refine our understanding of
   snake avoidance by primates.},

Abstract = {Objectives The World Health Organization estimates that almost 300
   million people suffer from depression worldwide. African Americans are
   understudied for depression-related phenotypes despite widespread racial
   disparities. In our study of African Americans, we integrated
   information on psychosocial stressors with genetic variation in order to
   better understand how these factors associated with depressive symptoms.
   Methods Our research strategy combined information on financial strain
   and social networks with genetic data to investigate variation in
   symptoms of depression (CES-D scores). We collected self-report data on
   depressive symptoms, financial strain (difficulty paying bills) and
   personal social networks (a model of an individual's social
   environment), and we genotyped genetic variants in five genes previously
   implicated in depressive disorders (HTR1a, BDNF, GNB3, SLC6A4, and
   FKBP5) in 128 African Americans residing in Tallahassee, Florida. We
   tested for direct and gene-environment interactive effects of the
   psychosocial stressors and genetic variants on depressive symptoms.
   Results Significant associations were identified between high CES-D
   scores and a stressful social environment (i.e., a high percentage of
   people in participants' social network who were a source of stress) and
   high financial strain. Only one genetic variant (rs1360780 in FKBP5) was
   significantly associated with CES-D scores and only when psychosocial
   stressors were included in the model; the T allele had an additive
   effect on depressive symptoms. Sex was also significantly associated
   with CES-D score in the model with psychosocial stressors and genetic
   variants; males had higher CES-D scores. No significant interactive
   effects were detected. Conclusions A stressful social environment and
   material disadvantage increase depressive symptoms in the study
   population. Additional associations with FKBP5 and male sex were
   revealed in models that included both psychosocial and genetic data. Our
   results suggest that incorporating psychosocial stressors may empower
   future genetic association studies and help clarify the biological
   consequences of social and financial stress.},

   and individual characteristics on the tendency to avoid food
   contaminated by soil and by their own and conspecifics' feces. Materials
   and methods We conducted feeding tests on 40 semi-free ranging
   individuals rescued from the pet trade. Using generalized linear mixed
   models, we investigated the effect of season, sex, age, dominance rank,
   and exposure to non-natural living conditions on feeding decisions.
   Results Woolly monkeys did not avoid soil-contaminated food and equally
   avoided food contaminated by their own and conspecifics' feces.
   Individuals varied greatly in their level of fecal avoidance. Only
   females exhibited strong avoidance of fecally contaminated food, but
   adapted their behavior to food availability, highlighting the trade-off
   between nutritional intake and parasite avoidance. Additionally,
   low-ranking females, less competitive over food resources, exhibited
   lower avoidance than dominant ones. Juveniles were more cautious than
   adults, possibly to compensate for a higher parasite susceptibility.
   Finally, we reported an unknown effect of exposure to non-natural living
   conditions on behavioral defenses, as animals kept as household pets for
   an extended period apparently lost their ability to avoid fecally
   contaminated food. Conclusion We argue that striving to understand
   variation in infection-avoidance behaviors in natural populations is
   crucial to predict disease spread and inform conservation policies.},

Abstract = {Objectives The aim of this report is to present the large deciduous
   tooth collection of identified children that is housed at the National
   Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) in Burgos, Spain. Methods
   Yearly, members of the Dental Anthropology Group of the CENIEH are in
   charge of collecting the teeth and registering all the relevant
   information from the donors at the time of collection. In compliance
   with Spanish Law 14/2007 of July 3, 2007, on Biomedical Research
   (BOE-A-2007-12945), all individuals are guaranteed anonymity and
   confidentiality. When the donor hands in the tooth, they fill out a
   Donor Information Form and sign the Informed Consent Form. At the same
   time, another person completes the data label for the transparent
   polyethylene zip lock bag where the tooth is temporarily stored. All
   teeth are then transferred to the CENIEH Restoration lab, where the
   specialists apply the same protocol as for the fossil remains. Results
   Although the sample is still growing, from the first collection campaign
   in 2014 to date it comprises 2977 teeth of children whose ages of tooth
   loss are between 2 and 15 years. Each tooth is associated with basic
   information of the individuals and their parents and grandparents (sex,
   date, and place of birth, ancestry, country of residence), as well as
   important data about early life history (pregnancy duration,
   breastfeeding, bottle-feeding) and other relevant information provided
   by the donors (such as if they are twins, dental loss, or dental
   extraction). Conclusions Due to the scarcity of deciduous dental samples
   available, the Raton Perez collection represents a highly valuable
   sample for a wide range of disciplines such as forensic, dental, and
   anthropological fields among others.},

Abstract = {Objectives We study the genetic diversity between Classic Teotihuacan
   and its neighboring towns trying to understand how far or close they are
   at the genetic level. Materials and methods We use cranial nonmetric
   traits to study a sample of 280 adult skulls from archaeological sites
   running from the late Preclassic to the early Postclassic. Samples of
   Classic Teotihuacan were studied for La Ventilla and San Sebastian
   Xolalpan neighbors. For the Epiclassic period, samples from Xaltocan,
   Toluca valley, Mogotes and Xico were used. For the Preclassic and
   Postclassic samples from Xico were also used. We used a parametric
   bootstrap for the mean measure of divergence for the statistical
   analysis. Results Samples from Xico have small biodistance from
   Preclassic to Postclassic. Samples from Los Mogotes differ depending on
   the functional context of deposition, with individuals from household
   burials (funerary) differing from non-funerary, ceremonial interments
   and exhibiting affinities to Epiclassic samples from Toluca valley.
   Epiclassic populations from Xaltocan vary significantly from any samples
   analyzed. Samples from Classic period Teotihuacan vary considerably
   among them but form a separate genetic group from all the other
   populations under study. Conclusions The great biodistance separation
   among Classic Teotihuacan and its neighbor villages of central Mexico
   let us conclude that, contrary from the classical idea that those
   villages were confirmed by the inhabitants of Teotihuacan's collapse:
   They indeed remain as separate populations by themselves.},

Title = {Costs of male infanticide for female capuchins: When does an adaptive
   male reproductive strategy become costly for females and detrimental to
   population viability?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-360},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives Infanticide in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus
   imitator) typically occurs in association with alpha male replacements
   (AMRs). Although infanticide is likely adaptive for males, it imposes
   costs on females that are difficult to quantify without long-term
   demographic data. Here we investigate effects of AMRs and infanticide on
   female reproductive success and how these costs affect capuchin groups.
   We investigate (1) effects of AMR frequency on the production of
   surviving infants; (2) energetic and (3) temporal ``opportunity
   costs{''} of infant loss; and (4) how AMR frequency impacts capuchin
   group sizes. Materials and methods We censused six groups (7-33
   years/group, 74 adult females). We modeled surviving infant production
   in relation to AMR. We estimated a female's energy requirements for lost
   infants and the temporal cost relative to the median reproductive
   window. We simulated how varying AMR rates would affect future capuchin
   group sizes. Results Females exposed to more frequent AMR tended to
   produce fewer surviving offspring. We estimate the average lost infant
   requires approximately 33\% additional energy intake for its mother and
   represents 10\% of the average reproductive opportunity window available
   to females. Simulated populations remain viable at the observed rate of
   AMR occurrence but decrease in size at even slightly higher rates.
   Discussion While infanticide is adaptive for males, for females it
   affects lifetime reproductive success and imposes energetic and
   opportunity costs. Although capuchin populations have evolved with AMRs
   and infanticide, small increases in AMR frequency may lead to population
   decline/extinction. Infanticide likely plays a large role in population
   maintenance for capuchins.},

Title = {Uniparental genetic markers in native Americans: A summary of all

Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to create a comprehensive summary
   of available mtDNA and Y-chromosome data for Native Americans from
   North, Central, and South America, including both modern and ancient
   DNA. To illustrate the usefulness of this dataset we present a broad
   picture of the genetic variation for both markers across the Americas.
   Methods We searched PubMed, ResearchGate, Google Scholar for studies
   about mtDNA or Y-chromosome variation in Native American populations,
   including geographic, linguistic, ecological (ecoregion), archeological
   and chronological information. We used AMOVA to estimate the genetic
   structure associated with language and ecoregion grouping and Mantel
   tests to evaluate the correlation between genetic and geographic
   distances. Results Genetic data were obtained from 321 primary sources,
   including 22,569 individuals from 298 contemporary populations, and 3628
   individuals from 202 archeological populations. MtDNA lineages of
   probable non-Amerindian origin were rare, in contrast with Y-chromosome
   lineages. Mantel tests showed a statistically significant correlation
   for the whole continent considering mtDNA but not the Y-chromosome.
   Genetic structure between groups was always stronger for mtDNA than for
   the Y-chromosome. Conclusions This study summarizes decades of research
   conducted in Native American populations for both mtDNA and the
   Y-chromosome. Continental or sub-continental patterns of variation
   reveal that most of the genetic variation occurs within populations
   rather than among linguistic or ecoregional groups, and that isolation
   by distance is barely detectable in most population sets. The genetic
   structure among groups was always larger for mtDNA than for the
   Y-chromosome, suggesting between-sex differences in gene flow.},

Title = {Sex differences in diet and life conditions in a rural Medieval Islamic
   population from Spain (La Torrecilla, Granada): An isotopic and
   osteological approach to gender differentiation in al-Andalus},

Abstract = {Objectives Gender differentiation can influence the diet, physical
   activity, and health of human populations. Multifaceted approaches are
   therefore necessary when exploring the biological consequences of
   gender-related social norms in the past. Here, we explore the links
   between diet, physiological stress, physical activity, and gender
   differentiation in the Medieval Islamic population of La Torrecilla
   (Granada, Spain, 13th-15th century AD), by analyzing stable isotope
   patterns, stature, and long bone diaphyseal measurements.
   Materials and Methods The sample includes 96 individuals (48 females, 48
   males) classified as young and middle adults (20-34 and 35-50 years of
   age respectively). Diet was reconstructed through the analysis of delta
   C-13 and delta N-15. Stature, humeral and femoral diaphyseal shape and
   product of diaphyseal diameters served as proxies of physiological
   stress and physical activity.
   Results Isotopic ratios suggest a substantial dietary contribution of
   C-4 plants (e.g., sorghum, millet), a variable access to animal
   proteins, and no differences between the sexes. Sexual dimorphism in
   stature derives from a markedly low female stature. Long bone diaphyseal
   properties suggest that men performed various physically stressful
   activities, whereas women were involved in less physically demanding
   activities (possibly related to household work).
   Discussion Gender differentiation in La Torrecilla was expressed by a
   possibly differential parental investment in male versus female
   offspring and by culturally sanctioned gender differences in the
   performance of physical tasks. Diet was qualitatively homogenous between
   the sexes, although we cannot rule out quantitative differences. Our
   results shed new light on the effects of gender-related social norms on
   human development and lifestyle.},

Abstract = {Intersectionality, the theory named by Kimberle Crenshaw, outlines how
   multiple elements of an individual's social identity overlap to create
   and preserve societal inequalities and discrimination. Recently
   bioarchaeology's engagement with intersectionality has become
   increasingly explicit, as the field recognizes the lived experience of
   multiple axes of an individual's identity. Evidence of trauma can remain
   observable in an individual's skeleton for years, making it an ideal
   subject of study for intersectional analyses in bioarchaeology. Using
   contrasting case studies of two individuals who died in hospitals and
   were unclaimed after death, we explore the theoretical and
   methodological application of intersectionality to investigations of
   accidental and interpersonal trauma. Differences in identities and
   structural inequalities affect bone quality and health outcomes. As we
   demonstrate, a broken bone is the intersecting result of biological,
   histomorphological, sociocultural, and behavioral factors. This approach
   allows for a better acknowledgement of the inherent complexity of past
   lives, elevating and amplifying previously silenced voices. In this way,
   intersectionality in bioarchaeology demands social justice.},

Title = {Leprosy in medieval Denmark: Exploring life histories through a
   multi-tissue and multi-isotopic approach},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Objectives By focusing on two Danish leprosaria (N AE stved and Odense;
   13th-16th c. CE) and using diet and origin as proxies, we follow a
   multi-isotopic approach to reconstruct life histories of patients and
   investigate how leprosy affected both institutionalized individuals and
   the medieval Danish community as a whole.
   Materials and Methods We combine archaeology, historical sources,
   biological anthropology, isotopic analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15,
   delta S-34, Sr-87/Sr-86) and radiocarbon dating, and further analyze
   bones with different turnover rates (ribs and long bones).
   Results The delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 results indicate a C-3
   terrestrial diet with small contributions of marine protein for leprosy
   patients and individuals from other medieval Danish sites. A similar
   diet is seen through time, between males and females, and patients with
   and without changes on facial bones. The isotopic comparison between
   ribs and long bones reveals no significant dietary change. The delta
   S-34 and Sr-87/Sr-86 results suggest that patients were local to the
   regions of the leprosaria. Moreover, the radiocarbon dates show a mere
   50\% agreement with the arm position dating method used in Denmark.
   Conclusions A local origin for the leprosy patients is in line with
   historical evidence, unlike the small dietary contribution of marine
   protein. Although only 10\% of the analyzed individuals have rib/long
   bone offsets that undoubtedly show a dietary shift, the data appear to
   reveal a pattern for 25 individuals (out of 50), with elevated delta
   C-13 and/or delta N-15 values in the ribs compared to the long bones,
   which points toward a communal type of diet and reveals organizational
   aspects of the institution.},

Title = {How ancestral subsistence strategies solve salmon starvation and the
   ``protein problem{''} of Pacific Rim resources},

Abstract = {This article provides a theoretical treatment of hunter-gatherer diet
   and physiology. Through a synthesis of nutritional studies, informed by
   ethno-archaeological data, we examine the risk of protein-rich diets for
   human survival, and how societies circumvent ``salmon starvation{''} in
   the northeastern Pacific Rim. Fundamental nutritional constraints
   associated with salmon storage and consumption counter long-standing
   assumptions about the engine of cultural evolution in the region. Excess
   consumption of lean meat can lead to protein poisoning, termed by early
   explorers ``rabbit starvation.{''} While consumption of fats and
   carbohydrates is widely portrayed as a pathway to ``offsetting{''}
   protein thresholds, there are true limits to the amount of protein
   individuals can consume, and constraints are most extreme for smaller
   individuals, children, and pregnant/nursing mothers. While this problem
   is not usually perceived as associated with fish, the risk of protein
   poisoning limits the amount of low-fat fish that people can eat safely.
   Compared with smaller, mass-harvested species (e.g., eulachon), dried
   salmon are exceedingly lean. Under certain circumstances fattier foods
   (small forage fish, marine mammals, whales, and even bears) or
   carbohydrate-rich plants may have been preferred not just for taste but
   to circumvent this ``dietary protein ceiling.{''} Simply put, ``salmon
   specialization{''} cannot evolve without access to complimentary caloric
   energy through fat-rich or carbohydrate-rich resources. By extension,
   the evolution of storage-based societies requires this problem be solved
   prior to or in tandem with-salmon intensification. Without such
   solutions, increased mortality and reproductive rates would have made
   salmon reliance unsustainable. This insight is in line with genomic
   research suggesting protein toxicity avoidance was a powerful
   evolutionary force, possibly linked to genetic adaptations among First
   Americans. It is also relevant to evaluating the plausibility of other
   purportedly ``focal{''} economies and informs understanding of the many
   solutions varied global societies have engineered to overcome
   physiological protein limits.},

Title = {Revisiting metric sex estimation of burnt human remains via supervised
   learning using a reference collection of modern identified cremated
   individuals (Knoxville, USA)},

Volume = {175},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives This study aims to increase the rate of correctly sexed
   calcined individuals from archaeological and forensic contexts. This is
   achieved by evaluating sexual dimorphism of commonly used and new
   skeletal elements via uni- and multi-variate metric trait analyses.
   Materials and methods Twenty-two skeletal traits were evaluated in 86
   individuals from the William M. Bass donated cremated collection of
   known sex and age-at-death. Four different predictive models, logistic
   regression, random forest, neural network, and calculation of population
   specific cut-off points, were used to determine the classification
   accuracy (CA) of each feature and several combinations thereof.
   Results An overall CA of >= 80\% was obtained for 12 out of 22 features
   (humerus trochlea max., and lunate length, humerus head vertical
   diameter, humerus head transverse diameter, radius head max., femur head
   vertical diameter, patella width, patella thickness, and talus trochlea
   length) using univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed an
   increase of CA (>= 95\%) for certain combinations and models (e.g.,
   humerus trochlea max. and patella thickness). Our study shows metric
   sexual dimorphism to be well preserved in calcined human remains,
   despite the changes that occur during burning.
   Conclusions Our study demonstrated the potential of machine learning
   approaches, such as neural networks, for multivariate analyses. Using
   these statistical methods improves the rate of correct sex estimations
   in calcined human remains and can be applied to highly fragmented
   unburnt individuals from both archaeological and forensic contexts.},

Title = {No support for the hereditarian hypothesis of the Black-White
   achievement gap using polygenic scores and tests for divergent selection},

Abstract = {Objectives Debate about the cause of IQ score gaps between Black and
   White populations has persisted within genetics, anthropology, and
   psychology. Recently, authors claimed polygenic scores provide evidence
   that a significant portion of differences in cognitive performance
   between Black and White populations are caused by genetic differences
   due to natural selection, the ``hereditarian hypothesis.{''} This study
   aims to show conceptual and methodological flaws of past studies
   supporting the hereditarian hypothesis.
   Materials and methods Polygenic scores for educational attainment were
   constructed for African and European samples of the 1000 Genomes
   Project. Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess variance
   test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for signals
   of selection by testing for excess genetic differentiation (F-st).
   Expected mean difference in IQ for populations was calculated under a
   neutral evolutionary scenario and contrasted to hereditarian claims.
   Results Tests for selection using polygenic scores failed to find
   evidence of natural selection when the less biased within-family GWAS
   effect sizes were used. Tests for selection using F-st values did not
   find evidence of natural selection. Expected mean difference in IQ was
   substantially smaller than postulated by hereditarians, even under
   unrealistic assumptions that overestimate genetic contribution.
   Conclusion Given these results, hereditarian claims are not supported in
   the least. Cognitive performance does not appear to have been under
   diversifying selection in Europeans and Africans. In the absence of
   diversifying selection, the best case estimate for genetic contributions
   to group differences in cognitive performance is substantially smaller
   than hereditarians claim and is consistent with genetic differences
   contributing little to the Black-White gap.},

Title = {Bilateral asymmetry and developmental plasticity of the humerus in
   modern humans},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {3},
Pages = {418-433},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective This study investigates bilateral asymmetry in the humerus of
   modern human populations with differing activity patterns to assess the
   relative plasticity of different bone regions in response to
   environmental influences, particularly the biomechanical demands of
   handedness.
   Methods External breadths, cross-sectional properties, and centroid
   sizes were used to quantify directional and absolute asymmetry of
   humeral diaphyseal, distal periarticular, and articular regions in six
   populations with differing subsistence strategies (total n = 244).
   Geometric section properties were measured using computed tomography at
   six locations along the distal humerus, while centroid sizes of the
   distal articular and periarticular regions, as well as eight segments of
   the diaphysis, were extracted from external landmark data. Bilateral
   asymmetries were compared between populations and sexes. Each property
   was also tested for correlation with bilateral asymmetry at 40\% of bone
   length, which has been shown to correlate with handedness.
   Results Asymmetry is highest in the diaphysis, but significant through
   all distal bone regions. Asymmetry increases in the region of the
   deltoid tuberosity, and progressively declines distally through the
   shaft and distal periarticular region. Articular asymmetry is higher
   than periarticular asymmetry, approaching levels seen just proximal to
   the olecranon fossa, and is weakly but significantly correlated with
   diaphyseal asymmetry. Hunter-gatherers from Indian Knoll have
   significantly higher levels of asymmetry than other groups and are more
   sexually dimorphic, particularly in cross-sectional properties of the
   diaphysis.
   Conclusions Humeral dimensions throughout the diaphysis, including
   regions currently used in taxonomic assignments of fossil hominins,
   likely respond to in vivo use, including population and sex-specific
   behaviors.},

Abstract = {Objectives According to demographic history, Ecuador has experienced
   shifts in its Native American populations caused by European
   colonization and the African slave trade. The continuous admixture
   events among Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans occurred
   differently in each region of the country, producing a stratified
   population. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the level of
   genetic substructure in the Ecuadorian Mestizo population. Materials and
   methods A total of 377 male and 209 female samples were genotyped for
   two sets of X-chromosomal markers (32 X-Indels and 12 X-STRs).
   Population analyses performed included Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests,
   LD analysis, PCA, pairwise F(ST)s, and AMOVA. Results Significant levels
   of LD were observed between markers separated by distances of less than
   1 cM, as well as between markers separated by distances varying from
   10.891 to 163.53 cM. Among Ecuadorian regions, Amazonia showed the
   highest average R-2 value. Discussion When X-chromosomal and autosomal
   differentiation values were compared, a sex-biased admixture between
   European men and Native American and African women was revealed, as well
   as between African men and Native American women. Moreover, a distinct
   Native American ancestry was discernible in the Amazonian population, in
   addition to sex-biased gene flow between Amazonia and the Andes and
   Pacific coast regions. Overall, these results underline the importance
   of integrating X chromosome information to achieve a more comprehensive
   view of the genetic and demographic histories of South American admixed
   populations.},

Abstract = {Efforts to name and classify Middle Pleistocene Homo, often referred to
   as ``Homo heidelbergensis{''} are hampered by confusing patterns of
   morphology but also by conflicting paleoanthropological ideologies that
   are embedded in approaches to hominin taxonomy, nomenclature, and the
   species concept. We deconstruct these issues to show how the field's
   search for a ``real{''} species relies on strict adherence to
   pre-Darwinian essentialist naming rules in a post-typological world. We
   then examine Middle Pleistocene Homo through the framework of
   ethnobiology, which examines on how Indigenous societies perceive,
   classify, and name biological organisms. This research reminds us that
   across human societies, taxonomies function to (1) identify and classify
   organisms based on consensus pattern recognition and (2) construct a
   stable nomenclature for effective storage, retrieval and communication
   of information. Naming Middle Pleistocene Homo as a ``real{''} species
   cannot be verified with the current data; and separating regional groups
   into distinct evolutionary lineages creates taxa that are not defined by
   readily perceptible or universally salient differences. Based on
   ethnobiological studies of this kind of patterning, referring to these
   hominins above the level of the species according to their generic
   category with modifiers (e.g., ``European Middle Pleistocene Homo{''})
   is consistent with observed human capabilities for cognitive
   differentiation, is both necessary and sufficient given the current
   data, and will allow for the most clear communication across ideologies
   going forward.},

Title = {Heterogeneous frailty and the expression of linear enamel hypoplasia in

Abstract = {Objectives Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) is a common skeletal marker of
   physiological stress (e.g., malnutrition or illness) that is studied
   within and across populations, without reference to familial risk. We
   examine LEH prevalence in a population with known genealogical
   relationships to determine the potential influence of genetic
   heritability and shared environment.
   Methods LEH data of 239 individuals from a single population were
   recorded from the Ohio State University Menegaz-Bock collection dental
   casts. All individuals were of known age, sex, and genealogy.
   Narrow-sense heritability estimates were obtained for LEH presence and
   count data from all unworn, fully erupted teeth (excluding third molars)
   using SOLAR (v.8.1.1). Age, sex, and age-sex interaction were included
   as covariates. Models were re-run with a household effect variable.
   Results LEH persists across generations in this study population with
   moderate, significant heritability estimates for presence in four teeth,
   and count in four teeth (three teeth were significant for both). When a
   household effect variable was added, no residual heritability remained
   for LEH count on any tooth. There was no significant household effect
   for three of the four teeth that had significant heritability estimates
   for LEH presence. Age was a significant covariate. Further analyses with
   birth year data revealed a secular trend toward less LEH.
   Conclusions This study provides evidence for familial risk of LEH
   (genetic and environmental) that has consequences for the broad use of
   this skeletal marker of stress. These results have repercussions for
   archaeological assemblages, or population health studies, where genetic
   relatives and household groups might be heavily represented.},

Title = {Scaling of linear anthropometric dimensions in living humans},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-143},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives Some previous studies suggest that humans do not conform to
   geometric similarity (isometry) in anthropometric dimensions of the
   upper and lower limbs. Researchers often rely on a single statistical
   approach to the study of scaling patterns, and it is unclear whether
   these methods produce similar results and are equally robust. This study
   used one bivariate and one multivariate method to examine how linear
   anthropometric dimensions scale in a sample of adult humans.
   Materials and methods Motion capture marker data from 104 adults of
   varying height and mass were used to calculate anthropometric
   dimensions. We analyzed scaling patterns in pooled and separate sexes
   with two methods: (1) bivariate log-log regression and (2) multivariate
   principal component analysis (PCA). We calculated 95\% highest
   density/confidence intervals for each method and defined
   positive/negative allometry as estimates lying outside those intervals.
   Results Results identified isometric scaling of the upper arm, thigh,
   and shoulder, positive allometry of the forearm and shank, and negative
   allometry of the pelvis in the pooled sample using both statistical
   methods. Patterns of allometry in the pooled sample were similar between
   methods but differed in magnitude. Sex-specific results differed in both
   pattern and magnitude between log-log regression and PCA. Only one
   measurement (shoulder width) departed from isometry in the sex-specific
   log-log regressions.
   Discussion Our findings suggest that especially in sex-specific
   analyses, the pattern and magnitude of allometry are sensitive to
   statistical methodology. When body mass was selected as the size
   variable, most human linear anthropometric dimensions in this sample
   scaled isometrically and were therefore geometrically similar within
   sexes.},

Title = {A field method for cryopreservation of whole blood from a finger prick
   for later analysis with flow cytometry},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objectives Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for investigating immune
   function, allowing for the quantification of leukocytes by subtype. Yet
   it has not been used extensively for field work due to perishable
   reagents and the need for immediate analysis of samples. To make flow
   cytometry more accessible, we devise and evaluate a field protocol for
   freezing capillary blood.
   Materials and Methods We collected finger prick blood samples from 110
   volunteers, age 18 to 42. Blood samples were analyzed immediately for 18
   cell surface markers. Aliquots of whole blood were frozen in the vapor
   phase of a liquid nitrogen tank with 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide in medium.
   Samples were analyzed on a Guava EasyCyte HT flow cytometer after 2, 4,
   or 14 weeks.
   Results Major lymphocyte fractions in frozen samples were correlated
   with fresh values (T-cells: r = 0.82; Natural Killer {[}NK] cells: r =
   0.64; CD4: r = 0.67; CD8: r = 0.82; Naive CD4: r = 0.73, Naive CD8: r =
   0.71; B-cells: r = 0.73; all p < 0.001), and mean values were similar to
   those from fresh samples. However, correlations for smaller subsets of
   CD4 and B cells were generally poor. Some differences resulted from
   changes in non-specific binding for some antibody-conjugate pairs.
   Cryopreservation also resulted in a reduction in granulocytes more than
   lymphocytes.
   Discussion Our results suggest that antibody/fluorochrome combinations
   should be validated before use on frozen samples, and that functional
   changes in cells may affect some cell markers. However, this simple
   freezing protocol utilizing finger pricks, whole blood, and a liquid
   nitrogen shipping tank is viable for obtaining samples for flow
   cytometry under field conditions.},

Title = {Later Stone Age human hair from Vaalkrans Shelter, Cape Floristic Region

Abstract = {Previous studies show that the indigenous people of the southern Cape of
   South Africa were dramatically impacted by the arrival of European
   colonists starting similar to 400 years ago and their descendants are
   today mixed with Europeans and Asians. To gain insight on the occupants
   of the Vaalkrans Shelter located at the southernmost tip of Africa, we
   investigated the genetic make-up of an individual who lived there about
   200 years ago. We further contextualize the genetic ancestry of this
   individual among prehistoric and current groups. From a hair sample
   excavated at the shelter, which was indirectly dated to about 200 years
   old, we sequenced the genome (1.01 times coverage) of a Later Stone Age
   individual. We analyzed the Vaalkrans genome together with genetic data
   from 10 ancient (pre-colonial) individuals from southern Africa spanning
   the last 2000 years. We show that the individual from Vaalkrans was a
   man who traced similar to 80\% of his ancestry to local southern San
   hunter-gatherers and similar to 20\% to a mixed East African-Eurasian
   source. This genetic make-up is similar to modern-day Khoekhoe
   individuals from the Northern Cape Province (South Africa) and Namibia,
   but in the southern Cape, the Vaalkrans man's descendants have likely
   been assimilated into mixed-ancestry ``Coloured{''} groups. The
   Vaalkrans man's genome reveals that Khoekhoe pastoralist
   groups/individuals lived in the southern Cape as late as 200 years ago,
   without mixing with non-African colonists or Bantu-speaking farmers. Our
   findings are also consistent with the model of a Holocene pastoralist
   migration, originating in Eastern Africa, shaping the genomic landscape
   of historic and current southern African populations.},

Title = {``{[}This] system was not made for {[}you]:{''} A case for decolonial
   Scientia},

Volume = {175},

Abstract = {Background Sylvia Wynter's ``recoded{''} form of science called
   decolonial Scientia (DS) is grounded in an understanding of humans as
   simultaneously biological and cultural. DS includes narrative
   interventions that destabilize Western scientific authority, and address
   limitations that empirical data collection and analysis place on
   capturing simultaneous realities. Therefore, Wynter's narrative
   ``languaging{''} is both scientific critique and grounded in a tradition
   of Black radical imagining.
   Aims In this article, I use languaging to destabilize the canonical
   narrative tied to W. M. Cobb's production of the article ``Race and
   Runners.{''} The standard telling focuses on Cobb's examination of
   Owens' lower extremities to expose the fallacy of racial differences in
   athletic ability. Destabilization of the narrative allows for
   identifying relational complexities between actors involved in the
   canonical story - and identifying ideologies embedded within it that
   guide our deconstructions of biological race. My alter(ed)native
   subjectivity informs my use of languaging to argue that the relationship
   between narrative and research practices belie Western
   scientific/unscientific binaries.
   Materials and methods Audiovisual and documentary sources of the
   public-facing ``Race and Runners{''} story were subject to comparative
   analysis to verify the content and order of events in the canonical
   narrative. Letters focused on race and athletic ability obtained from
   the W. Montague Cobb Manuscript Collection at Howard University serve as
   ``apocryphal{''} sources of information. Correspondence between Cobb and
   a representative member of the public named Howard Duncan took place
   within a period immediately before, during and after Cobb publishes
   ``Race and Runners{''} in the Journal of Health and Physical Education.
   Contents were subject to a systematic analysis that involved reviewing
   documents to identify statements reflecting scientific practices, human
   interactions and relationships between race and athletic ability
   reflected in the canonical narrative. Contents were also examined for
   statements relevant to the narrative that departed from or added to the
   canonical story in the same three areas. Details regarding departures
   and additions were recorded along with the specific part of the
   narrative to which they corresponded. Narrative departures and additions
   were articulated with the canonical narrative in the interest of
   destabilizing it to identify ``knots of ideas, histories and narratives
   that, contrary to Western science, can only be legible in relation to
   one another{''} (McKittrick, 2015b p. 2).
   Results Letters exchanged between Cobb and Duncan reveal dynamics that
   are obscured in the canonical storyline. For instance, Duncan's ability
   as a white male to assert himself as Cobb's peer demonstrates how
   racialized power is enacted through science. This is also reflected in
   Owens' position in the narrative as a voiceless object of knowledge.
   Letters also present Cobb's identity beyond being a ``pioneer,{''}
   rendering how he is studying and experiencing racism. This includes how
   he refuses to engage Duncan as a peer.
   Discussion More than mere stories, narratives are motivating and
   instructive forces that shape how we study human biology and use our
   research to oppose biological notions of race. Correspondence between
   Cobb and Duncan reveals how Western scientific ideologies that reinforce
   prescribed roles and boundaries are embedded in narratives.
   These ideologies can limit the transformative potential of our
   approaches to contesting biological notions of race.},

Abstract = {Objective Frailty is the physiological stress that individuals suffer
   during their life. In past populations, frailty is conventionally
   assessed through the occurrence of different biomarkers of biological
   stress. Some efforts have been made to propose indexes that combine all
   biomarkers. However, these indices have some critical limitations: they
   cannot be used on incomplete skeletons, do not consider the severity
   and/or healing of lesions, and assign equal importance to different
   biomarkers. To address these limitations, we propose a new index to
   assess frailty in skeletal individuals. Material and Methods By
   statistically analyzing a large amount of osteological data available
   from the Museum of London, and using a Logit model, we were able to
   define a different weight for each reported biomarker of frailty, based
   on their importance in increasing the risk of premature death for the
   individuals. Results The biological index of frailty (BIF) is the
   weighted mean of all biomarkers scored on the individuals, according to
   a different degree of importance assigned to each one. It also considers
   the severity and healing of the biomarkers when this is relevant to
   diagnose frailty. We applied BIF on a sample of Monastics and
   Non-Monastics from medieval England and compared it with the skeletal
   index of frailty (SFI). Discussion BIF is the first frailty index that
   gives a different weight to each skeletal biomarker of stress, considers
   both severity and healing of the lesions, and can be applied on partial
   skeletal remains. The comparison with SFI showed that BIF is applicable
   to a larger number of skeletal individuals, revealing new differences
   between the Monastic and the Non-Monastic groups.},

Abstract = {Objectives We quantified variation in fecal cortisol across reproductive
   periods in Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) to examine physiological
   mechanisms that may facilitate biparental care. Specifically, we
   evaluated evidence for the explanation that owl monkeys have hormonal
   mechanisms to mobilize energy during periods when each sex is investing
   heavily in reproduction, that is, the gestation period for females and
   the infant care period for males. Materials and methods Between 2011 and
   2015, we monitored 10 groups of Azara's owl monkeys from a wild
   population in Formosa, Argentina and collected fecal samples from 26
   adults (13 males, 13 females). Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays,
   we quantified fecal cortisol as a proxy for evaluating stress responses,
   including energetic demands, on both sexes during periods of
   reproduction and parental care. Results Male cortisol was lowest during
   periods when they were caring for young infants (<3 months) compared
   with periods with older infants or no infant. Female cortisol was
   elevated during gestation compared with other periods. Mean fecal
   cortisol in both males and females was lower when an infant was present
   compared with when females were gestating. Discussion Our results do not
   support the hypothesis that owl monkey males have elevated fecal
   cortisol during periods when they need to mobilize energy to provide
   intensive infant care. Our findings are also inconsistent with the
   Maternal Relief hypothesis. However, results from studies measuring
   fecal cortisol must be interpreted with care and alternative
   explanations, such as seasonal fluctuations in diet and thermoenergic
   demands, should be considered when drawing conclusions.},

Title = {Examining developmental plasticity in the skeletal system through a

Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-178},

Abstract = {Developmental plasticity facilitates energetically costly but
   potentially fitness-enhancing adjustments to phenotypic trajectories in
   response to environmental stressors, and thus may significantly impact
   patterns of growth, morbidity, and mortality over the life course.
   Ongoing research into epigenetics and developmental biology indicate
   that the timing of stress exposures is a key factor when assessing their
   impact on developmental processes. Specifically, stress experienced
   within sensitive developmental windows (SDWs), discrete developmental
   periods characterized by heightened energy requirements and rapid
   growth, may alter the pace and tempo of growth in ways that
   significantly influence phenotypic development over both the short and
   long term. In human skeletal biology, efforts to assess how
   developmental environments shape health outcomes over the life course
   could be enhanced by incorporating the SDW concept into existing
   methodological approaches. The goal of this article is to outline an
   interpretive framework for identifying and interpreting evidence of
   developmental stress in the skeletal system using the SDW concept. This
   framework provides guidance for the identification of elements most
   likely to capture evidence of stress most relevant to a study's core
   research questions, the interpretation of developmental stress exhibited
   by those elements, and the relationship of skeletal indicators of stress
   to the demographic patterning of morbidity and mortality. Use of the SDW
   concept in skeletal biology has the potential to enrich traditional
   approaches to addressing developmental origins of health and disease
   hypotheses, by targeting periods in which individuals are most
   susceptible to stress and thus most likely to exhibit plasticity in
   response.},

Title = {Genetic landscape of Gullah African Americans},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {905-919},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Gullah African Americans are descendants of formerly enslaved
   Africans living in the Sea Islands along the coast of the southeastern
   U.S., from North Carolina to Florida. Their relatively high numbers and
   geographic isolation were conducive to the development and preservation
   of a unique culture that retains deep African features. Although
   historical evidence supports a West-Central African ancestry for the
   Gullah, linguistic and cultural evidence of a connection to Sierra Leone
   has led to the suggestion of this country/region as their ancestral
   home. This study sought to elucidate the genetic structure and ancestry
   of the Gullah.
   Materials and Methods We leveraged whole-genome genotype data from
   Gullah, African Americans from Jackson, Mississippi, African populations
   from Sierra Leone, and population reference panels from Africa and
   Europe to infer population structure, ancestry proportions, and global
   estimates of admixture.
   Results Relative to non-Gullah African Americans from the Southeast US,
   the Gullah exhibited higher mean African ancestry, lower European
   admixture, a similarly small Native American contribution, and increased
   male-biased European admixture. A slightly tighter bottleneck in the
   Gullah 13 generations ago suggests a largely shared demographic history
   with non-Gullah African Americans. Despite a slightly higher relatedness
   to populations from Sierra Leone, our data demonstrate that the Gullah
   are genetically related to many West African populations.
   Discussion This study confirms that subtle differences in African
   American population structure exist at finer regional levels. Such
   observations can help to inform medical genetics research in African
   Americans, and guide the interpretation of genetic data used by African
   Americans seeking to explore ancestral identities.},

Title = {Female-directed aggression by adolescent male chimpanzees primarily
   constitutes dominance striving, not sexual coercion},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are notable for exhibiting high
   levels of male-to-female aggression. Much of this aggression from adult
   males serves sexually coercive functions. Despite being smaller and
   lower-ranking than adult males, adolescent males also engage in regular
   aggression against adult females. Here, we test whether the primary
   function of this aggression is sexual coercion, as in adult males, or,
   alternatively, whether adolescent males use aggression to establish
   social dominance over females.
   Materials and Methods We analyzed 1771 copulations and 1812 instances of
   male-initiated aggression between adolescent males (aged nine through 14
   years) and adult females across 21 years of observation of the Kanyawara
   chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda.
   Results Our test of the sexual coercion hypothesis revealed that
   adolescent males did not selectively target cycling females for
   aggression, nor did aggression against cycling females predict rates of
   copulation with those females. Our test of the social dominance
   hypothesis showed that males succeeded in dominating all adult females
   before, or soon after, dominating their first adult male. Additionally,
   we found that adolescent males dominated females approximately in the
   order of the females' own ranks, from the bottom to the top of the
   female hierarchy.
   Discussion Our data illustrate that the establishment of social
   dominance was more important than sexual coercion in explaining patterns
   of adolescent male aggression toward females. In comparison, evidence
   for sexual coercion was clear and compelling in adult males. These
   findings highlight that the primary function of male-to-female
   aggression differs between adolescent and adult males.},

Title = {A dense sample of fossil primates (Adapiformes, Notharctidae,
   Notharctinae) from the Early Eocene Willwood Formation, Wyoming:
   Documentation of gradual change in tooth area and shape through time},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {728-743},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives The Willwood Formation of the southern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming
   is a fluvial rock sequence that spans approximately 3 million years of
   early Eocene time. It has yielded one the largest collections of fossil
   mammals in the world including thousands of dentitions of extinct
   lemur-like primates known as notharctines. In the southern Bighorn
   Basin, specimens of these primates have been collected on numerous
   paleontological expeditions and the stratigraphic levels yielding the
   dentitions have been carefully recorded. Notharctine dentitions
   represent a rare opportunity to study morphological variation in a
   single anatomical system through time among closely related individuals.
   Materials and Methods Prior studies of Bighorn Basin notharctines
   through time produced measurements of hundreds of specimens but I report
   here results from measurement and comparison of the dentitions and
   dentaries of more than 3,000 specimens, all stratigraphically mapped.
   Results Variation in premolar and molar area and variation in dentary
   depth are apparent throughout the section. Specimens with relatively
   small teeth and dentaries are known from the older part of the section.
   In younger rocks, variation in tooth area among specimens increases.
   Variation in tooth area is continuous and overlaps extensively both
   within and between stratigraphic levels. Other dental variables examined
   by inspection change in a mosaic and continuous fashion through the
   section. These features include variation in the presence and number of
   paraconids on the lower fourth premolar (p4), the size and shape of the
   entoconid notch on the lower first and second molars, and the relative
   development of the pseudohypocone, mesostyle, and cingula on the upper
   molars.
   Discussion These broad patterns can be identified despite notharctine
   alpha taxonomy being in need of extensive revision and, importantly,
   simplification. Such revision is beyond the scope of this article but is
   essential if we are to develop a taxonomy that is both free of
   stratigraphic influence and useful for rapid, repeatable species
   assignment. Boundaries among the patterns of tokogenesis, anagenesis,
   and cladogenesis are blurred in this dense sample of extinct primates.
   While pattern of evolution, a population-level phenomenon, may be
   difficult to falsify in the fossil record, this notharctine sample
   suggests that in the rare instance such as this, when the fossil record
   is densely sampled, change through time is continuous and more
   consistent with gradual evolution.},

Abstract = {Objectives Cranial vault modification (CVM), the intentional reshaping
   of the head, indicated group affiliation in prehistoric Andean South
   America. This study aims to analyze CVM data from the Cuzco region of
   Peru to illuminate patterns of early migration and settlement along with
   the later impact of the Inca Empire (AD 1438-1532) on the ethnic
   landscape.
   Materials and Methods 419 individuals from 10 archaeological sites
   spanning over 2300 years were assessed for CVM using morphological
   analysis.
   Results CVM patterns show distinct temporal attributes: the tabular type
   of modification appeared first and dominated the early sample (900 BC-AD
   600), followed by an influx of unmodified crania during the Middle
   Horizon (AD 600-1000). The annular type appeared later during the Late
   Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1438). In the subsequent period of Inca
   imperialism, modification rates were higher at sites in the Cuzco
   countryside than in Cuzco city sites.
   Discussion The study results, combined with archaeological and
   ethnohistoric data, reveal the sociopolitical transformations that
   occurred prior to and during the rise of the Inca Empire. The influx of
   unmodified crania during the Middle Horizon resulted at least partly
   from Wari occupation, while the appearance of the annular type during
   the LIP points to migration into the area, possibly from the Lake
   Titicaca region. In the Inca Imperial Period, Inca individuals at Cuzco
   city sites refrained from modification as a sign of their ethnic
   identity, while modification patterns in the Cuzco countryside likely
   reflect state-coerced resettlement of different ethnic groups.},

Title = {Relative tooth size, Bayesian inference, and Homo naledi},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {262-282},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives: Size-corrected tooth crown measurements were used to
   estimate phenetic affinities among Homo naledi (similar to 335-236 ka)
   and 11 other Plio-Pleistocene and recent species. To assess further
   their efficacy, and identify dental evolutionary trends, the data were
   then quantitatively coded for phylogenetic analyses. Results from both
   methods contribute additional characterization of H. naledi relative to
   other hominins.
   Materials and Methods: After division by their geometric mean, scaled
   mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions were used in tooth size
   apportionment analysis to compare H. naledi with Australopithecus
   africanus, A. afarensis, Paranthropus robustus, P. boisei, H. habilis,
   H. ergaster, H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, H.
   sapiens, and Pan troglodytes. These data produce equivalently scaled
   samples unaffected by interspecific size differences. The data were then
   gap-weighted for Bayesian inference.
   Results: Congruence in interspecific relationships is evident between
   methods, and with many inferred from earlier systematic studies.
   However, the present results place H. naledi as a sister taxon to H.
   habilis, based on a symplesiomorphic pattern of relative tooth size. In
   the preferred Bayesian phylogram, H. naledi is nested within a clade
   comprising all Homo species, but it shares some characteristics with
   australopiths and, particularly, early Homo.
   Discussion: Phylogenetic analyses of relative tooth size yield
   information about evolutionary dental trends not previously reported in
   H. naledi and the other hominins. Moreover, with an appropriate model
   these data recovered plausible evolutionary relationships. Together, the
   findings support recent study suggesting H. naledi originated long
   before the geological date of the Dinaledi Chamber, from which the
   specimens under study were recovered.},

Title = {A deep-learning-based workflow to assess taxonomic affinity of hominid
   teeth with a test on discriminating Pongo and Homo upper molars},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {175},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a state-of-art deep
   learning (DL) method with superior performance in image classification.
   Here, a CNN-based workflow is proposed to discriminate hominid teeth.
   Our hope is that this method could help confirm otherwise questionable
   records of Homo from Pleistocene deposits where there is a standing risk
   of mis-attributing molars of Pongo to Homo.
   Methods and materials A two-step workflow was designed. The first step
   is converting the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) into EDJ card, that is,
   a two-dimensional image conversion of the three-dimensional EDJ surface.
   In this step, researchers must carefully orient the teeth according to
   the cervical plane. The second step is training the CNN learner with
   labeled EDJ cards. A sample consisting of 53 fossil Pongo and 53 Homo
   (modern human and Neanderthal) was adopted to generate EDJ cards, which
   were then separated into training set (n = 84) and validation set (n =
   22). To assess the feasibility of this workflow, a Pongo-Homo classifier
   was trained from the aforementioned EDJ card set, and then the
   classifier was used to predict the taxonomic affinities of six samples
   (test set) from von Koenigswald's Chinese Apothecary collection.
   Results Results show that EDJ cards in validation set are classified
   accurately by the CNN learner. More importantly, taxonomic predictions
   for six specimens in test set match well with the diagnosis results
   deduced from multiple lines of evidence, implying the great potential of
   CNN method.
   Discussion This workflow paves a way for future studies using CNN to
   address taxonomic complexity (e.g., distinguishing Pongo and Homo teeth
   from the Pleistocene of Asia). Further improvements include visual
   interpretation and extending the applicability to moderately worn teeth.},

Abstract = {Objectives The aim of this research was to explore the origin,
   diversification, and demographic history of O1a-M119 over the past
   10,000 years, as well as its role during the formation of East Asian and
   Southeast Asian populations, particularly the Han, Tai-Kadai-speaking,
   and Austronesian-speaking populations.
   Materials and Methods Y-chromosome sequences (n = 141) of the O1a-M119
   lineage, including 17 newly generated in this study, were used to
   reconstruct a revised phylogenetic tree with age estimates, and identify
   sub-lineages. The geographic distribution of 12 O1a-M119 sub-lineages
   was summarized, based on 7325 O1a-M119 individuals identified among
   60,009 Chinese males.
   Results A revised phylogenetic tree, age estimation, and distribution
   maps indicated continuous expansion of haplogroup O1a-M119 over the past
   10,000 years, and differences in demographic history across geographic
   regions. We propose several sub-lineages of O1a-M119 as founding
   paternal lineages of Han, Tai-Kadai-speaking, and Austronesian-speaking
   populations. The sharing of several young O1a-M119 sub-lineages with
   expansion times less than 6000 years between these three population
   groups supports a partial common ancestry for them in the Neolithic Age;
   however, the paternal genetic divergence pattern is much more complex
   than previous hypotheses based on ethnology, archeology, and
   linguistics.
   Discussion Our analyses contribute to a better understanding of the
   demographic history of O1a-M119 sub-lineages over the past 10,000 years
   during the emergence of Han, Austronesians, Tai-Kadai-speaking
   populations. The data described in this study will assist in
   understanding of the history of Han, Tai-Kadai-speaking, and
   Austronesian-speaking populations from ethnology, archeology, and
   linguistic perspectives in the future.},

Abstract = {Breastfeeding is known to be a powerful mediator of maternal and
   childhood health, with impacts throughout the life course. Paleodietary
   studies of the past 30 years have accordingly taken an enduring interest
   in the health and diet of young children as a potential indicator of
   population fertility, subsistence, and mortality patterns. While
   progress has been made in recent decades toward acknowledging the agency
   of children, many paleodietary reconstructions have failed to
   incorporate developments in cognate disciplines revealing synergistic
   dynamics between maternal and offspring biology. Paleodietary
   interpretation has relied heavily on the ``weanling's dilemma,{''} in
   which infants are thought to face a bleak choice between loss of
   immunity or malnutrition. Using a review of immunological and
   epidemiological evidence for the dynamic and supportive role that
   breastfeeding plays throughout the complementary feeding period, this
   article offers context and nuance for understanding past feeding
   transitions. We suggest that future interpretative frameworks for infant
   paleodietary and bioarchaeological research should include a broad
   knowledge base that keeps pace with relevant developments outside of
   those disciplines.},

Abstract = {Objective This study examines whether individuals with higher dental
   fluctuating asymmetry (DFA) are frailer than those with lower DFA, by
   examining whether increased DFA is associated with skeletal lesion
   formation.
   Subjects and methods 150 individuals with permanent teeth and 64
   individuals with deciduous teeth. All individuals are Ancestral
   Puebloans from archaeological sites in modern-day New Mexico. We
   estimate DFA in three ways: (a) deciduous DFA only, (b) permanent DFA
   only, and (c) a composite of permanent and deciduous DFA. We analyzed
   DFA alongside lesion status for cribra orbitalia (CO) and porotic
   hyperostosis (PH), as well as the presence/absence of enamel hypoplasia
   (EH). All stress indicators were further analyzed for their impact on
   mortality hazards.
   Results We find that individuals with active CO and PH lesions have
   increased DFA, while those with healed lesions have lower DFA. We found
   no relationship between EH and DFA. Further, DFA alone does not predict
   individual mortality but CO does.
   Conclusions Individuals with increased DFA are frailer and therefore,
   less capable of buffering themselves against perturbations to their
   health than those with lower DFA. All results indicate that individuals
   in this study with lower DFA were more successful in buffering
   themselves against random environmental impacts during childhood. While
   DFA alone does not predict mortality hazard, its relationship to lesion
   status (lower DFA in individuals with healed lesions) indicates that it
   would be a valuable addition to studies of health and stress.},

Title = {The 1918 influenza pandemic did not accelerate tuberculosis mortality
   decline in early-20th century Newfoundland: Investigating historical and
   social explanations},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {179-191},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives The selective mortality hypothesis of tuberculosis after the
   1918 influenza pandemic, laid out by Noymer and colleagues, suggests
   that acute exposure or pre-existing infection with tuberculosis (TB)
   increased the probability of pneumonia and influenza (P\&I) mortality
   during the 1918 influenza pandemic, leading to a hastened decline of TB
   mortality in post-pandemic years. This study describes cultural
   determinants of the post-pandemic TB mortality patterns in Newfoundland
   and evaluates whether there is support for this observation.
   Materials and methods Death records and historical documents from the
   Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador were used to calculate
   age-standardized island-wide and sex-based TB mortality, as well as
   region-level TB mortality, for 1900-1939. The Joinpoint Regression
   Program (version 4.8.0.1) was used to estimate statistically significant
   changes in mortality rates.
   Results Island-wide, females had consistently higher TB mortality for
   the duration of the study period and a significant shift to lower TB
   mortality beginning in 1928. There was no similar predicted significant
   decline for males. On the regional level, no models predicted a
   significant decline after the 1918 influenza pandemic, except for the
   West, where significant decline was predicted in the late-1930s.
   Discussion Although there was no significant decline in TB mortality
   observed immediately post-pandemic, as has been shown for other Western
   nations, the female post-pandemic pattern suggests a decline much later.
   The general lack of significant decrease in TB mortality rate is likely
   due to Newfoundland's poor nutrition and lack of centralized healthcare
   rather than a biological interaction between P\&I and TB.},

Title = {Skin deep: The decoupling of genetic admixture levels from phenotypes
   that differed between source populations},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {406-421},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives In genetic admixture processes, source groups for an admixed
   population possess distinct patterns of genotype and phenotype at the
   onset of admixture. Particularly in the context of recent and ongoing
   admixture, such differences are sometimes taken to serve as markers of
   ancestry for individuals-that is, phenotypes initially associated with
   the ancestral background in one source population are assumed to
   continue to reflect ancestry in that population. Such phenotypes might
   possess ongoing significance in social categorizations of individuals,
   owing in part to perceived continuing correlations with ancestry.
   However, genotypes or phenotypes initially associated with ancestry in
   one specific source population have been seen to decouple from overall
   admixture levels, so that they no longer serve as proxies for genetic
   ancestry. Here, we aim to develop an understanding of the joint dynamics
   of admixture levels and phenotype distributions in an admixed
   population.
   Methods We devise a mechanistic model, consisting of an admixture model,
   a quantitative trait model, and a mating model. We analyze the behavior
   of the mechanistic model in relation to the model parameters.
   Results We find that it is possible for the decoupling of genetic
   ancestry and phenotype to proceed quickly, and that it occurs faster if
   the phenotype is driven by fewer loci. Positive assortative mating
   attenuates the process of dissociation relative to a scenario in which
   mating is random with respect to genetic admixture and with respect to
   phenotype.
   Conclusions The mechanistic framework suggests that in an admixed
   population, a trait that initially differed between source populations
   might serve as a reliable proxy for ancestry for only a short time,
   especially if the trait is determined by few loci. It follows that a
   social categorization based on such a trait is increasingly
   uninformative about genetic ancestry and about other traits that
   differed between source populations at the onset of admixture.},
