Title = {Exploring directional and fluctuating asymmetry in the human palate
   during growth},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Palate morphology is constantly changing throughout an
   individual's lifespan, yet its asymmetry during growth is still little
   understood. In this research, we focus on the study of palate morphology
   by using 3D geometric morphometric approaches to observe changes at
   different stages of life, and to quantify the impact of directional and
   fluctuating asymmetry on different areas at different growth stages.
   Materials and Methods The sample consists of 183 individuals (1-72
   years) from two identified human skeletal collections of 19th and early
   20th Century Italian contexts. A 3D-template of 41 (semi)landmarks was
   applied on digital palate models to observe morphological variation
   during growth.
   Results Asymmetrical components of the morphological structure appears
   multidirectional on the entire palate surface in individuals <2 years
   old and become oriented (opposite bilateral direction) between 2 and 6
   years of age. Specifically, directional asymmetry differentially impacts
   palate morphology at different stages of growth. Both the anterior and
   posterior palate are affected by mild alterations in the first year of
   life, while between 2 and 6 years asymmetry is segregated in the
   anterior area, and moderate asymmetry affects the entire palatal surface
   up to 12 years of age. Our results show that stability of the
   masticatory system seems to be reached around 13-35 years first by
   females and then males. From 36 years on both sexes show similar
   asymmetry on the anterior area. Regarding fluctuating asymmetry,
   inter-individual variability is mostly visible up to 12 years of age,
   after which only directional trends can be clearly observed at a group
   level.
   Discussion Morphological structure appears instable during the first
   year of life and acquires an opposite asymmetric bilateral direction
   between 2 and 6 years of age. This condition has been also documented in
   adults; when paired with vertical alteration, anterior/posterior
   asymmetry seems to characterize palate morphology, which is probably due
   to mechanical factors during the lifespan. Fluctuating asymmetry is
   predominant in the first period of life due to a plausible relationship
   with the strength of morphological instability of the masticatory
   system. Directional asymmetry, on the other hand, shows that the
   patterning of group-level morphological change might be explained as a
   functional response to differential inputs (physiological forces,
   nutritive and non-nutritive habits, para-masticatory activity as well as
   the development of speech) in different growth stages. This research has
   implications with respect to medical and evolutionary fields. In
   medicine, palate morphology should be considered when planning
   orthodontic and surgical procedures as it could affect the outcome. As
   far as an evolutionary perspective is concerned the dominance of
   directional asymmetries in the masticatory system could provide
   information on dietary and cultural habits as well as pathological
   conditions in our ancestors.},

Title = {Quantification of dental macrowear using 3D occlusal surface topographic

Abstract = {Objectives Childhood paleodietary reconstruction via dental macrowear
   analysis is limited in part by available methods to measure dental
   macrowear. We describe a method to quantify dental macrowear progression
   (in both deciduous and permanent molars) using a handheld intraoral
   scanner and two 3D occlusal topographic measurements. We assess the
   agreement of our macrowear proxies with an established qualitative wear
   scoring system and their relationship to age.
   Material and methods We scanned 92 well-preserved dentitions of immature
   individuals from the medieval cemetery of St. Polten in Lower Austria
   using an intraoral scanner. Two measurements were made on the resulting
   mesh files-the relative flat surface area in \% of the occlusal surface
   (RFSA\%) and the mesial interior slope angle. We estimated the technical
   error of measurement (TEM). Comparisons were made with the macrowear
   scoring system-tooth wear index.
   Results We found that TEM for both measurements was between 1 and 3\%,
   except the interobserver TEM of RFSA\% which was above 5\%. Both
   quantitative measurements generally agree with the established
   qualitative scores and correlate with age; however, RFSA\% does not
   reliably indicate the progression of macrowear for teeth after dentine
   exposure occurs.
   Discussion The proposed 3D topographic measurements can be made
   reliably, and within a certain range of wear provide good quantitative
   proxies of the progression of dental macrowear. Such measurements
   constitute a promising approach for improving dental macrowear analysis
   in contexts such as childhood paleodietary reconstruction, which benefit
   from additional precision in wear rate estimation and present less
   dentine exposure.},

Title = {Use of craniometric data to facilitate migrant identifications at the

Abstract = {Objectives Thousands of migrants have died along the United
   States/Mexico border and many remain unidentified. The purpose of this
   research is to test whether estimations of population affinity, derived
   from craniometric data, can facilitate identification of migrant remains
   and provide a geographic region of origin rather than the broad label
   Hispanic. The appropriateness of current forensic reference data will
   also be assessed.
   Methods A case study combined with craniometric data from positively
   identified and unidentified migrants from the Pima County Office of the
   Medical Examiner (n = 489) in Arizona and operation identification (n =
   201) in Texas were compared to skeletal data representing Guatemalan (n
   = 87) and Mexican (n = 65) Mayans. Biological distance and discriminant
   function analyses were used to assess overall population relationships
   and classificatory models for forensic anthropological application.
   Results The majority of evidence indicates that estimations of
   population affinity can assist in the facilitation identification of
   migrant remains, even when a broad classification is used. Biological
   distances among the groups suggest that positively identified Guatemalan
   and Mexican migrants are similar to one another but differ from
   Guatemalan and Mexican Mayans.
   Conclusions Population affinity estimations can aid migrant
   identification, and current reference data used in forensic
   anthropological practice should be replaced with data from positive
   identifications. Estimates of geographic origin may be more useful than
   the broad generic term Hispanic for narrowing down the search for a
   missing person, but more data and research is needed to achieve this
   goal. Although, the utility of geographic origin estimates relies on
   transnational data centralization and sharing, which is not always the
   case.},

Title = {Seasonal variability in the diet and feeding ecology of black-and-white
   ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) in Ranomafana National Park,

Abstract = {Objectives: We characterized the diet and foraging ecology of the
   black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), a specialized
   frugivore, and investigated behavioral strategies exhibited in response
   to seasonal changes in resource availability.
   Materials and Methods: Behavioral data were collected from the same two
   adjacent communities across 29 months during two observation periods
   (2007-2008; 2017-2018) in Mangevo, a primary rainforest habitat in
   southeastern Madagascar. To analyze feeding in the context of energy
   maximization versus time minimization strategies, we used nonparametric
   tests to compare plant part constituents, dietary diversity, activity
   budgets, and canopy strata use between fruit-abundant versus fruit-lean
   seasons.
   Results: Individuals dedicated similar to 30\% of their time to feeding
   year-round, mostly in the middle canopy (11-20 m). Animals fed primarily
   on fruits (74\% of diet), but frugivory decreased and folivory increased
   markedly during fruit-lean seasons. Abundant season dietary diversity
   (98 taxa, H ` = 0.71-1.37) was greater than lean season diversity (70
   taxa, H ` = 0.56-1.06), which coincided with less traveling, more
   resting, and higher canopy use-though interannual variation was
   observed.
   Conclusions: Herein, we describe behavioral and dietary patterns that
   are concordant with a time minimizing behavioral strategy.
   Black-and-white ruffed lemur diets comprised lower taxonomic diversity,
   fewer fruits, and more leaves during fruit-lean months. Further, shifts
   toward less travel, more resting, and greater use of higher canopy
   levels during this time were most likely for thermoregulatory benefits.},

Title = {The effect of data provenance on estimates of gestation length in
   African and Asian colobines},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {4},
Pages = {606-613},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives It seems to be commonly accepted that gestation length within
   the subfamily Colobinae lasts several weeks longer in the African tribe
   (Colobini) than in the Asian tribe (Presbytini) even though closely
   related taxa of similar body mass should have similar life histories.
   Suspecting problems with data provenance to cause the difference, we
   revisited the published records expecting similar gestation lengths in
   both tribes if based on vetted, accurate data. Materials and Methods We
   compiled published gestation length data for Colobini and Presbytini,
   labeling them as ``unspecified{''} (n = 16) if the primary reference
   could not be located, methods were not described, and/or conceptions,
   the beginning of gestation, were determined based on sporadic
   observations of mating. If conceptions were determined based on changing
   hormone levels or patterns of daily mating records, we labeled the data
   as ``accurate{''} (n = 12). We analyzed the ln transformed data in a
   phylogenetic framework in relation to adult female body mass. Results In
   the unspecified dataset, gestation length in the two tribes overlapped
   extensively and did not differ significantly. However, in the accurate
   dataset, gestation length was significantly shorter in Colobini (not
   longer, as previously assumed). Discussion Data provenance had a strong
   impact on the comparison, reversing the relationship in gestation length
   in the two sister tribes. It remains to be determined why gestation
   lengths differ, whether, relative to the other primates, Colobini have a
   shortened gestation or Presbytini a lengthened gestation, and whether
   similar differences exist in other closely related taxa. Addressing
   these questions will require additional, broader, comparative analyses.},

Title = {First direct evidence of conservative foraging ecology of early
   Gigantopithecus blacki (similar to 2 Ma) in Guangxi, southern China},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-108},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: Gigantopithecus blacki, the largest hominoid known, is one
   of the representative Pleistocene mammals in southern China and northern
   Southeast Asia. Here we investigate the feeding ecology of G. blacki in
   its core habitat (Guangxi, Southern China) during the early Early
   Pleistocene, which was the early period in its evolution.
   Materials and methods: The stable isotopic (C, O) analysis of tooth
   enamel of the fauna associated with G. blacki (n = 58), including the
   largest number of G. blacki teeth (n = 12) to date from the Liucheng
   Gigantopithecus Cave (similar to 2 Ma), Guangxi, China, is undertaken.
   Results: The delta C-13 values of Liucheng fauna range from -12.9 to
   -19.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.1 +/- 1.3 parts per
   thousand (n = 58) and the delta O-18 values range from -4.3 to -9.6
   parts per thousand with an average of -6.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand (n
   = 58). The delta C-13 values of G. blacki range from -15.9 parts per
   thousand to -17.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.5 +/- 0.4
   parts per thousand (n = 12), and the delta O-18 values vary from -5.9
   parts per thousand to -7.5 parts per thousand with an average of -6.6
   +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (n = 12).
   Conclusions: The isotopic data show Guangxi was characterized by closed
   C-3 forest and humid climate in the early Early Pleistocene. Niche
   partitioning is found among G. blacki, Sinomastodon, Ailuropoda and
   Stegodon, the typical megafauna in South China in the early Early
   Pleistocene. This could be one of the important factors for them to
   co-exist until the Middle Pleistocene. Smallest isotopic variations of
   G. blacki are found compared with those of contemporary animals,
   indicating a conservative foraging ecology i.e., limited foraging area
   and/or narrow dietary flexibility. Furthermore, the more confined
   foraging ecology of G. blacki is also seen in comparison with fossil and
   extant large-bodied primates. However, the unique dietary pattern of G.
   blacki does not seem to have hindered its survival. The environment in
   Guangxi during the early Early Pleistocene offered the suitable
   conditions for G. blacki to become one of the typical species in the
   faunal assemblages.},

Title = {Human burials at the Kisese II rockshelter, Tanzania},

Abstract = {Objectives: The Late Pleistocene and early Holocene in eastern Africa
   are associated with complex evolutionary and demographic processes that
   contributed to the population variability observed in the region today.
   However, there are relatively few human skeletal remains from this time
   period. Here we describe six individuals from the Kisese II rockshelter
   in Tanzania that were excavated in 1956, present a radiocarbon date for
   one of the individuals, and compare craniodental morphological diversity
   among eastern African populations.
   Materials and Methods: This study used standard biometric analyses to
   assess the age, sex, and stature of the Kisese II individuals. Eastern
   African craniodental morphological variation was assessed using measures
   of dental size and a subset of Howells' cranial measurements for the
   Kisese II individuals as well as early Holocene, early pastoralist,
   Pastoral Neolithic, and modern African individuals.
   Results: Our results suggest a minimum of six individuals from the
   Kisese II collections with two adults and four juveniles. While the
   dating for most of the burials is uncertain, one individual is directly
   radiocarbon dated to similar to 7.1 ka indicating that at least one
   burial is early Holocene in age. Craniodental metric comparisons
   indicate that the Kisese II individuals extend the amount of human
   morphological diversity among Holocene eastern Africans.
   Conclusions: Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that
   Late Pleistocene and early Holocene eastern Africans exhibited
   relatively high amounts of morphological diversity. However, the Kisese
   II individuals suggest morphological similarity at localized sites
   potentially supporting increased regionalization during the early
   Holocene.},

Title = {Sex estimation of teeth at different developmental stages using

Abstract = {Objectives: This study tests, for the first time, the applicability of a
   new method of sex estimation utilizing enamel peptides on a sample of
   deciduous and permanent teeth at different stages of mineralization,
   from nonadults of unknown sex, including perinates.
   Materials and methods: A total of 43 teeth from 29 nonadult individuals
   aged from 40 gestational weeks to 19 years old were analyzed. The sample
   included pairs of fully mineralized and just developing teeth from the
   same individual. The individuals were from four archaeological sites in
   England: Piddington (1st-2nd centuries AD), Coach Lane, Victoria Gate,
   and Fewston (all 18th-19th centuries). A method that identifies sex
   chromosome-linked isoforms of the peptide amelogenin from human tooth
   enamel was applied. The method utilizes a minimally destructive acid
   etching procedure and subsequent nano liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry.
   Results: It was possible to determine the sex of 28 of the nonadult
   individuals sampled (males = 20, females = 8, undetermined = 1). Only
   one sample failed (CL9), due to insufficient mineralization of the
   sampled tooth enamel. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with
   identifier PXD021683.
   Discussion: Sufficient peptide material to determine sex can be
   recovered even from the crowns of developing perinatal teeth that are
   not fully mineralized. The minimally destructive and inexpensive
   (compared to ancient DNA) nature of this procedure has significant
   implications for bioarchaeological studies of infancy and childhood.},

Title = {Testing the Giles hypothesis using geometric morphometrics},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {744-751},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives The Giles hypothesis posits that differences in the cranial
   morphology of Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla are largely the result
   of allometric scaling. However, previous support for the Giles
   hypothesis was based on bivariate plots of linear measurements. This
   investigation uses geometric morphometric methods to retest this
   hypothesis and its prediction that extending the ontogenetic trajectory
   of a chimpanzee would produce an adult gorilla-like cranial morphology.
   Materials and Methods Forty-three 3D cranial landmarks were collected
   from an ontogenetic series of 76 Pan troglodytes and 58 Gorilla gorilla
   specimens. Ontogenetic trajectories of cranial shape change were
   computed via multivariate regression of Procrustes aligned coordinates
   against LnCS (size vector) and molar eruption stage (developmental
   vector). These two vectors were then used in developmental simulations
   to extend the ontogenetic trajectories of adult chimpanzees. Allometric
   trajectories of chimpanzees and gorillas were also directly compared
   using Procrustes ANOVA.
   Results Pan and Gorilla significantly differ in their allometric
   trajectories, and none of the Pan developmental simulations resembled
   actual adult gorillas. Additionally, the more the Pan developmental
   vector was extended, the more morphologically distinct the simulations
   became from actual adult gorillas.
   Discussion Taken together, these results do not support the Giles
   hypothesis that allometric scaling is primarily responsible for observed
   morphological differences between chimpanzee and gorilla crania. This
   investigation demonstrates that neither ``growing{''} a chimpanzee to
   the size of a gorilla, nor extending a chimpanzee's developmental shape
   trajectory will result in an adult gorilla-like cranial morphology as
   they differ in their patterns of allometry.},

Abstract = {Skin color is the primary physical criterion by which people have been
   classified into groups in the Western scientific tradition. From the
   earliest classifications of Linnaeus, skin color labels were not neutral
   descriptors, but connoted meanings that influenced the perceptions of
   described groups. In this article, the history of the use of skin color
   is reviewed to show how the imprint of history in connection with a
   single trait influenced subsequent thinking about human diversity. Skin
   color was the keystone trait to which other physical, behavioral, and
   culture characteristics were linked. To most naturalists and
   philosophers of the European Enlightenment, skin color was influenced by
   the external environment and expressed an inner state of being. It was
   both the effect and the cause. Early investigations of skin color and
   human diversity focused on understanding the central polarity between
   ``white{''} Europeans and nonwhite others, with most attention devoted
   to explaining the origin and meaning of the blackness of Africans.
   Consistently negative associations with black and darkness influenced
   philosophers David Hume and Immanuel Kant to consider Africans as less
   than fully human and lacking in personal agency. Hume and Kant's views
   on skin color, the integrity of separate races, and the lower status of
   Africans provided support to diverse political, economic, and religious
   constituencies in Europe and the Americas interested in maintaining the
   transatlantic slave trade and upholding chattel slavery. The mental
   constructs and stereotypes of color-based races remained, more strongly
   in some places than others, after the abolition of the slave trade and
   of slavery. The concept of color-based hierarchies of people arranged
   from the superior light-colored people to inferior dark-colored ones
   hardened during the late seventeenth century and have been reinforced by
   diverse forces ever since. These ideas manifest themselves as racism,
   colorism, and in the development of implicit bias. Current knowledge of
   the evolution of skin color and of the historical development of
   color-based race concepts should inform all levels of formal and
   informal education. Awareness of the influence of color memes and race
   ideation in general on human behavior and the conduct of science is
   important.},

Abstract = {Objectives Primates exhibit variation in rates of growth and
   development. Variation in female growth and development across ape
   species appears to be explained by the Ecological Risk Aversion
   Hypothesis (ERAH). Indeed, existing data on variation in somatic growth
   and reproductive maturation between humans' closest living ape
   relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, appear to be consistent with this
   hypothesis. However, existing data on behavioral maturation between the
   two species appear to contradict this hypothesis. We present novel
   behavioral data on infant and juvenile females from wild populations of
   both species in order to further evaluate predictions of the ERAH as it
   relates to the speed of behavioral maturation.
   Materials and methods We analyzed 3 years of behavioral data on 17
   female bonobos (<8 years of age) from LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of
   the Congo and 40 years of behavioral data on 30 age-matched female
   chimpanzees from Gombe, Tanzania. We compared the timing of (a) the
   attainment of independence from mothers and (b) the development of
   social skills using the following proxies: proximity between females and
   their mothers and the time that females spent engaged in eating,
   suckling, social play, social grooming, and riding on their mothers.
   Results We did not find species differences in the proportion of time
   that females spent in contact with their mothers or engaged in eating,
   suckling, social play, or social grooming. Female bonobos spent more
   time riding on their mothers than did female chimpanzees. Female bonobos
   spent more time at distances greater than 5 m from their mothers during
   the ages of 3-8 years, but females did not differ during the ages of 0-3
   years.
   Discussion Behavioral maturation is largely similar between females of
   the two species based on the ages and proxies considered herein. We
   propose alternative explanations for the differences that we found in
   proximity and riding that do not invoke differences in underlying rates
   of maturation.},

Abstract = {Objective We aim to identify maternal genetic affinities between the
   Middle to Final Neolithic (3850-2300 BC) populations from present-day
   Poland and possible genetic influences from the Pontic steppe. Materials
   and methods We conducted ancient DNA studies from populations associated
   with Zlota, Globular Amphora, Funnel Beaker, and Corded Ware cultures
   (CWC). We sequenced genomic libraries on Illumina platform to generate
   86 complete ancient mitochondrial genomes. Some of the samples were
   enriched for mitochondrial DNA using hybridization capture. Results The
   maternal genetic composition found in Zlota-associated individuals
   resembled that found in people associated with the Globular Amphora
   culture which indicates that both groups likely originated from the same
   maternal genetic background. Further, these two groups were closely
   related to the Funnel Beaker culture-associated population. None of
   these groups shared a close affinity to CWC-associated people.
   Haplogroup U4 was present only in the CWC group and absent in Zlota
   group, Globular Amphora, and Funnel Beaker cultures. Discussion The
   prevalence of mitochondrial haplogroups of Neolithic farmer origin
   identified in Early, Middle and Late Neolithic populations suggests a
   genetic continuity of these maternal lineages in the studied area.
   Although overlapping in time - and to some extent - in cultural
   expressions, none of the studied groups (Zlota, Globular Amphora, Funnel
   Beaker), shared a close genetic affinity to CWC-associated people,
   indicating a larger extent of cultural influence from the Pontic steppe
   than genetic exchange. The higher frequency of haplogroup U5b found in
   populations associated with Funnel Beaker, Globular Amphora, and Zlota
   cultures suggest a gradual maternal genetic influx from Mesolithic
   hunter-gatherers. Moreover, presence of haplogroup U4 in Corded Ware
   groups is most likely associated with the migrations from the Pontic
   steppe at the end of the Neolithic and supports the observed genetic
   distances.},

Abstract = {Objectives Previously developed methods in subadult body mass estimation
   have not been tested in populations other than European-American or
   African-American. This study uses a contemporary Taiwanese sample to
   test these methods. Through evaluating their accuracy and bias, we
   addressed whether the allometric relationships between body mass and
   skeletal traits commonly used in subadult body mass estimation are
   conserved among different populations.
   Materials and Methods Computed tomography scans of lower limbs from
   individuals aged 0-17 years old of both sexes were collected from
   National Taiwan University Hospital along with documented body weight.
   Polar second moment of area, distal femoral metaphyseal breadth, and
   maximum superior/inferior femoral head diameter were collected either
   directly from the scans or from reconstructed 3D models. Estimated body
   mass was compared with documented body mass to assess the performance of
   the equations.
   Results Current methods provided good body mass estimates in Taiwanese
   individuals, with accuracy and bias similar to those reported in other
   validation studies. A tendency for increasing error with increasing age
   was observed for all methods. Reduced major axis regression showed the
   allometric relationships between different skeletal traits and body mass
   across different age categories can all be summarized using a common
   fitted line. A revised, maximum likelihood-based approach was proposed
   for all skeletal traits.
   Discussion The results suggested that the allometric relationships
   between body mass and different skeletal traits are largely conserved
   among populations. The revised method provided improved applicability
   with strong underlying theoretical justifications, and potential for
   future improvements.},

Title = {Novel strategies for the characterization of cancellous bone morphology:
   Virtual isolation and analysis},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {920-930},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives The advent of micro-computed tomography (mu CT) made
   cancellous bone more accessible than ever before. Nevertheless, the
   characterization of cancellous bone is made difficult by its inherent
   complexity and the difficulties in defining homology across datasets.
   Here we propose novel virtual methodological approaches to overcome
   those issues and complement existing methods.
   Materials and methods We present a protocol for the isolation of the
   whole cancellous region within a mu CT scanned bone. This method
   overcomes the subsampling issues and allows studying cancellous bone as
   a single unit. We test the protocol on a set of primate bones. In
   addition, we describe a set of morphological indices calculated on the
   topological skeleton of the cancellous bone: node density, node
   connectivity, trabecular angle, trabecular tortuosity, and fractal
   dimension. The usage of the indices is shown on a small comparative
   sample of primate femoral heads.
   Results The isolation protocol proves reliable in isolating cancellous
   structures from several different bones, regardless of their shape. The
   indices seem to detect some functional differences, although further
   testing on comparative samples is needed to clarify their potential for
   the study of cancellous architecture.
   Conclusions The approaches presented overcome some of the difficulties
   of trabecular bone studies. The methods presented here represent an
   alternative or supporting method to the existing tools available to
   address the biomechanics of cancellous bone.},

Title = {Fluctuating asymmetry, a marker of poor growth quality, is associated
   with adult male metabolic rate},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {646-655},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Life history theory, a branch of evolutionary theory,
   predicts the existence of trade-offs in energetic allocation between
   competing physiological functions. The core metabolic cost of
   self-maintenance, measured by resting metabolic rate (RMR), represents a
   large component of human daily energy expenditure. Despite strong
   selective pressures for energetic frugality and high observed
   interindividual variation in RMR, the link between RMR and energetic
   allocation to life-history traits remains understudied in humans.
   Materials In a sample of 105 (m = 57, f = 48), we investigated the
   relationship between adult RMR and investment in growth quality, as
   measured by fluctuating asymmetry (FA).
   Results Measurement of RMR and FA in university rowers revealed a
   significant positive correlation amongst males (n = 57, r = 0.344, p =
   0.005, 1-tailed; standardized 95\% CI, 0.090 to 0.598). Convincing
   evidence for a correlation among females was not found (n = 48, r =
   0.142, p = 0.169, 1-tailed, standardized 95\% CI, -0.152 to 0.435).
   Discussion The data suggest that low-quality asymmetrical growth is
   associated with later-life metabolic inefficiencies in males. Energetic
   investment in processes (likely concerning the stress-response)
   unrelated to growth during childhood may thereby trade-off against adult
   metabolic efficiency. We suggest that the presence of a relationship
   between RMR and FA in males but not females may be explained by the
   additional metabolic strain associated with larger body size and
   increased male muscularity, which may amplify the inefficiencies arising
   from low-quality growth.},

Title = {Geographic and temporal diversity in dental morphology reflects a
   history of admixture, isolation, and drift in African Americans},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives While genetic studies have documented variation in admixture
   proportions in contemporary African Americans across the US, relatively
   little is known about the socio-historical roots of this variation. Our
   goal in this study is to use dental morphology to explore the
   socio-historical correlates of admixture, localized gene flow, and drift
   in African Americans.
   Methods Our data are ordinally-graded dental morphological traits scored
   in 196 Africans, 335 Europeans and European Americans, 291
   pre-Spanish-contact Native Americans, and 722 African Americans. The
   African American data derived from contemporary and historic samples. We
   eliminated from analysis individuals and traits with greater than 20\%
   missing data. We summarized the major axes of trait variation using
   principal component analysis (PCA), estimated biological distance,
   constructed multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots of the distances, and
   measured the correlation between geographic and biological distance.
   Results In the PCA, African American groups clustered between Africans
   and Europeans on PC 1, reflecting admixture between the groups. PC 2
   separated African American samples, possibly reflecting movement,
   isolation, and drift. MDS analyses confirmed the existence of sizable
   biological distances between African American samples, especially
   between contemporary and past African American samples. We found no
   relationship between biological and geographic distances.
   Discussion We demonstrate that admixture and drift can be inferred from
   multi-variable analyses of patterns of dental morphology in admixed
   populations. Localized gene flow has not affected patterns of trait
   variation in African Americans, but long-range movement, isolation, and
   drift have. We connect patterns of dental trait variation to efforts to
   flee oppression during the Great Migration, and the repeal of
   anti-miscegenation laws.},

Title = {The evolution of the human trophic level during the Pleistocene},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The human trophic level (HTL) during the Pleistocene and its degree of
   variability serve, explicitly or tacitly, as the basis of many
   explanations for human evolution, behavior, and culture. Previous
   attempts to reconstruct the HTL have relied heavily on an analogy with
   recent hunter-gatherer groups' diets. In addition to technological
   differences, recent findings of substantial ecological differences
   between the Pleistocene and the Anthropocene cast doubt regarding that
   analogy's validity. Surprisingly little systematic evolution-guided
   evidence served to reconstruct HTL. Here, we reconstruct the HTL during
   the Pleistocene by reviewing evidence for the impact of the HTL on the
   biological, ecological, and behavioral systems derived from various
   existing studies. We adapt a paleobiological and paleoecological
   approach, including evidence from human physiology and genetics,
   archaeology, paleontology, and zoology, and identified 25 sources of
   evidence in total. The evidence shows that the trophic level of the Homo
   lineage that most probably led to modern humans evolved from a low base
   to a high, carnivorous position during the Pleistocene, beginning with
   Homo habilis and peaking in Homo erectus. A reversal of that trend
   appears in the Upper Paleolithic, strengthening in the
   Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic and Neolithic, and culminating with the advent
   of agriculture. We conclude that it is possible to reach a credible
   reconstruction of the HTL without relying on a simple analogy with
   recent hunter-gatherers' diets. The memory of an adaptation to a trophic
   level that is embedded in modern humans' biology in the form of
   genetics, metabolism, and morphology is a fruitful line of investigation
   of past HTLs, whose potential we have only started to explore.},

Title = {Fermented food consumption in wild nonhuman primates and its ecological

Abstract = {Objectives Although fermented food use is ubiquitous in humans, the
   ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to its emergence are
   unclear. Here we investigated the ecological contexts surrounding the
   consumption of fruits in the late stages of fermentation by wild
   primates to provide insight into its adaptive function. We hypothesized
   that climate, socioecological traits, and habitat patch size would
   influence the occurrence of this behavior due to effects on the
   environmental prevalence of late-stage fermented foods, the ability of
   primates to detect them, and potential nutritional benefits.
   Materials and methods We compiled data from field studies lasting at
   least 9 months to describe the contexts in which primates were observed
   consuming fruits in the late stages of fermentation. Using generalized
   linear mixed-effects models, we assessed the effects of 18 predictor
   variables on the occurrence of fermented food use in primates.
   Results Late-stage fermented foods were consumed by a wide taxonomic
   breadth of primates. However, they generally made up 0.01\%-3\% of the
   annual diet and were limited to a subset of fruit species, many of which
   are reported to have mechanical and chemical defenses against herbivores
   when not fermented. Additionally, late-stage fermented food consumption
   was best predicted by climate and habitat patch size. It was more likely
   to occur in larger habitat patches with lower annual mean rainfall and
   higher annual mean maximum temperatures.
   Discussion We posit that primates capitalize on the natural fermentation
   of some fruits as part of a nutritional strategy to maximize periods of
   fruit exploitation and/or access a wider range of plant species. We
   speculate that these factors contributed to the evolutionary emergence
   of the human propensity for fermented foods.},

Title = {An inconstant biorhythm: The changing pace of Retzius periodicity in
   human permanent teeth},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1},
Pages = {172-186},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives Human tooth enamel retains evidence of growth in the form of
   Retzius lines. The number of daily growth increments between the
   regularly occurring lines defines their repeat interval, or periodicity.
   Retzius periodicity is often incorporated into enamel formation times,
   age-at-death reconstructions, or used to provide a basis from which to
   explore an underlying biorhythm. Biological anthropologists typically
   assume that RP remains constant within an individual and does not vary
   along the tooth-row. Here, we test that assumption.
   Materials and methods RP was calculated from n = 223 thin sections of
   human permanent teeth from individuals of British and southern African
   origin. Forty individuals provided multiple teeth (n = 102 teeth) and a
   further 121 individuals each provided a single tooth.
   Results We report first evidence that RP of permanent teeth does not
   always remain constant within an individual. Of those individuals that
   provided multiple teeth, 42\% (n = 17/40) demonstrated a decrease in RP
   along the tooth row, with most shifting by two or more days (n = 11).
   Across the entire sample, mean RP of anterior teeth was significantly
   higher than molars. Mean premolar RP tended to be intermediate between
   anterior teeth and molars.
   Discussion Our data do not support the assumption that RP invariably
   remains constant within the permanent teeth of an individual.
   Transferring RP from molars to incisors within an individual can result
   in a miscalculation of formation time and age-at-death by up to 1 year.
   Implications for biological anthropologists and the source of the
   underlying long period biorhythm are discussed.},

Title = {Technical note: Estimating original crown height in worn mandibular

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {176},

Pages = {692-702},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a novel method to estimate original crown height (OCH) for
   worn human mandibular canines using a cubic regression equation based on
   ratios of worn crown height and exposed dentin. This method may help
   alleviate issues frequently presented by worn teeth in dental analyses,
   including those in bioarchaeology. Mandibular canines (n = 28) from
   modern day New Zealand and English populations were selected. Crown
   height and dentin thickness were measured on dental thin sections (n =
   19) and the resulting (log10) ratios were fitted to a cubic regression
   curve allowing OCH in worn crowns to be predicted. Variation in the
   dentin apex position was recorded and effects of angled wear slopes
   investigated allowing adjusted values to be generated. Our method is
   trialed for use on intact and sectioned teeth (n = 17). A cubic
   regression curve best describes the relationship between (log10) ratios
   and crown height deciles (R-2 = 0.996, df(1) = 3, df(2) = 336, p <
   0.001). No significant differences were detected between OCH estimates
   using our method and digitally recreated cusp outlines of the same
   crowns (t = 1.024, df = 16, p > 0.05), with a mean absolute error of
   0.171 mm and an adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.923. Our
   approach offers a quantitative method to estimate the percentage of OCH
   remaining on worn mandibular canines, and by extension, the OCH. Our
   estimates are comparable to digitally recreated cusps but less
   subjective and not limited to crowns with minimal wear.},

Abstract = {Objectives During the Middle Ages, Portugal witnessed unprecedented
   socioeconomic and religious changes under transitioning religious
   political rule. The implications of changing ruling powers for urban
   food systems and individual diets in medieval Portugal is poorly
   understood. This study aimed to elucidate the dietary impact of the
   Islamic and Christian conquests.
   Materials and Methods Radiocarbon dating, peptide mass fingerprinting
   (ZooMS) and stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of animal
   (n = 59) and human skeletal remains (n = 205) from Muslim and Christian
   burials were used to characterize the diet of a large historical sample
   from Portugal. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (BSIMM) was used
   to estimate the contribution of marine protein to human diet.
   Results Early medieval (8-12th century), preconquest urban Muslim
   populations had mean (+/- 1SD) values of -18.8 +/- 0.4 parts per
   thousand for delta C-13 10.4 +/- 1 parts per thousand for delta N-15,
   indicating a predominantly terrestrial diet, while late medieval
   (12-14th century) postconquest Muslim and Christian populations showed a
   greater reliance on marine resources with mean (+/- 1SD) values of -17.9
   +/- 1.3 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 11.1 +/- 1.1 parts per
   thousand for delta N-15. BSIMM estimation supported a significant
   increase in the contribution of marine resources to human diet.
   Discussion The results provide the first biomolecular evidence for a
   dietary revolution that is not evidenced in contemporaneous historical
   accounts. We find that society transitioned from a largely agro-pastoral
   economy under Islamic rule to one characterized by a new focus on marine
   resources under later Christian rule. This economic change led to the
   naissance of the marine economy that went on to characterize the
   early-modern period in Portugal and its global expansion.},

Title = {Evidence for a sensitive period of plasticity in brown adipose tissue
   during early childhood among indigenous Siberians},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {834-846},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Evolutionary theorists have debated the adaptive significance
   of developmental plasticity in organisms with long lifespans such as
   humans. This debate in part stems from uncertainty regarding the timing
   of sensitive periods. Does sensitivity to environmental signals
   fluctuate across development or does it steadily decline? We
   investigated developmental plasticity in brown adipose tissue (BAT)
   among indigenous Siberians in order to explore the timing of phenotypic
   sensitivity to cold stress.
   Methods BAT thermogenesis was quantified using infrared thermal imaging
   in 78 adults (25 men; 33 women). Cold exposure during gestation,
   infancy, early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence was
   quantified using: (1) the average ambient temperature across each
   period; (2) the number of times daily temperature dropped below -40
   degrees F during each period. We also assessed past cold exposure with a
   retrospective survey of participation in outdoor activities.
   Results Adult BAT thermogenesis was significantly associated with the
   average temperature (p = 0.021), the number of times it was below -40
   degrees F (p = 0.026), and participation in winter outdoor activities (p
   = 0.037) during early childhood.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that early childhood represents an
   important stage for developmental plasticity, and that culture may play
   a critical role in shaping the timing of environmental signals. The
   findings highlight a new pathway through which the local consequences of
   global climate change may influence human biology, and they suggest that
   ambient temperature may represent an understudied component of the
   developmental origins of health and disease.},

Title = {Shorter distal forelimbs benefit bipedal walking and running mechanics:
   Implications for hominin forelimb evolution},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {589-598},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Brachial index is a skeletal ratio that describes the
   relative length of the distal forelimb. Over the course of hominin
   evolution, a shift toward smaller brachial indices occurred. First,
   Pleistocene australopiths yield values between extant chimpanzees and
   humans, with further evolution in Pliocene Homo to the modern human
   range. We hypothesized that shorter distal forelimbs benefit walking and
   running performance, notably elbow and shoulder joint torques, and
   predicted that the benefit would be greater in running compared to
   walking.
   Materials and methods We tested our hypothesis in a modern human sample
   walking and running while carrying hand weights, which increase the
   inertia (mass and effective length) of the distal forelimb, simulating a
   larger brachial index.
   Results We found longer distal forelimbs and the added mass increased
   elbow muscle torque by 98\% while walking and 70\% in running,
   confirming our hypothesis that shorter distal forelimbs benefit walking
   and running performance. Shoulder muscle torque similarly increased in
   both gaits with the addition of hand weights due to elongation of the
   effective forelimb length. Normalized elbow torque, which accounted for
   the effect on shoulder torque caused by the experimental manipulation,
   increased by 16\% while walking but 52\% while running, indicating that
   shorter distal forelimbs provide a greater benefit for running by
   approximately three-fold.
   Discussion Selection for economical bipedal walking in Australopithecus
   and endurance running in Homo likely contributed to the shift toward
   relatively smaller distal forelimbs across hominin evolution, with
   modern human proportions attained in Pleistocene Homo erectus and
   retained in later species.},

Title = {Neuromechanical linkage between the head and forearm during running},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},

Abstract = {Objectives The main objective was to test the hypothesis of a
   neuromechanical link in humans between the head and forearm during
   running mediated by the biceps brachii and superior trapezius muscles.
   We hypothesized that this linkage helps stabilize the head and combats
   rapid forward pitching during running which may interfere with gaze
   stability.
   Materials and methods Thirteen human participants walked and ran on a
   treadmill while motion capture recorded body segment kinematics and
   electromyographic sensors recorded muscle activation. To test
   perturbations to the linkage system we compared participants running
   normally as well as with added mass to the face and the hand.
   Results The results confirm the presence of a neuromechanical linkage
   between the head and forearm mediated by the biceps and superior
   trapezius during running but not during walking. In running, the biceps
   and superior trapezius activations were temporally linked during the
   stride cycle, and adding mass to either the head or hand increased
   activation in both muscles, consistent with our hypothesis. During
   walking the forces acting on the body segments and muscle activation
   levels were much smaller than during running, indicating no need for a
   linkage to keep the head and gaze stable.
   Discussion The results suggest that the evolution of long distance
   running in early Homo may have favored selection for reduced rotational
   inertia of both the head and forearm through synergistic muscle
   activation, contributing to the transition from australopith head and
   forelimb morphology to the more human-like form of Homo erectus.
   Selective pressures from the evolution of bipedal walking were likely
   much smaller, but may explain in part the intermediate form of the
   australopith scapula between that of extant apes and humans.},

Abstract = {Objectives This article presents new radiocarbon and isotopic data to
   provide further information about the diet of the indigenous population
   of La Gomera and its possible changes across time.
   Materials and methods delta C-13 and delta N-15 of 53 human and 19
   faunal samples from different sites on the island have been obtained and
   analyzed. Of these, 52 have been radiocarbon dated to provide insight on
   chronological changes.
   Results Human dates range from the 3rd to 15th centuries AD, while
   faunal dates range from the 1st to 17th centuries AD. Stable carbon and
   nitrogen values are significantly different between the human and goat
   samples and have also a trophic increase of 3.4 parts per thousand.
   Although male and female delta N-15 data are not significantly
   different. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of both human and
   animal samples tend to discretely decrease over time.
   Discussion Radiocarbon dates from humans correlate with other dates
   obtained in the rest of the archipelago. Animal radiocarbon dates
   generally coincide except for one date, which requires further study.
   Isotopic delta N-15 data suggest a mix of marine and terrestrial protein
   consumption in humans, the latter being more abundant given the
   seasonality of the first. delta C-13 data also suggest a possible mixed
   diet in humans, with a predominance of C-3 plants, like Hordeum vulgare,
   the only grain found in archaeological sites so far. Variations of both
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 over time suggest a slight modification on the
   diet, which could be related to environmental changes.},

Title = {Toward a bioarchaeology of urbanization: Demography, health, and

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {72},
Pages = {79-118},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urbanization is one of the most important settlement shifts in human
   history and has been the focus of research within bioarchaeology for
   decades. However, there have been limited attempts to synthesize the
   results of these studies in order to gain a broader perspective on
   whether or how urbanization affects the biology, demography, and
   behavior of humans, and how these potential effects are embodied in the
   human skeleton. This paper outlines how bioarchaeology is well-suited to
   examine urbanization in the past, and we provide an overview and
   examples of three main ways in which urbanization is studied in
   bioarchaeological research: comparison of (often contemporaneous) urban
   and rural sites, synchronic studies of the variation that exists within
   and between urban sites, and investigations of changes that occur within
   urban sites over time. Studies of urbanization, both within
   bioarchaeology and in other fields of study, face a number of
   limitations, including a lack of a consensus regarding what urban and
   urbanization mean, the assumed dichotomous nature of urban versus rural
   settlements, the supposition that urbanization is universally bad for
   people, and the assumption (at least in practice) of homogeneity within
   urban and rural populations. Bioarchaeologists can address these
   limitations by utilizing a wide array of data and methods, and the
   studies described here collectively demonstrate the complex, nuanced,
   and highly variable effects of urbanization.},

Title = {A Novel method for the identification and quantification of weight
   faltering},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1},
Pages = {282-291},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective We describe a new method for identifying and quantifying the
   magnitude and rate of short-term weight faltering episodes, and assess
   how (a) these episodes relate to broader growth outcomes, and (b)
   different data collection intervals influence the quantification of
   weight faltering.
   Materials and methods We apply this method to longitudinal growth data
   collected every other day across the first year of life in Gambian
   infants (n = 124, males = 65, females = 59). Weight faltering episodes
   are identified from velocity peaks and troughs. Rate of weight loss and
   regain, maximum weight loss, and duration of each episode were
   calculated. We systematically reduced our dataset to mimic various
   potential measurement intervals, to assess how these intervals affect
   the ability to derive information about short-term weight faltering
   episodes. We fit linear models to test whether metrics associated with
   growth faltering were associated with growth outcomes at 1 year, and
   generalized additive mixed models to determine whether different
   collection intervals influence episode identification and metrics.
   Results Three hundred weight faltering episodes from 119 individuals
   were identified. The number and magnitude of episodes negatively
   impacted growth outcomes at 1 year. As data collection interval
   increases, weight faltering episodes are missed and the duration of
   episodes is overestimated, resulting in the rate of weight loss and
   regain being underestimated.
   Conclusions This method identifies and quantifies short-term weight
   faltering episodes, that are in turn negatively associated with growth
   outcomes. This approach offers a tool for investigators interested in
   understanding how short-term weight faltering relates to longer-term
   outcomes.},

   notions of shared ancestry and ethnic identity have been shaped by
   centuries of migration and admixture. Materials and Methods We asked 507
   New Mexicans of Spanish-speaking descent (NMS) to list their ethnic
   identity and to estimate their percentages of European and Native
   American ancestry. We then compared self-estimates to estimates derived
   from 291,917 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and we examined how
   differences between the estimates varied by ethnic identity. Results
   Most NMS (94\%) predicted that they had non-zero percentages of European
   and Native American ancestry. Self-estimates and SNP-estimates were
   positively correlated (r(European) = 0.38, r(Native-American) = 0.36, p
   < 0.001). The correlations belie systematic patterns of underestimation
   and overestimation based on ethnic identity. NMS with ancestral ties to
   20th century immigrants, who identified as Mexican or Mexican American,
   often underestimated their European ancestry (self-estimate <
   SNP-estimate) and overestimated their Native American ancestry. The
   pattern was reversed for NMS who emphasized deep connections to colonial
   New Mexico and identified as Spanish or Spanish American. Discussion
   While NMS accurately predicted that they had European and Native
   American ancestry, they predicted ancestry percentages with only
   moderate accuracy. Differences between self-estimated and SNP-estimated
   ancestry were associated with ethnic identities that were shaped by
   migration to the region over the past 400 years. We connect ethnic
   identities and patterns of ancestry estimation to resistance to colonial
   hegemony and discuss the implications of our results for the
   construction of ethnic identities, now and in the past.},

Title = {Population history of Brazilian south and southeast shellmound builders
   inferred through dental morphology},

Abstract = {Objective The Southeast and South Coast of Brazil was inhabited during
   most of the Holocene by shellmound builders. Although there are cultural
   differences in the archaeological record between regions, it is still
   debatable how these differences may relate to different population
   histories. Here, we contribute to this discussion by exploring dental
   morphological affinities between several regional series.
   Materials and Methods Dental morphology of 385 individuals from 14
   archaeological sites was analyzed using the Arizona State University
   Dental Anthropology System. Fifteen traits were used to explore
   morphological affinities among series through Euclidean distance, Mean
   Measure of Divergence, and Principal Component Analysis. Mantel matrix
   correlation and partial correlation tests were used to examine the
   association between biological, geographic, and chronological distances.
   Results Morphological affinities show that ceramic and nonceramic South
   Coast groups cluster and differ from most Southeast series. In contrast,
   Southeast coastal and riverine groups display high morphological
   variance, showing less biological coherence among them. These biological
   distances between regions are partially explained by geography, but not
   by chronology.
   Conclusions The results support that these coastal populations were
   low-mobility groups. Although interactions between individuals of
   different regions likely existed, gene flow occurred mostly among
   individuals from local or adjacent areas. The introduction of ceramic in
   the South Coast is not associated with changes in dental morphology
   patterns, suggesting its adoption is not exclusively associated with the
   arrival of different biological groups. Southeast coastal and riverine
   groups show high phenotypic diversity, suggesting a different history of
   human occupation and cultural development than observed in the South
   Coast.},

Title = {Medieval injuries: Skeletal trauma as an indicator of past living
   conditions and hazard risk in Cambridge, England},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {626-645},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective To explore how medieval living conditions, occupation, and an
   individual's role within society impacted their risk of skeletal trauma.
   Materials The skeletal remains of 314 individuals from medieval
   Cambridge that were buried in the parish cemetery of All Saints by the
   Castle (n = 84), the Augustinian friary (n = 75), and the cemetery of
   the Hospital of St John the Evangelist (n = 155) were analyzed.
   Methods Macroscopic examination and plain radiographs were used to
   classify fracture type. The causative mechanisms and forces applied to a
   bone were inferred based on fracture morphology.
   Results The skeletal trauma observed represents accidental injuries,
   likely sustained through occupational or everyday activities, and
   violence. The highest prevalence rate was observed on the individuals
   buried at All Saints by the Castle (44\%, n = 37/84), and the lowest was
   seen at the Hospital of St John (27\%, n = 42/155). Fractures were more
   prevalent in males (40\%, n = 57/143) than females (26\%, n = 25/95).
   Conclusions Skeletal trauma was highest in All Saints parish burial
   ground, indicating that the poor, whether working urban or rurally, had
   the highest risk of injury. The pattern and types of fractures observed
   suggests that males experienced more severe traumatic events than
   females. However, females that were routinely involved in manual labor
   were also at increased risk of injury.
   Significance This article enhances our understanding of how traumatic
   injuries differed by age, sex, and burial locations in the medieval
   period.
   Further research Additional comparative studies in different
   geographical regions are needed to determine how representative these
   findings are.},

Title = {Comparing semi-landmarking approaches for analyzing three-dimensional

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1},
Pages = {227-237},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives Increased use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging data has led
   to a need for methods capable of capturing rich shape descriptions.
   Semi-landmarks have been demonstrated to increase shape information but
   placement in 3D can be time consuming, computationally expensive, or may
   introduce artifacts. This study implements and compares three strategies
   to more densely sample a 3D image surface.
   Materials and methods Three dense sampling strategies: patch,
   patch-thin-plate spline (TPS), and pseudo-landmark sampling, are
   implemented to analyze skulls from three species of great apes. To
   evaluate the shape information added by each strategy, the semi or
   pseudo-landmarks are used to estimate a transform between an individual
   and the population average template. The average mean root squared error
   between the transformed mesh and the template is used to quantify the
   success of the transform.
   Results The landmark sets generated by each method result in estimates
   of the template that on average were comparable or exceeded the accuracy
   of using manual landmarks alone. The patch method demonstrates the most
   sensitivity to noise and missing data, resulting in outliers with large
   deviations in the mean shape estimates. Patch-TPS and pseudo-landmarking
   provide more robust performance in the presence of noise and variability
   in the dataset.
   Conclusions Each landmarking strategy was capable of producing shape
   estimations of the population average templates that were generally
   comparable to manual landmarks alone while greatly increasing the
   density of the shape information. This study highlights the potential
   trade-offs between correspondence of the semi-landmark points,
   consistent point spacing, sample coverage, repeatability, and
   computational time.},

Title = {Sexual dimorphism in the size and shape of the non-obstetric pelvis
   across anthropoids},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives The presence of sexual dimorphism in the birth canals of
   anthropoid primates is well documented, and birth canal dimorphism tends
   to be especially robust among species that give birth to relatively
   large neonates. However, it is less clear whether birth canal dimorphism
   is accompanied by dimorphism in parts of the pelvis not directly under
   selection for birth, particularly including bi-iliac breadth,
   biactetabular breadth, lengths of the ischium and ilium, and 3D shape.
   This study investigates the patterns of dimorphism among anthropoid
   primates in those parts of the pelvis which do not directly contribute
   to the bony birth canal, here termed the non-obstetric pelvis. Methods
   3D landmark data were collected on the bony pelves of 899 anthropoid
   primates. Specifically, landmark data were collected on parts of the
   pelvis not thought to be directly involved in selection for parturition,
   including portions of the posterior and superior ilium, acetabulum, and
   lateral ischium. Principal components analysis and Euclidean distance
   matrix analysis were used to ascertain sexual dimorphism in pelvic sizes
   and shapes within each species. Results Results show that dimorphism in
   non-obstetric pelvic size and shape exists across anthropoids, just as
   is seen in the birth canal. However, the magnitude of dimorphism in
   non-obstetric pelvic shape tends to be greater among anthropoid species
   that give birth to relatively large neonates compared with those
   birthing smaller neonates relative to maternal pelvic size. Conclusions
   Though all anthropoids included in the study show some degree of sexual
   dimorphism in non-obstetric pelvic size and/or shape, species which give
   birth to large neonates relative to maternal pelvic size have the
   highest levels of dimorphism in pelvic shape. Moreover, the magnitude of
   dimorphism in certain parts of the non-obstetric pelvis mirrors patterns
   seen in the birth canal. The results of this study are promising for
   ascertaining pelvic dimorphism and relative neonate size in fossil
   primates, particularly in fragmentary remains which do not preserve a
   complete bony birth canal.},

Title = {Technical note: Artificial Resynthesis Technology for the experimental

Abstract = {Dental microwear formation on the posterior dentition is largely
   attributed to an organism's diet. However, some have suggested that
   dietary and environmental abrasives contribute more to the formation
   process than food, calling into question the applicability of dental
   microwear to the reconstruction of diet in the fossil record. Creating
   microwear under controlled conditions would benefit this debate, but
   requires accurately replicating the oral environment. This study tests
   the applicability of Artificial Resynthesis Technology (ART 5) to create
   microwear textures while mitigating the challenges of past research. ART
   5 is a simulator that replicates the chewing cycle, responds to changes
   in food texture, and simulates the actions of the oral cavity.
   Surgically extracted, occluding pairs of third molars (n = 2 pairs) were
   used in two chewing experiments: one with dried beef and another with
   sand added to the dried beef. High-resolution molds were taken at 0, 50,
   100, 2500, and 5000 simulated chewing cycles, which equates to
   approximately 1 week of chewing. Preliminary results show that ART 5
   produces microwear textures. Meat alone may produce enamel prism rod
   exposure at 5000 cycles, although attrition cannot be ruled out. Meat
   with sand accelerates the wear formation process, with enamel prism rods
   quickly obliterated and ``pit-and-scratch{''} microwear forming at
   approximately 2500 cycles. Future work with ART 5 will incorporate a
   more thorough experimental protocol with improved controls, pH of the
   simulated oral environment, and grit measurements; however, these
   results indicate the potential of ART 5 in untangling the complex
   variables of dental microwear formation.},

Title = {Testing the reliability of CT scan-based dental wear magnitude scoring},

Abstract = {Objectives Digital models are now frequently used in biological
   anthropology (bioanthropology) research. Despite several studies
   validating this type of research, none has examined if the assessment of
   dental wear magnitude based on Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is
   reliable. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap and assess if dental
   wear magnitude scoring based on CT scans provides results consistent
   with scoring based on direct observation of the physical specimens.
   Materials and Methods Dental wear magnitude from 412 teeth of 35
   mandibles originating from the Portuguese Muge and Sado Mesolithic
   shell-middens was scored. The mandibles were also CT scanned and
   visualized using 3D Slicer. CT scan-based scoring of dental wear
   magnitude was then undertaken. Two scoring rounds were undertaken for
   each observation method (totaling four scoring rounds) and an
   intra-observer error test was performed. The averaged results of the two
   observation methods were compared via boxplots with paired cases.
   Results Intra-observer error was negligible and non-significant. Scoring
   results are comparable between the two observation methods.
   Notwithstanding, some differences were found, in which CT scan
   assessment generally overestimates dental wear when compared to direct
   observation. Discussion Our results generally validate the use of CT
   scans in studies of dental wear magnitude. Notwithstanding several
   caveats relating to CT scanning and visualization limitations should be
   considered to avoid over or under-estimation of dental wear.},

Abstract = {Objectives One of the most contentious issues in paleoanthropology is
   the nature of the last common ancestor of humans and our closest living
   relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos (panins). The numerical composition
   of the vertebral column has featured prominently, with multiple models
   predicting distinct patterns of evolution and contexts from which
   bipedalism evolved. Here, we study total numbers of vertebrae from a
   large sample of hominoids to quantify variation in and patterns of
   regional and total numbers of vertebrae in hominoids. Materials and
   Methods We compile and study a large sample (N = 893) of hominoid
   vertebral formulae (numbers of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral,
   caudal segments in each specimen) and analyze full vertebral formulae,
   total numbers of vertebrae, and super-regional numbers of vertebrae:
   presacral (cervical, thoracic, lumbar) vertebrae and sacrococcygeal
   vertebrae. We quantify within- and between-taxon variation using
   heterogeneity and similarity measures derived from population genetics.
   Results We find that humans are most similar to African apes in total
   and super-regional numbers of vertebrae. Additionally, our analyses
   demonstrate that selection for bipedalism reduced variation in numbers
   of vertebrae relative to other hominoids. Discussion The only proposed
   ancestral vertebral configuration for the last common ancestor of
   hominins and panins that is consistent with our results is the modal
   formula demonstrated by chimpanzees and bonobos (7 cervical-13
   thoracic-4 lumbar-6 sacral-3 coccygeal). Hox gene expression boundaries
   suggest that a rostral shift in Hox10/Hox11-mediated complexes could
   produce the human modal formula from the proposal ancestral and panin
   modal formula.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Genetic drift and admixture are driving forces in human
   evolution, but their concerted impact to population evolution in
   historical times and at a micro-geographic scale is poorly assessed. In
   this study we test a demographic model encompassing both admixture and
   drift to the case of social-cultural isolates such as the so-called
   ``Commons.{''}
   Materials and methods: Commons are peculiar institutions of medieval
   origins whose key feature is the tight relationship between population
   and territory, mediated by the collective property of shared resources.
   Here, we analyze the Y-chromosomal genetic structure of four Commons
   (for a total of 366 samples) from the Central and Eastern Padana plain
   in Northern Italy.
   Results: Our results reveal that all these groups exhibit patterns of
   significant diversity reduction, peripheral/outlier position within the
   Italian/European genetic space and high frequency of Common-specific
   haplogroups. By explicitly testing different drift-admixture models, we
   show that a drift-only model is more probable for Central Padana
   Commons, while additional admixture (similar to 20\%) from external
   population around the same time of their foundation cannot be excluded
   for the Eastern ones.
   Discussion: Building on these results, we suggest central Middle Ages as
   the most probable age of foundation for three of the considered Commons,
   the remaining one pointing to late antiquity. We conclude that an
   admixture-drift model is particularly useful for interpreting the
   genetic structure and recent demographic history of small-scale
   populations in which social-cultural features play a significant role.},

Abstract = {Objectives We investigated the diversity of the pygmy marmoset, Cebuella
   pygmaea, by comparing genetic, morphological and pelage traits of
   animals from Peru and Ecuador.
   Materials and Methods We extracted DNA from museum specimen osteocrusts
   and from fecal samples collected from free-ranging individuals. We
   sequenced the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and the control region from
   samples collected at 13 different sites and used Bayesian inference and
   Maximum Likelihood to identify distinct clades. We took measurements of
   the crania of a subset of these specimens (n = 26) and ran a logistic
   regression to determine if any of the cranial measurements (n = 22)
   could predict a specimen's clade. In addition, we examined the pelage
   patterns of the museum specimens and photographs taken of free-ranging
   individuals and divided them into pelage types based on coloration of
   the underbelly.
   Results We identified two divergent clades, and two distinct groups with
   clear geographic boundaries within one of those clades. Two measurements
   of the zygomatic bone perfectly predicted a given individual's mtDNA
   clade. We found four distinct pelage patterns in our samples, but these
   patterns are variable within clades and among individuals within the
   same population.
   Conclusion These analyses indicate that the two recognized subspecies of
   pygmy marmoset should be elevated to the species level (C. pygmaea and
   C. niveiventris) based on molecular and cranial differences but not on
   pelage patterns. We provide evidence on the geographic limits of the two
   clades and identify regions where additional sampling is required to
   better define the geographic distribution of the two clades.},

Title = {The need to incorporate human variation and evolutionary theory in
   forensic anthropology: A call for reform},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {4},
Pages = {672-683},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In 1992, Norm Sauer called for a language shift in which practitioners
   would move away from the socially loaded term ``race{''} and replace it
   with the less provocative term ``ancestry.{''} While many heeded the
   call and moved towards ancestry in their research and reports, the
   actual approach to research and analysis did not change. In response to
   this change, there was a large growth in ancestry estimation method
   development in the early decade of the 2000s. However, the practice of
   ancestry estimation did not adequately incorporate evolutionary theory
   in interpretation or trait selection and continued with little critical
   reflection. In the past decade, there has been an increase in ancestry
   validation methods with little critique of the ``race{''} concept or
   discussion of modern human variation or reference samples. To advance,
   forensic anthropologists need to reckon with the practice of ancestry
   estimation as it is currently practiced. We are calling for another
   reform in the axiom focusing on evolutionary theory, population history,
   trait selection, and population-level reference samples. The practice
   needs to abandon the terms ancestry and race completely and recalibrate
   to an analysis of population affinity. Population affinity is a
   statistical approach based on the underlying population structure that
   would allow the understanding of how microevolutionary forces act in
   concert with historical events (e.g., colonization, the Transatlantic
   Slave Trade, etc.) to shape modern human variation. This is not to be
   confused with geographic ancestry that all too often can be perceived as
   interchangeable with social race and as an affirmation of the biological
   concept of race. It is time to critically evaluate the social and
   scientific implications of the current practice of ancestry estimation,
   and re-frame our approach to studying and analyzing modern human

Title = {Conventional microscopy makes perikymata count and spacing data feasible

Abstract = {Objectives Current methods of quantifying defects of dental enamel (DDE)
   include either gross or low-level examination for linear enamel
   hypoplasia, histological analysis of striae of Retzius, or scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) of a tooth or a tooth cast. Gross examination
   has been shown to miss many defects. Other methods can be destructive,
   require transporting samples, and are expensive. Here, we show that
   digital light microscopy (DLM) can be used for the analysis of DDE as
   indicated by widened perikymata spacing (WPS). This method takes
   advantage of high-power (100x) microscopy, but is non-destructive, can
   be implemented almost anywhere, and is inexpensive. Materials and
   Methods As proof of concept, we created photomontages of labial surfaces
   of five human canines from images made using DLM and SEM. We counted and
   measured the widths of all visible perikymata for each imaging modality
   and fit measurements to a negative curve representing the expected
   values for each tooth. We calculated residuals for each measurement. WPS
   were defined when R-2 was in the 90th percentile, and were considered
   matched in DLM and SEM images when observed within the same decile of
   the tooth surface. Results There were more WPS detected in the images
   derived from DLM than from SEM. Overall, the data derived from the two
   imaging modalities provided similar information about the frequency and
   timing of stress during dental development. Conclusions The method
   described here allows for DDE data acquisition as WPS from large
   samples, making feasible population-level studies that reflect
   sophisticated understanding of dental development.},

Title = {The Human Bone Collection of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University

   skeletal remains},

Abstract = {Objectives The present work describes the status and contents of The
   Human Bone Collection of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of
   Hong Kong.
   Materials and methods The Collection originates from the 1980s and
   became officially established in 2017 for teaching and research
   purposes. Most of the Collection consists of unclaimed human remains of
   southern Chinese individuals exhumed from local cemeteries and donated
   to the Faculty in the last few decades. The demographic information was
   provided largely from burial records and forensic estimations. Since
   2016, the Collection has undergone a process of reorganization into
   cranial and postcranial remains, followed by preservation procedures
   that included cleaning and classification.
   Results The Collection currently consists of remains belonging to about
   368 individuals (243 males, 54 females, 71 unknown), with ages ranging
   from 0.8 to 90 years (mean 57.4 years). It comprises cranial remains
   belonging to 260 individuals (169 males, 39 females, 52 unknown), and
   postcranial remains belonging to 248 individuals (180 males, 42 females,
   26 unknown). The preservation status ranges from poor to good, with the
   cranial remains better preserved than the postcranial elements. For a
   large number of individuals, ear ossicles, soil samples, and other
   materials are also available.
   Discussion The Collection is accessible to local and international
   institutions for teaching and research.},

Title = {The association of osteochemometrics and bone mineral density in humans},

Abstract = {Objectives Even though much is known about bone mineral and matrix
   composition, studies about their relationship with several bone
   properties and its alterations related to bone diseases such as
   osteoporosis are practically non-existent in humans. Thus, the
   development of methods to understand the effects of bone properties at a
   microscopic level is paramount. This research aimed to evaluate whether
   Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) band
   intensity ratios correlate with femoral bone mass, bone mineral content
   (BMC) (total and femoral neck), bone mineral per unit area (BMD) (total,
   femoral neck, greater trochanter, intertrochanteric region, and Ward's
   area) and the area (total and femoral neck). A sample of femora from the
   21st Century Identified Skeleton Collection (N = 78, 42 females and 36
   males) was employed and BMC, BMD, and the femoral areas were acquired by
   DXA.
   Results It was found that only females' BMD had a significant
   association with the femoral FTIR-ATR indices under study, whereas bone
   collagen (Am/P) and the content of carbonate Type A (API) in males
   correlated with the total proximal femur area of the regions of interest
   and the femoral neck area.
   Discussion Men and women showed different changes related to their
   chemical composition in BMD, BMC, and probed area, most likely due to
   differences in structure and physiology, as well as mechanical strength
   in the proximal femoral sites where BMD was analyzed.},

Title = {Using a multimethod life history approach to navigate the osteological
   paradox: A case study from Prehispanic Nasca, Peru},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives We leverage recent bioarchaeological approaches and life
   history theory to address the implications of the osteological paradox
   in a study population. The goal of this article is to evaluate morbidity
   and mortality patterns as well as variability in the risk of disease and
   death during the Late Intermediate period (LIP; 950-1450 C.E.) in the
   Nasca highlands of Peru. We demonstrate how the concurrent use of
   multiple analytical techniques and life history theory can engage the
   osteological paradox and provide salient insights into the study of
   stress, frailty, and resilience in past populations.
   Materials and methods Crania from LIP burial contexts in the Nasca
   highlands were examined for cribra orbitalia (n = 325) and porotic
   hyperostosis (n = 270). All age groups and both sexes are represented in
   the sample. Survivor/nonsurvivor analysis assessed demographic
   differences in lesion frequency and severity. Hazard models were
   generated to assess differences in survivorship. The relationship
   between dietary diversity and heterogeneity in morbidity was assessed
   using stable delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotope values for bone collagen
   and carbonate. One hundred and twenty-four crania were directly AMS
   radiocarbon dated, allowing for a diachronic analysis of morbidity and
   mortality.
   Results The frequency and expression of both orbital and vault lesions
   increases significantly during the LIP. Survivor/nonsurvivor analysis
   indicates cranial lesions co-vary with frailty rather than robusticity
   or longevity. Hazard models show (1) decreasing survivorship with the
   transition into the LIP, (2) significantly lower adult life expectancy
   for females compared to males, and (3) individuals with cranial lesions
   have lower survivorship across the life course. Stable isotope results
   show very little dietary diversity. Mortality risk and frequency of
   pathological skeletal lesions were highest during Phase III (1300-1450
   C.E.) of the LIP.
   Conclusion Results provide compelling evidence of increasing
   physiological stress and mortality in the Nasca highlands during the
   LIP, but also reveal substantial heterogeneity in frailty and the risk
   of death. Certain members of society experienced a heavier disease
   burden and higher mortality compared to their contemporaries. Elevated
   levels of disease and lethal trauma among females account for some of
   the sex differences in survivorship but cannot explain the large degree
   of female-biased mortality. We hypothesize that parental investment in
   males or increased female fertility rates may explain these differences.},

Title = {The accuracy of age estimation using transition analysis in the
   Hamann-Todd collection},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {680-688},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Reconstructing demography of past populations using skeletal
   data is challenging when analyzing adults because the process of
   biological aging does not always reflect the individual's chronological
   age. A proposed solution to address the limitations of traditional age
   estimation methods is transition analysis (TA), a multifactorial method
   of age estimation. However, despite its methodological refinement, TA
   has varying degrees of accuracy when applied to different known-age
   skeletal samples. This study assesses TA's accuracy by comparing age
   estimates to known age at death in the Hamann-Todd Collection.
   Materials and Methods We contrasted the maximum likelihood age estimates
   generated by the ADBOU program to the known ages of 221 individuals. The
   absolute error was calculated for the entire sample, and compared
   between sex and ancestry.
   Results The mean absolute error in the sample is 11.6 (SD = 10.3) years,
   with white individuals' errors (14.1 years) being significantly higher
   than black individuals' (9.1 years; p < 0.001). No significant
   differences were found between sexes (p = 0.621). A weak to moderate
   positive correlation was found between known age and absolute error for
   white males (R = 0.607; p < 0.001), white females (R = 0.509; p <
   0.001), and black males (R = 0.371; p = 0.006). The accuracy of TA age
   estimates varied when each anatomical region was analyzed independently,
   but the combination of all three anatomical regions yielded the most
   accurate age estimates.
   Discussion These findings further support that TA accuracy depends on
   the prior distribution used and, in the Hamann-Todd Collection, the
   accuracy for white individuals is more influenced by this limitation
   than when black individuals are analyzed.},

Title = {Quantifying cortical bone in fragmentary archeological second
   metacarpals},

Abstract = {Objectives Skeletal variation in cortical bone thickness is an indicator
   of bone quality and health in archeological populations. Second
   metacarpal radiogrammetry, which measures cortical thickness at the
   shaft midpoint, is traditionally used to evaluate bone loss in
   bioarcheological and some clinical contexts. However fragmentary
   elements are regularly omitted because the midpoint cannot be
   determined. This methodological limitation reduces sample sizes and
   biases them against individuals prone to fracture, such as older
   individuals with low bone mass. This study introduces a new technique
   for measuring cortical bone in second metacarpals, the ``Region of
   Interest{''} (ROI) method, which quantifies bone in archeological
   remains with less-than-ideal preservation while accounting for cortical
   heterogeneity.
   Materials and methods The ROI method was adapted from digital X-ray
   radiogrammetry (DXR), a clinical method used to estimate bone mineral
   density, and tested using second metacarpals from Middenbeemster,
   Netherlands, a 19th century known age and sex skeletal collection. The
   ROI method quantifies cortical bone area within a 1.9 cm-long,
   mid-diaphyseal region, standardized for body size differences using
   total area (CAI(ROI)). CAI(ROI) values were compared to traditional
   radiogrammetric cortical indices (CI) to assess the method's ability to
   identify age-related bone loss.
   Results CAI(ROI) values have high intra- and interobserver replicability
   and are strongly and significantly correlated with CI values for both
   males (r{[}n = 39] = 0.906, p = 0.000) and females (r{[}n = 58] = 0.925,
   p = 0.000).
   Conclusion The ROI method complements traditional radiogrammetry
   analyses and provides a reliable way to quantify cortical bone in
   incomplete second metacarpals, thereby maximizing sample sizes, allowing
   patterns in bone acquisition and loss to be more comprehensively
   depicted in archeological assemblages.},

Title = {Is craniofacial morphology and body composition related by common genes:
   Comparative analysis of two ethnically diverse populations},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives The overarching hypothesis of the present paper is that
   ethnically and/or genetically diverse human populations may exhibit
   similarity in correlations between various aspects of human phenotypes
   due to the morphological integration process during the ontogenetic
   stages. To test this we investigated whether an association between
   craniofacial (CF) features and body composition (BC) variations is
   present in humans and the extent to which such possible associations are
   comparable in different populations. Furthermore, the paper examines the
   contribution of common genetic (additive) and shared familial
   environmental factors in assessing the correlation between CF and BC
   characteristics in humans. Materials and Methods Two pedigree-based
   samples were collected from two distinct populations, including India
   (Santhal) and Europe (Chuvash). Canonical correlation analysis was used
   to compare the association between CF and BC characteristics in the two
   studied samples. The contribution of genetic and familial environmental
   factors on the correlation between CF and BC features was analyzed
   through variance decomposition analysis by implementing the Mendelian
   Analysis package (MAN). Results Our study suggests that CF morphology is
   significantly (p < 0.001) associated with BC variation in both samples.
   CF characteristics and BC phenotypes revealed a consistent trend in both
   samples where condensed and broad CF morphology was significantly
   associated with increased fat accumulation, with slight variations
   between the Santhal and Chuvash samples. Despite the variations observed
   between the samples, the heritability estimates were impressively
   equivalent for traits like total facial height
   (55.6\%(Santhal)vs.56.1\%(Chuvash)) and nasal index (42.8\%(Santhal)vs.
   43.3\%(Chuvash)). Discussion The genetic contribution of CF morphology
   appeared to be extensive and the contribution of common genetic and
   shared family environmental correlations between CF and BC measures were
   suggestively substantial. Accordingly, these correlations were
   consistently observed across ethnically diverse populations, despite
   drastic morphological differences between the samples under comparison.},

Title = {Footloose: Articular surface morphology and joint movement potential in

Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives The competing functional demands of diarthrodial joints,
   permitting mobility while retaining enough stability to transmit forces
   across the joint, have been linked with the shape and size of the
   joint's articular surfaces. A clear understanding of the relationship
   between joint morphology and joint movement potential is important for
   reconstructing locomotor behaviors in fossil taxa.
   Methods In a sample of matched tali and calcanei of lorisids (n = 28)
   and cheirogaleids (n = 38), we quantify the surface areas of the talar
   and calcaneal ectal (=posterior talocalcaneal) articular surfaces and
   model the principal curvatures of these surfaces with quadric formulas.
   These two taxonomic groups have similar body masses, but differ
   substantially in positional behavior, so that differences in joint
   surface morphology should reflect adaptive demands of their locomotor
   behavior.
   Results Compared with cheirogaleids, lorisids exhibit: (a) a
   significantly greater area difference between their paired joint
   surfaces; and (b) a more pronounced saddle shape for the talar ectal
   facet.
   Conclusion The increased subtalar joint mobility observed in lorisids
   may be achieved by increasing the amount of sliding and rolling that can
   occur at the subtalar joint. The subtalar joint morphology observed in
   two fossil euarchontans, the plesiadapiforms Purgatorius sp. and
   Plesiadapis cookei, compares favorably with the morphology observed
   among lorisids, potentially suggesting antipronograde postures within
   these extinct taxa.},

Title = {Dietary shifts and diversities of individual life histories reveal
   cultural dynamics and interplay of millets and rice in the Chengdu

Abstract = {Objectives: We undertook a more comprehensive analyses than our previous
   study (Yi et al., International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 2018, 28,
   636-644) at the Gaoshan site (similar to 2500-2000 cal. BC) to expand
   our understanding of the different roles of rice and millets to human
   subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of human diets, diversity of
   human life histories and cultural influence (dental ablation) to human
   population.
   Materials and Methods: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of human
   (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) bones as well as
   carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. Human
   bones were directly AMS-C-14 dated. In addition, sequential sampling of
   16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for
   isotopic analysis was also conducted.
   Results: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) indicate that there
   existed two periods of occupation at the site, similar to 2500-2200 BC
   and similar to 2200-1900 BC. Moderate high delta N-15 values were found
   in the crops. Isotopic data from bone collagen suggest that the humans
   mainly relied on C-3-based animal protein and were supplemented by
   C-4-based foods. This isotopic pattern is also seen in pigs. Significant
   difference of human delta C-13 values (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05)
   between the two periods was observed. Compared to the bones, the
   isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider
   variability and higher delta C-13 values.
   Discussion: The crops (millets and rice) were probably manured. Human
   individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and pigs in general. In
   combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C-3 (rice)
   consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC)
   to late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of
   rice agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life
   histories during childhood are identified given different isotopic
   profiles of dentine sections, demonstrating that C-3 (rice) and C-4
   (millets)-based foods played different roles in human lives. Even
   though, there were similar weaning practices among the human
   populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental
   ablation, cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River
   Valley, consumed more millets during childhood in the early period than
   those without dental ablation in the late period. Our study here
   provides novel insights into cultural dynamics and the interplay between
   rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural system during the Late
   Neolithic in Southwest China.},

Title = {Increased performance in juvenile baboons is consistent with ontogenetic

Abstract = {Objectives In many primates, the greater proportion of climbing and
   suspensory behaviors in the juvenile repertoire likely necessitates good
   grasping capacities. Here, we tested whether very young individuals show
   near-maximal levels of grasping strength, and whether such an early
   onset of grasping performance could be explained by ontogenetic
   variability in the morphology of the limbs in baboons.
   Material and methods We quantified a performance trait, hand pull
   strength, at the juvenile and adult stages in a cross-sectional sample
   of 15 olive baboons (Papio anubis). We also quantified bone dimensions
   (i.e., lengths, widths, and heights) of the fore- (n = 25) and hind limb
   (n = 21) elements based on osteological collections covering the whole
   development of olive baboons.
   Results One-year old individuals demonstrated very high pull strengths
   (i.e., 200\% of the adult performance, relative to body mass), that are
   consistent with relatively wider phalanges and digit joints in
   juveniles. The mature proportions and shape of the forelimb elements
   appeared only at full adulthood (i.e., >= 4.5 years), whereas the mature
   hind limb proportions and shape were observed much earlier during
   development.
   Discussion These changes in limb performance and morphology across
   ontogeny may be explained with regard to behavioral transitions that
   olive baboons experience during their development. Our findings
   highlight the effect of infant clinging to mother, an often-neglected
   feature when discussing the origins of grasping in primates. The
   differences in growth patterns, we found between the forelimb and the
   hind limb further illustrate their different functional roles, having
   likely evolved under different ecological pressures (manipulation and
   locomotion, respectively).},

Title = {A geometric morphometric assessment of shape variation in adult pelvic

Abstract = {Objectives In humans, the pelvis is the most sexually dimorphic skeletal
   element and is often utilized in aging and sexing remains. The pelvis
   has become greatly relied upon in anthropological research (e.g.,
   forensics, demographics, obstetrics, evolutionary history); however,
   pelvis morphology is highly variable, and very little is known about the
   nature, sources, patterning, and interpretation of this variation. This
   study aims to quantify pelvis shape variation, document sexual shape
   variation, and estimate the plasticity of morphology. This will
   ultimately give greater ability to interpret modern, archaeological, and
   evolutionary patterns to gain deeper insight into processes which shape
   human anatomy. Materials and methods Using a sample of 129 Medieval
   Danish skeletons, shape variation is documented in the greater sciatic
   notch (GSN), iliac crest (IC), arcuate line (AL), and sub-pubic angle
   (SPA) using 3D geometric morphometrics. The landmarking method applied
   here has the advantage of being applicable to fragmentary remains,
   rather than requiring whole bones. This allows it to be easily applied
   to archaeological samples and for the interpretation of separate bone
   features. Differences in shape were statistically analyzed by principle
   component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, and morphological
   disparity. Relationships between maximum femur length, body mass, and
   shape centroid size were also test by allometric regression. Results
   Results quantify the sexual dimorphism and shape variation present in
   these features. The GSN shape is the most variable, while the AL is the
   least. Similarly, the IC is the only feature which shows almost no
   dimorphism in shape, and instead best reflects lifestyle/activity
   patterns. Evidence of dimorphism in the IC is likely a result of
   cultural labor patterns rather than genetic and hormonal influence.
   Finally, the shapes of the GSN, AL, and SPA are more related to body
   mass than to femur length, such that individuals with increased mass
   exhibit more classically ``male{''} shapes and those with less mass have
   more ``female{''} shapes. Discussion The results have important
   implications for the evolution of pelvic anatomy, and sexual dimorphism,
   but also highlight the plasticity inherent in pelvic morphology.
   Analyzing pelvis features separately in a clearly defined, relatively
   genetically homogenous population gives insight into the determinants of
   bone morphology, which are not readily observable by other means. The
   relationship between body mass and shape suggests dimorphism in body
   size and composition may affect bone shape.},

Abstract = {Objectives To provide a comprehensive analysis of perimortem cranial
   injuries found on human remains from the Eneolithic (ca. 4200 BCE) mass
   grave discovered at Potocani, Croatia, to test if the assemblage is a
   result of a deliberate violent episode on a massive scale. Materials and
   Methods Standard bioarchaeological analysis, including inventory of the
   preserved elements, minimum number of individuals, sex determination,
   age at death, as well as pattern and distribution of trauma, was
   recorded. Results A minimum of 41 people are present in the sample. Both
   sexes and almost all age groups are represented, with a prevalence of
   children and young adults. Four blunt force antemortem injuries are
   registered in three adult males and one subadult while perimortem
   injuries are recorded on 13 crania with a total of 28 injuries. The
   distribution of perimortem injuries is not patterned with age, sex, or
   siding, and their location is on lateral, posterior, or superior parts
   of the crania. No ``defensive wounds{''} or other type of injuries are
   observed on postcranial elements. Discussion The injuries, manner of
   disposal of the bodies, radiocarbon dates, and other available data
   strongly suggest that the Potocani sample represents a single episode of
   execution during which the Potocani people were unable to defend
   themselves. The Potocani massacre is the oldest such example in
   southeastern Europe and provides additional evidence that indiscriminate
   violence on a massive scale is not a product of modern societies.},

Abstract = {Background While well known for its Viking past, Norway's population
   history and the influences that have shaped its genetic diversity are
   less well understood. This is particularly true with respect to its
   demography, migration patterns, and dialectal regions, despite there
   being curated historical records for the past several centuries. In this
   study, we undertook an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity
   within the country to elaborate this history from a matrilineal genetic
   perspective.
   Methods We aggregated 1174 partial modern Norwegian mtDNA sequences from
   the published literature and subjected them to detailed statistical and
   phylogenetic analysis by dialectal regions and localities. We further
   contextualized the matrilineal ancestry of modern Norwegians with data
   from Mesolithic, Iron Age, and historic period populations.
   Results Modern Norwegian mtDNAs fell into eight West Eurasian (N, HV,
   JT, I, U, K, X, W), five East Eurasian (A, F, G, N11, Z), and one
   African (L2) haplogroups. Pairwise analysis of molecular variance
   (AMOVA) estimates for all Norwegians indicated they were differentiated
   from each other at 1.68\% (p < 0.001). Norwegians within the same
   dialectal region also showed genetic similarities to each other,
   although differences between subpopulations within dialectal regions
   were also observed. In addition, certain mtDNA lineages in modern
   Norwegians were also found among prehistoric and historic period
   populations, suggesting some level of genetic continuity over hundreds
   to many thousands of years.
   Conclusions This analysis of mtDNA diversity provides a detailed picture
   of the genetic variation within Norway in light of its topography,
   settlement history, and historical migrations over the past several
   centuries.},

Title = {Three-dimensional surface scanning methods in osteology: A topographical

Abstract = {Objectives Three-dimensional (3D) data collected by structured light
   scanners, photogrammetry, and computed tomography (CT) scans are
   increasingly combined in joint analyses, even though the scanning
   techniques and reconstruction software differ considerably. The aim of
   the present study was to compare the quality and accuracy of surface
   models and landmark data obtained from modern clinical CT scanning, 3D
   structured light scanner, photogrammetry, and MicroScribe digitizer.
   Material and methods We tested 13 different photogrammetric software
   tools and compared surface models obtained by different methods for four
   articulated human pelves in a topographical analysis. We also measured a
   set of 219 landmarks and semilandmarks twice on every surface as well as
   directly on the dry bones with a MicroScribe digitizer.
   Results Only one photogrammetric software package yielded surface models
   of the complete pelves that could be used for further analysis. Despite
   the complex pelvic anatomy, all three methods (CT scanning, 3D
   structured light scanning, photogrammetry) yielded similar surface
   representations with average deviations among the surface models between
   100 and 200 mu m. A geometric morphometric analysis of the measured
   landmarks showed that the different scanning methods yielded similar
   shape variables, but data acquisition via MicroScribe digitizer was most
   prone to error.
   Discussion We demonstrated that three-dimensional models obtained by
   different methods can be combined in a single analysis. Photogrammetry
   proved to be a cheap, quick, and accurate method to generate 3D surface
   models at useful resolutions, but photogrammetry software packages
   differ enormously in quality.},

Abstract = {Objectives As many primates live in forests where visibility is limited,
   the ability to detect the aroma of distant fruit and navigate odor
   plumes would be highly adaptive. Our study is the first to investigate
   this ability with strepsirrhine primates.
   Materials and Methods We tested the ability of a group of ring-tailed
   lemurs to detect hidden fruit from afar using scent alone. We hid
   containers in the underbrush of a semi-natural forest, some baited with
   real cantaloupe and some with sham cantaloupe, 4-17 m from a path
   routinely used by the lemurs. Crucially, the containers were not visible
   from the path. Therefore, the lemurs had to use olfactory cues, but did
   not have to prioritize them to locate the bait.
   Results The lemurs found the real cantaloupe on days that the wind blew
   the scent of the fruit toward the trail. They did not find the sham
   cantaloupe. Upon detecting the odor of the bait, the lemurs sniffed the
   air at one or more locations as they moved toward the bait, a process of
   navigation known as klinotaxis.
   Discussion The traditional belief is that primates are unable to track
   odor plumes. The untrained lemurs in this study were able to detect the
   odor of the cantaloupe among the complex odors of the forest and
   navigate the odor plume to the fruit. The results indicate that
   olfaction may be used to respond to cues from distant sources. The
   ability to track odor plumes may be a critical foraging skill for
   strepsirrhines.},

Title = {Computational fluid dynamics simulation wall model predicting air
   temperature of the nasal passage for nonhuman primates},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Nasal passages adjust the temperature of inhaled air to reach
   the required body temperature for the lungs. The nasal regions of
   primates including humans are believed to have experienced anatomical
   modifications that are adaptive to effective conditioning of the
   atmospheric air in the habitat for a given species. Measurements of the
   nasal temperature are required to understand the air-conditioning
   performance for a given species. Unfortunately, repeated direct
   measurements within the nasal passage have been technically precluded in
   most nonhuman primates.
   Materials and methods Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is a
   potential approach for examining the temperature profile in the nasal
   passage without any direct measurements. The CFD simulation model mainly
   comprises a computational model to simulate physiological mechanisms and
   a wall model to simulate the nasal passage's anatomical and physical
   properties. We used a computational model developed for humans and
   examined corrections for the developed wall model based on human
   properties for predicting its performance in Japanese macaques.
   Results This study confirmed that the epithelium layer thickness of the
   wall model affects the accuracy of the predictions for macaques. A
   convenient correction of the thickness based on body mass allows us to
   simulate the actual air temperature profile in macaques' nasal passage.
   Discussion The CFD simulations of the wall model corrected with body
   mass can be applied to other nonhuman primates and mammals. This
   convenient corrective approach allows us to examine the functional
   contributions of a specific morphology to the air-conditioning
   performance without any direct measurements to improve our understanding
   of primates' functional morphology and physical adaptations to the
   temperature environment in their habitat.},

Title = {Estimating age-at-death in burnt adult human remains using the

Volume = {175},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives The Falys-Prangle-method assesses age-related morphological
   changes to the sternal clavicle end (SCE), enabling the observation of
   mature adults from the 5th decade onwards in unburnt human skeletal
   remains. The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of
   the Falys-Prangle-method on burnt human remains.
   Materials and methods Fifty-two SCE of 40 cremated individuals (out of
   86) from the William M. Bass collection of the Forensic Anthropology
   Center (Knoxville, Tennessee) of known age-at-death and sex are
   available for assessment. Surface topography, porosity, and osteophyte
   formation are evaluated, after which the calculated composite score is
   associated with the corresponding age range as described by Falys and
   Prangle. The method is also applied on an archaeological case study from
   Oudenburg, Belgium, dating to the Roman period.
   Results The assessed age ranges strongly agree with the true age ranges
   (alpha = 0.828), suggesting the Falys-Prangle-method to be applicable on
   burnt human remains. The case study from Oudenburg yields markedly
   improved age-at-death estimates, significantly enhancing our
   understanding of the age distribution within this community.
   Discussion Information on age-at-death is key in the construction of
   biological profiles of past individuals. The mature adult is often
   invisible in the archaeological record since most macroscopic age
   estimation methods do not distinguish beyond 46+ years old. Our study
   stresses the usefulness of a large-scale application of the
   Falys-Prangle-method, which will increase the visibility of mature
   adults, especially in archaeological burnt human skeletal collections,
   where such information is, at present, extremely difficult to obtain.},

Abstract = {Objectives We examine the prevalence and sociodemographic risk factors
   of skeletal indicators of stress in forensic samples of undocumented
   migrants from Mexico and Central America. Materials and methods Cranial
   and dental remains of 319 migrants recovered in the Arizona and Texas
   borderlands were assessed for porotic hyperostosis (PH), cribra
   orbitalia (CO), and linear enamel hypoplasias (LEH). Logistic regression
   models for each condition were estimated to test for associations with
   biological sex, age, recovery location, and whether individuals were
   identified. Additional models estimated for a subsample of identified
   migrants included region of origin, residential context, and community
   indigeneity. Results The full sample shows moderate crude prevalence of
   CO (9.6\%) and LEH (34.1\%), and a high prevalence of PH (49.6\%).
   Significantly higher odds of PH are associated with being male (2.16
   times higher), unidentified (1.89 times higher), and recovered in
   Arizona (3.76 times higher). Among identified migrants, we fail to find
   associations significant at the p < 0.05 level between skeletal stress
   and all sociodemographic variables except age. Discussion The factors
   associated with PH may be related to influences on decisions to migrate
   and diversity among migrant sending regions. The skeletal evidence for
   early life stress is generally consistent with common public health
   concerns among impoverished communities in the region. The lesions
   themselves are viewed as embodied risk of physiological disturbance when
   resource access is structured by higher-level social, economic, and
   political forces. Forensic anthropologists would benefit from increased
   sensitivity to embodied structural violence among the vulnerable
   individuals and communities they serve.},

Title = {The constraints of racialization: How classification and valuation
   hinder scientific research on human variation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {2, SI},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Human biological variation has historically been studied through the
   lens of racialization. Despite a general shift away from the use of
   overt racial terminologies, the underlying racialized frameworks used to
   describe and understand human variation still remain. Even in relatively
   recent anthropological and biomedical work, we can observe clear
   manifestations of such racial thinking. This paper shows how
   classification and valuation are two specific processes which facilitate
   racialization and hinder attempts to move beyond such frameworks. The
   bias induced by classification distorts descriptions of phenotypic
   variation in a way that erroneously portrays European populations as
   more variable than others. Implicit valuation occurs in tandem with
   classification and produces narratives of superiority/inferiority for
   certain phenotypic variants without an objective biological basis. The
   bias of racialization is a persistent impediment stemming from the
   inheritance of scientific knowledge developed under explicitly racial
   paradigms. It is also an internalized cognitive distortion cultivated
   through socialization in a world where racialization is inescapable.
   Though undeniably challenging, this does not present an insurmountable
   barrier, and this bias can be mitigated through the critical evaluation
   of past work, the active inclusion of marginalized perspectives, and the
   direct confrontation of institutional structures enforcing racialized
   paradigms.},

Title = {Paleodemographic analysis of age at death for a population of Black Sea
   Scythians: An exploration by using Bayesian methods},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {595-613},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Studies of the demography of past populations involving
   deterministic life tables can be criticized for ignoring the errors of
   estimation. Bayesian methods offer an alternative, by focusing on the
   uncertainty of the estimates, although their results are often sensitive
   to the choice of prior distributions. The aim of this study is to
   explore a range of Bayesian methods for estimating age at death for a
   population of nomadic warriors-Scythians from the Black Sea region.
   Materials and methods In total, skeletons of 312 individuals (93
   children and 219 adults) from Glinoe (Moldova), dated to the 5th-2nd
   century BCE, were examined. We unified the age categories corresponding
   to different aging methods, allowing an application of a probabilistic
   assessment of the age categorization. A hierarchical Bayesian
   multinomial-Dirichlet-Dirichlet model was applied, with a hypothetical,
   subjective reference population, a real reference population, and no
   reference.
   Results Stationary-population life expectancy was estimated as 27.7years
   (95\% CI: 25.1-30.3) for a newborn (e(0)), and 16.4years (14.0-19.0) for
   20-year-olds (e(20)), although with high uncertainty, and sensitive to
   the model specification. Slight differences in longevity between
   different social strata and between the Classical and Late chronological
   periods were found, although with high estimation errors. A more robust
   finding, confirming earlier studies, was a high probability of death in
   young adulthood, which could depend on Scythian lifestyle (conflicts,
   wars).
   Discussion Our study shows a way to overcome some limitations of broad
   age categorization by using the Bayesian approach with alternative model
   specifications, allowing to assess the impact of reference populations.},

Title = {Lack of biological mortality bias in the timing of dental formation in
   contemporary children: Implications for the study of past populations},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {646-660},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Biological mortality bias is the idea that individuals who
   perish (non-survivors) are biologically distinct from those who survive
   (survivors). If biological mortality bias is large enough,
   bioarchaeological studies of nonsurvivors (skeletal samples) cannot
   accurately represent the experiences of the survivors of that
   population. This effect is particularly problematic for the study of
   juvenile individuals, as growth is particularly sensitive to
   environmental insults. In this study, we test whether biological
   mortality bias exists in one dimension of growth, namely dental
   development.
   Materials and methods Postmortem computed tomography scans of 206
   children aged 12 years and younger at death were collected from two
   institutions in the United States and Australia. The sample was
   separated into children dying from natural causes as proxies for
   non-survivors and from accidental causes as proxies for survivors.
   Differences in the timing of dental development were assessed using
   sequential logistic regressions between dental formation stages and
   residual analysis of dental minus chronological age.
   Results No consistent delay in age of attainment of dental stages was
   documented between survivors and non-survivors. Delays between survivors
   and non-survivors in dental relative to chronological age were greatest
   for infants, and were greater for females than for males.
   Discussion Lack of biological mortality bias in dental development
   reinforces confidence in juvenile age estimates and therefore in
   skeletal growth profiles and growth studies. As dental development is
   known to be less environmentally sensitive than skeletal growth and
   development, further studies should examine biological mortality bias in
   long bone length.},

Abstract = {Objective: In this study, we analyze breastfeeding and weaning practices
   in pre-Columbian complex hunter-gatherers from the lower Parana River
   basin (South America).
   Materials and Methods: We carried out bone isotope analyses concerning
   delta C-13 in collagen and apatite, the spacing between both carbon
   sources and delta N-15 in a sample of 23 subadult and adult individuals
   of both sexes recovered from Late Holocene archaeological sites, ranging
   from 1665 +/- 45 to 680 +/- 80 C-14 years BP.
   Results and Discussion: The results indicate that exclusive
   breastfeeding continued until the age of similar to 2 years, and weaning
   probably until 4 years of age. Supplementary foods included C-3 plants
   and probably animal fats and C-4 carbohydrates. A high fractionation of
   4.9 parts per thousand in delta N-15 values was recognized between
   breastfeeding infants and adult females, perhaps reflecting episodic
   hyper-protein diets in women linked to men's food provisioning during
   women's gestational/postpartum period. Additionally, male adults present
   a higher protein intake than females. Although this difference is not
   statistically significant with the current sample size, it could be a
   clue related to a sexual division in food procurement.},

Title = {Inflammaging: Blame the sons. Relationships between the number of sons
   and the level of inflammatory mediators among post-reproductive women},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Reproduction is costly, but sons and daughters differently
   influence maternal physiology, also in older age. In particular, having
   sons may negatively influence maternal health and may be associated with
   a shorter life span of mothers. Sons may also contribute to increased
   inflammaging, a chronic sub-clinical systemic inflammatory state
   characterized by elevated levels of serum inflammatory mediators. The
   aim of this study was to examine the impact of the total number of
   children, and the number of daughters and sons separately on
   concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), and proinflammatory
   cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha).
   Materials and Methods The participants were 378 women aged 45-92 who had
   3.9 (SD 2.12, median = 4, range = 0-13) children, including 2.1 (SD
   1.46, median = 2, range = 0-8) sons and 1.8 (SD 1.44, median = 2, range
   = 0-7) daughters on average.
   Results We found a positive relationship between the overall number of
   children and IL-6 levels. CRP and IL-6 concentrations were positively
   associated with the number of sons but not with the number of daughters.
   Each son increased maternal CRP level by 11\%, and IL-6 level by 6\%.
   Neither the total number of children nor the number of daughters or sons
   were related to the TNF-alpha concentration.
   Discussion Aging-associated inflammation in post-reproductive mothers
   with a higher number of sons supports the hypothesis of trade-offs
   between reproduction and health. Furthermore, these results provide new
   evidence contributing to the idea that having sons may have more
   detrimental effects on the maternal organism than having daughters.},

Title = {Three-dimensional analysis of sexual dimorphism in the soft tissue
   morphology of the upper airways in a human population},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {171},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives Several studies have analyzed the sexual dimorphism of the
   skeletal cranial airways. This study aimed to quantify the
   three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the soft tissues of the upper
   airways in a human population. We addressed hypotheses about
   morphological features related to respiratory and energetic aspects of
   nasal sexual dimorphism.
   Methods We reconstructed 3D models of 41 male and female soft tissue
   nasal airways from computed tomography data. We measured 280 landmarks
   and semilandmarks for 3D-geometric morphometric analyses to test for
   differences in size and 3D morphology of different functional
   compartments of the soft tissue airways.
   Results We found statistical evidence for sexual dimorphism: Males were
   larger than females. 3D features indicated taller and wider inflow
   tracts, taller outflow tracts and slightly taller internal airways in
   males. These characteristics are compatible with greater airflow in
   males.
   Discussion The differences in 3D nasal airway morphology are compatible
   with the respiratory-energetics hypothesis according to which males
   differ from females because of greater energetic demands. Accordingly,
   structures related to inflow and outflow of air show stronger signals
   than structures relevant for air-conditioning.},

Title = {Stable isotope evidence (Fe, Cu) suggests that sex, but not aging is
   recorded in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) bone},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},

Pages = {80-92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives Here, we examine (1) if the sex-related differences in iron
   (Fe) and copper (Cu) isotope ratios, represented as delta Fe-56 and
   delta Cu-65 values, respectively observed in humans exist in bulk
   occipital bone and incisors of male and female non-human primates, and
   (2) if the variation of Fe and Cu isotope ratios, known to vary in human
   blood as a factor of age are similar in non-human primate bone.
   Materials and Methods Isotope ratios were measured from the skeletal
   elements of 20 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with known life history
   traits. The metals were purified by column chromatography and their
   isotope ratios measured by MC-ICP-MS. Data were analyzed using
   generalized additive models (GAM).
   Results When accounting for age and sex independently, we found a
   significant relationship between delta Cu-65 values and occipital bone,
   but not in incisors. There were no significant relationships observed
   between delta Fe-56 values, occipital bone, or incisors. Similarly,
   there were no significant relationships observed between delta Fe-56
   values, delta Cu-65 values, and age.
   Discussion We suggest that Cu and Fe isotope ratios have the potential
   to be useful supplementary tools in future research in biological
   anthropology, but additional studies are needed to further verify the
   relationship between sex, age, delta Cu-65, and delta Fe-56 values in
   primates.},

Title = {Oral processing, sexual selection, and size variation in the
   circumorbital region of Colobus and Piliocolobus},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {3},
Pages = {559-576},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives The function of the browridge in primates is a subject of
   enduring debate. Early studies argued for a role in resisting
   masticatory stresses, but recent studies have suggested sexual signaling
   as a biological role. We tested associations between circumorbital form,
   diet, oral processing, and social behavior in two species of colobus
   monkey-the king colobus (Colobus polykomos) and western red or bay
   colobus (Piliocolobus badius).
   Materials and methods We quantified circumorbital size and dimorphism in
   a sample of 98 crania. Controlling for age and facial size, we tested
   whether variation in circumorbital morphology can be explained by
   variation in diet, oral processing behavior, masticatory muscle size,
   and mating system. To contextualize our results, we included a broader
   sample of facial dimorphism for 67 anthropoid species.
   Results Greater circumorbital thickness is unrelated to the stresses of
   food processing. King colobus engages in longer bouts of anterior tooth
   use, chews more per ingestive event, and processes a tougher diet, yet
   circumorbital thickness of C. polykomos is reduced compared to P.
   badius. Differences in circumorbital development do not vary with wear
   or facial size. Greater sexual dimorphism is present in P. badius;
   comparisons across anthropoids indicated patterns of circumorbital
   dimorphism were decoupled from overall size dimorphism.
   Conclusions The expanded circumorbits of male red colobus monkeys
   evolved in response to intense male-male competition. This hypothesis is
   consistent with the pattern across anthropoid primates and highlights
   the underappreciated role of sexual selection in shaping the primate
   face.},

Title = {Variability of weaning age in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei

Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},

Pages = {776-784},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Weaning is a key life history milestone for mammals that
   represents both the end of nutritional investment from the perspective
   of mothers and the start of complete nutritional independence for the
   infants. The age at weaning may vary depending on ecological, social,
   and demographic factors experienced by the mother and infant. Bwindi
   mountain gorillas live in different environmental conditions and have
   longer interbirth intervals than their counterparts in the Virunga
   Volcanoes, yet other life history characteristics of this population
   remain less well known. We use long-term data from Bwindi Impenetrable
   National Park, Uganda to examine factors related to weaning age.
   Materials and methods We analyzed data on infants born in four mountain
   gorilla groups in Bwindi to quantify their age of weaning (defined as
   last nipple contact) and to test if the sex of offspring, parity, and
   dominance rank of mother influences age of weaning. We also compared the
   age at weaning and time to conception after resumption of mating in
   Bwindi and Virunga gorillas.
   Results Bwindi gorillas were weaned at an average age of 57.5 months. No
   difference was found between age of weaning for primiparous and
   multiparous mothers, nor did maternal dominance rank influence age of
   weaning, but sons were weaned at a later age than daughters. The
   majority of Bwindi mothers were still suckling when they resumed mating
   and mothers generally conceived before they weaned their previous
   offspring. The age of weaning was significantly later in Bwindi than in
   Virunga gorillas. After mothers resumed mating, the time to conceiving
   the next offspring was not significantly longer for Bwindi females than
   Virungas females (6 vs. 4 months).
   Discussion Later weaning age for sons than daughters is similar to
   findings of other studies of great apes. Bwindi mountain gorillas are
   weaned at approximately the same age as western gorillas and
   chimpanzees, which is more than a year later than Virunga mountain
   gorillas. The results of this study suggest that variation in ecological
   conditions of populations living in close geographic proximity can
   result in variation in life history patterns, which has implications for
   understanding the evolution of the unique life history patterns of
   humans.},

Title = {The character of conflict: A bioarchaeological study of violence in the
   Nasca highlands of Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (950-1450
   CE)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {614-630},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: This study uses osteological and radiocarbon datasets
   combined with formal quantitative analyses to test hypotheses concerning
   the character of conflict in the Nasca highlands during the Late
   Intermediate Period (LIP, 950-1450 C.E.). We develop and test
   osteological expectations regarding what patterns should be observed if
   violence was characterized by intragroup violence, ritual conflict,
   intermittent raiding, or internecine warfare.
   Materials and methods: Crania (n = 267) were examined for antemortem and
   perimortem, overkill, and critical trauma. All age groups and both sexes
   are represented in the sample. One hundred twenty-four crania were AMS
   dated, allowing a detailed analysis of diachronic patterns in violence
   among various demographic groups.
   Results: Thirty-eight percent (102/267) of crania exhibit some form of
   cranial trauma, a significant increase from the preceding Middle Horizon
   era. There are distinct trauma frequencies within the three subphases of
   the LIP, but Phase III (1300-1450 C.E.) exhibits the highest frequencies
   of all trauma types. Males exhibit significantly more antemortem trauma
   than females, but both exhibit similar perimortem trauma rates.
   Discussion: There was chronic, internecine warfare throughout the Late
   Intermediate Period with important variations in violence throughout the
   three temporal phases. Evidence for heterogeneity in violent mortality
   shows a pattern consistent with social substitutability, whereby any and
   all members of the Nasca highland population were appropriate targets
   for lethal and sublethal violence. We argue that by testing hypotheses
   regarding the targets and types of conflict we are better able to
   explain the causes and consequences of human conflict.},

Title = {Effects of human variation on foot and ankle pain in rural Madagascar},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Objectives Foot and ankle dysfunction in barefoot/minimally shod
   populations remains understudied. Although factors affecting
   musculoskeletal pain in Western populations are well-studied, little is
   known about how types of work, gender, and body shape influence bone and
   joint health in non-Western and minimally shod communities. This study
   examines the effect of human variation on locomotor disability in an
   agrarian community in Madagascar. Materials and methods Foot
   measurements were collected along with height, weight, age, and
   self-report data on daily activity and foot and ankle pain from 41 male
   and 48 female adults. A short form revised foot function index (FFI-R),
   that measures functional disability related to foot pain, was
   calculated. Raw and normalized foot measurements were compared by gender
   and used in a multiple linear regression model to determine predictors
   of FFI-R. Results Compared to men, women reported higher FFI-R scores (p
   = 0.014), spent more time on their feet (p = 0.019), and had higher BMIs
   (p = 0.0001). For their weight, women had significantly smaller and
   narrower feet than men. Bimalleolar breadth (p = 0.0005) and foot length
   (p = 0.0223) standardized by height, time spent on feet (p = 0.0102),
   ankle circumference standardized by weight (p = 0.0316), and age (p =
   0.0090) were significant predictors of FFI-R score. Discussion Our
   findings suggest that human variation in anatomical and behavioral
   patterns serve as significant explanations for increased foot and ankle
   pain in women in this non-Western rural population. Foot and ankle pain
   were prevalent at similar levels to those in industrialized populations,
   indicating that research should continue to examine its effect on
   similar barefoot/minimally shod communities.},

Title = {Exploring ``wear and tear{''} of joints and ``muscle function{''}

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives Changes in the joints are believed to result from ``wear and
   tear,{''} a consequence of activity, as entheseal changes (EC) result
   from muscle use. However, clinical data showed that activity does not
   necessarily increase the likelihood of degenerative joint changes (DJC)
   and that exercise results in healthier joints. We tested whether
   individuals with continuous repetitive biomechanical efforts (Group 1)
   were more likely to exhibit EC and if occupations known to exert
   strenuous but discontinued efforts (Group 2) would more likely cause
   DJC.
   Materials and Methods Eighty-nine males with known occupations from
   Portuguese identified collections were used: shoemakers and carpenters
   (Group 1), workers (Group 2), and civil servants, and shop assistants as
   a control group. Major upper and lower limb joints and entheses sites
   were used. DJC and EC were tested between occupations - while
   controlling for age (overall approach) - and within occupation
   (occupation-specific approach).
   Results The overall approach showed that age - as a covariant - had a
   significant impact on DJC and EC development (p < 0.05), with occupation
   being non-significant (p > 0.05) despite the variability in the
   mean-values of lesions. The occupation-specific approach showed a
   significant variability of DJC and EC correlations, within and between
   occupations, with no clear trend of DJC and EC development according to
   occupation.
   Discussion The results showed that exploring overall patterns might
   conceal occupation-specific joint and muscle use, emphasizing age as a
   major contributor of changes; and that the occupation-specific approach
   highlighted particular aspects associated with occupations, allowing for
   a more informative assessment of strenuous repetitive or discontinuous
   activity-related technical gestures and their impact on skeletal
   biology.},

Abstract = {Objectives In this study, we describe a newly excavated early Holocene
   human cranium from Guizhou, Southwestern China, namely the Zhaoguo M1
   (ZG 1). We aim to evaluate its morphological resemblance with Late
   Pleistocene human, and Northern and Southern China Neolithic
   populations. We also aim to infer its position in the process of East
   Asian population regionalization.
   Materials and Methods The ZG 1 skull is almost complete, only missing
   parts of the right parietal and the basicranium around the foramen
   magnum. Comparative samples include Late Pleistocene humans and
   Neolithic populations from Northern and Southern China. Univariate and
   multivariate analyses are carried out in the study.
   Results ZG 1 has a dolichocephalic cranium, wide zygomatic breadth,
   moderate glabella and supraobtial projection, marked canine fossa, and
   thin cranial vault. The nasal floor, maximum cranial breadth position,
   and frontal arc proportion are all congruent with modern human.
   Statistical analysis suggests that ZG 1's measurements are most similar
   to those of Southern China Neolithic specimens, with some closer to Late
   Pleistocene humans.
   Conclusion ZG 1 shows a clear affinity with Southern China Neolithic
   populations, providing further support that regionalization of
   morphological variability patterns between Northern and Southern
   Neolithic populations could have originated at least 10,000 years ago.},

Title = {Neanderthal cranial remains from Baume Moula-Guercy (Soyons, Ardeche,

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1},
Pages = {201-226},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives We provide the first comparative description of the Guercy 1
   cranium and isolated cranial fragments from Baume Moula-Guercy and
   examine their affinities to European Preneanderthals, Neanderthals, and
   Homo sapiens.
   Materials and Methods The Moula-Guercy hominins derive from deposits
   chronostratigraphically and biostratigraphically dated to the Eemian
   Interglacial (MIS 5e). For comparisons we compiled a sample of European
   and Southwest Asian subadult-adult Middle-to-Late Pleistocene hominins
   (approximate to MIS 14-MIS 2; N = 184). This sample represents a
   Preneanderthal-Neanderthal group and a H. sapiens group, both of which
   were further divided into three time-successive subgroups defined by
   associated marine isotope stages (MIS). Metric and morphological
   observations were made on the original fossils and a virtual
   reconstruction of Guercy 1. Developmental age and sex and the
   minimum-maximum number of individuals were assessed.
   Results Guercy 1 represents the remains of a late stage adolescent
   (approximate to 15-16.0 years) female. Morphological and metric data
   combine to associate the total morphological pattern expressed in Guercy
   1 with our MIS 7-MIS 5e ({''}Early Neanderthal{''}) subgroup. Some
   features, especially those related to the frontal, suggest linkage to a
   paleodeme comprising the Moula-Guercy, Artenac, La Chaise Abri Suard
   and, possibly, the Biache-Saint-Vaast samples.
   Discussion Remains of MIS 7-MIS 5e Neanderthals are rare and
   fragmentary, especially those dated to the Last Interglacial. The Baume
   Moula-Guercy sample provides new insights into the total morphological
   pattern expressed in MIS 5e Neanderthals. Further, our results support
   earlier suggestions that MIS 7-MIS 5e European hominins represent a
   morphotype that is distinct from both earlier and later members of the
   Preneanderthal-Neanderthal group.},

Title = {An epidemiological approach to the analysis of cribra orbitalia as an
   indicator of health status and mortality in medieval and post-medieval
   London under a model of parasitic infection},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {4},
Pages = {631-645},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives Many individuals living in medieval and post-medieval London
   suffered issues with sanitation, food insecurity, infectious disease,
   and widespread exposure to parasites from a multitude of sources,
   causing increased risk of death for many inhabitants. We examine this
   stressful environment and its relationship with various demographic and
   temporal dimensions, using cribra orbitalia (CO) as an indicator of
   stress, to model an increased risk of dying under the expectations of
   our proposed parasitic model of infection.
   Materials and methods We analyze the relationship between CO and
   mortality across seven medieval and post-medieval cemeteries from London
   by the covariates of sex, status, and age-at-death. A survival analysis
   (Cox regression) and a binomial logit estimated hazard and odds ratios
   of dying with CO across age-at-death, sex, status, and time-period
   within single statistical models. In addition, we provide new Bayesian
   age-at-death estimates for post-medieval samples.
   Results The models show the rate of CO decreased over time and
   age-at-death, regardless of sex or status; post-medieval individuals
   were similar to 72\% less likely to die with lesions than their medieval
   counterparts. Further, individuals with CO had similar to 1\% decrease
   in risk of dying with CO per year of age.
   Discussion These results suggest increased mortality risk for those with
   lesions indicative of anemia (CO), and selective mortality of younger
   individuals during the medieval period. Despite sex-specific nutritional
   and occupational hazards, and status-based access to resources, the
   prevalence of CO was similar across sex and status, which suggests
   living with parasitic infection that caused anemia was an everyday
   reality for medieval and post-medieval Londoners.},

Title = {Genetic diversity, structure, and admixture in Mayans from Guatemala and

Abstract = {Objective To analyze the genetic origin, relationships, structure, and
   admixture in Mayan Native American groups from Guatemala and Mexico
   based on 15 autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs) loci commonly used in
   human identification (HID).
   Methods We genotyped 513 unrelated Mayan samples from Guatemala based on
   15 STR loci (AmpFlSTR (R) Identifiler kit). Moreover, we included 4408
   genotypes previously reported, as following: Mayas from Guatemala and
   Mexico (n = 1666) and from Latin American, European, and African (n =
   2742) populations. Forensic parameters, genetic distances, admixture,
   and population structure were assessed.
   Results Forensic parameters of the 15 STRs in different Mayan groups
   from Guatemala were reported. Low (Fst = 0.78\%; p = 0.000) and
   non-significant differentiation (Fst = 1.8\%; p = 0.108) were observed
   in Mayas from Guatemala and Mexico, respectively. The relative
   homogeneity observed among Mayan groups supported theories of extensive
   pre-Columbian gene flow and trade throughout the Mayan Empire. The
   distribution of the three Native American ancestries among these Mayan
   groups did not support the presumable Guatemalan origin of Tojolabal and
   Lacandon people (South, Mexico). The nonsignificant differentiation
   between Ladinos and Mayas suggests a relative panmixia in Guatemala.
   Mestizos from southeastern Mexico and Guatemala constitute a core of
   Native American ancestry in Latin America related to the Mayan Empire in
   Central America.
   Conclusions The higher European admixture and homogeneity in Mexican
   Mayas of the Yucatan Peninsula suggest more intensive post-Columbian
   gene flow in this region than in Guatemalan Mayas.},

Abstract = {Objective To analyze variability in newborn (NB) anthropometry among
   Jujenean NBs as a function of geographic altitude (500 m to approximate
   to 4000 masl), maternal anthropometry and other maternal characteristics
   within the maternal capital framework.
   Materials and methods Data obtained from 41,371 mother/child pairs
   recorded in the Jujuy Perinatal Information System (SIP) between 2009
   and 2014, including: NB and maternal weight, length/height and BMI;
   gestational age (corrected); maternal age, educational level,
   nutritional status, and marital status; birth interval; and planned
   pregnancy. Based on the declared place of residence, the prevalence of
   unsatisfied basic needs (\% UBN) was determined and the data was split
   into two altitudinal groups: highlands (HL, >2500 masl) and lowlands
   (LL, <2500 masl). ANOVA, Chi-squared and Pearson tests were applied as
   needed. Statistical associations between the response variables-NB
   weight, length and BMI-and maternal and environmental variables were
   tested using a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM).
   Results All NB and maternal anthropometric variables were lower in HL
   compared to LL; they also presented negative correlations with altitude,
   except NB length. Apart from gestational age and birth interval, HL and
   LL presented statistically significant differences in all study
   variables. GAMM results showed that maternal anthropometry was the main
   influence on NB weight and length.
   Discussion Of all the maternal capital features examined, only maternal
   anthropometric variables were found to protect offspring against the
   negative impact of HL environments.},

Title = {Sex differences in adult famine mortality in medieval London},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives Recurrent famine events during the medieval period might have
   contributed to excess mortality during the Black Death in London,
   England (c. 1349-1350). Previous research using conventional methods of
   age estimation revealed that adult males experienced lower risks of
   mortality under ``normal{''} (attritional) but not famine mortality
   conditions following the Black Death. However, given the biases inherent
   in conventional age estimation methods, this study reassesses sex
   differences in risks of medieval adult famine mortality using ages
   estimated via transition analysis, which avoids some of the limitations
   of conventional age estimation methods.
   Materials and Methods We apply hazards analysis (the Gompertz model of
   adult mortality) to ages estimated for human skeletal remains (n = 1245)
   from London cemeteries dated to the pre-Black Death (c. 1000-1250 CE)
   and post-Black Death (c. 1350-1540 CE) periods.
   Results The results reveal no sex differences in risks of mortality
   before the Black Death but indicate that adult males faced lower risks
   of mortality after the Black Death during conditions of normal and
   famine mortality.
   Conclusions These findings largely support those of our previous
   research, which suggested that selective mortality during the Black
   Death or sex-biased improvements in standard of living following the
   epidemic reduced risk of mortality for adult males in the post-Black
   Death period under normal mortality conditions. However, the use of
   transition analysis age estimates also revealed a reduced risk of
   mortality for post-Black Death adult males under famine conditions.},

Title = {Common evolutionary patterns in the human nasal region across a

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {176},
Number = {3},
Pages = {422-433},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives Variation in the external nasal region among human
   populations has long been proposed in the literature to reflect
   adaptations to facilitate thermoregulation, air conditioning, and
   moisture retention in local climates and environments. More
   specifically, adaptations in populations living in colder climates have
   often been assumed due to correlational relationships found between
   variation in the nasal region and climatic variables. Here, we test this
   hypothesis by applying a quantitative genetics approach based on the
   Lande model to assess whether variation in the nasal region can be
   explained by random neutral processes (e.g., genetic drift) or if
   non-random forces (i.e., adaptation) have contributed significantly to
   its diversity. Materials and methods A mixed-sex sample representing 28
   population groups from Howells' craniometric dataset were analyzed (n =
   2504). Twenty standard measurements were chosen to reflect the external
   skeletal morphology of the nasal region. We apply statistical tests
   developed from evolutionary quantitative genetics theory to analyze
   patterns of within- and between-population divergence under a null
   hypothesis of genetic drift. Results This study finds a rejection of
   genetic drift in all analyses, across tests that involve all 28
   populations, exclusively cold-climate populations, and with cold-climate
   populations excluded, indicating that non-random evolutionary forces
   have contributed significantly to variation in the nasal region overall.
   Discussion These results show that nasal region adaptation is not
   exclusive to cold-climate populations, which have often been implicated
   in the literature to drive nasal variation, instead suggesting that the
   propensity for adaptation in the nasal region is shared among all human
   populations.},

Abstract = {Objectives The statistical analysis of fossil remains is essential to
   understand the evolution of the genus Homo. Unfortunately, the human
   fossil record is straight away scarce and plagued with severe loss of
   information caused by taphonomic processes. The recently developed field
   of Virtual Anthropology helps to ameliorate this situation by using
   digital techniques to restore damaged and incomplete fossils.
   Materials and methods We present the package Arothron, an R software
   suite meant to process and analyze digital models of skeletal elements.
   Arothron includes tools to digitally extract virtual cavities such as
   cranial endocasts, to statistically align disarticulated or broken bony
   elements, and to visualize local variations between surface meshes and
   landmark configurations.
   Results We describe the main functionalities of Arothron and illustrate
   their usage through reproducible case studies. We describe a tool for
   segmentation of skeletal cavities by showing its application on a
   malleus bone, a Neanderthal tooth, and a modern human cranium,
   reproducing their shape and calculating their volume. We illustrate how
   to digitally align a disarticulated model of a modern human cranium, and
   how to combine piecemeal shape information on individual specimens into
   one. In addition, we present useful visualization tools by comparing the
   morphological differences between the right hemisphere of the
   Neanderthal and the modern human brain.
   Conclusions The Arothron R package is designed to study digital models
   of fossil specimens. By using Arothron, scientists can handle digital
   models with ease, investigate the inner morphology of 3D skeletal
   models, gain a full representation of the original shapes of damaged
   specimens, and compare shapes across specimens.},

Abstract = {Objectives Current human infant urine collection methods for the field
   are problematic for the researcher and potentially uncomfortable for the
   infant. In this study, we compared two minimally invasive methods for
   collecting infant urine: organic cotton balls and filter paper.
   Materials and methods We first collected urine from infants using the
   clean catch method. We then used those samples to compare the
   performance of filter paper and cotton ball collection protocols. We
   analyzed the clean catch and cotton samples using commercial
   estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G) kits and tried two different extraction
   methods for the filter paper. Using a paired t-test (n = 10), we
   compared clean catch and cotton samples. We also compared effect sizes
   within and between methods.
   Results We were unable to extract enough urine from the filter paper to
   successfully assay the samples for E1G. The paired t-test revealed a
   statistically significant difference between the clean catch and cotton
   methods (t = 2.63, p-value = 0.03). However, the effect size was small
   (5.91 mu g/ml, n = 10, 95\% CI = 3.80, 8.02) and similar to or larger
   than the difference seen between duplicate wells for clean catch and
   cotton values.
   Discussion While this study is limited by sample size, our results
   indicate that filter paper is not a field-friendly method for collecting
   infant urine. However, we found that organic cotton balls showed similar
   values to the clean catch method, and we propose this method as an
   alternative, minimally invasive method for study of E1G in human infant
   urine.},

Abstract = {Objectives This study compares lower limb diaphyseal robusticity between
   Native Alaskan hunter-gatherers to reconstruct patterns of mobility and
   engagement with terrain.
   Materials and methods Ancestral remains included in this study date
   between 600 and 1800 C.E. and were divided into three regions: Coastal
   Bay (CB), Far North Coastal (FNC), and Inland/Riverine (IR).
   Cross-sectional properties were determined at femoral and tibial
   midshafts and standardized by powers of body mass and bone length.
   Results Consistently elaevated areas and second moments of area were
   found in ancestral remains from the Far North Coastal, while the Coastal
   Bay remains had reduced diaphyseal robusticity. Individuals from the IR
   region were intermediate in robusticity for male femora, but similar to
   the Coastal Bay group for females. Sexual dimorphism was greatest in the
   IR ancestral remains and comparable between Coastal Bay and Far North
   Coastal regions.
   Conclusions Ancestral remains from the Far North Coastal region have the
   greatest diaphyseal robusticity in response to intensive hunting and
   travel over rugged terrain. Reduced sexual dimorphism in the Far North
   Coastal region suggest female participation in hunting activities.
   Intermediate diaphyseal robusticity among IR males and increased sexual
   dimorphism reflects diverse patterns of mobility in relation to the
   hunting cycle between males and females. Reduced diaphyseal robusticity
   and sexual dimorphism among the Coastal Bay group is associated with
   sedentary villages established around net fishing in regions with low
   relief. Such findings argue against technocentric views of sedentism in
   hunter-gatherer lifeways and generally reflect diverse adaptive
   strategies and interaction with local terrain among Indigenous Late
   Holocene hunter-gatherers of Alaska.},

Title = {Ontogenetic and morphological variation in primate long bones reflects
   signals of size and behavior},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {174},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: Many primates change their locomotor behavior as they mature
   from infancy to adulthood. Here we investigate how long bone
   cross-sectional geometry in Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, Hylobatidae, and Macaca
   varies in shape and form over ontogeny, including whether specific
   diaphyseal cross sections exhibit signals of periosteal adaptation or
   canalization.
   Materials and methods: Diaphyseal cross sections were analyzed in an
   ontogenetic series across infant, juvenile, and adult subgroups.
   Three-dimensional laser-scanned long bone models were sectioned at
   midshaft (50\% of biomechanical length) and distally (20\%) along the
   humerus and femur. Traditional axis ratios acted as indices of
   cross-sectional circularity, while geometric morphometric techniques
   were used to study cross-sectional allometry and ontogenetic trajectory.
   Results: The humeral midshaft is a strong indicator of posture and
   locomotor profile in the sample across development, while the mid-femur
   appears more reflective of shifts in size. By comparison, the distal
   diaphyses of both limb elements are more ontogenetically constrained,
   where periosteal shape is largely static across development relative to
   size, irrespective of a given taxon's behavior or ecology.
   Discussion: Primate limb shape is not only highly variable between taxa
   over development, but at discrete humeral and femoral diaphyseal
   locations. Overall, periosteal shape of the humeral and femoral midshaft
   cross sections closely reflects ontogenetic transitions in behavior and
   size, respectively, while distal shape in both bones appears more
   genetically constrained across intraspecific development, regardless of
   posture or size. These findings support prior research on tradeoffs
   between function and safety along the limbs.},

Abstract = {The UNESCO Golija-Studenica Biosphere Reserve (BR) is located in
   southwestern Serbia. Its captivating beauty, breath-taking landscape
   diversity, and preserved natural and cultural values make it one of the
   country's most beautiful mountains. This paper aims to determine the
   differences in motivation and level of satisfaction with the tourism
   offer of Golija-Studenica BR based on the visitor's gender. Motivation
   and satisfaction of 642 visitors to Golija-Studenica BR were analysed
   using factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha coefficient and regression
   analysis. Research findings confirm that gender matters - there is a
   gender-based impact on the motivation and satisfaction of visitors. The
   paper makes both scientific and practical contributions. Thus far,
   insufficient attention has been given to researching motivation and
   satisfaction of visitors to biosphere reserves in Serbia. Therefore,
   this paper can serve as a scientific basis for future research, for the
   improvement of the tourism offer of GolijaStudenica BR with the aim of
   encouraging its diversity, and for the development of sustainable
   tourism in this destination.},

Title = {Opportunities and challenges for transdisciplinary research in flood

Abstract = {Mountain hazards such as floods, torrents or landslides pose a serious
   threat to human lives and repeatedly cause considerable damage in the
   Alpine region. Shrinking populations also provide a socio-political
   challenge for regional and local authorities. Within the OAW-ESS funded
   DemoHazAlps project, the aim is to develop a better understanding of
   demographic change as a key driver in transforming risk patterns. A
   transdisciplinary research strategy was chosen to address these
   challenges in the Gailtal, in the Austrian province of Carinthia. This
   paper describes the use of transdisciplinary research above all to
   integrate the knowledge of those who are affected by, and those who can
   affect the planning of, risk management. Transdisciplinary research has
   a high potential to contribute to overcoming conflicts in flood risk
   management triggered by, and linked to, demographic change. However, in
   practice there are many limitations and barriers to consider, such as
   the negative connotations of risk management or a pandemic. This paper
   provides some critical reflection on transdisciplinary research to
   address limitations and barriers; the lessons learnt could be applied in
   similar situations, for example within UNESCO biosphere reserves.},

Abstract = {Planning recreational areas for a conservation-use balance is important
   in the sustainable use of national parks. This study was conducted to
   determine the ability of forest roads as hiking routes in Hatila Valley
   National Park, northeostern Turkey. The indicators used as evaluation
   criteria were determined using the natural characteristics and landscape
   values of the National Park. A multi-criteria decision analysis (the
   Analytic Hierarchy Process; AHP) was used, with route length, slope,
   altitude, aspect, walking time, landscape quality and access to clean
   water as the main parameters. Experts were consulted to determine the
   weights of parameters and the linear scoring functions. Expert opinions
   were also used for scoring measurable and unmeosurable sub-parameters. A
   Hiking Suitability Index (HSI) was formulated using these parameters to
   score the suitability of existing roads for hiking. A Geographic
   Information System (GIS) was used to map the parameters and hiking
   routes. Results showed that slope was the most important parameter in
   assessing suitability. We concluded that forest roads can be used for
   hiking in protected areas without harming nature, and the suitability of
   routes can be determined using AHP.},

Abstract = {Whether and how alpine organismic communities respond to ongoing

   intrinsically slow responses, remote locations and limited data. Here we
   provide a synthesis of the first five years of a multidisciplinary,

   aquatic ecosystems in the Austrian Hohe Tauern National Park and
   companion sites in northern Italy and the central Swiss Alps. The
   programme aims at evidencing the ecological state and trends in largely
   late-successional, high-elevation ecosystems. We present the conceptual
   framework, the study design and first results. Replicated over five
   regions, different sites and a multitude of permanent plots, the abiotic
   (microclimate, physics and chemistry of soils and water bodies),
   biodiversity (plants, animals, microbes), and productivity data (alpine
   grassland, lakes, streams) provide a representative reference for future
   re-assessments. The wide spectrum of biological baseline data presented
   and their spatial and temporal variation also illustrate the degree of
   uncertainty associated with smaller-scale and short-term studies and the
   role of stochasticity in long-term biological monitoring.},

Abstract = {The diversity and community structure of soil nematodes around Lake
   Paiku in Mount Qomolangma (Mt. Everst) National Nature Reserve were
   investigated, to obtain soil ecosystem information, assess local soil
   quality, and provide the basis for environmental protection. Twelve
   plots were selected for typical vegetation communities around the lake.
   Within each plot, soil samples were collected from depths of 0 to 25 cm.
   The Baermann tray method was used to extract nematodes. Overall, we
   acquired 2,272 nematodes belonging to 2 classes, 5 orders, 32 families
   and 48 genera. The nematode density was 0-413 individuals per 100 g dry
   soil (average 109). Bacterivores, predators and omnivores were the
   dominant trophic groups. The individual density and genus numbers of
   soil nematodes were highest in the northeast and southeast corners of
   the lake. For most of the area studied, soil nutrients were at a medium
   level and there was no human disturbance. The energy flow of the soil
   food web tends to be via fungus decomposition channels. The redundancy
   analysis shows that soil-available P, pH, alkali-hydrolytic N, and
   soil-available K have strong effects on the soil nematode community,
   whereas the soil's total N, organic matter and water content have only
   minor effects. Soil-available P and pH were negatively correlated with
   nematode diversity. Soil nematodes showed surface aggregation; the soil
   food webs tend to have complex structures because of the presence of
   K-strategist organisms; the lakeshore ecosystem is in the late stage of
   succession and relatively stable. The increasing amount of
   soil-available P and increasing pH value corresponded to reduced
   biodiversity and unstable soil nematode communities. A greater diversity
   of nematodes were found in the Lake Paiku region in comparison to
   studies carried out in alpine meadows of the Chang Tang (or Northern
   Tibet) Grasslands.},

Abstract = {Road mortality is one of the most obvious forms of anthropic impact upon
   fauna. The Iron Gates Natural Park is an area of great biodiversity,
   crossed by a 154 km long road running parallel to the Danube River. To
   estimate the impact of this road upon the fauna, between March 2019 and
   February 2020 we monitored road mortality on a monthly basis. We
   recorded 13,230 road-killed animals, belonging to 71 taxa. The greatest
   proportion of taxa was killed in early summer and the number of
   individuals killed peaked in autumn. A spring mortality peak was not
   observed. Cold-blooded animals were killed year-round, even though they
   should not have been active in winter in Romania. This is a consequence
   of the warmer climate of the region compared to the rest of Romania, but
   also the mild winter of 2019 / 2020. Mitigation measures such as
   stopping the construction of new roads would prevent the problem of
   animal road deaths being replicated in other areas. In addition to the
   ecological, zoogeographical and conservation value of its findings, our
   study also warns of a cause-effect link between global warming and an
   increase in road mortality.},

Abstract = {Resilience at various levels of the social and environmental domains is
   a key aspect of sustainable development in mountain areas. However,
   resilience research is hampered by inconsistent definitions and
   conceptualizations of resilience. Using the examples of two research
   projects from protected mountain areas in different regions of the world
   (in the Austrian Alps and the Nepalese Himalayas), we illustrate two
   distinct perspectives on resilience: a system-based perspective and an
   agency-based one. We identify common characteristics of these views on
   resilience and apparent contradictions between them, and discuss how the
   two perspectives can be integrated to enhance understanding of
   resilience and to support sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Nepal's population of endangered Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris) is on
   the rise. In recent years, the presence of tigers has been documented at
   higher elevations. The objective of this study is to explore the
   possible reasons for the tigers' presence at the higher elevations. It
   is critical that these high-altitude habitats for tigers be further
   explored and protected. The study points out the importance of the
   Mahabharat range and a longitudinal conservation gradient approach in
   Nepal. Apart from this, it is imperative to assess the density of tigers
   and tiger prey in the area. Even though high-altitude ecology may be
   suitable for tiger growth, the formulation of a high-altitude tiger
   conservation action plan with effective coordination between stakeholder
   organizations and concerned departments is of great importance.},

Abstract = {The United States was an integral part of the early growth of UNESCO's
   Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), yet chang-ing political and
   social contexts have impacted the relationship between the US and MAB.
   Poised at the start of a new period of activity, as the US reviews its
   strategy on its current and future engagement with MAB, it is critical
   to discuss the factors that have influenced the history of US
   involvement in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) and how
   the US will engage in the future. For the purpose of this article, the
   US Biosphere Network (USBN) refers to the current recently reinvigorated
   network of biosphere reserves in the US. As many of the USBN sites are
   partially or fully mountainous ecosystems, the renewed engage-ment of
   the USBN will contribute to the conservation of some of the nation's
   most prized mountain landscapes. This article pro-vides an overview of
   the biosphere reserve concept and of US involvement with the
   intergovernmental programme. We discuss challenges facing the USBN,
   including relevancy and inclusion, political relations with UNESCO, and
   perceptions of zoning. We present examples of opportunities and
   strategies that have been implemented by the Champlain-Adirondack
   Biosphere Network in a mountain region, followed by conclusions on
   revisioning MAB in the US and globally for the next 50 years.},

Abstract = {The UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve Collemeluccio-Montedimezzo-Alto
   Molise was established in 1977 in Molise Region (Central Italy) to
   safeguard local natural and managed ecosystems in two separate areas
   administered by two different municipalities. An association of seven
   small municipalities with various local bodies, the ASSOMAB Alto Molise
   Consortium, was established in 2006 to expand and zone the Reserve in
   order to promote innovative and environmentally sustainable approaches
   to economic and social development, by setting in place a new model of
   sustainable and integrated management in the area. In the renewal step
   of 2014, UNESCO agreed the expansion of the old protected areas into a
   single, larger reserve, to be managed by the Consortium. Today it covers
   nine Natura 2000 sites, seven of which are included in the European
   Habitats Directive, and two in the Birds Directive. Local administrators
   and stakeholders see the Reserve as an opportunity to develop
   sustainable actions while protecting and enhancing the extraordinary
   environmental richness, including the remarkable biodiversity. In this
   paper, the authors discuss the current situation and the socio-economic
   opportunities in this rural landscape, which is affected by population
   ageing, outmigration and a diminishing economy, all of which are
   significant drivers of land-use changes, particularly land abandonment
   and forest expansion.},

Abstract = {The Macun lakes form a high-alpine (> 2,600 m asl) cirque landscape (3.6
   km(2)) in the Swiss National Park, comprising 26 small lakes together
   with a number of temporary ponds. Streams interconnect the four largest
   lakes, forming the drainage network that flows into the Inn River at the
   town of Lavin. The drainage network of Macun consists of a north and a
   south basin that overlie an ortho-gneiss, meta-granitoid bedrock. The
   south basin is influenced by various rock glaciers. The
   physico-chemistry of surface waters at 10 sites has been monitored
   annually in mid-summer since 2001. Further, an YSI EXO2 Multiparameter
   Sonde (Exosonde) with various water quality sensors has been employed
   since 2016 at the last lake in the network to examine seasonal and diel
   patterns in physico-chemistry. Results showed clear physico-chemical
   differences between the two basins, which mostly reflect rock-glacier
   inputs in the south basin. Nitrogen values were two-fold higher and
   particulate phosphorus values two-fold lower in the south basin than in
   the north basin. Over time, the physico-chemistry in the two basins
   became more homogeneous, with a reduction in rock-glacial inputs in the
   south basin and an overall decrease in nitrogen in the catchment. Data
   from 30 springs and tributaries sampled in 2002 and 2017 reflected the
   basin differences and temporal changes observed at the primary study
   sites. Continuous temperature records showed north basin streams to be
   ca. 3 degrees C warmer than south-basin streams, but with high
   inter-annual variation that reflected annual differences in weather and
   no evidence of a general change over time (increase or decrease).
   Exosonde data revealed strong seasonality in measured parameters as well
   as seasonality in diel patterns (e. g., dissolved oxygen, temperature,
   chlorophyll-a); diel fluctuations were most pronounced in summer and
   least in winter. The results highlight the importance of long-term
   monitoring for understanding ecosystem state changes in alpine
   freshwaters, especially during periods of rapid environmental change.},

Abstract = {In this policy article, we identify challenges for maintaining the Black
   Forest Bio-sphere Reserve's diverse cultural landscape and present the
   efforts undertaken to address these. Set in a land-use context that is
   rich in tradition, featuring com-mon pastures and an indigenous cattle
   breed, landscape preservation today is threatened by fundamental changes
   in the agricultural community as well as of land-use systems. As part of
   the MAB network, the UNESCO Black Forest Biosphere Reserve provides
   collaborative arenas to address these issues and propose action in
   concertation with local actors and communities. To illustrate this, we
   describe the ALLMENDE 2.0 applied research project, the creation of a
   commercialization hub for the local Hinterwalder cattle, and support for
   the modelling of more extensive ecologically-orientated agriculture.},

Abstract = {Understanding local residents' perceptions of changes triggered by the
   creation of a biosphere reserve (BR) is important for a reserve's
   successful management. This study asked 383 local residents of the
   Wienerwald BR, Austria, about their perceptions of changes, at
   individual and regional levels, nine years after the creation of the BR,
   and correlated these perceptions with place attachment. The vast
   majority of respondents perceived either no changes or positive ones in
   the region and for themselves. They saw the most positive impact of the
   BR as being the preservation of threatened landscape types and cultural
   landscapes. Study results revealed that local residents with stronger
   emotional, functional and social ties to the region perceived more
   positive impacts of the BR. The BR management could make use of the
   positive relationship between place attachment and perceptions of
   change, as high place attachment can be beneficial for the preservation
   of natural and cultural landscapes, and can contribute to greater
   involvement in participation processes by, and quality of life of, the
   local population.},

Abstract = {Grand Teton National Park (GRTE) is a popular mountain recreation
   destination which, like many National Park Service (NPS) units, has
   experienced a significant increase in visitation in recent years, with
   toted visits increasing by 27\% between 2014 and 2017 (NPS 2020.
   Particularly popular within GRTE is the String and Leigh Lakes (SLL)
   area, which is a favoured alpine destination for numerous day-use
   recreation activities and also an important starting point for
   backcountry and overnight recreational users within GRTE's Recommended
   Wilderness. To better understand the visitor experience of overnight
   backcountry recreationists in the SLL area, data were collected using
   novel public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) during
   the summer of 2018.
   PPGIS data were used to identify the locations in which overnight
   recreationists experienced positive and negative recreation outcomes.
   Results indicate that they experience more positive outcomes within the
   Recommended Wilderness, away from high-density, trailhead-proximate
   areas outside the Recommended Wilderness. Findings also indicate that
   overnight users experience crowding and conflict more outside of the
   Recommended Wilderness than elsewhere on their backcountry trip While
   this may seem intuitive these are some of the first empirical results
   spatially contextualizing backcountry visitor outcomes in a popular
   national park, The findings thus provide managers with visitor
   experience baseline that can be monitored and adaptively managed in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Paeonia decomposita is on the IUCN's Red List of endangered species, and
   occurs only in the northwest part of Sichuan Province, China. For the
   effective protection of the species, it is important to evaluate the
   suitability of potential habitats for P. decomposita and natural factors
   that influence the species. Based on the actual distribution points of
   P. decomposita in northwest Sichuan from 2016 to 2018, the Maximum
   Entropy Model (MaxEnt) was used to analyse the main factors affecting
   its habitat, and to predict suitable habitats. The results show that:
   (1) the model has high accuracy and is suitable for the prediction and
   evaluation of habitat suitability for P. decomposita; (2) temperature,
   slope, precipitation and moisture index will all greatly affect P.
   decomposita's distribution; (3) the areas that are potentially suitable
   for P. decomposita are mainly in Mianyang, Aba, Ganzi and Liangshan,
   which are greatly affected by human activities; effective protection
   measures have not been taken. It is proposed that new reserves for the
   introduction of P. decomposita should be established in areas of high or
   moderately high suitability. A programme of cultivation of this rare
   species should also be set up.},

Abstract = {The Balkan Peninsula is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts numerous
   mountain lakes, which offer a refuge for a multitude of species.
   However, previous pristine habitats have been deeply affected by
   anthropogenic change, such as non-native fish introductions, which calls
   for multi-species considerations in the last remaining unaltered
   habitats. We carried out abiotic measurements and biodiversity
   assessments in two neighbouring alpine lakes, Lakes Leqinat and Drelaj
   in the Bjeshket e Nemuna National Park in Kosovo, in August 2018. Lake
   Leqinat is a permanent, stratified water body and exhibits weak oxygen
   depletion below 3 m. Phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophycean,
   cryptophycean and chlorophycean algae. Zooplankton consisted of five
   rotifer species and Daphnia longispina. A mark-recapture experiment
   yielded a population of alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris) of nearly
   4 000 adult individuals. In contrast, cold water from the surrounding
   karst seeps into Lake Drelaj, which is a well-oxygenated temporary lake.
   Hence phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses were considerably lower
   than in Lake Leqinat. Phytoplankton was dominated by cryptophycean,
   chlorophycean, and bacillariophycean algae. Zooplankton consisted of the
   diaptomid copepod Mixodiaptomus tatricus, the cladoceran Daphnia rosea,
   and the anostracan Chirocephalus diaphanus. Conservation efforts should
   ensure that Lake Leqinat remains unstocked as introduced fish would
   probably destroy the natural community.},

Abstract = {In Eastern Europe, several UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BRs) have been
   important promoters of transnational and transboundary nature
   conservation and sustainable development. Nevertheless, political and
   institutional barriers and scarcity of resources have hindered
   successful cross-border cooperation. The prospects for BRs in Eastern
   Europe are mixed, especially in relation to the challenges of ecosystem
   degradation and climate change, as well as socioeconomic and
   (geo)political crises. Based on our own experience of one and a half
   decades of growing cooperation between partners in Ukraine and Germany,
   we conclude that transnational cooperation between BRs and science is
   particularly rewarding and mutually beneficial.},

Abstract = {Lhalu wetland, located in the northwest of Lhasa city, Tibet, is the
   highest and largest urban natural wetland in the world. Due to its
   specific climate and the unique plateau ecosystem, it is a hotspot of
   endemic and endangered species. Lhalu wetland is an important wetland
   for Lhasa city for its biodiversity and for enhancing human well-being.
   However, due to global warming, over-exploitation and the presence of
   non-native species, it has suffered serious ecosystem damage and
   biodiversity loss. To protect biodiversity and the functioning of the
   ecosystem, new measures are needed, and current measures should be
   better enforced. This study is important for biodiversity conservation
   and the management of Lhalu wetland in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.},

Abstract = {The year 2023 will mark the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of the
   Julian Alps Biosphere Reserve (JABR). When awarded the prestigious
   title, the Triglav National Park (TNP) Authority was already the
   managing body of TNP, which constitutes the core and buffer zones of the
   then-newly designated area. Over the course of time, it has become clear
   that buffer zone management is instrumental in securing the objectives
   of the TNP and JABR. This paper discusses aspects of management relating
   mostly to visitation, education and training, cross-border cooperation,
   and enhancing the local economy through the collaboration of providers.
   A bottom-up approach and multi-stakeholder networking as essential
   components of modern policy-making are the key to success, particularly
   since sustainable development in sensitive areas is reliant upon
   fostering a strong and broad community identity and local support for
   protected areas.},

   Park projects in Switzerland, focusing on their strategies and the
   political causes of their actions. Five in-depth qualitative interviews
   were conducted with the leaders of the opponents of Adula Park and

   conservation advocates and park opponents. The existence of this radical
   opposition prevented bottom-up schemes from working, Further studies
   should aim to better understand the causes of this malaise in order to

Abstract = {Biosphere Reserves face huge challenges worldwide, especially those
   located in metropolitan areas such as La Campana-Penuelas Biosphere
   Reserve in central Chile. As well as direct threats, such as urban
   sprawl and wildfires, such reserves face a less evident threat in the
   form of weak community engagement and awareness of the value,
   opportunities and challenges that the name biosphere reserve offers.
   Since 2015, environmental conflicts have intensified in this area of
   Chile, and counter-movements towards re-territorialization have arisen
   under the slogan ``We are biosphere reserve{''}. This implies a deep
   understanding of the imbrications of the lives of humans and
   more-than-humans in a common territory which face common challenges with
   regard to the preservation of life and regenerative actions and
   pathways. In Chile, this local social / political / spiritual movement
   now converges with a national movement towards recovering sovereignty
   over common goods through a new Constitution. In this article, we
   describe a fruitful academia-community dialogue of knowledges created
   through a series of open-access courses, collaborative mapping, and
   artistic initiatives developed by citizens, such as textile-making and
   handcrafts using natural pigments. All of these initiatives come
   together within the framework of very local geopolitical actions for the
   preservation of the biocultural landscapes found within the biosphere
   reserve. We discuss these initiatives as forms of biocultural resistance
   and re-existence.},

Abstract = {With 62 \% of its total area covered in forest, Styria is the most
   densely forested province in Austria. Accordingly, forests, more than
   any other habitat, characterise the landscape in the Styrian Eisenwurzen
   Nature and Geopark. The forest areas of the nature park are managed by a
   combination of private owners and the Styrian Provincial Forests, the
   Austrian Federal Forests and the City of Vienna. The near-natural areas
   of the nature park forests in particular are characterised by
   species-rich fauna and flora, which include specially protected species.
   However, the forests of the nature park do not simply provide habitats
   for a large number of protected animal and plant species. Due to their
   location - embedded between the Durrenstein wilderness area, the
   Kalkalpen National Park and the Gesause National Park - they also
   function as important stepping-stone habitats for many forest-bound
   species.},

Abstract = {The creation of protected mountain areas is often preceded by conflicts
   over access and use of natural resources. The case of the Cerro Khapia
   in the Peruvian Andes, however, points to mountains as not just nature
   but also culture. More than a decade ago, different ontologies and
   opposing views on mountains led to protests of the Aymara people against
   the exploitation of Cerro Khapia by a Canadian mining company, mainly
   because the mountain is the local Aymara's apu or tutelary god. Today,
   Cerro Khapia is temporarily protected as a Reserved Zone and on track to
   become a permanently protected area. Moreover, it is a case in point of
   the importance of questioning one's own ontological viewpoint and
   mediating different mind-sets.},

Pages = {58-69},

Abstract = {In the 50 years since the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB)
   was launched, 727 sites in 131 countries have gained the status of
   biosphere reserve (BR). Golija-Studenica BR belongs to the group of BRs
   that have been active for the past 20 years. This BR is one of the most
   prominent protected areas and the first of its kind in Serbia. A balance
   between biodiversity conservation, as the primary goal of protection,
   and the promotion of sustainable profitable activities involving diverse
   actors has yet to be achieved. This research aims to provide a
   contextual understanding of changes in Golija-Studenica BR and draw
   lessons for future BR development. It relies on the experiential and
   practical knowledge of diverse stakeholders, including management
   bodies, the NGO sector and the local population itself. The methodology
   is based on a qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews
   with open-ended questions. Research results show that the BR model is a
   subtle, time-reliant driver of change, with some unintentional
   side-effects. It brings about changes in how protected areas are
   managed, affects the economic behaviour of the local population, raises
   awareness about environmental issues, and has an impact on demographic
   trends and social change.},

Abstract = {Arganeraie Biosphere Reserve (ABR) in Morocco was established in 1998.
   Today the reserve covers 2.5 million hectares and more than 3 million
   people and, as such, it has been a complex social-ecological system to
   govern. Authors draw on post normal conservation science and
   environmental governance studies to investigate environmental governance
   processes within the ABR and shed light on their outcomes and challenges
   to date. First, authors analyse how Moroccan institutions are managing
   this vast territory. Second, we look at perceptions of an extended peer
   community of decision-makers. This research adds an empirical case study
   to the North African region and addresses two main weaknesses of UNESCO
   Biosphere Reserves worldwide: 1) effective governance and 2)
   shortcomings in their implementation. Through an ethnographic approach,
   we are able to point out how low strategic priority and a weak political
   will regarding the ABR may be hindering inclusive environmental
   governance. The authors suggest some key aspects for improving the
   existing governance system; various baseline needs and barriers that may
   be addressed in advance; a set of drivers, and several proposals for
   inclusive governance in the ABR. This study should prompt academia,
   policy-and decision-makers to identify and enhance synergies that allow
   for a shared vision of their territory.},

Abstract = {The Great Aletsch Glacier and world-famous peaks of Eiger, Monch and
   Jungfrau make up the core of the UNESCO World Heritage Swiss Alps
   Jungfrau-Aletsch (SAJA), which was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage
   site in 2001, the first Alpine World Heritage designation. The natural
   and cultural landscape is very di-verse due to its climatic differences
   and high altitudinal gradients. One extraordinary cultural element of
   the landscape in the UNESCO World Heritage SAJA is the tra-ditional
   irrigation system. It mainly provides irrigation for meadows and
   vineyards, creating small-scale and species-rich habitats for animals
   and plants. As a result of agricultural structural change and workload,
   the traditional irrigation techniques are endangered and are being
   replaced by sprinkler systems or, in some cases, abandoned completely.
   The project Preservation of Traditional Irrigation in the Upper Valais
   served to detect areas still traditionally irrigated and to discuss
   challenges, solutions and perspectives with local actors and experts to
   develop a concrete ac-tion plan. Possible solution approaches proposed
   are: a) financial compensation; b) platform and volunteering; c)

Abstract = {This study aims to explore how lichen diversity, composition and
   distribution vary with altitude, and environmental factors (temperature
   and relative humidity). The study was conducted in the forest of Gunung
   Nuking, Selangor at five sites (at different altitudes) which were
   chosen as sampling stations. Forty-four lichen species were identified.
   Their diversity, composition and distribution correlated significantly
   with the forest's altitude and environmental factors, increasing at
   higher altitudes, While Graphidaceae and Physciaceae species were
   present at all altitudes, the dominant species changed according to
   altitude: some species of Parmeliaceae were found only at higher
   altitudes (601-1493 m), while C. xanthina and a few species from
   Physciaceae were present only at lower altitudes (0-600m), These
   findings will provide additional information about the lichens of the
   tropical montane forest of Malaysia, enhancing knowledge on how to
   manage and sustain lichens in this type of forest.},

Abstract = {Mountain areas are particularly attractive for the development of winter
   activities such as skiing, owing to both morphological and climatic
   conditions. However, mountain areas are at the same time vulnerable, For
   this reason, they are often under protection. This study focuses on two

   skiers' opinions and complaints regarding the resorts. In addition, a
   comparison between the resorts was conducted. In order to verify the
   relationship between socio-demographic variables and the skiers'
   opinions, two types of statistical tests were used: Spearman's rank
   correlation cfficient and Chi-square. The results show that the Kasprowy
   Wierch ski resort received a larger number of negative comments than
   Skolnate Pleso. However, Skalnate Pleso drew more negative opinions
   regarding the impact of the cable car and ski area on the landscape. The
   consequences of fulfilling visitors' expectations can be used
   practically by the managers of the protected areas.},

Abstract = {For the first time, a field project run by Weihenstephan-Triesdorf
   University of Applied Sciences has reached the finals of the 2020
   European Natura 2000 award. Just as special as the project's presence
   among the finalists in the Communication category has been the initial
   concept of the Spessart project. This field study was designed in close
   cooperation with specialist and municipal authorities, and local
   inhabitants, and was conducted in sites of communal and city forests in
   the Main-Spessart district. Over a period of 17 years, student groups
   focused on three overarching survey parameters, which were in accordance
   with the working instructions of the Bavarian State Institute of
   Forestry: Presence of Natura 2000 habitats, habitat structures, and
   Fauna (with a particular focus on value-adding bird species and bats).
   The evaluations of each parameter were carried out separately and then
   combined into an overall evaluation. Following the data analysis and
   evaluation phase, recommendations for optimizations and subsidies were
   made. The final results were presented to interested local people,
   authorities and the press. This information could inform and support
   grant and subsidy applications for nature and forest conservation
   efforts.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the Serengeti-Ngorongoro Biosphere
   Reserve, Tanzania, is successfully mitigating the immense challenges
   that rising population density and growing land-use pressure, as well as
   climate change and tourism, pose to vulnerable biodiversity hotspots,
   such as ancient Afromontane forests. The biosphere reserve's management
   approach to ecological and socio-cultural heritage was analysed using
   the Global-Local Drivers of Change model as a theoretical basis,
   together with The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)
   analysis framework. This empirical study of a relatively old Sub-Saharan
   African biosphere reserve (established in 1981) used a qualitative
   research approach, where data was collected from focus groups living in
   the reserve, and semi-structured interviews with Ngorongoro Conservation
   Area officials and other main stakeholders. Results show that the
   management focus on environmental conservation over socio-cultural
   heritage has led to population growth, cultural change and landscape
   transformation, leading to human-wildlife conflicts and negative
   park-people relationships. It is concluded that this biosphere reserve
   needs to better exploit its vast potential and adjust its institutional
   structure and operational strategies to align with modern Other
   Effective Area-Based Conservation Methods.},

Abstract = {The biosphere reserve (BR), as conceived by UNESCO, is a permanent
   intervention towards sustainable development. With 727 BRs in 131
   countries (osterreichisches MAB-Nationalkomitee 2021), this means
   interventions in highly diverse environmental, economic, socio-cultural
   and institutional contexts. With the MAB Strategy 2015-2025, the Lima
   Declaration 2016 and the Lima Action Plan 2016-2025, UNESCO BRs should
   develop fully into model regions for the implementation of the
   Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030 (SDGs) (United Nations 2015).
   Because of their varied contexts, the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere
   Reserves consists of different, but globally self-similar, fractal
   institutions. In this article we emphasize the understanding,
   implementation and management of BRs in Germany, Austria and
   Switzerland. These three European democracies are examples of federally
   structured states with comparatively wealthy economies as well as high
   political stability. Respect for property rights, regional acceptance,
   decentralized decision-making, and micro-and macro-economic
   considerations have always played decisive roles in the development of
   BRs in the DACH countries. We aim to identify, analyse and discuss the
   distinct characteristics and peculiarities of BRs in this area. We
   investigate how the framework conditions of sustainability, as presented
   in the concept of BRs, are perceived, discussed and implemented. As a
   basis for our analysis, we use a sample of 18 peer-reviewed
   publications, which were published collectively as a book on BRs in the
   DACH countries (Borsdorf et al. 2020). The individual publications
   present overviews, case studies and in-depth investigations in the three
   countries. All authors were invited to participate in a meta-text
   analysis. This was conducted in the form of a survey, a
   transdisciplinary workshop with a reflective design using a virtual
   whiteboard, and a concluding feedback loop. The results of the
   qualitative exploration are interpreted against the background of
   international comparisons and recent scholarly discussions. Based on the
   assumption that different types of ambigui-ties and conflicts are
   inherently a key element of the BR concept, we conclude that the DACH
   countries may have found specific ways to deal with and overcome these
   differences.},

Abstract = {In the Atacama Desert highlands, Aymara communities hove practised
   herding since pre-Hispanic times. Currently, large areas of the
   mountains' ecosystems are under official protection, This situation has
   created tensions between Aymara herding practices and official
   conservation policies. In this article, we document herding practices
   and how they have contributed to the production of these ecosystems. We
   also explore several conservation policies in the area and how they
   clash with Aymara herding, To do this, we make use of ethnography and
   state conservation plans. We suggest that these policies reproduce
   colonial dynamics, creating conflicting aims and affecting Aymara
   territorial rights. We conclude that traditional Aymara ecological
   knowledge and practices should guide the conservation of these mountain
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The 34th International Geographical Congress was held online from 16 to
   20 August 2021. Its main themes were strengthening our collective
   response to global problems and building bridges between continents. The
   International Geographical Union Commission of Mountain Studies
   (IGU-CMS) organized an International Symposium of Mountain Studies
   (Istanbul) as part of the congress, with 11 presentations over three
   different sessions. Three explored the development of mountain research
   methodology (montology), which underpins the advancement of mountain
   science. These focused on: montology as applied to mountain
   conservation; getting to grips with urbanization; and the reality of
   periglacial geographies. Other topics covered by the presentations
   included disciplinary methods of ecosystem dynamics, land-use change,
   transhumance, climate change model simulations of terraced landscapes,
   conservation of flagship species and mountain responses to extreme
   weather scenarios. The IGU-CMS also presented its plans for an edited
   book series on montology and announced the launch of its first volume
   (Montology Palimpsest: A Primer of Mountain Geographies) in time for
   next year's IGU Paris 2022.},

Abstract = {In Switzerland, Regional Nature Parks are required to undergo an impact
   assessment after ten years of operation, in order for the federal
   government to award the Park of National Importance label for a further
   ten years and for the government, relevant canton and communes to
   continue to provide financial support for the park's operation. To this
   end, is there a convenient way of identifying and holistically assessing
   the impacts of park management activities on the goals of the parks and
   the overarching targets of parks policy in Switzerland? Based on
   experience gained from the evaluation of three Regional Nature Parks, we
   have developed a framework model for the holistic evaluation of such
   parks and present it here for discussion.},

Abstract = {This paper explores motives for visiting nation I parks in Serbia. The
   results were obtained from the responses of 840 visitors who were
   surveyed while they were staying in Serbia's national parks during June
   2020. The aim of the paper is to examine whether the motives for
   visiting the parks correlate with visitors' sociodemographic
   charaderistics: gender, age, educational level and employment status.
   The results showed that there are statistically significant differences
   in motives to visit national parks in relation to gender, while among
   other sociodemographic characteristics such as employment status,
   education and age, the correlation is negligible. The scientific
   contribution of the paper lies in the possibility of applying the
   research results elsewhere, to help understand visitors' motives, as
   well as create attractive tourist offers in national parks based on
   sustainable development.},

   Vulnerable in the IUCN red list, and any population should be the
   subject of scientific attention. Both ungulates were monitored for a
   year in the Nador Mountains (western Algeria). This is the first record
   of aoudad in this part of Tiaret province. Both species are partly
   sympatric. However, the aoudad was sighted only in small numbers in the
   roughest valleys in the north. The gazelle population is larger, but
   with few juveniles. The future of these wild ungulates is therefore
   worrying, and new conservation measures are required, including
   protecting this area.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal is key to the persistence and spread of plant
   populations. Because the majority of plant species rely on animals to
   disperse their seeds, global change drivers that directly affect animals
   can cause cascading impacts on plant communities. In this review, we
   synthesize studies assessing how disperser loss alters plant
   populations, community patterns, multitrophic interactions, and
   ecosystem functioning. We argue that the magnitude of risk to plants
   from disperser loss is shaped by the combination of a plant species'
   inherent dependence on seed dispersal and the severity of the hazards
   faced by their dispersers. Because the factors determining a plant
   species' risk of decline due to disperser loss can be related to traits
   of the plants and dispersers, our framework enables a trait-based
   understanding of change in plant community composition and ecosystem
   functioning. We discuss how interactions among plants, among dispersers,
   and across other trophic levels also mediate plant community responses,
   and we identify areas for future research to understand and mitigate the
   consequences of disperser loss on plants globally.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that evolved behaviors play a determining role in
   facilitating and impeding the evolution of other traits has been
   discussed for more than 100 years with little consensus beyond an
   agreement that the ideas are theoretically plausible in accord with the
   Modern Synthesis. Many recent reviews of the genomic, epigenetic, and
   developmental mechanisms underpinning major behavioral transitions show
   how facultative expression of novel behaviors can lead to the evolution
   of obligate behaviors and structures that enhance behavioral function.
   Phylogenetic and genomic studies indicate that behavioral traits are
   generally evolutionarily more labile than other traits and that they
   help shape selective environments on the latter traits. Adaptive
   decision-making to encounter resources and avoid stress sources requires
   specific sensory inputs, which behaviorally shape selective environments
   by determining those features of the external world that are
   biologically relevant. These recent findings support the hypothesis of a
   dual role for behavior in evolution and are consistent with current
   evolutionary theory.},

Abstract = {Past biological invasions have contributed to shaping our present day
   biodiversity. For many island ecosystems, they are the only source of
   terrestrial life. At the same time, biological invasions, in particular
   when caused by human activity, are a major concern for the conservation
   of native species. It is therefore essential to understand the drivers
   of biological invasions as well as the role invasions have played in
   different ecosystems. Molecular tools have provided valuable data to
   reconstruct biological invasions, their drivers, and their impacts.
   Recent technological developments have further increased the potential
   of molecular tools to track past shifts in biodiversity. Here, we
   provide a perspective on how such molecular tools have influenced our
   understanding of past biological invasions and discuss how they may
   further help to shape our understanding and management of biological
   invasions.},

   understand the evolution of adaptive behaviors. Bats, with their
   extraordinarily high ecological diversity, are ideal animals for this
   purpose. An explosion in recent research allows for better understanding
   of the molecular, genetic, neural, and behavioral bases for sensory
   ecology and cognition in bats. We give examples of studies that
   illuminate connections between sensory and cognitive features of
   information filtering, evolutionary trade-offs in sensory and cognitive
   processing, and multimodal sensing and integration. By investigating the
   selective pressures underlying information acquisition, processing, and
   use in bats, we aim to illuminate patterns and processes driving sensory

Abstract = {Flowering plants exhibit two principal life-history strategies:
   annuality (living and reproducing in one year) and perenniality (living
   more than one year). The advantages of either strategy depend on the
   relative benefits of immediate reproduction balanced against
   survivorship and future reproduction. This trade-off means that
   life-history strategies are associated with particular environments,
   with annuals being found more often in unpredictable habitats. Annuality
   and perenniality are the outcome of developmental genetic programs
   responding to their environment, with perennials being distinguished by
   their delayed competence to flower and reversion to growth after
   flowering. Evolutionary transitions between these strategies are
   frequent and have consequences for mating systems and genome evolution,
   with perennials being more likely to outcross with higher inbreeding
   depression and lower rates of molecular evolution. Integrating
   expectations from life-history theory with knowledge of the
   developmental genetics of flowering and seasonality is required to
   understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution of annual and
   perennial life histories.},

Abstract = {Patterns of variation and evolution at a given site in a genome can be
   strongly influenced by the effects of selection at genetically linked
   sites. In particular, the recombination rates of genomic regions
   correlate with their amount of within-population genetic variability,
   the degree to which the frequency distributions of DNA sequence variants
   differ from their neutral expectations, and the levels of adaptation of
   their functional components. We review the major population genetic
   processes that are thought to lead to these patterns, focusing on their
   effects on patterns of variability: selective sweeps, background
   selection, associative overdominance, and Hill-Robertson interference
   among deleterious mutations. We emphasize the difficulties in
   distinguishing among the footprints of these processes and disentangling
   them from the effects of purely demographic factors such as population
   size changes. We also discuss how interactions between selective and
   demographic processes can significantly affect patterns of variability
   within genomes.},

   conservation and management has led to some concrete successes but has

   conservation interventions involve attempts to either attract or repel
   animals, which we refer to as approach/avoidance issues. These attempts
   can be reframed as issues of manipulating the decisions animals make,
   which are driven by their perceptual abilities and attentional biases,
   as well as the value animals attribute to current stimuli and past
   learned experiences. These processes all fall under the umbrella of
   animal cognition. Here, we highlight rules that emerge when considering
   approach/avoidance conservation issues through the lens of
   cognitive-based management. For each rule, we review relevant
   conservation successes and failures to better predict the conditions in
   which behavior can be manipulated, and we suggest how to avoid future
   failures.},

Abstract = {The emergence of a new phylogeny of ray-finned fishes at the turn of the
   twenty-first century marked a paradigm shift in understanding the
   evolutionary history of half of living vertebrates. We review how the
   new ray-finned fish phylogeny radically departs from classical
   expectations based on morphology. We focus on evolutionary relationships
   that span the backbone of ray-finned fish phylogeny, from the earliest
   divergences among teleosts and nonteleosts to the resolution of major
   lineages of Percomorpha. Throughout, we feature advances gained by the
   new phylogeny toward a broader understanding of ray-finned fish
   evolutionary history and the implications for topics that span from the
   genetics of human health to reconsidering the concept of living fossils.
   Additionally, we discuss conceptual challenges that involve reconciling
   taxonomic classification with phylogenetic relationships and propose an
   alternate higher-level classification for Percomorpha. Our review
   highlights remaining areas of phylogenetic uncertainty and opportunities
   for comparative investigations empowered by this new phylogenetic
   perspective on ray-finned fishes.},

Abstract = {Glaciers are retreating globally, and the resulting ice-free areas
   provide an experimental system for understanding species colonization
   patterns, community formation, and dynamics. The last several years have
   seen crucial advances in our understanding of biotic colonization after
   glacier retreats, resulting from the integration of methodological
   innovations and ecological theories. Recent empirical studies have
   demonstrated how multiple factors can speed up or slow down the velocity
   of colonization and have helped scientists develop theoretical models
   that describe spatiotemporal changes in community structure. There is a
   growing awareness of how different processes (e.g., time since glacier
   retreat, onset or interruption of surface processes, abiotic factors,
   dispersal, biotic interactions) interact to shape community formation
   and, ultimately, their functional structure through succession. Here, we
   examine how these studies address key theoretical questions about
   community dynamics and show how classical approaches are increasingly
   being combined with environmental DNA metabarcoding and functional trait
   analysis to document the formation of multitrophic communities,
   revolutionizing our understanding of the biotic processes that occur
   following glacier retreat.},

Abstract = {Beyond the better-studied carbohydrates and the macronutrients nitrogen
   and phosphorus, a remaining 20 or so elements are essential for life and
   have distinct geographical distributions, making them of keen interest
   to ecologists. Here, I provide a framework for understanding how
   shortfalls in micronutrients like iodine, copper, and zinc can regulate
   individual fitness, abundance, and ecosystem function. With a special
   focus on sodium, I show how simple experiments manipulating
   biogeochemistry can reveal why many of the variables that ecologists
   study vary so dramatically from place to place. I conclude with a
   discussion of how the Anthropocene's changing temperature,
   precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 levels are contributing to nutrient
   dilution (decreases in the nutrient quality at the base of food webs).},

Abstract = {Our understanding of ungulate migration is advancing rapidly due to
   innovations in modern animal tracking. Herein, we review and synthesize
   nearly seven decades of work on migration and other long-distance
   movements of wild ungulates. Although it has long been appreciated that
   ungulates migrate to enhance access to forage, recent contributions
   demonstrate that their movements are fine tuned to dynamic landscapes
   where forage, snow, and drought change seasonally. Researchers are
   beginning to understand how ungulates navigate migrations, with the
   emerging view that animals blend gradient tracking with spatial memory,
   some of which is socially learned. Although migration often promotes
   abundant populations-with broad effects on ecosystems-many migrations
   around the world have been lost or are currently threatened by habitat
   fragmentation, climate change, and barriers to movement. Fortunately,
   new efforts that use empirical tracking data to map migrations in detail
   are facilitating effective conservation measures to maintain ungulate
   migration.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection has the potential to decrease mean fitness in a
   population through an array of costs to nonsexual fitness. These costs
   may be offset when sexual selection favors individuals with high
   nonsexual fitness, causing the alignment of sexual and natural
   selection. We review the many laboratory experiments that have
   manipulated mating systems aimed at quantifying the net effects of
   sexual selection on mean fitness. These must be interpreted in light of
   population history and the diversity of ways manipulations have altered
   sexual interactions, sexual conflict, and sexual and natural selection.
   Theory and data suggest a net benefit is more likely when sexually
   concordant genetic variation is enhanced and that ecological context can
   mediate the relative importance of these different effects. Comparative
   studies have independently examined the consequences of sexual selection
   for population/species persistence. These provide little indication of a
   benefit, and interpreting these higher-level responses is challenging.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary rates play a central role in connecting micro- and
   macroevolution. All evolutionary rate estimates, including rates of
   molecular evolution, trait evolution, and lineage diversification, share
   a similar scaling pattern with time: The highest rates are those
   measured over the shortest time interval. This creates a disconnect
   between micro- and macroevolution, although the pattern is the opposite
   of what some might expect: Patterns of change over short timescales
   predict that evolution has tremendous potential to create variation and
   that potential is barely tapped by macroevolution. In this review, we
   discuss this shared scaling pattern across evolutionary rates. We break
   down possible explanations for scaling into two categories, estimation
   error and model misspecification, and discuss how both apply to each
   type of rate. We also discuss the consequences of this ubiquitous
   pattern, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing rates over
   different timescales. Finally, after addressing purely statistical
   concerns, we explore a few possibilities for a shared unifying
   explanation across the three types of rates that results from a failure
   to fully understand and account for how biological processes scale over
   time.},

Abstract = {Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and
   slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are
   emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components.
   Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating,
   cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include
   food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production,
   pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement,
   mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration,
   landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to
   biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate
   and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health
   and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water
   conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known
   about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity.
   Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting
   of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon
   sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating
   biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize,
   notwithstanding regional character.},

Abstract = {Although research performed in cities will not uncover new evolutionary
   mechanisms, it could provide unprecedented opportunities to examine the
   interplay of evolutionary forces in new ways and new avenues to address
   classic questions. However, while the variation within and among cities
   affords many opportunities to advance evolutionary biology research,
   careful alignment between how cities are used and the research questions
   being asked is necessary to maximize the insights that can be gained. In
   this review, we develop a framework to help guide alignment between
   urban evolution research approaches and questions. Using this framework,
   we highlight what has been accomplished to date in the field of urban
   evolution and identify several up-and-coming research directions for
   further expansion. We conclude that urban environments can be used as
   evolutionary test beds to tackle both new and long-standing questions in
   evolutionary biology.},

Abstract = {The concept of evolvability emerged in the early 1990s and soon became
   fashionable as a label for different streams of research in evolutionary
   biology. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, evolvability is defined
   as the ability of a population to respond to directional selection. This
   differs from other fields by treating evolvability as a property of
   populations rather than organisms or lineages and in being focused on
   quantification and short-term prediction rather than on macroevolution.
   While the term evolvability is new to quantitative genetics, many of the
   associated ideas and research questions have been with the field from
   its inception as biometry. Recent research on evolvability is more than
   a relabeling of old questions, however. New operational measures of
   evolvability have opened possibilities for understanding adaptation to
   rapid environmental change, assessing genetic constraints, and linking
   micro- and macroevolution.},

Abstract = {Communication occurs when a sender emits a cue perceived by a receiver
   that changes the receiver's behavior. Plants perceive information
   regarding light, water, other nutrients, touch, herbivores, pathogens,
   mycorrhizae, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants also emit cues
   perceived by other plants, beneficial microbes, herbivores, enemies of
   herbivores, pollinators, and seed dispersers. Individuals responding to
   light cues experienced increased fitness. Evidence for benefits of
   responding to cues involving herbivores and pathogens is more limited.
   The benefits of emitting cues are also less clear, particularly for
   plant-plant communication. Reliance onmultiple or dosage-dependent cues
   can reduce inappropriate responses, and plants often remember past cues.
   Plants have multiple needs and prioritize conflicting cues such that the
   risk of abiotic stress is treated as greater than that of shading, which
   is in turn treated as greater than that of consumption. Plants can
   distinguish self from nonself and kin from strangers. They can identify
   the species of competitor or consumer and respond appropriately. Cues
   involving mutualists often contain highly specific information.},

   ecological and evolutionary studies that are not possible in the
   laboratory or small experimental plots. The nuclear accident at
   Chernobyl (1986) allows for rigorous analyses of radiation effects on
   individuals and populations at an ecosystem scale. Here, the current
   state of knowledge related to populations within the Chernobyl region of
   Ukraine and Belarus following the largest civil nuclear accident in
   history is reviewed. There is now a significant literature that provides
   contrasting and occasionally conflicting views of the state of animals
   and how they are affected by this mutagenic stressor. Studies of genetic
   and physiological effects have largely suggested significant injuries to
   individuals inhabiting the more radioactive areas of the Chernobyl
   region. Most population censuses for most species suggest that
   abundances are reduced in the more radioactive areas.},

Abstract = {Understanding what regulates population sizes of organisms with complex
   life cycles is challenging because limits on population sizes can occur
   at any stage or transition. We extend a conceptual framework to explore
   whether numbers of successfully laid eggs determine densities of later
   stages in insects, fish, amphibians, and snails inhabiting marine,
   freshwater, or terrestrial habitats. Our review suggests novel
   hypotheses, which propose characteristics of species or environments
   that create spatial variation in egg densities and predict when such
   patterns are maintained throughout subsequent life-cycle stages.
   Existing data, although limited, suggest that persistent, strong
   associations between egg and subsequent juvenile densities are likely
   for species where suitable egg-laying habitat is in short supply. Those
   associations are weakened in some environments and for some species by
   density-dependent losses of eggs or hatchlings. Such cross-ecosystem
   comparisons are fundamental to generality in ecology but demand
   place-based understandings of species' biology and natural history.},

Abstract = {Allelopathy (i.e., chemical interaction among species) was originally
   conceived as inclusive of positive and negative effects of plants on
   other plants, and we adopt this view. Most studies of allelopathy have
   been phenomenological, but we focus on studies that have explored the
   ecological significance of this interaction. The literature suggests
   that studies of allelopathy have been particularly important for three
   foci in ecology: species distribution, conditionality of interactions,
   and maintenance of species diversity. There is evidence that allelopathy
   influences local distributions of plant species around the world.
   Allelopathic conditionality appears to arise through coevolution, and
   this is a mechanism for plant invasions. Finally, allelopathy promotes
   species coexistence via intransitive competition, modifications of
   direct interactions, and (co)evolution. Recent advances additionally
   suggest that coexistence might be favored through biochemical
   recognition. The preponderance of phenomenological studies
   notwithstanding, allelopathy has broad ecological consequences.},

Abstract = {The increased capacity of DNA sequencing has significantly advanced our
   understanding of the phylogeny of birds and the proximate and ultimate
   mechanisms molding their genomic diversity. In less than a decade, the
   number of available avian reference genomes has increased to over
   500-approximately 5\% of bird diversity-placing birds in a privileged
   position to advance the fields of phylogenomics and comparative,
   functional, and population genomics. Whole-genome sequence data, as well
   as indels and rare genomic changes, are further resolving the avian tree
   of life. The accumulation of bird genomes, increasingly with long-read
   sequence data, greatly improves the resolution of genomic features such
   as germline-restricted chromosomes and the Wchromosome, and is
   facilitating the comparative integration of genotypes and phenotypes.
   Community-based initiatives such as the Bird 10,000 Genomes Project and
   Vertebrate Genome Project are playing a fundamental role in amplifying
   and coalescing a vibrant international program in avian comparative
   genomics.},

Abstract = {In this review, we highlight the main insights that have been gathered
   from recent developments using large-scale genomics of fungal
   saprotrophs and symbiotrophs (including ectomycorrhizal and orchid and
   ericoid mycorrhizal fungi) inhabiting forest ecosystems. After assessing
   the goals and motivations underlying our approach, we explore our
   current understanding of the limits and future potential of using
   genomics to understand the ecological roles of these forest fungi.
   Comparative genomics unraveled the molecular machineries involved in
   lignocellulose decomposition in wood decayers, soil and litter
   saprotrophs, and mycorrhizal symbionts. They also showed that
   transitions from saprotrophy to mutualism entailed widespread losses of
   lignocellulose-degrading enzymes; diversification of novel,
   lineage-specific symbiosis-induced genes; and convergent evolution of
   genetic innovations that facilitate the accommodation of mutualistic
   symbionts within their plant hosts. We also identify the major questions
   that remain unanswered and propose new avenues of genome-based research
   to understand the role of soil fungi in sustainable forest ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We examine the evidence linking species' traits to contemporary range
   shifts and find they are poor predictors of range shifts that have
   occurred over decades to a century. We then discuss reasons for the poor
   performance of traits for describing interspecific variation in range
   shifts from two perspectives: (a) factors associated with species'
   traits that degrade range-shift signals stemming from the measures used
   for species' traits, traits that are typically not analyzed, and the
   influence of phylogeny on range-shift potential and (b) issues in
   quantifying range shifts and relating them to species' traits due to
   imperfect detection of species, differences in the responses of
   altitudinal and latitudinal ranges, and emphasis on testing linear
   relationships between traits and range shifts instead of nonlinear
   responses. Improving trait-based approaches requires a recognition that
   traits within individuals interact in unexpected ways and that different
   combinations of traits may be functionally equivalent.},

Abstract = {Evolution has been viewed as occurring primarily through selection among
   individuals. We present a framework based on multilevel selection for
   evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with
   supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role
   that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community
   organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in
   creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and
   those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple
   levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with
   mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the
   Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary
   processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has
   the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.},

Abstract = {The twenty-first century has witnessed an explosion in research on
   animal migration, in large part due to a technological revolution in
   tracking and remote-sensing technologies, along with advances in
   genomics and integrative biology. We now have access to unprecedented
   amounts of data on when, where, and how animals migrate across various
   continents and oceans. Among the important advancements, recent studies
   have uncovered a surprising level of variation in migratory trajectories
   at the species and population levels with implications for both
   speciation and the conservation of migratory populations. At the
   organismal level, studies linking molecular and physiological mechanisms
   to traits that support migration have revealed a remarkable amount of
   seasonal flexibility in many migratory animals. Advancements in the
   theory for why animals migrate have resulted in promising new directions
   for empirical studies. We provide an overview of the current state of
   knowledge and promising future avenues of study.},

Abstract = {When a phenological shift affects a demographic vital rate such as
   survival or reproduction, the altered vital rate may or may not have
   population-level consequences. We review the evidence that climate
   change affects populations by shifting species' phenologies, emphasizing
   the importance of demographic life-history theory. We find many examples
   of phenological shifts having both positive and negative consequences
   for vital rates. Yet, few studies link phenological shifts to changes in
   vital rates known to drive population dynamics, especially in plants.
   When this link ismade, results are largely consistent with life-history
   theory: Phenological shifts have populationlevel consequences when they
   affect survival in longer-lived organisms and reproduction in
   shorter-lived organisms. However, there are just as many cases in which
   demographic mechanisms buffer population growth from phenologically
   induced changes in vital rates. We provide recommendations for future
   research aiming to understand the complex relationships among climate,
   phenology, and demography, which will help to elucidate the extent to
   which phenological shifts actually alter population persistence.},

Abstract = {Linking interspecific interactions (e.g., mutualism, competition,
   predation, parasitism) to macroevolution (evolutionary change on deep
   timescales) is a key goal in biology. The role of species interactions
   in shaping macroevolutionary trajectories has been studied for centuries
   and remains a cutting-edge topic of current research. However, despite
   its deep historical roots, classic and current approaches to this topic
   are highly diverse. Here, we combine historical and contemporary
   perspectives on the study of ecological interactions in macroevolution,
   synthesizing ideas across eras to build a zoomed-out picture of the big
   questions at the nexus of ecology and macroevolution. We discuss the
   trajectory of this important and challenging field, dividing research
   into work done before the 1970s, research between 1970 and 2005, and
   work done since 2005. We argue that in response to long-standing
   questions in paleobiology, evidence accumulated to date has demonstrated
   that biotic interactions (including mutualism) can influence lineage
   diversification and trait evolution over macroevolutionary timescales,
   and we outline major open questions for future research in the field.},

Abstract = {Interactions between plants and microbes have important influences on
   evolutionary processes, population dynamics, community structure, and
   ecosystem function. We review the literature to document how climate
   change may disrupt these ecological interactions and develop a
   conceptual framework to integrate the pathways of plant-microbe
   responses to climate over different scales in space and time. We then
   create a blueprint to aid generalization that categorizes climate
   effects into changes in the context dependency of plant-microbe pairs,
   temporal mismatches and altered feedbacks over time, or spatial
   mismatches that accompany species range shifts. We pair a new graphical
   model of how plant-microbe interactions influence resistance to climate
   change with a statistical approach to predict the consequences of
   increasing variability in climate. Finally, we suggest pathways through
   which plant-microbe interactions can affect resilience during recovery
   from climate disruption. Throughout, we take a forward-looking
   perspective, highlighting knowledge gaps and directions for future
   research.},

Abstract = {All species within ecosystems contribute to regulating carbon cycling
   because of their functional integration into food webs. Yet carbon
   modeling and accounting still assumes that only plants, microbes, and
   invertebrate decomposer species are relevant to the carbon cycle. Our
   multifaceted review develops a case for considering a wider range of
   species, especially herbivorous and carnivorous wild animals. Animal
   control over carbon cycling is shaped by the animals' stoichiometric
   needs and functional traits in relation to the stoichiometry and
   functional traits of their resources. Quantitative synthesis reveals
   that failing to consider these mechanisms can lead to serious
   inaccuracies in the carbon budget. Newer carbon-cycle models that
   consider food-web structure based on organismal functional traits and
   stoichiometry can offer mechanistically informed predictions about the
   magnitudes of animal effects that will help guide new empirical research
   aimed at developing a coherent understanding of the interactions and
   importance of all species within food webs.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary adaptation to temperature and climate depends on both the
   extent to which organisms experience spatial and temporal environmental
   variation (exposure) and how responsive they are to the environmental
   variation (sensitivity). Theoretical models and experiments suggesting
   substantial potential for thermal adaptation have largely omitted
   realistic environmental variation. Environmental variation can drive
   fluctuations in selection that slow adaptive evolution. We review how
   carefully filtering environmental conditions based on how organisms
   experience their environment and further considering organismal
   sensitivity can improve predictions of thermal adaptation. We contrast
   taxa differing in exposure and sensitivity. Plasticity can increase the
   rate of evolutionary adaptation in taxa exposed to pronounced
   environmental variation. However, forms of plasticity that severely
   limit exposure, such as behavioral thermoregulation and phenological
   shifts, can hinder thermal adaptation. Despite examples of rapid thermal
   adaptation, experimental studies often reveal evolutionary constraints.
   Further investigating these constraints and issues of timescale and
   thermal history are needed to predict evolutionary adaptation and,
   consequently, population persistence in changing and variable
   environments.},

Abstract = {Phylogenomics underpins a stable and mostly well-resolved hypothesis for
   the interrelationships of extant arthropods. Exceptionally preserved
   fossils are integrated into this framework by coding their morphological
   characters, as exemplified by total-evidence dating approaches that
   treat fossils as dated tips in analyses numerically dominated by
   molecular data. Cambrian fossils inform on the sequence of character
   acquisition in the arthropod stem group and in the stems of its main
   extant clades. The arthropod head problem incorporates unique appendage
   combinations and remains of the nervous system in fossils into a scheme
   mostly based on neuroanatomy and Hox expression domains for extant
   forms. Molecular estimates of arthropod origins in the Cryogenian or
   Ediacaran predate a coherent picture from the arthropod fossil record,
   which commences as trace fossils in the earliest Cambrian. Probabilistic
   morphological clock analysis of trilobites, which exemplify the earliest
   arthropod body fossils, supports a Cambrian origin, without the need to
   posit an unfossilized Ediacaran history.},

Abstract = {Flower evolution is characterized by widespread repetition, with
   adaptations to pollinator environment evolving in parallel. Recent
   studies have expanded our understanding of the developmental basis of
   adaptive floral novelties-petal fusion, bilateral symmetry, heterostyly,
   and floral dimensions. In this article, we describe patterns of trait
   evolution and review developmental genetic mechanisms underlying floral
   novelties. We discuss the diversity of mechanisms for parallel
   adaptation, the evidence for constraints on these mechanisms, and how
   constraints help explain observed macroevolutionary patterns. We
   describe parallel evolution resulting from similarities at multiple
   hierarchical levels-genetic, developmental, morphological,
   functional-which indicate general principles in floral evolution,
   including the central role of hormone signaling. An emerging pattern is
   mutational bias that may contribute to rapid patterns of parallel
   evolution, especially if the derived trait can result from simple
   degenerative mutations. We argue that such mutational bias may be less
   likely to govern the evolution of novelties patterned by complex
   developmental pathways.},

Abstract = {The ecology of fear concerns the population-, community-, and
   ecosystem-level consequences of the behavioral interactions between
   predators and prey, i.e., the aggregate impacts of individual responses
   to life-threatening events. We review new experiments demonstrating that
   fear itself is powerful enough to affect the population growth rate in
   free-living wild birds and mammals, and fear of large carnivores-or the
   human super predator-can cause trophic cascades affecting plant and
   invertebrate abundance. Life-threatening events like escaping a predator
   can have enduring, even lifelong, effects on the brain, and new
   interdisciplinary research on the neurobiology of fear in wild animals
   is both providing insights into post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and
   reinforcing the likely commonality of population- and community-level
   effects of fear in nature. Failing to consider fear thus risks
   dramatically underestimating the total impact predators can have on prey
   populations and the critical role predator-prey interactions can play in

Abstract = {During the past 541 million years, marine animals underwent three
   intervals of diversification (early Cambrian, Ordovician,
   Cretaceous-Cenozoic) separated by nondirectional fluctuation, suggesting
   diversity-dependent dynamics with the equilibrium diversity shifting
   through time. Changes in factors such as shallow-marine habitat area and
   climate appear to have modulated the nondirectional fluctuations.
   Directional increases in diversity are best explained by evolutionary
   innovations in marine animals and primary producers coupled with
   stepwise increases in the availability of food and oxygen. Increasing
   intensity of biotic interactions such as predation and disturbance may
   have led to positive feedbacks on diversification as ecosystems became
   more complex. Important areas for further research include improving the
   geographic coverage and temporal resolution of paleontological data
   sets, as well as deepening our understanding of Earth system evolution
   and the physiological and ecological traits that modulated organismal
   responses to environmental change.},

Abstract = {Studies of cetacean evolution using genetics and other biomolecules have
   come a long way-from the use of allozymes and short sequences of
   mitochondrial or nuclear DNA to the assembly of full nuclear genomes and
   characterization of proteins and lipids. Cetacean research has also
   advanced from using only contemporary samples to analyzing samples
   dating back thousands of years, and to retrieving data from indirect
   environmental sources, including water or sediments. Combined, these
   studies have profoundly deepened our understanding of the origin of
   cetaceans; their adaptation and speciation processes; and of the past
   population change, migration, and admixture events that gave rise to the
   diversity of cetaceans found today.},

Abstract = {Species tree estimation is a basic part of many biological research
   projects, ranging from answering basic evolutionary questions (e.g., how
   did a group of species adapt to their environments?) to addressing
   questions in functional biology. Yet, species tree estimation is very
   challenging, due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene
   duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer, and hybridization, which
   can make gene trees differ from each other and from the overall
   evolutionary history of the species. Over the last 10-20 years, there
   has been tremendous growth in methods and mathematical theory for
   estimating species trees and phylogenetic networks, and some of these
   methods are now in wide use. In this survey, we provide an overview of
   the current state of the art, identify the limitations of existing
   methods and theory, and propose additional research problems and
   directions.},

Abstract = {Mutually beneficial interspecific interactions are abundant throughout
   the natural world, including between microbes. Mutualisms between
   microbes are critical for everything from human health to global
   nutrient cycling. Studying model microbial mutualisms in the laboratory
   enables highly controlled experiments for developing and testing
   evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. In this review, we begin by
   describing the tools available for studying model microbial mutualisms.
   We then outline recent insights that laboratory systems have shed on the
   evolutionary origins, evolutionary dynamics, and ecological features of
   microbial mutualism. We touch on gaps in our current understanding of
   microbial mutualisms, note connections to mutualism in nonmicrobial
   systems, and call attention to open questions ripe for future study.},

Abstract = {Most biological invasion literature-including syntheses and
   meta-analyses and the resulting theory-is reported from temperate
   regions, drawing only minimally from the tropics except for some island
   systems. The lack of attention to invasions in the tropics results from
   and reinforces the assumption that tropical ecosystems, and especially
   the continental tropics, are more resistant to invasions. We have
   critically assessed biological invasions in the tropics and compared
   them with temperate regions, finding relatively weak evidence that
   tropical and temperate regions differ in their invasibility and in the
   traits that determine invader success and impacts. Propagule pressure
   and the traits that promote adaptation to disturbances (e.g., high
   fecundity or fast growth rates) are generally favorable to invasions in
   both tropical and temperate regions. We emphasize the urgent need for
   greater investment and regional cooperation in the study, prevention,
   and management of biological invasions in the tropics.},

Abstract = {Plants are the foundation of the food web and therefore interact
   directly and indirectly with myriad organisms at higher trophic levels.
   They directly provide nourishment to mutualistic and antagonistic
   primary consumers (e.g., pollinators and herbivores), which in turn are
   consumed by predators. These interactions produce cascading indirect
   effects on plants (either trait-mediated or density-mediated). We review
   how predators affect plant-pollinator interactions and thus how
   predators indirectly affect plant reproduction, fitness, mating systems,
   and trait evolution. Predators can influence pollinator abundance and
   foraging behavior. In many cases, predators cause pollinators to visit
   plants less frequently and for shorter durations. This decline in
   visitation can lead to pollen limitation and decreased seed set.
   However, alternative outcomes can result due to differences in predator,
   pollinator, and plant functional traits as well as due to altered
   interaction networks with plant enemies. Furthermore, predators may
   indirectly affect the evolution of plant traits and mating systems.},

Title = {Evolution of Mimicry Rings as a Window into Community Dynamics},

Pages = {315-341},
Abstract = {Mimicry rings are communities of mimetic organisms that are excellent
   models for ecological and evolutionary studies because the community
   composition, the nature of the species interactions, the phenotypes
   under selection, and the selective agents are well characterized. Here,
   we review how regional and ecological filtering, density- and
   frequency-dependent selection, toxicity of prey, and age of mimicry
   rings shape their assembly. We synthesize findings from theoretical and
   empirical studies to generate the following hypotheses: (a) the degree
   of unpalatability and age of mimicry rings increase mimicry ring size
   and (b) the degree of unpalatability, generalization of the aposematic
   signal, and availability of alternative prey are positively related to
   the breadth of the protection umbrella for an aposematic signal and
   negatively related to the degree of mimetic resemblance. We also provide
   a phylogenetic framework in which key aspects of mimicry ring
   diversification may be studied.},
