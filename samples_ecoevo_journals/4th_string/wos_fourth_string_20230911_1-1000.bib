Title = {Diet of five Trachylepis skink species (Scincidae: Mabuyinae) in savanna

Abstract = {Lizards, especially skinks (Scincidae) occurring in arid environments
   constitute good study objects to test niche differentiation and other
   related issues of interspecific competition. Diet of five Trachylepis
   skink (T. punctulata, binotata, T. capensis, T. wahlbergii, T. damarana)
   was studied through stomach content analysis. Skinks were collected in
   savanna habitats in Namibia. In all these species, active foraging
   strategy predominates. All skink species preyed almost exclusively on
   insects. Four insect taxa comprised the bulk of diet in all five species
   investigated: Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Isoptera, Hymenoptera (Formicidae)
   and larvae. Their overall contribution ranged from 72.2\% to 100.0\% of
   all prey items in the diet of particular skink species. Most prey items
   were below 10 mm long, some were 11-20 mm in length. Both males and
   females fed on the same prey groups, but there were marked differences
   in the proportions of these groups. In general, males preyed more on
   beetles and grasshoppers, while females - more on ants. All main prey
   groups were recorded both in dry and in wet season in all five skink
   species. Food niche overlap was the highest between T. damarana and
   T.wahlbergii (0.84), and between T. binotata and T. punctulata (0.77).
   No overlap in food niche was recorded between T. capensis and T.
   punctulata, and low overlap (0.26) between T. capensis and T binotata.},

Title = {What determines ion content of lumbricid casts: soil type, species, or

Abstract = {Most soils possess a large supply of nutrients, but these reserves
   cannot be mobilized by plants, as they exist in a bound form. Therefore,
   it is need to understand mechanisms that naturally increase the
   acquisition of nutrients by plants. Earthworms are crucial soil
   engineers that play a key role in soil functioning. In this study we
   have estimated the impact of three factors, earthworm species,
   ecological group, and soil type, on the ion content of casts of Eisenia
   nordenskioldi, E. ventripapillata, E. nana, Lumbricus rubellus, and
   Aporrectodea caliginosa. Laboratory experiments were performed in
   microcosms on three soil types. We analyzed five water-soluble cations
   and six anions in the earthworm casts by capillary zone electrophoresis
   to determine their content in casts compared to soil. For three of the
   five species studied this is the first information obtained on the
   matter. The obtained data demonstrated that soil type has the biggest
   impact on the observed changes in the cast ion content, probably due to
   the differences in the initial concentrations and soil properties.
   Within each soil type, the observed effects were mostly
   species-specific, and the species belonging to the same ecological group
   (endogeic and epi-endogeic) did not have similar effects. The exposure
   to different earthworm species resulted in pronounced differences in the
   concentrations of magnesium, calcium, ammonium, and chloride, while the
   soil type had the highest impact on sulfate, fluoride, acetate, and
   sodium ions. Therefore, the terms `ecological group and `functional
   group' are not equivalent for earthworm casts, and replacing an
   earthworm species with another belonging to the same ecological group
   may result in changes of the soil ion composition.},

Abstract = {The spatial patterns of carbon pool in landscape vary greatly with
   variation of forest structures and climate conditions. In this field
   study, the carbon storage in overstory, understory, litter layer of
   plants and soil carbon in forests was investigated in 26-28 year-old
   Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) pure and mixed forests along a
   latitudinal gradient (20-30 degrees N) crossing Hunan and Guangxi
   provinces of China, during the period of May 2015-August 2017. We found
   that the total carbon storage in Masson pine forests ranged 88.92-149.41
   Mg/ha, of which 54.03\% occurred in aboveground compound and 45.97\%
   occurred belowground. The overall total carbon storage distribution was
   34.62-68.72 Mg/ha, 3.82-10.19 Mg/ha, 2.37-3.96 Mg/ha, and 6.06-12.08
   Mg/ha in stems, branches, leaves, and roots, respectively. The carbon
   storage in the overstory of forest stands and forest soils significantly
   decreased with increasing latitude, while the carbon storage in the
   understory and litter of the forest stands significantly increased as
   the latitude increased. `Ihe overall carbon storage significantly
   decreases by 8.26 Mg/ha in Masson pine forests as the latitude increased
   by one degree. The carbon storage increased by 8.43\% in Masson pine
   mixed forests compared to the pure forest stands after the
   transformation from the pure forest stands into the mixed forest stands
   similar to 15 years later. The results of changes in carbon storage in
   the studied forests with the latitudinal gradient could be attributed to
   variations in hydrothermal conditions with changing latitudes. The
   forest structure with different tree species composition was another
   important factor regulating carbon storage in forest ecosystems at the
   same latitude. The results provided a scientific basis for better
   understanding of latitudinal variation and spatial distribution of
   carbon storage in Masson pine forest stands with optimal forest stand
   structures in subtropical region of China.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric conditions play an important role in structuring avian
   communities in space and time. Here we assess the role of weather
   conditions on the distribution and abundance of the enigmatic glossy
   ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in Northeast Algeria in both wintering
   grounds and in breeding areas in a survey spanning from 2011 to 2019.
   During the study period, cooler years were wetter and warmer years were
   drier. The wintering population size in the region could be estimated to
   200-300 individuals. The number of individuals in wintering grounds
   increased in recent years in one site (Berrihane), but it did not show a
   strong association with weather conditions prior to wintering. Four
   breeding colonies were detected in highly-vegetated ponds with in-water
   trees where the number of breeding pairs was the highest. Extinction was
   recorded for two colonies (50\% of colonies) where one permanently
   disappeared and one exhibited a series of extinctions and
   recolonizations across years. The estimated colony size was larger at El
   Dakhla (60-105 pairs) than El Chatt (0-42 pairs), Fezara Lake (25-41
   pairs), and Tonga Lake (0-2 pairs). Climate conditions seemed to
   correlate with the number of pairs in one site (El Chatt) such that warm
   and dry years were associated with lower number of individuals. We
   discuss that disturbance and pollution might play a role in colony
   establishment but the number of pairs is positively related to the
   extinction of a nearby colony, suggesting that those refuge colonies are
   crucial for the persistence of the species in the area. This study
   presents historical data on the occurrence and abundance of a relatively
   unstudied species and gives new information on its climatic sensitivity
   which might be helpful for predicting future climate change impacts.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Farmland water bodies (FWBs) are marginal habitats in the agricultural
   landscape. However, regardless of their small size, they are refuges for
   natural vegetation and species-rich animal assemblages. They are
   especially important in areas where the intensification of agricultural
   activities reduces the ecological quality of the landscape. The study
   aimed to evaluate the effect of the habitat structure of the FWB buffer
   zone on macrophyte association diversity in the FWBs (n = 49). As many
   as 175 species of vascular plants, three stoneworts, and 40 (41-49
   according to Chao2 estimator) plant associations were recognized,
   including 19 of high conservation priority. The occurrence of threatened
   associations (0-5 per FWB) was not correlated with the number of common
   (unthreatened) ones. The most important predictors of plant diversity
   (at the species level and the association level) were the connection of
   the FWB with a watercourse (positive effect), and the distance from the
   FWB to the nearest built-up areas (positive effect). The results suggest
   that even though the high percentage cover of perennial vegetation
   mitigates the effect of diffused pollutions of agricultural origin on
   FWB biota, its significance may become low when the distance from a
   built-up area to FWBs is small.},

Abstract = {The growth rate of the diameter of trees is significantly correlated
   with their age; therefore, a growth model can be established to predict
   the dynamics of the population. To reveal the relationship between
   individual age and diameters at breast height (DBH) of D. involucrata,
   five populations were chosen in the largest distribution area of D.
   involucrata in Sichuan province. Dendrochronology and regression model
   was used to evaluate the distribution of the DBH and its relationship
   with the age, respectively. All 130 D. involucrata trees recorded in the
   studied plots, with the minimum DBH of 3.8 cm, and the maximum of 45.5
   cm, corresponding to the minimum age of 4 years and the maximum age of
   98 years. The results showed that in the first 11 DBH classes (DBH < 22
   cm), the tree DBH increases relatively slowly with the growth of the
   age. After the 11th DBH class, the DBH class increases slowly with
   increasing tree age. The tree age exceeds 20 years, the increase in the
   DBH growth rates with tree age is similar among the five populations.
   The linear models were fitted to determine the regression equation for
   the DBH growth curve of D. involucrata, which can be well described by a
   parabolic model. Under normal forest stand development and growth
   conditions, the model can be widely applied to study the ages of
   individual D. involucrata.},

Title = {Detectability of elusive reptiles under artificial cover objects is

Abstract = {Field surveys of rare and elusive reptiles often encounter the problem
   of low detectability. Therefore, several techniques have been invented
   to improve detection probability and artificial cover objects (ACOs) are
   among the most commonly used in reptile studies. However, the
   methodological effectiveness of ACOs has been rarely evaluated and
   focused mostly on spatial aspects. The temporal dimension of the ACOs
   effectiveness remains still understudied, despite well-known seasonal
   variation in reptile activity patterns. Here, we examined seasonal and
   between-year variation in the fraction of occupied ACOs, as a proxy for
   detectability, in two elusive reptile species, the slow worm Anguis
   fragilis and smooth snake Coronella austriaca. We found that the use of
   ACOs was species-specific and showed high temporal variation. In the
   case of smooth snakes, monthly usage varied between years; specifically
   within-year variation of the proportion in occupied ACOs was most
   pronounced in 2015, but seems vanishing in consecutive years. This loss
   of of seasonal pattern occurs only in the last year of survey in the
   case of slow worm and monthly use of ACOs seem not to vary between
   years. Considerably low detectability of the studied species by the ACO
   method in some years may not necessarily indicate their low population
   density, but rather results from shifts in their diurnal activity and/or
   microhabitat use dependent on ambient temperatures. Increasing
   between-year variation in weather conditions may reduce repeatability of
   seasonal patterns of ACO usage, making we suggest additional detection
   techniques that could bee incorporated.},

Title = {Allometry, biomass and productivity in Pinus massoniana forests of
   China: an updated review of published data},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Field measurements of forest biomass are labor-consuming and usually
   destructive, but such direct datasets are the foundation for further
   developing indirect estimation such as biomass equation and biomass
   expansion factors that were used to scale biomass estimation or carbon
   storage from site or local surveys up to regional or national level.
   Pinus massoniana is widely distributed throughout 17 provinces of China
   and has a high economic value. This study is an updated review of the
   allometric equations, biomass allocation data and productivity
   estimations in Pinus massoniana forests of China published in articles
   during the period from 1982 to 2019. Different allometric equations of
   Pinus massoniana showed site-specific dependences. The aboveground and
   total tree biomass were expressed as power equations of mean age for
   Pinus massoniana forests. The mean value of aboveground tree biomass,
   total tree biomass and ecosystem biomass across all ages for Masson pine
   forests was 109.81, 127.65 and 138.76 Mg/ha, respectively. The mean
   proportion of stem, branch and foliage to aboveground tree biomass for
   Pinus massoniana was 77.1\%, 15.9\% and 7\%, respectively. The tree root
   biomass continuously increased with the aboveground tree biomass and a
   power relationship was found between the tree root biomass and
   aboveground tree biomass for Pinus massoniana forests. The tree net
   primary productivity increased with aboveground tree biomass for Pinus
   massoniana forests, and the relationship was expressed as a linear
   equation. The mean tree, litter and ecosystem net primary productivity
   was 7.04, 4.88 and 8.30 Mg/ha/year, respectively. These findings provide
   key parameters for the biomass estimation and carbon accounting studies
   of widely planted Pinus massoniana forests in China.},

Abstract = {Fire-induced effects on biota activity and diversity, and soil
   attributes, could have implications for biodiversity conservation and
   recovery of semiarid grassland ecosystems. Here, we examined the
   abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, and soil
   attributes in burned and unburned grasslands in the semiarid Nanhuashan
   Natural Reserve in western Loess Plateau of China. Arthropods and soil
   were sampled in springtime one year after fire disturbance. We found no
   significant differences in total abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods
   between burned and unburned grasslands. However, the taxonomic richness
   and the Shannon index of ground-dwelling arthropods were found to be
   significantly greater in burned than unburned grasslands. Postfire
   effects also indicated significant differences in dominance hierarchy
   among taxa within functional groups as a consequence of increasing
   predatory abundance but decreasing phytophagous one from unburned to
   burned grasslands. Likewise, soil bulk density declined, whereas soil
   C/N increased significantly from unburned to burned grasslands. In
   conclusion, fire could promote the taxonomic richness and the diversity
   of ground-dwelling arthropods, thus being indicators of positive effect
   of fire disturbance on biodiversity conservation of semiarid grassland
   ecosystems of northwestern China. However, soil bulk density and soil
   C/N could be susceptible to fire-driven changes of soil attributes.},

Abstract = {We investigated the response mechanisms of plant functional traits to
   environmental factors at the community level in order to elucidate the
   adaptive and survival strategies of plants in different environmental
   gradients. 184 vegetation sampling plots were laid by stratified random
   sampling in the Saihanba region of Hebei, China. Three functional traits
   (leaf nitrogen content, LNC; specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter
   content, LDMC) were measured and the community-level weighted means of
   the trait values were calculated by the species coverage values. Climate
   and terrain data were generated from the climate model ClimateAP and
   using ArcGIS. Finally, eight environmental factors, including climate,
   topographical, and soil factor, were recorded and the association with
   functional traits was analysed using a generalized additive model. Model
   testing indicated a good predictability for the SLA and LDMC while a
   relatively poor predictability was seen with LNC. Environmental factors
   that significantly impacted SLA included elevation, degree-days above 0
   degrees C, mean annual precipitation and total soil nitrogen content. In
   contrast, LDMC was significantly influenced by elevation, total soil
   nitrogen and phosphorous content while LNC was affected by elevation and
   degree-days above 0 degrees C. High values of SLA and LNC were found in
   areas at lower elevations. The distribution of high LDMC values
   indicated that plant leaves have a relatively high tolerance and
   resistance to stress, which was better for plant to grow in the adverse
   environment. At the community level, clarifying plant functional traits
   distribution and their changes with environmental gradients is useful
   for the potential vegetation restoration.},

Title = {Potential distribution of five native grass species in northern Mexico

Abstract = {Grasslands are recognized as the most threatened communities on the
   planet due to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances. In the state
   of Chihuahua, Mexico, native grasslands have a great ecological
   importance due to their wide distribution; however, studies on the
   current and future potential distributions of grasslands, as well as
   their temporal dynamics based on climatic variability, are lacking.
   `thus, we analysed the potential distribution of five native grasses
   (Bouteloua curtipendula, Bouteloua gracilis, Leptochloa dubia, Digitaria
   californica and Setaria macrostachya) based on climatic factors. The
   present data of these species were consulted at the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility (GBIF) and recorded with location information:
   latitude and longitude. This database was complemented with presence
   data of the five species from previous studies. To characterize the
   climate niche, the values of the climatic factors at the locations of
   the species presence, were obtained from the World-Clim. Then, current
   and future potential distributions of these native species, were
   generated based on three climate change scenarios, based on
   Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0). Under
   the RCP2.6 scenario, the estimated area of S. macrostachya was 12,525.5
   ha, representing 7.4\% of the state. For B. gracilis, the potential
   areas under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios were 20,391.49 and 23,079.08
   ha, respectively. B. curtipendula represented the smallest area, with
   4.6\% under the scenario RCP2.6. The distribution of grassland species
   in northern Mexico is mainly determined by climatic factors; as it may
   apply for the rest of the grassland species within this area, so those
   results could increase our knowledge about their potential distribution.},

Abstract = {We provide the first records of possible conspecific brood parasitism in
   the lesser whitethroat Sylvia curruca and the common linnet Linaria
   cannabina, two species of small passerines. In 2018 we found two
   unusually large clutches, one for each species (8 and 9 eggs,
   respectively), both containing two distinct egg morphs differing in
   coloration. Further detailed analysis of egg morphology and brood
   phonology (in the whitethroat) suggested that the eggs in each nest had
   been laid by different females. Surprisingly, two seemingly full sized
   clutches were laid in both nests, a pattern that is unusual in
   conspecific brood parasitism in passerines, whose nests are typically
   parasitized with single eggs. Alternatives to conspecific brood
   parasitism are therefore discussed. We argue that traditional
   field-based methods, when carefully used, may be sufficient to document
   brood parasitism recorded during occasional observations. We finally
   conclude that enlarged broods, resulting from conspecific brood
   parasitism, are probably more frequent than expected, but they may be
   often overlooked.},

Abstract = {Fire has major impact on species diversity in natural ecosystems around

   indices - index of dominance, Shannon-Wiener index and Shannon- Wiener
   evenness, Simpson index, and Chao1 non-parametric estimation. We
   detected 67 species at the burned site, and 97 and 106 at the unburned
   sites. The three most frequently trapped species at all sites were
   Macaria liturata, Buphalus piniaria and Thera obeliscata, representing
   common forest geometrid moths. We observed a decline in species number
   and abundance at the burned site compared to the unburned sites,
   probably due to the direct mortality of larvae. On the contrary, the
   burned site was more diverse according to the diversity indices. The
   fire disrupted the original character of the coniferous forest, which
   was proved by a decline of species feeding on conifers and Vaccinium
   spp. The burned site attracted species associated with dry habitats such
   as Eublemma purpurina, Charissa obscurata and Scopula rubiginata. Even
   though wildfires are viewed negatively in general, they might
   temporarily enhance diversity in a homogeneous landscape.},

Abstract = {Compared to chewing lice, symbiotic and studies on their biology,
   ecology and survival strategies are still rare. To describe the ecology
   and morphology of the mite species Proctophyllodes megaphyllus, a
   symbiont of the alpine accentor Prunella collaris, 150 accentors were
   captured in the West Carpathian Mountains of Slovakia. The mites
   extracted from the birds were sexed and their specific body structures
   were measured. In total 2144 individuals of P. megaphyllus were
   collected from 100 accentors. Male mites collected in autumn, after the
   bird's postnuptial moult, reached the largest size. At the same time,
   mite prevalence reached maximum while the mean intensity of infestation
   was at its lowest. Our results suggest that mites preferred newly coated
   feathers after a moult and radiated horizontally, infesting birds at
   shared roosting sites where alpine accentors tend to reoccur. This study
   is one of the few evaluations of seasonal variation in ecology and
   morphology of feather mites in alpine conditions.},

Abstract = {Noise generated by human activities has increased over the last decades
   as a result of human population growth, global transport and
   urbanization. The understanding of the effect of noise on different
   animal populations is mandatory to help making informed decisions in the
   field of natural resource management. While managers often focus on
   rare, charismatic species, it is important to examine the effects of
   noise on species that are common because abundant species have strong
   ecological impacts. This paper describes the influence of traffic noise
   on representatives of two orders of mammals: rodents and bats. I
   reviewed field and laboratory studies that inspected the influence of
   traffic noise on the following aspects of rodent and bat ecology: (1)
   activity and behaviour, (2) abundance and habitat use, and (3) foraging.
   Bats tended to be negatively affected by traffic noise, although certain
   species demonstrated a considerable degree of tolerance to this
   disturbance. The effects of traffic noise on rodents were more varied,
   but typically consisted of detrimental changes in vigilance-foraging
   trade-off. However, research on rodents appears biased towards social
   species which rely on alarm calls for protection.},

Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to survey the species diversity and
   Leishmania infection of rodents in the Gonbad -e- Kavoos City and
   County, northeastern Iran, during 2018-2019. Totally, 20 rural and four
   urban areas endemic for leishmaniasis were selected and visited monthly.
   Rodent species diversity indices were calculated in different spatial
   and temporal scales. Species richness was also calculated using
   rarefaction curves to estimate the number of species in unequal sample
   sizes. A total of 167 rodents belonging to 7 species, 6 genera, and 2
   families were collected. Rattus rattus (34.7\%) and Rattus norvegicus
   (18.6\%) were identified as dominant species. The largest Margalef and
   Menhinick species richness (D-Mg = 1.55; D-Mn = 1.01) and the highest
   value of the Shannon index (H' = 1.71) were observed in rural areas.
   Seasonal abundance of the rodents varied among species and showed that
   the highest richness (D-Mg = 1.27; D-Mn = 0.65) occurred in spring and
   the highest value of Shannon index (H' = 1.72) was noted in summer.
   Rarefaction curves confirmed that the highest species richness occurred
   in summer and spring in the rural area. Seasonal fluctuations of R.
   rattus and R. norvegicus have a significant impact on the changes in
   rodent species diversity. Investigations of Leishmania infection showed
   that amastigote forms of Leishmania were observed in 15.4\% of smears
   taken from Rhombomys opimus and Meriones libycus and examined under the
   light microscope. The highest rate of Leishmania infection was observed
   during the summer.},

Title = {Influence of branch death on leaf nutrient status and stoichiometry of

Abstract = {The wild apple tree Malus sieversii is a tertiary relict species and a
   key ancestor of the commonly cultivated apple trees today. In recent
   years, many M. sieversii individuals have died or have severe dead
   branches. Whether branch death would lead to the change in nutrient
   stoichiometry of M. sieversii remains unclear. In this study, the
   nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) stoichiometric traits
   of M. sieversii individual trees with different proportion of dead
   branches divided into three classes (Class I {[}< 20\%], Class II
   {[}40-60\%], and Class III {[}> 80\%]) during annual growth period,
   elemental scaling relations, and the possible influencing factors were
   systematically analysed. Leaf N, P, and K decreased during growing
   season, and N and P did not show significant differences among the three
   classes; however, the Class III wild apple trees had the lowest K
   contents in both photosynthetic and reproductive organs. Flowers had
   higher P and K contents than leaves, whereas fruits had low N content.
   The growth of M. sieversii was always limited by N due to low N:P ratio
   and N resorption efficiency. The scaling exponents of leaf N-P, N-K, or
   P-K among the three classes did not show any significant differences,
   revealing an inherent property of M. sieversii. Most soil variables
   showed weak correlations with leaf nutrient parameters (except for K).
   Precipitation and relative humidity, rather than temperature, showed
   significantly positive effects on leaf nutrients. These findings suggest
   that increasing water input and plant K content may be conducive to
   enhance the resistance and recovery ability of diseased wild apple
   trees.},

Abstract = {Rhizosphere fungal communities are of critical importance for forest
   health. Microbial diversity varies with forest types due to tree
   species. In order to examine the influence of forest types and species
   composition on fungal community diversity in rhizosphere soil, the field
   sampling was conducted in the pure and mixed forest stands of
   Castanopsis hystrix in a subtropical region of China. Soil samples were
   taken from four forest types: Castanopsis hystrix pure forests (CH),
   Castanopsis hystrix x Pinus elliottii mixed forests (CHPE), Castanopsis
   hystrix x Michelia macclurei mixed forests (CHMM), and Castanopsis
   hystrix x Mytilaria laosensis mixed forests (CHML), and the species
   composition and structure of rhizosphere fungal community were examined
   by using high-throughput sequencing approach for 18S rRNA genes. The
   results showed that the amount of OTUs (operational taxonomic units)
   were 288, 331, 334 and 293 in CHML, CHMM, CHPE and CH stands,
   respectively, and these fungal communities were affiliated with 13
   phyla, 28 classes, 85 orders, 87 families, and 131 genera. The fungal
   diversity was greater in CHMM and CHPE stands than in CH stands. The
   compositions were similar in CHMM and CHPE stands while those were
   significantly different in CHML and CH stands. The cladograms and
   co-expression network analysis showed that Ascomycota, Basidiomycota,
   Mortierellomycota and Rozellomycota were the dominant phyla. The study
   results implied that mixed forests might have a high potential for
   improving the microbial community diversity with formation of key
   species of microbial taxa due to the favorable microclimate and quality
   of litter composition occuring in mixed forests.},

Abstract = {We investigated morphological variation and sexual dimorphism in two
   species of syntopic cave crickets (Troglophilus neglectus and T.
   cavicola) from Northern Balkans. T. cavicola is able to penetrate deeper
   in caves and stays there for longer periods than T. neglectus. Yet, it
   has not exhibited clearly stronger constructive (body size, elongation
   of appendages, increased spinulation) or reductive (eye reduction)
   traits than T. neglectus. Moreover, contrary to expectation, there is no
   clear association between more prolonged staying in a stable cave
   environment and overall lower morphological variability in T. cavicola.
   Only some of its morphological traits actually showed less while other
   showed more variation than in T. neglectus. While T. cavicola males are
   larger than females, there is no such difference in T. neglectus. This
   may help males of T. cavicola being more competitive towards overall
   larger T. neglectus. With the exception of the body size, overall sexual
   dimorphism was better expressed in larger T. neglectus. The morphospaces
   occupied by males and females overlap more strongly in T. cavicola than
   in T. neglectus, indicating that ecological niches of both sexes are
   better separated in the latter species.},

Title = {Seasonal changes of soil nitrogen mineralization along restoration

Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Soil nitrogen mineralization strongly affects N availability, thus
   impacting the primary productivity in ecosystems. The seasonal
   environmental changes affect soil mineralization in restored sandy
   grasslands such as a studied mobile dune (MD), a semi-fixed dune (SFD),
   a fixed dune (FD) and a grassland (G). During the growing season, we
   examined the association of soil N mineralization rate with vegetation
   characteristics, soil properties and climatic factors through the
   multivariate stepwise regression model. The vegetation cover, species
   diversity, above- and belowground biomass, soil carbon, nitrogen, soil
   water content (SWC), pH, electrical conductivity, very fine sand, clay
   and silt fractions increased during sandy grassland restoration. The
   NH4+-N concentration in MD and SFD was higher than that in FD and G,
   while NO3--N and inorganic N concentration showed a reverse trend. The
   NH4+-N, NO3--N and inorganic N concentrations in MD, SFD and FD reached
   to the highest values in June, while in G they were highest in May. The
   net mineralization and nitrification rates increased with sandy
   grassland restoration; both of these rates were much greater in June
   than in other months at all sites. Regression analysis showed that the
   NO3--N concentration, SWC, pH of the soil and precipitation could
   explain 75\% of the total variation in net nitrification rate, and the
   NO3--N concentration and precipitation could explain 59\% of the total
   variation in the net mineralization rate. These results illustrate that
   the sandy grassland restoration can enhance the soil N availability,
   with soil N mineralization mainly determined by the changes of the
   NO3--N concentration and precipitation.},

Abstract = {Forest roads are the most important infrastructural facilities to
   exploit forests that are renewable natural resources. They are of great
   importance for all kinds of scientific and technical interventions to be
   made to the forest. Despite the benefits of forest roads, they have
   great potential to cause degradation and fragmentation of natural
   habitats. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of forest
   road technical features and intensity of use (traffic volume) on
   movements of mammals. From August 2017 to September 2017, a total of six
   forest roads and their surroundings were observed from fixed plots with
   wildlife camera traps. The study identified a total of twelve species of
   mammals. All together 589 individuals were counted from 461 wild animal
   images. Golden jackal, wild boar, and red fox are dominant species in
   the study area. The species composition of wild mammals was not strongly
   related to road characteristics. Drivers and wild animals use the same
   area but differ in time of use. It was also determined that wild animals
   adopted the road as a part of natural surroundings.},

Title = {Mutualism between Lasius ant species and Stomaphis aphids in relation to
   social parasitism among the ants},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ant species Lasius (Lasius) brunneus (Latr.) and L. (Dendrolasius)
   fuliginosus (Latr.) are known mutualists of the myrmecophilous giant
   tree aphids of the genus Stomaphis Walk. Species of the Lasius subgenus
   Chthonolasius Ruzs., which live cryptically underground, have not been
   considered regular mutualists of those aphids. They often nest close to
   the known mutualists with which they are through their mutual colony
   developments intimately interrelated - as temporary social parasites of
   L. brunneus or temporary hosts of L. fuliginosus. Such a constellation
   raises the question about contacts of L. (Chthonolasius) species with
   Stomaphis aphids. Here, we describe modes of interaction between L.
   (Chthonolasius) umbratus (Nyl.) and S. graffii Cholod. which is usually
   hosted by L. (L.) brunneus. Our field data from Poland and elsewhere in
   Europe, together with published information, support our view that also
   L. (Ch.) umbratus and other underground-living species of the subgenus
   Chthonolasius are true mutualists of Stomaphis which take care of the
   aphids. Such ants differ by their protective behaviour from ants which
   prey on or only exploit aphids. The co-occurrence of L. (Chthonolasius)
   species with Stomaphis aphids has hitherto been relatively rarely
   reported, which probably is due to the cryptic lifestyle of these ants.
   We discuss the complex interrelations among the above Lasius F. species
   which belong to separate levels of social parasitism, and their
   relations with Stomaphis aphids. We also suggest that L. (Chthonolasius)
   species, which in the socially-parasitic hierarchy are located between
   Lasius s. str. and L. (Dendrolasius), may serve as transmitters of
   Stomaphis aphids from the former to the latter species.},

Abstract = {Till now, the breeding biology of several North African bird populations
   has been little studied, particularly that of the southern populations
   of Iberian chiffchaff Phylloscopus ibericus. In the present study, total
   of 31 nests of Iberian chiffchaff were monitored in the northeastern
   Algeria during 2013-2017. The nesting period, clutch and brood sizes,
   and reproductive success of the species were determined. The first
   egg-laying dates of the first broods were spread over the first twenty
   days of April. There were significant among-year variations in nesting
   seasons. The Iberian chiffchaff clutch sizes averaged 4.51 eggs. The
   number of hatchlings and fledglings averaged 4.09 and 3.54 nestlings,
   respectively. There is no correlation between the nest height above the
   ground and the hatching and the breeding success of the species.
   Predation and nest abandonment were the main causes of the breeding
   failure of the Iberian chiffchaff in studied population, however, in
   general the breeding success was high - 80.7\%. Breeding data for the
   Iberian chiffchaff at the southern edge of its breeding range in North
   Africa show smaller clutches and production of fewer young compared to
   the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita in Europe.},

Title = {The effects of feral dogs on wildlife in a nature reserve in southern
   Turkey},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Feral dogs can negatively impact wildlife through predation, fear
   interceded behavioural changes, harassment, hybridisation, and disease
   transmission. Thus, the presence of feral dogs in nature reserves poses
   a major problem for wildlife conservation. In this study, we recorded
   the effects of free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) on wildlife species
   in a protected Mediterranean forest reserve in southern Turkey. By using
   camera traps and line transects we sought to understand how the presence
   of feral dogs impacted the main wildlife species in the study area.
   Applying presence-absence transect surveys and camera trapping
   techniques to estimate animal occurrence we covered approximately 97,00
   ha and recorded 4209 images over a 154-week period. We found that the
   presence of feral dogs was significantly correlated with the movement of
   frequently observed wildlife species. Based on transect surveys, the
   species significantly affected by dog presence were fallow deer (Dama
   dama), wild boar (Sus scrofa), beech marten (Martes foina), badger
   (Meles meles), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Based on the camera trap
   data, fallow deer were negatively affected and wild boar not affected by
   dog occurrence while wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and caracal (Caracal
   caracal) were positively affected. The occurrence of wild boars, wild
   goats, hares, beech martens, red foxes and caracals across our study
   area increased with distance from agricultural land, while the
   occurrence of deer decreased. Overall, our findings suggest that the
   presence of dogs has a strong influence on wildlife in our study
   reserve. Since protected areas often are a final refuge for many of the
   species observed in this study, there is a need to take urgent measures
   to prevent feral dog impacts on wildlife and to reduce feral dog
   populations in wildlife reserves.},

Abstract = {In Central Europe Goodyera repens (L.) R. Br. is considered as species
   vulnerable to extinction, critically threatened, or even extinct,
   depending on the region. In recent years, this rare orchid clearly
   increases the number of sites within its natural range. The aim of the
   study is to present new data on the abundant occurrence of circum-boreal
   species in southern Poland (position of localities, the estimated number
   of specimens, habitat data) that indicate its ecological expansion. The
   localities of G. repens were described using the topogram method and
   then its distribution was shown using cartogram method. The study was
   conducted in the years 2010-2018 in the south-western part of the
   Swietokrzyskie Mountains (S Poland) on the area of 337,5 km(2). During
   the study the species was found for the first time on eleven localities.
   The largest populations were observed in secondary pine forests. The
   results of this study against the background of published data suggest
   the ecological expansion of the species in Poland, which is facilitated
   by the availability of suitable habitats. The expansion of this
   cold-adapted species is interesting in the context of the global
   warming.},

Title = {Effects of altitude and leaf age on leaf shape in an alpine shrub: the
   relevance for the leaf area estimation model},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nondestructive methods to estimate leaf area (LA) by leaf length (L)
   and/or width (W) are useful in plant physiology and ecology studies.
   However, both environmental and ontogenic factors may influence leaf
   size and/or shape, which may alter the coefficient of LA models. We
   carried an investigation along an altitudinal gradient in the Sergyemla
   Mountains, southeast Tibet. In August 2009, we selected nine sites at
   about every 50 m in altitude from 4,250 m to 4,640 m a.s.l. A total of
   4,245 different leaf-aged Rhododendron aganniphum var. schizopeplum (a
   dominant overstory species) leaves were measured. Compared with the
   single dimensional models, the two-dimensional model encompassing both L
   and W (model 5) reflected higher R-2 (0.98-0.99) and lower MSE
   (1.19-3.21) across different leaf age groups for each site, implying
   that such model could provide the best fit for LA estimation. Analysis
   of covariance further illustrated that two leaf dimensions model was
   irrespective of leaf age effects in eight out of the nine sites. Leaf
   shape (L:W ratio) varied between sites and tended to decrease at higher
   altitudes (4500-4640 m a.s.l.), leading to significant differences in
   coefficients of the two-dimension model between every two adjacent
   sites. For overstory species in alpine habitats, altitude rather than
   leaf age may affect leaf shape which alters the coefficients of LA
   estimation models. Since leaf shape of different species (overstory
   species versus understory ones) may show different responses to a
   certain environmental gradient, researchers must pay attention to the
   variation of leaf shape when estimating species-specific LA by measuring
   L and W, especially when leaves of the top overstory species were
   collected at different sites.},

Abstract = {Silver fir Abies alba was once an abundant tree species in the
   Karkonosze Mts. in Poland but its population has decreased. The aim of
   our study was to assess 1) the impact of canopy trees on the growth
   dynamics of silver fir saplings and 2) the relationship between the
   growth rate of silver fir saplings and the soil properties, with special
   regard to the soil enzyme activity. The study was conducted in the
   Karkonoski National Park on five experimental plots. Silver fir
   seedlings were planted in Scots pine, European larch, Norway spruce,
   silver birch and European beech stands in 1999. In 2016, we measured the
   diameter at breast height (DBH) and height of the canopy trees and the
   height, DBH, height increments, needle width and length of 100 silver
   fir saplings. The dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and asparaginase
   activity was analysed in organic and humus soil horizons. The height,
   diameter and needle dimensions of young silver fir trees were
   significantly different under different canopies. The urease and
   asparaginase activity was the highest under the larch and spruce canopy
   in both soil horizons. Phosphatase activity was also the highest under
   larch canopy but only in organic soil horizon. Young silver fir
   (thicket) has grown under the canopy of all tested tree species but
   found best growth conditions under larch and pine canopies. The relative
   growth of silver fir is therefore a function of both stand canopy and
   soil properties.},

Title = {Screening of Important Factors in the Early Sepsis Stage Based on the
   Evaluation of ssGSEA Algorithm and ceRNA Regulatory Network},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to pathogens. Delay
   in sepsis diagnosis has become a primary cause of patient death. This
   study determines some factors to prevent septic shock in its early
   stage, contributing to the early treatment of sepsis. Methods: The
   sequencing data (RNA- and miRNA-sequencing) of patients with septic
   shock were obtained from the NCBI GEO database. After re-annotation, we
   obtained lncRNAs, miRNA, and mRNA information. Then, we evaluated the
   immune characteristics of the sample based on the ssGSEA algorithm. We
   used the WGCNA algorithm to obtain genes significantly related to
   immunity and screen for important related factors by constructing a
   ceRNA regulatory network. Result: After re-annotation, we obtained 1708
   lncRNAs, 129 miRNAs, and 17 326 mRNAs. Also, through the ssGSEA
   algorithm, we obtained 5 important immune cells. Finally, we constructed
   a ceRNA regulation network associated with SS pathways. Conclusion: We
   identified 5 immune cells with significant changes in the early stage of
   septic shock. We also constructed a ceRNA network, which will help us
   explore the pathogenesis of septic shock.},

Title = {Evolutionary Dynamics of Indels in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic that claimed
   over 5.0 million lives, belongs to a class of enveloped viruses that
   undergo quick evolutionary adjustments under selection pressure.
   Numerous variants have emerged in SARS-CoV-2, posing a serious challenge
   to the global vaccination effort and COVID-19 management. The
   evolutionary dynamics of this virus are only beginning to be explored.
   In this work, we have analysed 1.79 million spike glycoprotein sequences
   of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus is fine-tuning the spike with
   numerous amino acid insertions and deletions (indels). Indels seem to
   have a selective advantage as the proportions of sequences with indels
   steadily increased over time, currently at over 89\%, with similar
   trends across countries/variants. There were as many as 420 unique indel
   positions and 447 unique combinations of indels. Despite their high
   frequency, indels resulted in only minimal alteration of N-glycosylation
   sites, including both gain and loss. As indels and point mutations are
   positively correlated and sequences with indels have significantly more
   point mutations, they have implications in the evolutionary dynamics of
   the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.},

Abstract = {The adaptive evolution and coevolution of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) gene in the genus
   Hildenbrandia were studied based on phylogenetic tree construction and
   the physicochemical properties and the secondary structures of protein
   encoded by rbcL (Rubisco large subunit) were analyzed. The amino acids
   compositions and grand average of hydropathicity of freshwater H.
   rivularis and marine H. rubra were similar. Rubisco large subunit of
   Hildenbrandia was hydrophilic and the secondary structure was primarily
   composed of alpha-helixes and beta-sheets, revealing the relatively
   stable structure of this protein. The predicted phosphorylation sites in
   H. rivularis and H. rubra were 33 and 36, respectively. No positive
   selection sites were detected in the genus Hildenbrandia, implying that
   rbcL gene evolved either neutrally or under purifying selection. A total
   of 41 coevolutionary groups were detected in the Rubisco large subunit
   of Hildenbrandia and the coevolving sites are in closer proximity in
   3-dimensional structure of the protein. Despite the long evolutionary
   history, rbcL gene in genus Hildenbrandia under different environments
   is rather conservative.},

Title = {Host-Population Microbial Diversity Scaling of Chinese Gut Microbiomes
   in Gout Patients},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gout is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that affects the life
   of tens of millions of people worldwide, and it typically presents as
   gout arthritis, gout stone, or even kidney damage. Research has revealed
   its connection with the gut microbiome, although exact mechanism is
   still unclear. Studies have shown the decline of microbiome diversity in
   gout patients and change of microbiome compositions between the gout
   patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, how diversity changes
   across host individuals at a cohort (population) level has not been
   investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here we apply the
   diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to the classic
   SAR (species-area relationship) and establishes the power-function model
   between microbiome diversity and the number of individuals within
   cohort, to comparatively investigate diversity scaling (changes) of gut
   microbiome in gout patients and healthy controls. The DAR modeling with
   a study involving 83 subjects (41 gout patients) revealed that the
   potential number of microbial species in gout patients is only 70\% of
   that in the healthy control (2790 vs 3900) although the difference may
   not be statistically significant. The other DAR parameters including
   diversity scaling and similarity parameters did not show statistically
   significant differences. We postulate that the high resilience of gut
   microbiome may explain the lack of significant gout-disease effects on
   gut microbial diversity at the population level. The lack of
   statistically significant difference between the gout patients and
   healthy controls at host population (cohort) level is different from the

Title = {Transcriptome Analysis of MYB Genes and Patterns of Anthocyanin
   Accumulation During Seed Development in Wheat},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Plants accumulate key metabolites as a response of biotic/abiotic stress
   conditions. In seed coats, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophylls
   can be found. They have been associated as important antioxidants that
   affect germination. In wheat, anthocyanins can impart the seed coat
   color which have been recognized as health-promoting nutrients.
   Transcription factors act as master regulators of cellular processes.
   Transcription complexes such as MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) regulate the
   expression of multiple target genes in various plant species. In this
   study, the spatiotemporal accumulation of seed coat pigments in
   different developmental stages (10, 20, 30, and 40 days after
   pollination) was analyzed using cryo-cuts. Moreover, the accumulation of
   phenolic, anthocyanin, and chlorophyll contents was quantified, and the
   expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes was evaluated. Finally,
   transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze putative MYB genes
   related to seed coat color, followed by further characterization of
   putative genes. TaTCL2, an MYB gene, was cloned and sequenced. It was
   determined that TaTCL2 contains a SANT domain, which is often present in
   proteins participating in the response to anthocyanin accumulation.
   Moreover, TaTCL2 transcript levels were shown to be influenced by
   anthocyanin accumulation during grain development. Interaction network
   analysis showed interactions with GL2 (HD-ZIP IV), EGL3 (bHLH), and TTG1
   (WD40). The findings of this study elucidate the mechanisms underlying
   color formation in Triticum aestivum L. seed coats.},

Title = {NLPEI: A Novel Self-Interacting Protein Prediction Model Based on
   Natural Language Processing and Evolutionary Information},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The study of protein self-interactions (SIPs) can not only reveal the
   function of proteins at the molecular level, but is also crucial to
   understand activities such as growth, development, differentiation, and
   apoptosis, providing an important theoretical basis for exploring the
   mechanism of major diseases. With the rapid advances in biotechnology, a
   large number of SIPs have been discovered. However, due to the long
   period and high cost inherent to biological experiments, the gap between
   the identification of SIPs and the accumulation of data is growing.
   Therefore, fast and accurate computational methods are needed to
   effectively predict SIPs. In this study, we designed a new method,
   NLPEI, for predicting SIPs based on natural language understanding
   theory and evolutionary information. Specifically, we first understand
   the protein sequence as natural language and use natural language
   processing algorithms to extract its features. Then, we use the
   Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) to represent the evolutionary
   information of the protein and extract its features through the Stacked
   Auto-Encoder (SAE) algorithm of deep learning. Finally, we fuse the
   natural language features of proteins with evolutionary features and
   make accurate predictions by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier.
   In the SIPs gold standard data sets of human and yeast, NLPEI achieved
   94.19\% and 91.29\% prediction accuracy. Compared with different
   classifier models, different feature models, and other existing methods,
   NLPEI obtained the best results. These experimental results indicated
   that NLPEI is an effective tool for predicting SIPs and can provide
   reliable candidates for biological experiments.},

Title = {The Evolution of G-quadruplex Structure in mRNA Untranslated Region},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) is a kind of non-canonical high-order
   secondary structure with important biological functions and is enriched
   in untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes. However, how rG4
   structures evolve is largely unknown. Here, we systematically
   investigated the evolution of RNA sequences around UTR rG4 structures in
   5 eukaryotic organisms. We found universal selection on UTR sequences,
   which facilitated rG4 formation in all the organisms that we analyzed.
   While G-rich sequences were preferred in the rG4 structural region,
   C-rich sequences were selectively not preferred. The selective pressure
   acting on rG4 structures in the UTRs of genes with higher G content was
   significantly smaller. Furthermore, we found that rG4 structures
   experienced smaller evolutionary selection near the translation
   initiation region in the 5 ` UTR, near the polyadenylation signals in
   the 3 ` UTR, and in regions flanking the miRNA targets in the 3 ` UTR.
   These results suggest universal selection for rG4 formation in the UTRs
   of eukaryotic genomes and the selection may be related to the biological
   functions of rG4s.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is associated with bovine papillomatosis, a
   disease that forms benign warts in epithelial tissues, as well as
   malignant lesions. Previous studies have detected a co-infection between
   BPV and other viruses, making it likely that these co-infections could
   influence disease progression. Therefore, this study aimed to identify
   and annotate viral genes in cutaneous papillomatous lesions of cattle.
   Sequences were obtained from the GEO database, and an RNA-seq
   computational pipeline was used to analyze 3 libraries from bovine
   papillomatous lesions. In total, 25 viral families were identified,
   including Poxviridae, Retroviridae, and Herpesviridae. All libraries
   shared similarities in the viruses and genes found. The viral genes
   shared similarities with BPV genes, especially for functions as virion
   entry pathway, malignant progression by apoptosis suppression and immune
   system control. Therefore, this study presents relevant data extending
   the current knowledge regarding the viral microbiome in BPV lesions and
   how other viruses could affect this disease.},

Title = {Biomarkers of Blood from Patients with Atherosclerosis Based on
   Bioinformatics Analysis},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a multifaceted disease characterized by the formation
   and accumulation of plaques that attach to arteries and cause
   cardiovascular disease and vascular embolism. A range of diagnostic
   techniques, including selective coronary angiography, stress tests,
   computerized tomography, and nuclear scans, assess cardiovascular
   disease risk and treatment targets. However, there is currently no
   simple blood biochemical index or biological target for the diagnosis of
   atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is of interest to find a biochemical
   blood marker for atherosclerosis. Three datasets from the Gene
   Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed to obtain differentially
   expressed genes (DEG) and the results were integrated using the
   Robustrankaggreg algorithm. The genes considered more critical by the
   Robustrankaggreg algorithm were put into their own data set and the data
   set system with cell classification information for verification.
   Twenty-one possible genes were screened out. Interestingly, we found a
   good correlation between RPS4Y1, EIF1AY, and XIST. In addition, we know
   the general expression of these genes in different cell types and whole
   blood cells. In this study, we identified BTNL8 and BLNK as having good
   clinical significance. These results will contribute to the analysis of
   the underlying genes involved in the progression of atherosclerosis and
   provide insights for the discovery of new diagnostic and evaluation
   methods.},

Title = {Genome-Wide Phylogenetic Analysis, Expression Pattern, and
   Transcriptional Regulatory Network of the Pig C/EBP Gene Family},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors (TFs)
   regulate many important biological processes, such as energy metabolism,
   inflammation, cell proliferation etc. A genome-wide gene identification
   revealed the presence of a total of 99 C/EBP genes in pig and 19
   eukaryote genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all C/EBP TFs were
   classified into 6 subgroups named C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, C/EBP delta,
   C/EBP epsilon, C/EBP gamma, and C/EBP zeta. Gene expression analysis
   showed that the C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, C/EBP delta, C/EBP gamma, and
   C/EBP zeta genes were expressed ubiquitously with inconsistent
   expression patterns in various pig tissues. Moreover, a pig C/EBP
   regulatory network was constructed, including C/EBP genes, TFs and
   miRNAs. A total of 27 feed-forward loop (FFL) motifs were detected in
   the pig C/EBP regulatory network. Based on the RNA-seq data, gene
   expression patterns related to FFL sub-network were analyzed in 27 adult
   pig tissues. Certain FFL motifs may be tissue specific. Functional
   enrichment analysis indicated that C/EBP and its target genes are
   involved in many important biological pathways. These results provide
   valuable information that clarifies the evolutionary relationships of
   the C/EBP family and contributes to the understanding of the biological
   function of C/EBP genes.},

Title = {Contrasting Patterns of Gene Duplication, Relocation, and Selection
   Among Human Taste Genes},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In humans, taste genes are responsible for perceiving at least 5
   different taste qualities. Human taste genes' evolutionary mechanisms
   need to be explored. We compiled a list of 69 human taste-related genes
   and divided them into 7 functional groups. We carried out comparative
   genomic and evolutionary analyses for these taste genes based on 8
   vertebrate species. We found that relative to other groups of human
   taste genes, human TAS2R genes have a higher proportion of tandem
   duplicates, suggesting that tandem duplications have contributed
   significantly to the expansion of the human TAS2R gene family. Human
   TAS2R genes tend to have fewer collinear genes in outgroup species and
   evolve faster, suggesting that human TAS2R genes have experienced more
   gene relocations. Moreover, human TAS2R genes tend to be under more
   relaxed purifying selection than other genes. Our study sheds new
   insights into diverse and contrasting evolutionary patterns among human
   taste genes.},

Title = {An Intron of Invertebrate Microphthalmia Transcription Factor Gene Is
   Evolved from a Longer Ancestral Sequence},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introns are highly variable in number and size. Sequence simulation is
   an effective method to elucidate intron evolution patterns. Previously,
   we have reported that introns are more likely to evolve through
   mutation-and-deletion (MD) rather than through mutation-and-insertion
   (MI). In the present study, we further studied evolution models by
   allowing insertion in the MD model and by allowing deletion in the MI
   model at various frequencies. It was found that all deletion-biased
   models with proper parameter settings could generate sequences with
   attributes matchable to 16 invertebrate introns from the microphthalmia
   transcription factor gene, whereas all insertion-biased models with any
   parameter settings failed to generate such sequences. We conclude that
   the examined invertebrate introns may have evolved from a longer
   ancestral sequence in a deletion-biased pattern. The constructed models
   are useful for studying the evolution of introns from other genes and/or
   from other taxonomic groups. (C++ scripts of all deletion- and
   insertion-biased models are available upon request.)},

   Housekeeping Genes},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Coding and non-coding short tandem repeats (STRs) facilitate
   a great diversity of phenotypic traits. The imbalance of mononucleotide
   A-repeats around transcription start sites (TSSs) was found in 3
   mammals: H. sapiens, M. musculus, and R. norvegicus. Principal Findings:
   We found that the imbalance pattern originated in some vertebrates. A
   similar pattern was observed in mammals and birds, but not in amphibians
   and reptiles. We proposed that the enriched A-repeats upstream of TSSs
   is a novel hallmark of endotherms or warm-blooded animals. Gene ontology
   analysis indicates that the primary function of upstream A-repeats
   involves metabolism, cellular transportation, and sensory perception
   (smell and chemical stimulus) through housekeeping genes. Conclusions:
   Upstream A-repeats may play a regulatory role in the metabolic process
   of endothermic animals.},

Title = {A Global Approach to Estimating the Abundance and Duplication of
   Polyketide Synthase Domains in Dinoflagellates},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many dinoflagellate species make toxins in a myriad of different
   molecular configurations but the underlying chemistry in all cases is
   presumably via modular synthases, primarily polyketide synthases. In
   many organisms modular synthases occur as discrete synthetic genes or
   domains within a gene that act in coordination thus forming a module
   that produces a particular fragment of a natural product. The modules
   usually occur in tandem as gene clusters with a syntenic arrangement
   that is often predictive of the resultant structure. Dinoflagellate
   genomes however are notoriously complex with individual genes present in
   many tandem repeats and very few synthetic modules occurring as gene
   clusters, unlike what has been seen in bacteria and fungi. However,
   modular synthesis in all organisms requires a free thiol group that acts
   as a carrier for sequential synthesis called a thiolation domain. We
   scanned 47 dinoflagellate transcriptomes for 23 modular synthase domain
   models and compared their abundance among 10 orders of dinoflagellates
   as well as their co-occurrence with thiolation domains. The total count
   of domain types was quite large with over thirty-thousand identified, 29
   000 of which were in the core dinoflagellates. Although there were no
   specific trends in domain abundance associated with types of toxins,
   there were readily observable lineage specific differences. The
   Gymnodiniales, makers of long polyketide toxins such as brevetoxin and
   karlotoxin had a high relative abundance of thiolation domains as well
   as multiple thiolation domains within a single transcript. Orders such
   as the Gonyaulacales, makers of small polyketides such as spirolides,
   had fewer thiolation domains but a relative increase in the number of
   acyl transferases. Unique to the core dinoflagellates, however, were
   thiolation domains occurring alongside tetratricopeptide repeats that
   facilitate protein-protein interactions, especially hexa and
   hepta-repeats, that may explain the scaffolding required for synthetic
   complexes capable of making large toxins. Clustering analysis for each
   type of domain was also used to discern possible origins of duplication
   for the multitude of single domain transcripts. Single domain
   transcripts frequently clustered with synonymous domains from
   multi-domain transcripts such as the BurA and ZmaK like genes as well as
   the multi-ketosynthase genes, sometimes with a large degree of apparent
   gene duplication, while fatty acid synthesis genes formed distinct
   clusters. Surprisingly the acyl-transferases and ketoreductases involved
   in fatty acid synthesis (FabD and FabG, respectively) were found in very
   large clusters indicating an unprecedented degree of gene duplication
   for these genes. These results demonstrate a complex evolutionary
   history of core dinoflagellate modular synthases with domain specific
   duplications throughout the lineage as well as clues to how large
   protein complexes can be assembled to synthesize the largest natural
   products known.},

   patients with LSCC. To identify more biomarkers associated with the
   prognosis of patients with LSCC, using bioinformatics analysis, this
   study used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LSCC dataset and gene
   expression profiles of GSE59102 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
   Eighty-one differentially co-expressed genes were identified by weighted
   gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Next, 10 hub genes (PPL,
   KRT78, CRNN, PTK7, SCEL, AGRN, SPINK5, AIF1L, EMP1, and PPP1R3C) were
   screened from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Based on
   survival analysis, SPINK5 was significantly correlated with survival
   time in LSCC patients. After verification in the TCGA and HPA databases,
   SPINK5 was selected as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, the GSEA results
   showed that downregulation of SPINK5 gene expression may promote
   tumorigenesis and the development of cancers by the ``BASAL CELL
   CARCINOMA{''} pathway, and it has been implicated in disrupting DNA
   damage and repair pathways. Collectively, SPINK5 may serve as a
   potential prognostic biomarker in LSCC.},

Title = {Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Parasites in Ghana Show Signatures of
   Balancing Selection at Artemisinin Resistance Predisposing Background
   Genes},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa is courting the risk of artemisinin resistance (ARTr)
   emerging in Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. Current molecular
   surveillance efforts for ARTr have been built on the utility of P.
   falciparum kelch13 (pfk13) validated molecular markers. However, whether
   these molecular markers will serve the purpose of early detection of
   artemisinin-resistant parasites in Ghana is hinged on a pfk13 dependent
   evolution. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the background pfk13
   genome may be present before the pfk13 ARTr-conferring variant(s) is
   selected and that signatures of balancing selection on these genomic
   loci may serve as an early warning signal of ARTr. We analyzed 12 198
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ghanaian clinical isolates in
   the Pf3K MalariaGEN dataset that passed a stringent filtering regimen.
   We identified signatures of balancing selection in 2 genes
   (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and chloroquine resistance transporter)
   previously reported as background loci for ARTr. These genes showed
   statistically significant and high positive values for Tajima's D, Fu
   and Li's F, and Fu and Li's D. This indicates that the biodiversity
   required to establish a pfk13 background genome may have been primed in
   clinical isolates of P. falciparum from Ghana as of 2010. Despite the
   absence of ARTr in Ghana to date, our finding supports the current use
   of pfk13 for molecular surveillance of ARTr in Ghana and highlights the
   potential utility of monitoring malaria parasite populations for
   balancing selection in ARTr precursor background genes as early warning
   molecular signatures for the emergence of ARTr.},

Title = {Transcriptomics of a Greenlandic Snailfish Reveals Exceptionally High
   Expression of Antifreeze Protein Transcripts},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Polar fishes have evolved antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that allow them to
   survive in subzero temperatures. We performed deep transcriptomic
   sequencing on a postlarval/juvenile variegated snailfish, Liparis gibbus
   (Actinopterygii: Scorpaeniformes: Cottoidei: Liparidae), living in an
   iceberg habitat (-2 degrees C) in Eastern Greenland and report detection
   of highly expressed transcripts that code for putative AFPs from 2 gene
   families, Type I and LS-12-like proteins (putative Type IV AFPs). The
   transcripts encoding both proteins have expression levels among the top
   <1\% of expressed genes in the fish. The Type I AFP sequence is
   different from a reported Type I AFP from the same species, possibly
   expressed from a different genetic locus. While prior findings from
   related adult sculpins suggest that LS-12-like/Type IV AFPs may not have
   a role in antifreeze protection, our finding of very high relative gene
   expression of the LS-12-like gene suggests that highly active
   transcription of the gene is important to the fish in the iceberg
   habitat and raises the possibility that weak or combinatorial antifreeze
   activity could be beneficial. These findings highlight the physiological
   importance of antifreeze proteins to the survival of fishes living in
   polar habitats.},

Title = {The Prevalence of Pharmacogenomics Variants and Their Clinical Relevance
   Among the Pakistani Population},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Pharmacogenomics (PGx), forming the basis of precision
   medicine, has revolutionized traditional medical practice. Currently,
   drug responses such as drug efficacy, drug dosage, and drug adverse
   reactions can be anticipated based on the genetic makeup of the
   patients. The pharmacogenomic data of Pakistani populations are limited.
   This study investigates the frequencies of pharmacogenetic variants and
   their clinical relevance among ethnic groups in Pakistan. Methods: The
   Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) database was used to extract
   pharmacogenetic variants that are involved in medical conditions with
   high (1A + 1B) to moderate (2A + 2B) clinical evidence. Subsequently,
   the allele frequencies of these variants were searched among multiethnic
   groups of Pakistan (Balochi, Brahui, Burusho, Hazara, Kalash, Pashtun,
   Punjabi, and Sindhi) using the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and ALlele
   FREquency Database (ALFRED). Furthermore, the published Pharmacogenomics
   literature on the Pakistani population was reviewed in PubMed and Google
   Scholar. Results: Our search retrieved (n = 29) pharmacogenetic genes
   and their (n = 44) variants with high to moderate evidence of clinical
   association. These pharmacogenetic variants correspond to
   drug-metabolizing enzymes (n = 22), drug-metabolizing transporters (n =
   8), and PGx gene regulators, etc. (n = 14). We found 5 pharmacogenetic
   variants present at >50\% among 8 ethnic groups of Pakistan. These
   pharmacogenetic variants include CYP2B6 (rs2279345, C; 70\%-86\%),
   CYP3A5 (rs776746, C; 64\%-88\%), FLT3 (rs1933437, T; 54\%-74\%), CETP
   (rs1532624, A; 50\%-70\%), and DPP6 (rs6977820, C; 61\%-86\%) genes that
   are involved in drug response for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
   transplantation, cancer, heart disease, and mental health therapy,
   respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights the frequency of
   important clinical pharmacogenetic variants (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) among
   multi-ethnic Pakistani populations. The high prevalence (>50\%) of
   single nucleotide pharmacogenetic variants may contribute to the drug
   response/diseases outcome. These PGx data could be used as
   pharmacogenetic markers in the selection of appropriate therapeutic
   regimens for specific ethnic groups of Pakistan.},

   Breast Tumors: A Pilot Study},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The microbiome plays diverse roles in many diseases and can potentially
   contribute to cancer development. Breast cancer is the most commonly
   diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Thus, we investigated whether the
   gut microbiota differs between patients with breast carcinoma and those
   with benign tumors. The DNA of the fecal microbiota community was
   detected by Illumina sequencing and the taxonomy of 16S rRNA genes. The
   alpha-diversity and beta-diversity analyses were used to determine
   richness and evenness of the gut microbiota. Gene function prediction of
   the microbiota in patients with benign and malignant carcinoma was
   performed using PICRUSt. There was no significant difference in the
   alpha-diversity between patients with benign and malignant tumors (P =
   3.15e(-1) for the Chao index and P = 3.1e(-1) for the ACE index). The
   microbiota composition was different between the 2 groups, although no
   statistical difference was observed in beta-diversity. Of the 31
   different genera compared between the 2 groups, level of only
   Citrobacter was significantly higher in the malignant tumor group than
   that in benign tumor group. The metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome
   in the malignant tumor group were significantly different from those in
   benign tumor group. Furthermore, the study establishes the distinct
   richness of the gut microbiome in patients with breast cancer with
   different clinicopathological factors, including ER, PR, Ki-67 level,
   Her2 status, and tumor grade. These findings suggest that the gut
   microbiome may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant
   breast carcinoma.},

Title = {Sequence-Based Prediction of Plant Protein-Protein Interactions by
   Combining Discrete Sine Transformation With Rotation Forest},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in plants are essential for
   understanding the regulation of biological processes. Although
   high-throughput technologies have been widely used to identify PPIs,
   they are usually laborious, expensive, and suffer from high
   false-positive rates. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel
   computational approaches as a supplement tool to detect PPIs in plants.
   In this work, we presented a method, namely DST-RoF, to identify PPIs in
   plants by combining an ensemble learning classifier-Rotation Forest
   (RoF) with discrete sine transformation (DST). Specifically, plant
   protein sequence is firstly converted into Position-Specific Scoring
   Matrix (PSSM). Then, the discrete sine transformation was employed to
   extract effective features for obtaining the evolutionary information of
   proteins. Finally, these optimal features were fed into the RoF
   classifier for training and prediction. When performed on the plant

Abstract = {Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a tumor with high incidence. This study
   aimed to identify the central genes of LUAD. LUAD were analyzed by
   weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA), and differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Samples were obtained from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx)
   databases and included 515 LUAD samples and 347 normal samples. The
   WGCNA algorithm generated a total of 10 modules. The top 2 modules
   (MEturquoise and MEblue) with the highest correlation to LUAD were
   selected. Ten Hub genes (IL6, CDH1, PECAM1, SPP1, THBS1, HGF, SNCA,
   CDH5, CAV1, and DLC1) were screened in the intersecting genes of DEGs
   and WGCNA (MEturquoise and MEblue). Only SPP1 was correlated with LUAD
   poor survival, indicating that SPP1 may be a key Hub gene for LUAD. The
   competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to analyze the
   regulatory relationship of Hub genes, and SPP1 may be directly regulated
   by 4 microRNAs (miRNAs) and indirectly regulated by 49 long noncoding
   RNAs (lncRNAs).},

Title = {Grafting Methionine on 1F1 Ab Increases the Broad-Activity on HA
   Structural-Conserved Residues of H1, H2, and H3 Influenza a Viruses},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A high level of mutation enables the influenza A virus to resist
   antibiotics previously effective against the influenza A virus. A
   portion of the structure of hemagglutinin HA is assumed to be
   well-conserved to maintain its role in cellular fusion, and the
   structure tends to be more conserved than sequence. We designed peptide
   inhibitors to target the conserved residues on the HA surface, which
   were identified based on structural alignment. Most of the conserved and
   strongly similar residues are located in the receptor-binding and
   esterase regions on the HA1 domain In a later step, fragments of anti-HA
   antibodies were gathered and screened for the binding ability to the
   found conserved residues. As a result, Methionine amino acid got the
   best docking score within the -2.8 angstrom radius of Van der Waals when
   it is interacting with Tyrosine, Arginine, and Glutamic acid. Then, the
   binding affinity and spectrum of the fragments were enhanced by grafting
   hotspot amino acid into the fragments to form peptide inhibitors. Our
   peptide inhibitor was able to form in silico contact with a structurally
   conserved region across H1, H2, and H3 HA, with the binding site at the
   boundary between HA1 and HA2 domains, spreading across different
   monomers, suggesting a new target for designing broad-spectrum antibody
   and vaccine. This research presents an affordable method to design
   broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors using fragments of an antibody as a
   scaffold.},

Title = {Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Gefitinib-Resistant Lung
   Adenocarcinoma using Bioinformatics Analysis},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Gefitinib resistance is a serious threat in the treatment of patients
   with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Elucidating the underlying
   mechanisms and developing effective therapies to overcome gefitinib
   resistance is urgently needed. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   were screened from the gene expression profile GSE122005 between
   gefitinib-sensitive and resistant samples. GO and KEGG analyses were
   performed with DAVID. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was
   established to visualize DEGs and screen hub genes. The functional roles
   of CCL20 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were examined using gene set
   enrichment analysis (GSEA). Functional analysis revealed that the DEGs
   were mainly concentrated in inflammatory, cell chemotaxis, and PI3K
   signal regulation. Ten hub genes were identified based on the PPI
   network. The survival analysis of the hub genes showed that CCL20 had a
   significant effect on the prognosis of LUAD patients. GSEA analysis
   showed that CCL20 high expression group was mainly enriched in
   cytokine-related signaling pathways. In conclusion, our analysis
   suggests that changes in inflammation and cytokine-related signaling
   pathways are closely related to gefitinib resistance in patients with
   lung cancer. The CCL20 gene may promote the formation of gefitinib
   resistance, which may serve as a new biomarker for predicting gefitinib
   resistance in patients with lung cancer.},

Title = {Exploration of Prognostic Biomarkers among Replication Factor C Family
   in the Hepatocellular Carcinoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common cancers with a high
   incidence and mortality. The human replication factor C (RFC) family
   contains 5 subunits that play an important role in DNA replication and
   DNA damage repair. RFCs are abnormally expressed in a variety of
   cancers; some of them are differentially expressed in HCC tissues and
   related to tumor growth. However, the expression, prognostic value, and
   effect targets of the whole RFC family in HCC are still unclear. To
   address these issues, we performed a multidimensional analysis of RFCs
   in HCC patients by Oncomine, UALCAN, GEPIA, Human protein atlas,
   Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, String, and LinkedOmics.
   mRNA expression of RFCs was significantly increased in HCC tissues.
   There was a significant correlation between the expression of RFC2/3/4/5
   and tumor stage of HCC patients. Besides, high mRNA expression of RFC2/4
   was associated with worse overall survival (OS). Moreover, genetic
   alterations of RFCs were associated with worse OS in HCC patients. We
   found that genes co-expressed with RFC2/4 were mainly involved in
   biological processes, such as chromosome segregation, mitotic cell cycle
   phase transition, and telomere organization and they activated the cell
   cycle and spliceosome pathways. The gene set is mainly enriched in
   cancer-related kinases AURKA, ATR, CDK1, PLK1, and CHEK1. E2F family
   members were the key transcription factors for RFCs. Our results suggest
   that differentially expressed RFC2 and RFC4 are potential prognostic
   biomarkers in HCC and may act on E2F transcription factors and some
   kinase targets to dysregulate the cell cycle pathway. These efforts may
   provide new research directions for prognostic biomarkers and
   therapeutic targets in HCC.},

Title = {BioAlign: An Accurate Global PPI Network Alignment Algorithm},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Motivation: The advancement of high-throughput PPI profiling techniques
   results in generating a large amount of PPI data. The alignment of the
   PPI networks uncovers the relationship between the species that can help
   understand the biological systems. The comparative study reveals the
   conserved biological interactions of the proteins across the species. It
   can also help study the biological pathways and signal networks of the
   cells. Although several network alignment algorithms are developed to
   study and compare the PPI data, the development of the aligner that
   aligns the PPI networks with high biological similarity and coverage is
   still challenging. Results: This paper presents a novel global network
   alignment algorithm, BioAlign, that incorporates a significant amount of
   biological information. Existing studies use global sequence and/or
   3D-structure similarity to align the PPI networks. In contrast, BioAlign
   uses the local sequence similarity, predicted secondary structure
   motifs, and remote homology in addition to global sequence and
   3D-structure similarity. The extra sources of biological information
   help BioAlign to align the proteins with high biological similarity.
   BioAlign produces significantly better results in terms of AFS and
   Coverage (6-32 and 7-34 with respect to MF and BP, respectively) than
   the existing algorithms. BioAlign aligns a much larger number of
   proteins that have high biological similarities as compared to the
   existing aligners. BioAlign helps in studying the functionally similar
   protein pairs across the species.},

Title = {In Silico Identification and Characterization of B12D Family Proteins in
   Viridiplantae},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {B12D family proteins are transmembrane proteins that contain the B12D
   domain involved in membrane trafficking. Plants comprise several members
   of the B12D family, but these members' numbers and specific functions
   are not determined. This study aims to identify and characterize the
   members of B12D protein family in plants. Phytozome database was
   retrieved for B12D proteins from 14 species. The total 66 B12D proteins
   were analyzed in silico for gene structure, motifs, gene expression,
   duplication events, and phylogenetics. In general, B12D proteins are
   between 86 and 98 aa in length, have 2 or 3 exons, and comprise a single
   transmembrane helix. Motif prediction and multiple sequence alignment
   show strong conservation among B12D proteins of 11 flowering plants
   species. Despite that, the phylogenetic tree revealed a distinct cluster
   of 16 B12D proteins that have high conservation across flowering plants.
   Motif prediction revealed 41 aa motif conserved in 58 of the analyzed
   B12D proteins similar to the bZIP motif, confirming that in the
   predicted biological process and molecular function, B12D proteins are
   DNA-binding proteins. Cis-regulatory elements screening in putative B12D
   promoters found various responsive elements for light, abscisic acid,
   methyl jasmonate, cytokinin, drought, and heat. Despite that, there is
   specific elements for cold stress, cell cycle, circadian, auxin,
   salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid in the promoter of a few B12D genes
   indicating for functional diversification for B12D family members. The
   digital expression shows that B12D genes of Glycine max have similar
   expression patterns consistent with their clustering in the phylogenetic
   tree. However, the expression of B12D genes of Hordeum vulgure appears
   inconsistent with their clustering in the tree. Despite the strong
   conservation of the B12D proteins of Viridiplantae, gene association
   analysis, promoter analysis, and digital expression indicate different
   roles for the members of the B12D family during plant developmental
   stages.},

   parameter regimes. In order to delineate further the robustness of
   commonly utilized methods for single-cell RNA-Seq. we aimed to
   comprehensively review scRNA-Seq analysis workflows in the setting of
   dimension reduction. clustering, and trajectory inference.
   METHODS: We utilized datasets with temporal single-cell transcriptomics
   profiles from public repositories. Combining multiple methods at each
   level of the workflow, we have performed over 6k analysis and evaluated
   the results of clustering and pseudotime estimation using adjusted rand
   index and rank correlation metrics. We have further integrated neural
   network methods to assess whether models with increased complexity can
   show increased bias/variance trade-off.
   RESULTS: Combinatorial workflows showed that utilizing non-linear
   dimension reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are sensitive to
   initial preprocessing steps hence clustering results on dimension
   reduced space of single-cell datasets should be utilized carefully.
   Similarly. pseudotime estimation methods that depend on previous
   non-linear dimension reduction steps can result in highly variable
   trajectories. In contrast, methods that avoid non-linearity such as WOT
   can result in repeatable inferences of temporal gene expression
   dynamics. Furthermore. imputation methods do not improve clustering or
   trajectory inference results substantially in terms of repeatability. In
   contrast, the selection of the normalization method shows an increased
   effect on downstream analysis where ScTransform reduces variability
   overall.},

Title = {Construction of a Prognostic Nomogram Based on Autophagy-Related Genes
   for Children With Neuroblastoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid malignancy in children. MYCN
   gene amplification is the most relevant genetic alteration in patients
   with NB and is associated with poor prognosis. Autophagy plays specific
   roles in the occurrence, development, and progression of NB. Here, we
   aimed to identify and assess the prognostic effects of autophagy-related
   genes (ARGs) in patients with NB and MYCN gene amplification.
   Differentially expressed ARGs were identified in patients with NB with
   and without MYCN gene amplification, and the ARG expression patterns and
   related clinical data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to
   Generate Effective Treatments database were used as the training cohort.
   Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses were used to
   identify prognostic ARGs associated with event-free survival (EFS), and
   a prognostic risk score model was developed. Model performance was
   assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves. The prognostic ARG mode l was verified
   using the validation cohort dataset, GSE49710. Finally, a nomogram was
   constructed by combining the ARGbased risk score with
   clinicopathological factors. Three ARGs (GABARAPL1, NBR1, and PINK1)
   were selected to build a prognostic risk score model. The EFS in the
   low-risk group was significantly better than that in the high-risk group
   in both the training and validation cohorts. A nomogram incorporating
   the prognostic risk score, age, and International Neuroblastoma Staging
   System stage showed a favorable predictive ability for EFS rates
   according to the area under the ROC curve at 3 years (AUC = 0.787) and 5
   years (AUC = 0.787). The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination and
   calibration. Our risk score model for the 3 ARGs can be used as an
   independent prognostic factor in patients with NB and MYCN gene
   amplification. The model can accurately predict the 3- and 5-year
   survival rates.},

Title = {The Functional Classification of ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 Replication, Immune
   Evasion, and Viral Pathogenesis Inferred through Phylogenetic Profiling},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {ORF8 is a highly variable genomic region of SARS-CoV-2. Although
   non-essential and the precise functions are unknown, it has been
   suggested that this protein assists in SARS-CoV-2 replication in the
   early secretory pathway and in immune evasion. We utilized the binding
   partners of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human HEK293T cells and performed
   genome-wide phylogenetic profiling and clustering analyses in 446
   eukaryotic species to predict and discover ORF8 binding partners that
   share associated functional mechanisms based on co-evolution. Results
   classified 47 ORF8 binding partner proteins into 3 clusters (groups
   1-3), which were conserved in vertebrates (group 1), metazoan (group 2),
   and eukaryotes (group 3). Gene ontology analysis indicated that group 1
   had no significant associated biological processes, while groups 2 and 3
   were associated with glycoprotein biosynthesis process and
   ubiquitin-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation
   pathways, respectively. Collectively, our results classified potential
   genes that might be associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogenesis,
   specifically related to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the
   secretory pathway. Here, we discuss the possible role of ORF8 in viral
   pathogenesis and in assisting viral replication and immune evasion via
   secretory pathway, as well as the possible factors associated with the
   rapid evolution of ORF8.},

   Competing Endogenous RNA in Osteosarcoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The etiology of osteosarcoma (OS) is complex and not fully understood
   till now. This study aimed to identify the miRNAs, circRNAs, and genes
   (mRNAs) that are differentially expressed in OS cell lines to
   investigate the mechanism of circRNA-associated competing endogenous
   RNAs (ceRNAs) in OS. Microarray datasets reporting mRNA (GSE70414),
   miRNA (GSE70367), and circRNA changes (GSE96964) in human OS cell lines
   were downloaded, differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were identified, and
   DEmRNAs were used for the annotation of Gene Ontology (GO) biological
   processes (BP), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
   pathways. The mechanisms of DEcircRNA-mediated ceRNAs were identified in
   a step-by-step process. A total of 326 DEmRNAs, 45 DEmiRNAs, and 110
   DEcircRNAs were identified from 3 datasets. The DEmRNAs were associated
   with GO BP terms, including cholesterol biosynthetic process,
   angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization and KEGG pathways,
   including p53 signaling pathway and biosynthesis of antibiotics. The
   final ceRNA network consisted of 8 DEcircRNAs, including 5 pappalysin
   (PAPPA) 1-derived DEcircRNAs (hsa\_circ\_0005456, hsa\_circ\_0088209,
   hsa\_circ\_0002052, hsa\_circ\_0088214 and has\_circ\_0008792, all
   downregulated), 3 DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-760, hsa-miR-4665-5p and
   hsa-miR-4539, all upregulated), and downregulated genes (including MMP13
   and HMOX1). The ceRNA regulation network of OS was built, which played
   important roles in the pathogenesis of OS and might be of great
   importance in therapy.},

Title = {Screening of Important Markers in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells to
   Predict Female Osteoporosis Risk Using LASSO Regression Algorithm and
   SVM Method},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the patient's
   risk of fracture. We aimed to identify robust marker genes related to
   osteoporosis based on different bioinformatic methods and multiple
   datasets. Methods: Three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
   were utilized for analysis separately. Significantly differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) from comparing high hip and low hip low bone
   mineral density (BMD) groups in the first dataset were identified for
   Gene Ontology (GO), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto
   encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) to investigate the discrepantly
   enriched biological processes between high hip and low hip group. Last
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), SVM model and
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network were performed and
   generated robust marker genes for downstream TF-target and miRNA-target
   prediction. Results: Several DEGs between high hip BMD group and low hip
   BMD group were obtained. And the metabolism-related pathways such as
   metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
   metabolism shown enrichment in these DEGs. Integration with LASSO
   regression analysis, 8 differential expression genes (SH3BP1, NARF,
   ANKRD34B, RNF40, ZNF473, AKT1, SHMT1, and VASH1) in GSE62402 were
   identified as the optimal differential genes combination. Moreover, the
   SVM validation analysis in GSE56814 and GSE56815 datasets showed that
   the characteristic gene combinations presented high diagnostic effects,
   and the model AUC areas for GSE56814 was 0.899 and for GSE56815 was
   0.921. Furthermore, the subcellular localization analysis of the 8 genes
   revealed that 4 proteins were located in the cytoplasm, 3 proteins were
   located in the nucleus, and 1 protein was located in the mitochondria.
   Additionally, the related TFs and miRNAs by performing TF-target and
   miRNA-target prediction for 5 genes (AKT1, SHMT1, ZNF473, RNF40 and
   VASH1) were investigated from PPI network. Conclusion: The optimal
   differential genes combination (SH3BP1, NARF, ANKRD34B, RNF40, ZNF473,
   AKT1, SHMT1, and VASH1) presented high diagnostic effect for
   osteoporosis risk.},

   Breast Cancer Based on exoRBase},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: To construct a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory
   network derived from exosomes of human breast cancer (BC) by using the
   exoRbase database, to explore the possible pathogenesis of BC, and to
   develop new targets for future diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The
   exosomal gene sequencing data of BC patients and normal controls were
   downloaded from the exoRbase database, and the expression profiles of
   exosomal mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA)
   were analyzed by using R language. Use Targetscan and miRanda database
   to jointly predict and differentially express miRNA (microRNA), miRNA
   combined with mRNA. The miRcode database was used to predict the miRNA
   combined with differentially expressed lncRNA, and the starBase database
   was used to predict the miRNA combined with circRNA in the difference
   table. The related mRNA, circRNA, lncRNA, and their corresponding miRNA
   prediction data were imported into Cytoscape software to visualize the
   ceRNA network. Enrichment analysis and visualization of KEGG were
   carried out using KOBAS. Hub gene was determined by Cytohubba plug-in.
   Results: Forty-two differentially expressed mRNA, 43 differentially
   expressed circRNA, and 26 differentially expressed lncRNA were screened
   out. The ceRNA network was constructed by using Cytoscape software,
   including 19 mRNA nodes, 2 lncRNA nodes, 8 circRNA nodes, and 41 miRNA
   nodes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed
   mRNA in the regulatory network mainly enriched the p53 signaling
   pathway. Find the key Hub gene PTEN. Conclusion: The ceRNA regulatory
   network in blood exosomes of BC patients has been successfully
   constructed in this study, which provides an exact target for the
   diagnosis and treatment of BC.},

Abstract = {SDF2L1 is a new type of endoplasmic reticulum stress inducible protein,
   which is related to poor prognosis of various cancer, we initially
   studied the low expression level of SDF2L1 in NPC, but the molecular
   mechanism of SDF2L1 in NPC needs further elucidation. To identify
   phosphorylated proteins regulated by SDF2L1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
   (NPC), Label-free Quantitative (LFQ) Proteomics and 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis
   were performed on high metastatic NPC 5-8F cells with overexpression of
   SDF2L1 and empty segment. Western blotting was applied to validate the
   differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPPs). As a result,
   331 DEPPs were identified by proteomics, and PARVA phosphorylation
   (ser8) was validated. The present results suggested that PARVA
   phosphorylation may be a new promising biomarker for predicting NPC and
   play a key role in the occurrence and development of NPC.},

Title = {Gut Microbiome Changes in Captive Plateau Zokors (Eospalax baileyi)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wild-caught animals must cope with drastic lifestyle and dietary changes
   after being induced to captivity. How the gut microbiome structure of
   these animals will change in response receives increasing attention. The
   plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), a typic subterranean rodent endemic to
   the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, spends almost the whole life underground and
   is well adapted to the environmental pressures of both plateau and
   underground. However, how the gut microbiome of the plateau zokor will
   change in response to captivity has not been reported to date. This
   study compared the microbial community structure and functions of 22
   plateau zokors before (the WS group) and after being kept in captivity
   for 15 days (the LS group, fed on carrots) using the 16S rRNA gene via
   high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the LS
   group retained 973 of the 977 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the
   WS group, and no new OTUs were found in the LS group. The dominant
   bacterial phyla were Bacteroides and Firmicutes in both groups. In alpha
   diversity analysis, the Shannon, Sobs, and ACE indexes of the LS group
   were significantly lower than those of the WS group. A remarkable
   difference (P < 0.01) between groups was also detected in beta diversity
   analysis. The UPGMA clustering, NMDS, PCoA, and Anosim results all
   showed that the intergroup difference was significantly greater than the
   intragroup difference. And compared with the WS group, the intragroup
   difference of the gut microbiota in the LS group was much larger, which
   failed to support the assumption that similar diets should drive
   convergence of gut microbial communities. PICRUSt revealed that although
   some functional categories displayed significant differences between
   groups, the relative abundances of these categories were very close in
   both groups. Based on all the results, we conclude that as plateau
   zokors enter captivity for a short time, although the relative
   abundances of different gut microbiota categories shifted significantly,
   they can maintain almost all the OTUs and the functions of the gut
   microbiota in the wild. So, the use of wild-caught plateau zokors in gut
   microbial studies is acceptable if the time in captivity is short.},

Title = {Bioinformatics Analysis Identifies Potential Related Genes in the
   Pathogenesis of Intrauterine Fetal Growth Retardation},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) affects approximately
   10\% to 15\% of all pregnancies worldwide. IUGR is not only associated
   with stillbirth and newborn death, but also the delay of cognition in
   childhood and the promotion of metabolic and vascular disorders in
   adulthood. Figuring out the mechanism of IUGR is rather meaningful and
   valuable. Methods: Datasets related to IUGR were searched in the Gene
   Expression Omnibus website. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used
   for normalization. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out
   using the ggpot2 tool. DEGs were used to conduct Gene Ontology (GO)
   terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
   enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis.
   IUGR related genes were searched in the OMIM website to look for the
   intersection with the DEGs. The DEGs were analyzed for tissue-specific
   expression by the online resource BioGPS. The results were displayed
   through volcano map, Venn map, box plot, heat map, and GSEA enrichment
   plots drawn by R language packages. Results: Eleven DEGs were screened
   out of 2 datasets. One hundred ninety-five genes related to IUGR in OMIM
   were retrieved. EGR2 was the only intersection gene that was found in
   both groups. Genes associated with placental tissue expression include
   COL17A1, HSD11B1, and LGALS14. Molecular functions of the DEGs are
   related to the oxidoreductase activity. The following 4 signaling
   pathways, reactome signaling by interleukins, reactome collagen
   degradation, Naba secreted factors, and PID NFAT tfpathway, were
   enriched by GSEA. Two critical modules comprising 5 up-regulated genes
   (LEP, PRL, TAC3, MMP14, and ADAMTS4) and 4 down-regulated genes (TIMP4,
   FOS, CCK, and KISS1) were identified by PPI analysis. Finally, we
   identified 6 genes (PRL, LGALS14, EGR2, TAC3, LEP, and KISS1) that are
   potentially relevant to the pathophysiology of IUGR. Conclusion: The
   candidate down-regulated genes LGALS14 and KISS1, as well as the
   up-regulated genes PRL, EGR2, TAC3, and LEP, were found to be closely
   related to IUGR by bioinformatics analysis. These hub genes are related
   to hypoxia and oxidoreductase activities in placental development. We
   provide useful and novel information to explore the potential mechanism
   of IUGR and make efforts to the prevention of IUGR.},

Title = {Seasonal Diversity of Microeukaryotes in the Han River, Korea Through
   18S rRNA Gene Metabarcoding},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems contain a large diversity of microeukaryotes that
   play important roles in maintaining their structure. Microeukaryote
   communities vary in composition and abundance on the basis of temporal
   and environmental variables and may serve as useful bioindicators of
   environmental changes. In the present study, 18S rRNA metabarcoding was
   employed to investigate the seasonal diversity of microeukaryote
   communities during four seasons in the Han River, Korea. In total, 882
   unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, including
   various diatoms, metazoans (e.g., arthropods and rotifers),
   chlorophytes, and fungi. Although alpha diversity revealed insignificant
   differences based on seasons, beta diversity exhibited a prominent
   variation in the community composition as per seasons. The analysis
   revealed that the diversity of microeukaryotes was primarily driven by
   seasonal changes in the prevailing conditions of environmental water
   temperature and dissolved oxygen. Moreover, potential indicator OTUs
   belonging to diatoms and chlorophytes were associated with seasonal and
   environmental factors. This analysis was a preliminary study that
   established a continuous monitoring system using metabarcoding. This
   approach could be an effective tool to manage the Han River along with
   other freshwater ecosystems in Korea.},

Title = {Compelling Evidence Suggesting the Codon Usage of SARS-CoV-2 Adapts to
   Human After the Split From RaTG13},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 needs to efficiently make use of the resources from hosts in
   order to survive and propagate. Among the multiple layers of regulatory
   network, mRNA translation is the rate-limiting step in gene expression.
   Synonymous codon usage usually conforms with tRNA concentration to allow
   fast decoding during translation. It is acknowledged that SARS-CoV-2 has
   adapted to the codon usage of human lungs so that the virus could
   rapidly proliferate in the lung environment. While this notion seems to
   nicely explain the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to lungs, it is unable to
   tell why other viruses do not have this advantage. In this study, we
   retrieve the GTEx RNA-seq data for 30 tissues (belonging to over 17 000
   individuals). We calculate the RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage)
   weighted by gene expression in each human sample, and investigate the
   correlation of RSCU between the human tissues and SARS-CoV-2 or RaTG13
   (the closest coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2). Lung has the highest
   correlation of RSCU to SARS-CoV-2 among all tissues, suggesting that the
   lung environment is generally suitable for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly,
   for most tissues, SARS-CoV-2 has higher correlations with the human
   samples compared with the RaTG13-human correlation. This difference is
   most significant for lungs. In conclusion, the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2
   has adapted to human lungs to allow fast decoding and translation. This
   adaptation probably took place after SARS-CoV-2 split from RaTG13
   because RaTG13 is less perfectly correlated with human. This finding
   depicts the trajectory of adaptive evolution from ancestral sequence to
   SARS-CoV-2, and also well explains why SARS-CoV-2 rather than other
   viruses could perfectly adapt to human lung environment.},

Abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of chronic, non-healing wounds is challenging and
   time-consuming because it can be caused by a variety of etiologies. This
   brief report presents an unusual case of a chronic wound lasting for 10
   months investigated by deep metagenomic sequencing. Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV) was identified in the wound and subsequently validated by in situ
   hybridization. Histopathologic examination eventually revealed that the
   non-healing wound was due to an EBV-associated NK/T cell lymphoma. By
   identifying mutations across the viral genome, the virus was classified
   as Type I EBV and clustered with others of geographic proximity. Our
   results suggest that metagenomic shotgun sequencing can not only rapidly
   and accurately identify the presence of underlying pathogens but also
   provide strain-level resolution for the surveillance of viral

Title = {Investigating the Genomic Background of CRISPR-Cas Genomes for
   CRISPR-Based Antimicrobials},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {CRISPR-Cas systems are an adaptive immunity that protects prokaryotes
   against foreign genetic elements. Genetic templates acquired during past
   infection events enable DNA-interacting enzymes to recognize foreign DNA
   for destruction. Due to the programmability and specificity of these
   genetic templates, CRISPR-Cas systems are potential alternative
   antibiotics that can be engineered to self-target antimicrobial
   resistance genes on the chromosome or plasmid. However, several
   fundamental questions remain to repurpose these tools against
   drug-resistant bacteria. For endogenous CRISPR-Cas self-targeting,
   antimicrobial resistance genes and functional CRISPR-Cas systems have to
   co-occur in the target cell. Furthermore, these tools have to outplay
   DNA repair pathways that respond to the nuclease activities of Cas
   proteins, even for exogenous CRISPR-Cas delivery. Here, we conduct a
   comprehensive survey of CRISPR-Cas genomes. First, we address the
   co-occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems and antimicrobial resistance genes
   in the CRISPR-Cas genomes. We show that the average number of these
   genes varies greatly by the CRISPR-Cas type, and some CRISPR-Cas types
   (IE and IIIA) have over 20 genes per genome. Next, we investigate the
   DNA repair pathways of these CRISPR-Cas genomes, revealing that the
   diversity and frequency of these pathways differ by the CRISPR-Cas type.
   The interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA repair pathways is
   essential for the acquisition of new spacers in CRISPR arrays. We
   conduct simulation studies to demonstrate that the efficiency of these
   DNA repair pathways may be inferred from the time-series patterns in the
   RNA structure of CRISPR repeats. This bioinformatic survey of CRISPR-Cas
   genomes elucidates the necessity to consider multifaceted interactions
   between different genes and systems, to design effective CRISPR-based
   antimicrobials that can specifically target drug-resistant bacteria in
   natural microbial communities.},

   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome pathway
   analysis were performed using the STRING database and Cytoscape
   software. We found that the mRNA expression, stages of HCC, and OS of
   AURKA and AURKB in HCC tissues were significantly different from control
   tissues, but there were significant inconsistencies in promoter
   methylation level and relationship with immunoinhibitors for AURKA and
   AURKB. None of the above items were significantly different for AURKC.
   Furthermore, a hub module including AURKA, AURKB, and AURKC was
   identified within the PPI network constructed with the Molecular Complex
   Detection (MCODE) plug-in in Cytoscape software. Our results show that
   AURKB could be a potential biomarker for HCC prognosis.},

Title = {Temperature and Latitude Correlate with SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiological
   Variables but not with Genomic Change Worldwide},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease has spread quickly
   and massively around the entire globe, causing millions of confirmed
   cases and deaths worldwide. The disease poses a serious ongoing threat
   to public health. This study aims to understand the disease potential of
   the virus in different regions by studying how average spring
   temperature and its strong predictor, latitude, affect epidemiological
   variables such as disease incidence, mortality, recovery cases, active
   cases, testing rate, and hospitalization. We also seek to understand the
   association of temperature and geographic coordinates with viral
   genomics. Epidemiological data along with temperature, latitude,
   longitude, and preparedness index were collected for different countries
   and US states during the early stages of the pandemic. Our worldwide
   epidemiological analysis showed a significant correlation between
   temperature and incidence, mortality, recovery cases and active cases.
   The same tendency was found with latitude, but not with longitude. In
   the US, we observed no correlation between temperature or latitude and
   epidemiological variables. Interestingly, longitude was correlated with
   incidence, mortality, active cases, and hospitalization. An analysis of
   mutational change and mutational change per time in 55 453 aligned
   SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed these parameters were uncorrelated
   with temperature and geographic coordinates. The epidemiological trends
   we observed worldwide suggest a seasonal effect for the disease that is
   not directly controlled by the genomic makeup of the virus. Future
   studies will need to determine if correlations are more likely the
   result of effects associated with the environment or the innate immunity
   of the host.},

Abstract = {Soil contamination by hydrocarbons due to oil spills has become a global
   concern and it has more implications in oil producing regions.
   Biostimulation is considered as one of the promising remediation
   techniques that can be adopted to enhance the rate of degradation of
   crude oil. The soil microbial consortia play a critical role in
   governing the biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), in
   particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, the
   degradation pattern of TPHs and PAHs of Kuwait soil biopiles was
   measured at three-month intervals. Then, the microbial consortium
   associated with oil degradation at each interval was revealed through
   16S rRNA based next generation sequencing. Rapid degradation of TPHs and
   most of the PAHs was noticed at the first 3 months of biostimulation
   with a degradation rate of pyrene significantly higher compared to other
   PAHs counterparts. The taxonomic profiling of individual stages of
   remediation revealed that, biostimulation of the investigated soil
   favored the growth of Proteobacteria, Alphaprotobacteria, Chloroflexi,
   Chlorobi, and Acidobacteria groups. These findings provide a key step
   towards the restoration of oil-contaminated lands in the arid
   environment.},

Title = {Integrated Analysis of Multi-Omics Data to Establish a Hypoxia-Related
   Prognostic Model in Osteosarcoma},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in
   clinical practice, and currently, the ability to predict prognosis in
   the diagnosis of OS is limited. There is an urgent need to find new
   diagnostic methods and treatment strategies for OS. Material and
   methods: We downloaded the multi-omics data for OS from the TARGET
   database. Prognosis-associated methylation sites were used to identify
   clustered subtypes of OS, and OS was classified into 3 subtypes (C1, C2,
   C3). Survival analysis showed significant differences between the C3
   subtype and the other subtypes. Subsequently, differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) across subtypes were screened and subjected to pathway
   enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 249 DEGs were screened from C3
   subtype to other subtypes. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis showed
   that DEGs were significantly enriched to the hypoxic pathway. Based on
   univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis, 12 genes from the
   hypoxia pathway were further screened and used to construct
   hypoxia-related prognostic model (HRPM). External validation of the HRPM
   was performed on the GSE21257 dataset. Finally, differences in survival
   and immune infiltration between high and low risk score groups were
   compared. Conclusion: In summary, we proposed a hypoxia-associated risk
   model based on a 12-gene expression signature, which is potentially
   valuable for prognostic diagnosis of patients with OS.},

Title = {The Power of Universal Contextualized Protein Embeddings in
   Cross-species Protein Function Prediction},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Computationally annotating proteins with a molecular function is a
   difficult problem that is made even harder due to the limited amount of
   available labeled protein training data. Unsupervised protein embeddings
   partly circumvent this limitation by learning a universal protein
   representation from many unlabeled sequences. Such embeddings
   incorporate contextual information of amino acids, thereby modeling the
   underlying principles of protein sequences insensitive to the context of
   species. We used an existing pre-trained protein embedding method and
   subjected its molecular function prediction performance to detailed
   characterization, first to advance the understanding of protein language
   models, and second to determine areas of improvement. Then, we applied
   the model in a transfer learning task by training a function predictor
   based on the embeddings of annotated protein sequences of one training
   species and making predictions on the proteins of several test species
   with varying evolutionary distance. We show that this approach
   successfully generalizes knowledge about protein function from one
   eukaryotic species to various other species, outperforming both an
   alignment-based and a supervised-learning-based baseline. This implies
   that such a method could be effective for molecular function prediction
   in inadequately annotated species from understudied taxonomic kingdoms.},

   (MIBC) by Bioinformatics},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We aimed to discover prognostic factors of muscle-invasive bladder
   cancer (MIBC) and investigate their relationship with immune therapies.
   Online data of MIBC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   and Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) database. Weighted gene
   co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and univariate Cox analysis were
   applied to classify genes into different groups. Venn diagram was used
   to find the intersection of genes, and prognostic efficacy was proved by
   Kaplan-Meier analysis. Heatmap was utilized for differential analysis.
   Riskscore (RS) was calculated according to multivariate Cox analysis and
   evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). MIBC samples
   from TCGA and GEO were analyzed by WGCNA and univariate Cox analysis and
   intersected at 4 genes, CLK4, DEDD2, ENO1, and SYTL1. Higher SYTL1 and
   DEDD2 expressions were significantly correlated with high tumor grades.
   Riskscore based on genes showed great prognostic efficiency in
   predicting overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and
   progression-free interval (PFI) in TCGA dataset (P < .001). The area
   under the ROC curve (AUC) of RS reached 0.671 in predicting 1-year
   survival and 0.653 in 3-year survival. KEGG pathways enrichment filtered
   5 enriched pathways. xCell analysis showed increased T cell CD4+ Th2
   cell, macrophage, macrophage M1, and macrophage M2 infiltration in high
   RS samples (P < .001). In immune checkpoints analysis, PD-L1 expression
   was significantly higher in patients with high RS. We have, therefore,
   constructed RS as a convincing prognostic index for MIBC patients and
   found potential targeted pathways.},

Title = {Computational Structural and Functional Analyses of ORF10 in Novel
   Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Variants to Understand Evolutionary Dynamics},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction: In an effort to combat SARS-CoV-2 through multi-subunit
   vaccine design, during studies using whole genome and immunome, ORF10,
   located at the 3 ` end of the genome, displayed unique features. It
   showed no homology to any known protein in other organisms, including
   SARS-CoV. It was observed that its nucleotide sequence is 100\%
   identical in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sourced worldwide, even in the
   recent-most VoCs and VoIs of B.1.1.529 (Omicron), B.1.617 (Delta),
   B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) lineages, implicating
   its constant nature throughout the evolution of deadly variants. Aim:
   The structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 and the role it may play
   in the viral evolution is yet to be understood clearly. The aim of this
   study is to predict its structure, function, and understand evolutionary
   dynamics on the basis of mutations and likely heightened immune
   responses in the immunopathogenesis of this deadly virus. Methods:
   Sequence analysis, ab-initio structure modeling and an understanding of
   the impact of likely substitutions in key regions of protein was carried
   out. Analyses of viral T cell epitopes and primary anchor residue
   mutations was done to understand the role it may play in the evolution
   as a molecule with likely enhanced immune response and consequent
   immunopathogenesis. Results: Few amino acid substitution mutations are
   observed, most probably due to the ribosomal frameshifting, and these
   mutations may not be detrimental to its functioning. As ORF10 is
   observed to be an expressed protein, ab-initio structure modeling shows
   that it comprises mainly an alpha-helical region and maybe an
   ER-targeted membrane mini-protein. Analyzing the whole proteome, it is
   observed that ORF10 presents amongst the highest number of likely
   promiscuous and immunogenic CTL epitopes, specifically 11 out of 30
   promiscuous ones and 9 out of these 11, immunogenic CTL epitopes.
   Reactive T cells to these epitopes have been uncovered in independent
   studies. Majority of these epitopes are located on the alpha-helix
   region of its structure, and the substitution mutations of primary
   anchor residues in these epitopes do not affect immunogenicity. Its
   conserved nucleotide sequence throughout the evolution and
   diversification of virus into several variants is a puzzle yet to be
   solved. Conclusions: On the basis of its sequence, structure, and
   epitope mapping, it is concluded that it may function like those
   mini-proteins used to boost immune responses in medical applications.
   Due to complete nucleotide sequence conservation even a few years after
   SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced, it poses a unique puzzle to be
   solved, in view of the evolutionary dynamics of variants emerging in the
   populations worldwide.},

Title = {Bioinformatics-based Characterization of the Sequence Variability of
   Zika Virus Polyprotein and Envelope Protein (E)},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Zika virus, which is widely spread and infects humans
   through the bites of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti female
   mosquitoes, represents a serious global health issue. Objective: The
   objective of the present study is to computationally characterize Zika
   virus polyproteins (UniProt Name: PRO\_0000443018 {[}residues 1-3423],
   PRO\_0000445659 {[}residues 1-3423] and PRO\_0000435828 {[}residues
   1-3419]) and their envelope proteins using their physico-chemical
   properties. Methods: To achieve this, the Polarity Index Method (PIM)
   profile and the Protein Intrinsic Disorder Predisposition (PIDP) profile
   of 3 main groups of proteins were evaluated: structural proteins
   extracted from specific Databases, Zika virus polyproteins, and their
   envelope proteins (E) extracted from UniProt Database. Once the PIM
   profile of the Zika virus envelope proteins (E) was obtained and since
   the Zika virus polyproteins were also identified with this profile, the
   proteins defined as ``reviewed proteins{''} extracted from the UniProt
   Database were searched for the similar PIM profile. Finally, the
   difference between the PIM profiles of the Zika virus polyproteins and
   their envelope proteins (E) was tested using 2 non-parametric
   statistical tests. Results: It was found and tested that the PIM profile
   is an efficient discriminant that allows obtaining a ``computational
   fingerprint{''} of each Zika virus polyprotein from its envelope protein
   (E). Conclusion: PIM profile represents a computational tool, which can
   be used to effectively discover Zika virus polyproteins from Databases,
   from their envelope proteins (E) sequences.},

Title = {Biological Computation and Compatibility Search in the Possibility Space
   as the Mechanism of Complexity Increase During Progressive Evolution},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The idea of computational processes, which take place in nature, for
   example, DNA computation, is discussed in the literature. DNA
   computation that is going on in the immunoglobulin locus of vertebrates
   shows how the computations in the biological possibility space could
   operate during evolution. We suggest that the origin of evolutionarily
   novel genes and genome evolution constitute the original intrinsic
   computation of the information about new structures in the space of
   unrealized biological possibilities. Due to DNA computation, the
   information about future structures is generated and stored in DNA as
   genetic information. In evolving ontogenies, search algorithms are
   necessary, which can search for information about evolutionary
   innovations and morphological novelties. We believe that such algorithms
   include stochastic gene expression, gene competition, and compatibility
   search at different levels of structural organization. We formulate the
   increase in complexity principle in terms of biological computation and
   hypothesize the possibility of in silico computing of future functions
   of evolutionarily novel genes.},

Title = {Identification and Analysis of Aux/IAA Family in Acer rubrum},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The phytohormone auxin are important in all aspects of plant growth and
   development. The Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) gene responds to
   auxin induction as auxin early response gene family. Despite the
   physiological importance of the Aux/IAA gene, a systematic analysis of
   the Aux/IAA gene in Acer rubrum has not been reported. This paper
   describes the characterization of Acer rubrum Aux/IAA genes at the
   transcriptomic level and Acer yangbiense Aux/IAA genes at the genomic
   level, with 17 Acer rubrum AUX/IAA genes (ArAux/IAA) and 23 Acer
   yangbiense Aux/IAA (AyAux/IAA) genes identified. Phylogenetic analysis
   shows that AyAux/IAA and ArAux/IAA family genes can be subdivided into 4
   groups and show strong evolutionary conservatism. Quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression
   profile of ArAux/IAA genes in different tissues under indole-3-acetic
   acid (IAA) treatment. Most ArAux/IAA genes are responsive to exogenous
   auxin and have tissue-specific expression. Overall, these results will
   provide molecular-level insights into auxin metabolism, transport, and
   signaling in Acer species.},

Title = {Full-Length 16S rRNA and ITS Gene Sequencing Revealed Rich Microbial
   Flora in Roots of Cycas spp. in China},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cycads have developed a complex root system categorized either as normal
   or coralloid roots. Past literatures revealed that a great diversity of
   key microbes is associated with these roots. This recent study aims to
   comprehensively determine the diversity and community structure of
   bacteria and fungi associated with the roots of two Cycas spp. endemic
   to China, Cycas debaoensis Zhong \& Chen and Cycas fairylakea D.Y. Wang
   using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA
   (V1-V9 hypervariable) and short fragment ITS region. The total DNA from
   12 root samples were extracted, amplified, sequenced, and analyzed.
   Resulting sequences were clustered into 61 bacteria and 2128 fungal
   OTUs. Analysis of community structure revealed that the coralloid roots
   were dominated mostly by the nitrogen-fixer Nostocaceae but also contain
   other non-diazotrophic bacteria. The sequencing of entire 16S rRNA gene
   identified four different strains of cyanobacteria under the
   heterocystous genera Nostoc and Desmonostoc. Meanwhile, the top
   bacterial families in normal roots were Xanthobacteraceae,
   Burkholderiaceae, and Bacillaceae. Moreover, a diverse fungal community
   was also found in the roots of cycads and the predominating families
   were Ophiocordycipitaceae, Nectriaceae, Bionectriaceae, and
   Trichocomaceae. Our results demonstrated that bacterial diversity in
   normal roots of C. fairylakea is higher in richness and abundance than
   C. debaoensis. On the other hand, a slight difference, albeit
   insignificant, was noted for the diversity of fungi among root types and
   host species as the number of shared taxa is relatively high (67\%). Our
   results suggested that diverse microbes are present in roots of cycads
   which potentially interact together to support cycads survival. Our
   study provided additional knowledge on the microbial diversity and
   composition in cycads and thus expanding our current knowledge on
   cycad-microbe association. Our study also considered the possible impact
   of ex situ conservation on cyanobiont community of cycads.},

Abstract = {Colony composition and behavioral characteristics of the myrmicine ant,
   Aphaenogaster rugulosa, a species endemic to Yonagunijima Island, were
   investigated. Colonies nested in rotten woods fallen on the forest
   floor. All queenright colonies (N = 42) were monogynous with one dealate
   queen. The average colony size in worker number was 140.5 +/- SD 94.9.
   Under laboratory conditions, workers and larvae fed on both fresh and
   dried insect preys. The workers used a kind of tool to transport diluted
   sugar water to the nest chamber. They dropped pine needles and trashes
   into the diluted sugar water and then transported the food-soaked
   materials back into the nest chamber, where nest members then sucked on
   the materials inside the nest chamber. Trophic eggs were laid by the
   workers, the majority of which were given to the larvae. The queens also
   fed on trophic eggs as well as insect preys. The workers under an orphan
   condition laid reproductive eggs that grew up to be males.},

Title = {The Acrotylaceae (Gigartinales) revisited: molecular data indicate
   family-level differences in one of the most enigmatic red-algal families},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {305-326},
Abstract = {The Acrotylaceae (Gigartinales) has been an obscure, puzzling red-algal
   family composed of six genera (Acrotylus, Amphiplexia, Antrocentrum,
   Claviclonium, Hennedya and Ranavalona) that have virtually no habit and
   vegetative features remotely in common. Excepting Amphiplexia, with two
   species, all are monotypic and, save for Ranavalona, endemic to the
   southern half of Australia, Ranavalona being known only by a single
   collection from southern Madagascar. The most noteworthy unifying
   feature of the genera is the cystocarps, in which carposporangial
   filaments grow into a hollow cavity from inner hull layers. In almost
   all other respects, apart from zonate tetrasporangia, there are no
   anatomical features that appear uniformly throughout the complex.
   Molecular studies indicate that the family is composed of the
   Acrotylaceae sensu stricto (for Acrotylus, Hennedya and Ranavalona) and
   the newly proposed Clavicloniaceae (for Claviclonium, Amphiplexia and
   Antrocentrum). We recognise a new species of Acrotylus (A.
   cryptographicus) and transfer Rhabdonia mollis Harvey and R. hamata
   Zanardini to Antrocentrum. Closest affinities of both families lie with
   the Dicranemataceae, Mychodeaceae and Mychodeophyllaceae of the
   Gigartinales. The South African genus Reinboldia, which is based on a
   single 19th century collection, has been questionably included in the
   Acrotylaceae previously but should, in our opinion, be excluded.},

Title = {A phylogenetic investigation of the taxonomically problematic Eucalyptus
   odorata complex (E. section Adnataria series Subbuxeales): evidence for
   extensive interspecific gene flow and reticulate evolution},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {403-435},
Abstract = {To investigate the relationships among species in the taxonomically
   problematic Eucalyptus odorata species complex, we generated molecular
   data using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   (ddRADseq) and Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArTseq). These
   data were analysed utilising principal-component analysis (PCA),
   phylogenetic networks, phylogeny reconstruction and hybridisation tests.
   Twelve species that are variously recognised in the complex were sampled
   from across their ranges, along with co-occurring members of E. section
   Adnataria, to allow for patterns of hybridisation and gene flow to be
   identified. Despite the large genetic datasets generated, many
   relationships within the E. odorata complex were poorly resolved, and
   few species were monophyletic, likely owing to both biological factors
   including recent speciation and extensive hybridisation and
   introgression, and potential over-splitting of taxa. We show that
   multiple taxa with limited distributions are the result of reticulate
   evolutionary events and that typical Eucalyptus viridis R.T.Baker and
   the possibly con-specific E. aenea K.D.Hill are sister to the rest of
   the complex. The remaining species appeared to represent a discontinuous
   crescent-shaped cline running from the Flinders Ranges to the
   south-western slopes region of New South Wales, with limited support for
   an east-west split in this cline across the Murray River Basin.
   Eucalytpus viridis var. latiuscula Blakely, which is not closely related
   to the typical variety of this species in our data, may represent a
   northern extension to this cline.},

Title = {Morphological and molecular evidence refute a broad circumscription for

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Pages = {127-179},
Abstract = {Morphological and single-nucleotide polymorphism data support splitting
   Pultenaea glabra Benth. into eight species, including one in Victoria,
   and seven in eastern and northern New South Wales. Six species are newly
   described, five of which are, like P. glabra, narrow-range endemics
   within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and adjacent
   sandstone landforms of the Great Dividing Range. The recognition of six
   new species from what was broadly P. glabra has implications for
   conservation management, including for P. glabra itself, which has a
   smaller distribution and more precise habitat requirements than
   previously thought. One of the new species, P. percussa, is known by a
   single 1971 gathering only. The occurrence of several narrow-range Blue
   Mountains endemic Pultenaea species may be explained by the combination
   of edaphic diversity and topographic complexity, which could act in
   concert to promote divergences among small, allopatric populations.
   Hybrids between P. glabra and P. flexilis Sm. are documented for the
   first time; however, limited evidence for introgression between the two
   species was observed. The following new taxa are described: Pultenaea
   aculeata M.A.M.Renner, P.H.Weston \& S.Clarke, Pultenaea percussa
   M.A.M.Renner \& P.H.Weston, Pultenaea furcata M.A.M.Renner \&

Abstract = {Pandanus grayorum Callm., Buerki \& Gallaher (Pandanaceae) is newly
   described from the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Queensland in Australia.
   It is the second Australian species other than P. gemmifer H.St.John
   known to reproduce by axillary plantlets on aerial branches. It can be
   distinguished from P. gemmifer and P. solms-laubachii F.Muell. by the
   dimensions of its leaves, shape and dimensions of its syncarps, and by
   the morphology of its phalanges. The placement of P. grayorum in a
   molecular phylogeny confirmed morphological evidence and showed that the
   new species clusters with P. gemmifer and P. solms-laubachii in a Glade
   closely related to the P. tectorius Parkinson complex. Pandanus grayorum
   is known from near the banks of the lower reaches of Mulgrave, Russell,
   Johnstone and Moresby rivers and associated subcoastal flood plains.
   Most collection records are from areas outside national parks and a
   preliminary conservation assessment of Vulnerable is suggested using the
   IUCN Red List. Finally, a key to north-eastern Queensland Pandanus
   species is also provided.},

Abstract = {Although some authors previously questioned the circumscription of
   Nicotiana benthamiana, it has never been treated taxonomically as more
   than a single widespread, variable species. A recent study employing
   phylogenetic and population genetic analyses has demonstrated that N.
   benthamiana comprises five species that are geographically and
   morphologically distinct. Here, we describe four new species in the N.
   benthamiana complex, namely, N. bilybara M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N.
   candelabra M.W.Chase \& Christenh., N. rupestris M.W.Chase \& Christenh.
   and N. scopulorum M.W.Chase \& Christenh., and illustrate all five. We
   provide descriptions, a diagnostic key and a table of morphological
   characters distinguishing these closely related species. The major
   morphological feature that distinguishes N. benthamiana from the other
   four species is its petiolate leaves that become sessile only near the
   apex of the inflorescence; N. candelabra is distinct in its bifacial
   branching, N. bilybara in its commonly winged petiole with an auriculate
   base, N. rupestris in the leafy apices of its calyx lobes, and N.
   scopulorum is the least morphologically divergent species, conforming
   most closely to the general description of the N. benthamiana species

Title = {Licmophora species (Bacillariophyta: Licmophorales) from Heron Island
   (Great Barrier Reef) and Melbourne, Australia, in comparison with
   similar species from Guam: evidence for endemicity in a marine diatom
   genus},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},

Abstract = {A prevailing hypothesis of microbial biogeography holds that all species
   are ubiquitous, but this may lead to fitting Pacific specimens into
   European taxa on the basis of light microscopy. There is now evidence of
   regional endemicity in freshwater diatoms in Australia and recent
   studies have shown large diversity in the Guam marine Licmophora flora.
   The aim was to compare Australian samples with Guam Licmophora spp.,
   especially their girdle bands. Valves and girdle bands from samples
   collected from Australia and Micronesia were described from observations
   made via light and scanning-electron microscopy. Of the nine species
   present in Australian samples, six were previously undescribed. Species
   with unusual characters included Licmophora insolita Lobban \&
   Emm.S.Santos sp. nov. with a novel location for the apical rimoportula
   and a Tharngan strip on the valvocopula; Licmophora ballerina Lobban \&
   S.Blanco sp. nov., with distinctive 3rd and 4th pleurae; and the
   licmosphenioid Licmophora johnwestii Lobban \& Emm.S.Santos sp. nov.
   Specimens resembling Licmophora debilis (Katz.) Grunow and L abbreviata
   C.Agardh, described from Europe, occurred in Great Barrier Reef samples.
   The study brings the Guam flora to 20 novel v. 2 matching
   Atlantic-European taxa. The proportion of new to known species in
   Australian and Guam samples suggests regional endemicity, at least being
   broadly different from European Licmophora floras.},

Title = {Three new tribes in Myrtaceae and reassessment of Kanieae},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-295},
Abstract = {The current tribal classification of Myrtaceae was based on analysis of
   the plastid matK coding region within the trnK intron. The phylogenetic
   position of the genera Cloezia and Xanthomyrtus was poorly supported,
   and the original sequence for Kania, the type genus of the tribe
   Kanieae, was rather poor. To clarify relationships, we sequenced plastid
   psbA-trnH and an extended portion of the trnK intron, including the
   spacer regions flanking matK, and nuclear ribosomal ITS and ETS regions
   for representative species across the tribes, including denser sampling
   of the three genera of interest. Analyses of these extended datasets
   show a strong relationship between Kania and the tribe Metrosidereae but
   not with other genera presently assigned to the Kanieae. The
   relationship between Kania and the tribe Metrosidereae is strongly
   correlated with morphological features recently documented in
   Metrosideros fossils. Consequently, a new tribe, Tristaniopsideae
   PeterG.Wilson, is described to accommodate most genera presently
   assigned to Kanieae. Furthermore, the morphological divergence and
   genetic distance shown by Cloezia and Xanthomyrtus are here considered
   as justifying their recognition as the tribes Cloezieae Peter G.Wilson
   and Xanthomyrteae Peter G.Wilson. Recognition of these tribes brings to
   four the number of tribes absent from present-day mainland Australia.
   Prior to this study, Metrosidereae was the only tribe in subfamily
   Myrtoideae that was absent from mainland Australia.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Salak palms (Salacca spp.) are important fruit species in Southeast
   Asia, but the morphogenesis of their reproductive organs is unknown. To
   observe female gametogenesis, pistil morphogenesis of S. wallichiana and
   subsequent fertilization were observed. The ovary contained three ovule
   primordia three months before flowering (BF). The ovule contained one
   mono-nucleate megaspore at the center and three degenerated megaspores
   on the chalazal side at two months BF, and a mononucleate embryo sac
   (ES) at one month BF. The nucellus enlarged, and protruded beak-like
   from the integuments, forming a micropylar structure. The ovule was
   anatropous, unitegmic, and crassinucellate. Three weeks BF, the ES was
   at the 8-nucleate stage. Two weeks BF, an egg apparatus comprising one
   egg-cell nucleus and two synergid nuclei were developing on the
   micropylar side. The central cell contained one polar nucleus (PN). One
   week BF, the synergids and central cell became multinucleate and
   multiple-PN dispersed in the ES. Several days BF, one PN was again
   observed, and the remaining PN appeared to develop cell groups along the
   ES wall. Anripodals existed on the chalazal side. One day BF, ES
   contained two PN, and one day after pollination (DAP), the zygote and
   primary endosperm nucleus occurred on the micropylar side. One synergid
   remained functional and enlarged even after fertilization. Four DAP and
   thereafter, suspensor cells and an early embryo existed on the
   micropylar side, and the ES contained multiple free endosperm nuclei. In
   S. wallichiana, the ES likely indicates intermediate morphogenesis
   between Polygonum and Oenothera types, suggesting a unique development
   pattern among palms.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of sclerophyllous vegetation in Australia, there
   are few phylogeographic studies with continent-wide sampling addressing
   questions about the expansion of this vegetation post-aridification, and
   what physical barriers are associated with breaks in distribution or
   patterns of genetic structure. We used amplicon sequencing of plastid
   and nuclear DNA to investigate phylogeography of Xanthorrhoea. Despite
   extremely low genetic variation and widespread sharing of identical DNA
   sequence among multiple species and across significant geographic
   distance, haplotype analyses showed phylogeographic structure. Network
   analysis of six plastid loci and 137 samples identified 54 haplotypes
   (two common, 35 unique to single samples) in three geographic groups,
   south west and central Australia, northern-eastern Australia, and
   southern-eastern Australia, indicating restricted gene flow among
   regions. A nrDNA haplotype network of 152 samples showed less variation,
   with one haplotype being widespread, found in all three plastid
   geographic groups and 70\% of species. nrDNA indicated four groups in a
   pattern, suggestive of at least two east-west divergences. A geographic
   area of a high haplotype diversity and divergence was identified in
   southern New South Wales, near the Southern Transition Zone. Our results
   showed the value of targeted amplicon sequencing and using multiple
   samples per species to identify both broad-scale and fine-scale
   biogeographic patterns.},

Pages = {485-509},
Abstract = {A molecular phylogeny of Chloantheae (Lamiaceae) based on a three-marker
   chloroplast and nuclear DNA dataset was used to test the monophyly of
   Lachnostachys Hook., Newcastelia F.Muell. and Physopsis Turcz. A clade
   consisting of at least one species from each of these genera was
   recovered separately from the `core' Lachnostachys, Newcastelia and
   Physopsis clades. The members of this composite clade are here
   transferred to the new genus, Apatelantha T.C.Wilson \& M.J.Henwood,
   which can be recognised by a combination of the base of the style being
   glabrous or with only non-glandular trichomes (glandular trichomes
   lacking), apex of corolla lobes (when present) acute to obtuse (not
   extending into an apical protrusion) and thin-textured (not
   distinctively thickened), pherophylls subtending three flowers, and
   anther connectives glabrous (sessile glands absent). A description of
   the new genus, together with new combinations for five species of
   Apatelantha, and amended descriptions of Lachnostachys, Newcastelia and
   Physopsis, are provided. A new species, Newcastelia clavipetala
   T.C.Wilson \& Radunz, is described and illustrated. A taxonomic key to
   genera of Chloantheae, and keys to species of Lachnostachys,
   Newcastelia, Physopsis and Apatelantha are provided.},

Title = {Arid Australia as a source of plant diversity: the origin and climatic
   evolution of Ptilotus (Amaranthaceae)},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {570-586},
Abstract = {In the present study, we tested the chronological and geographic origins
   of the mostly arid Australian Ptilotus (Amaranthaceae) and its close
   relatives (i.e. the `aervoids') by reconstructing a dated phylogeny with
   near-comprehensive sampling for Ptilotus and estimating ancestral
   geographic ranges. We investigated climatic niche evolution within
   Ptilotus and identified likely climatic origins and subsequent niche
   shifts by reconstructing ancestral states of climatic variables on the
   phylogeny, which was visualised using a phyloecospace approach.
   Geospatial analyses were employed to identify probable diversification
   hotspots within Australia. We inferred that the aervoids originated in
   Oligocene Africa-Asia and that Ptilotus arrived in northern Australia by
   dispersal in the Early Miocene. Subsequent diversification of Ptilotus
   was rapid, giving rise to all major clades in the western Eremaean by
   the time of an aridification pulse in the Middle Miocene. Climatic niche
   shifts from the arid Eremaean into monsoonal northern and temperate
   southern Australia are apparent for multiple independent species groups.
   Our analyses support the hypothesis that a pre-adaptation to aridity and
   early arrival in an aridifying Australia were integral to the success of
   Ptilotus, and that the Eremaean has been a source of biodiversity in the
   genus and for independent radiations into neighbouring climatic zones.},

Title = {Colpomenia species from south and south-eastern Australia (Ectocarpales,
   Phaeophyceae): a DNA barcoding approach},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {587-594},
Abstract = {Defining species in the brown algal genus Colpomenia is a challenging
   endeavour because of their morphological similarity, overlapping
   phenotypic variation, the absence of conspicuous diagnostic characters,
   and often lack of reproductive structures crucial for their
   identification. Thus, the use of molecular tools has become widely used
   to study Colpomenia taxonomy and evolution. The following four
   Colpomenia species are described along the Australian coast: C.
   claytoniae M.Boo, K.M.Lee, G.Y.Cho \& W.Nelson, C. ecuticulata
   M.J.Parsons, C. peregrina Sauvageau, and C. sinuosa (Mertens ex Roth)
   Derbes \& Solier. The objective of this study was to assess the
   diversity of Colpomenia species in southern and south-eastern Australia
   by using DNA barcoding techniques and single-marker species delimitation
   methods. We generated 44 new COI-5P DNA sequences from nine different
   populations across three Australian states (South Australia, Victoria
   and Tasmania), and applied 13 variations of four species delimitation
   methods (ABDG, SPN, PTP, GMYC). Our results recognised three Colpomenia
   species in the region, namely, C. sinuosa, C. claytoniae, and C.
   peregrina. Colpomenia sinuosa is the most widely distributed species in
   Australia. Colpomenia peregrina and C. claytoniae presented high levels
   of intraspecific genetic divergence. We did not find C. ecuticulata,
   although it has been previously reported from nearby our sampling area.},

Pages = {510-525},
Abstract = {Pycnandra Benth., a member of subfamily Chrysophylloideae (Sapotaceae),
   is the largest endemic genus in New Caledonia and is subdivided into six
   subgenera. It circumscribes 59 species, plus an additional three
   described here, and nine additional species that remain undescribed for
   various reasons. We here use nrDNA data of ETS, ITS, and RPB2, analyse
   it within a Bayesian framework using BEAST, and place the new species in
   their respective subgenera. Pycnandra perplexa Swenson \& Gateble is
   placed in subgenus Achradotypus and given a preliminary IUCN Red List
   assessment of Near Threatened (NT). It is confined to the ultramafic
   massif of southern Grande Terre and separated from the similar species
   P. griseosepala Vink, which is confined to non-ultramafic mountains
   north of the large southern ultramafic plateau. Pycnandra kopetoensis
   Munzinger \& Swenson and P. margueriteae Munzinger \& Swenson are two
   new micro-endemic species known only from their type localities, where
   habitats have been destroyed by deforestation, deliberate fires and
   mining activities. Pycnandra kopetoensis is named after Mount Kopeto,
   placed in subgenus Leptostylis, and given a preliminary assessment as
   Critically Endangered (CR). Pycnandra margueriteae is from a small
   remnant forest near Bourail and categorised as Critically Endangered
   (CR). Revised identification keys for subgenus Achradotypus, Leptostylis
   and Pycnandra are provided.},

Abstract = {We studied biomass changes in a lowland tropical rain forest in the
   Pasoh Forest Reserve of Peninsular Malaysia after selective logging in
   1958. A tree census was undertaken every 2 years from 1998 to 2012 in a
   6-ha logged forest plot. Total aboveground biomass (AGB) was 72\% of
   that in a primary forest plot within the same reserve in 1998, but
   reached 87 \% in 2012. AGB regrowth was spatially variable within the
   logged forest plot and was much less in swampy areas than in upland
   areas. The overall annual growth rate of AGB in the logged forest
   throughout the study period was 1.5\% and slowed (to 0.6 \%) in a dry
   period (2004-2006). The biomass of large trees (DBH >= 50 cm) increased
   by 56 \% during the study period, but amounted to only 5890 of the
   biomass of the corresponding size class in the primary forest,
   suggesting that stand structure is still recovering from logging.
   Spatiotemporal variation in AGB recovery after logging needs to be taken
   into account for logging and subsequent management of the tropical
   lowland forest biome.},

Title = {Morphological analyses support recognition of three new threatened

Abstract = {Statistical analyses of two morphological datasets, including 190 newly
   measured specimens, showed that individuals of Myosotis (Boraginaceae)
   from Te Waipounamu / South Island, Aotearoa, New Zealand, identified a
   priori with three different informal tag names, belong to the
   bracteate-prostrate group, are morphologically distinct from each other
   and from other species, and merit scientific description. Myosotis
   hikuwai Meudt, Prebble \& G.M.Rogers is known from one location near
   Wanaka (Otago), has an unusual erect, spring annual habit, and is most
   similar to M. brevis and M. glauca, with which it is sympatric. Myosotis
   venticola Meudt \& Prebble comprises plants that were sometimes
   previously identified as M. cheesemanii from certain ranges in Otago and
   southern Canterbury, but with retrorse trichomes present on the abaxial
   and adaxial side of the rosette leaves. Myosotis ultramafica Meudt,
   Prebble \& Rance comprises individuals from ultramafic sites in certain
   ranges in Southland, and is most similar to M. cheesemanii and M.
   lyallii. We recommend that all three new species are listed as
   Threatened under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In
   addition to descriptions and illustrations, the three new species are
   also included in a revised key to the nineteen species of southern
   hemisphere bracteate-prostrate Myosotis.},

Title = {The impact of multiple molecular and morphological data sets on the
   phylogenetic reconstruction of subtribe Neurachninae (Poaceae:
   Panicoideae: Paniceae)},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {227-251},
Abstract = {The taxonomy of Neurachninane has been unstable, with its member genera
   consisting of Ancistrachne, Calyptochloa, Cleistochloa, Dimorphochloa,
   Neurachne, Paraneurachne and Thyridolepis, changing since its original
   circumscription that comprised only the latter three genera. Recent
   studies on the phylogeny of Neurachninae have focused primarily on
   molecular data. We analysed the phylogeny of Neurachninae on the basis
   of molecular data from seven molecular loci (plastid markers: matK,
   ndhF, rbcL, rpl16, rpoC2 and trnLF, and ribosomal internal transcribed
   spacer, ITS) and morphological data from 104 morphological characters,
   including new taxonomically informative micromorphology of upper paleas.
   We devised an impact assessment scoring (IAS) protocol to aid selection
   of a tree for inferring the phylogeny of Neurachninae. Combining
   morphological and molecular data resulted in a well resolved phylogeny
   with the highest IAS value. Our findings support reinstatement of
   subtribe Neurachninae in its original sense, Neurachne muelleri and
   Dimorphochloa rigida. We show that Ancistrachne, Cleistochloa and
   Dimorphochloa are not monophyletic and Ancistrachne maidenii,
   Calyptochloa, Cleistochloa and Dimorphochloa form a new group, the
   cleistogamy group, united by having unique morphology associated with
   reproductive dimorphism.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {395-402},
Abstract = {Crinum flaccidum Herb. is widespread across southern and eastern
   Australia, but suffers from taxonomic uncertainty. This ambiguity is in
   part due to widespread hybridisation in the genus, but also
   morphological variability within and among populations. Morphological
   and molecular analyses of the complex using 24 morphological characters
   and 59 chloroplast coding and non-coding regions (similar to 50 000 bp)
   provided support for the separation of C. flaccidum from C. luteolum
   Traub \& L.S.Hannibal ex Traub, with the latter representing populations
   from the Flinders Ranges and Lake Eyre Basin. Within Crinum flaccidum,
   there was greater inferred genetic structure at the population level for
   New South Wales flood plain accessions, compared with South Australian
   populations from along the Murray River. The greater structure of the
   South Australian populations is theorised to be attributed to lower
   seed-dispersal rates leading to lower gene flow.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-62},
Abstract = {A new genus, Simonachne E.J.Thomps. is described and Ancistrachne
   maidenii (A.A.Ham.) Vickery is transferred to it as Simonachne maidenii
   (A.A.Ham.) E.J.Thomps. The new subtribe Cleistochloinae E.J.Thomps. is
   described and is composed of four genera, Calyptochloa, Cleistochloa,
   Dimorphochloa and Simonachne, united by distinctive morphology that is
   associated with reproductive dimorphism. Phenetic analyses were used to
   examine the similarities of taxa and to test the consistency of results
   with variation in analysis inputs. Input variations included the dataset
   in terms of composition of the samples and morphological characters, and
   the cluster analysis algorithms, viz. classification, ordination and
   association measure. A baseline dataset was used for comparison of
   results and comprised 24 samples and 161 characters relating to anatomy,
   micro- and macromorphology of spikelets, leaves and fertile culms. Three
   major clusters were resolved, Cleistochloinae ('the cleistogamy group'),
   Neurachninae in its original sense, and a cluster referred to as the
   `paniculate inflorescence group' composed of Ancistrachne s.s.,
   Entolasia and Panicum s.s. The results were congruent with a recent
   phylogenetic study that showed that Ancistrachne s.l., Cleistochloa s.l.
   and Dimorphochloa s.l. were not monophyletic. The process provided an
   array of morphological characters for descriptions of species and for
   distinguishing taxa at multiple ranks in natural groups, components of
   alpha and beta taxonomy respectively.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Sustainable land use through rewetting is becoming increasingly
   important in drained peatlands. We assessed the recovery of productivity
   of smallholder paludiculture using sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) in a
   rewetted peatland on Tebing Tinggi Island, Riau Province, Indonesia,
   which had been drained and burned in 2014. Stand structure and
   productivity of sago palms in smallholder plantations were measured in
   December 2016, November 2017, and March 2020. The sago stands were
   divided into three stands structure groups (pre-harvest stands, mid- to
   post-harvest stands, and growing period stands) according to gaps in the
   harvesting cycle, which were distributed in a mosaic pattern. Only those
   sago palms that had reached their maximum size were harvested, and as a
   result the mosaic pattern varied over time (spatial variation). The
   estimated harvest trunk height after rewetting was 8.9 +/- 1.5 m (mean
   +/- SD), which was not significantly different from that before drainage
   (9.7 +/- 0.4 m). The average annual yield of sago was 26.8 trunks
   ha(-1), and there was large annual variation. Annual yield of
   paludiculture conducted after rewetting recovered to the same yield as
   that before drainage (26.0 trunks ha(-1)). Such size distribution
   patterns and large fluctuations in yield are characteristic of
   semi-traditional smallholder sago cultivation. Despite fluctuations in
   annual yield, harvesting only suitable individuals allows sago palms to
   be supplied every year. The findings obtained in this study will
   contribute to national and regional efforts to initiate paludiculture
   using sago palms.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {438-476},
Abstract = {The diagnostic characteristics and distinctiveness of plant taxa have
   traditionally been based on a combination of geographic and
   morphological discontinuity. Implicit within these concepts is the
   notion that morphological variation is fixed and that gene flow among
   taxa is limited. However, species complexes that comprise a range of
   more-or-less continuous morphotypes often confound such assumptions and
   resist formal taxonomic treatment. A range of independent data sources,
   namely, nucleotide sequences, volatile oils and traditional morphology,
   were used in an integrative approach to resolve the taxonomic structure
   within the geographically widespread species complex of Prostanthera
   lasianthos Labill. We concluded that no dataset has primacy in defining
   segregate taxa, and that a combination of morphological and molecular
   data was required to determine the taxa within. As a result, we amended
   the description of P. lasianthos sens. strict. and recognise the
   following five new segregate species: Prostanthera largiflorens B.J.Conn
   \& K.Proft, P. lasiangustata J.Carrick ex B.J.Conn \& K. Proft, P.

Title = {Effects of host tree size on the species richness and abundance of
   epiphyte assemblages in a Bornean lowland tropical forest},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {This study clarified the effects of host tree size on the numbers of
   epiphyte species and individuals on a tree, based on observation of 122
   species and 2,162 individuals of epiphytes on 430 target trees in a
   Bornean primary lowland dipterocarp forest. We analyzed relationships of
   the diameter at breast height (DBH) of target host trees with the
   probability of epiphyte presence, number of epiphyte species on each
   target tree (species richness), number of epiphyte individuals on each
   target host tree (abundance), and cumulative number of epiphyte species.
   The probability of epiphyte presence was estimated by a generalized
   linear model (GLM) with a logistic distribution to be higher than 50\%
   on trees with DBH >40 cm. A GLM with a quasi-Poisson distribution showed
   that both species richness and epiphyte abundance increased
   exponentially with DBH. The most rapid increase was found for trees with
   DBH >40 cm. Also, about half of all epiphyte species recorded in this
   study were only found on trees with DBH >60 cm. These results suggest
   that in lowland tropical rainforests in the Southeast Asian tropics,
   large trees play an important role in maintaining the species diversity
   of epiphyte assemblages by providing them with habitats. Meanwhile,
   several epiphyte species were found only trees with DBH <= 40 cm,
   suggesting that the small trees also provide essential habitats with
   such epiphyte species. Primary forests with various sizes of trees are
   necessary for conservation of the epiphyte assemblages.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {33-41},
Abstract = {There is a high expectation for forest ecosystems to provide several
   ecosystem services simultaneously. In this study, positive relationships
   between the amount of carbon stock in coarse woody debris (CWD) and the
   diversity of polypore fungi were examined in six primary stands and 19
   secondary stands with different stand ages (12-81 years) of tropical
   rain forests in Malaysia. We recorded the size and number of each of the
   CWD pieces in which at least one fruiting body of 21 target polypore
   species appeared in each plot. The average amount of carbon stock in the
   CWD pieces was estimated to be 48.8 Mg ha(-1 )in primary forests and
   12.3 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forests. The diversity of polypore species
   increased with the amount of carbon stock in CWD when data from primary
   and secondary forest were combined. Among secondary forests, the carbon
   stock of CWD increased with stand age, but diversity of polypore species
   varied greatly among stands of similar ages and the carbon stock of CWD,
   and hence did not significantly increase with stand age or the carbon
   stock of CWD. According to our findings, primary forests are critically
   important for the conservation of biodiversity and carbon stock, and old
   secondary forests with higher carbon stock in CWD have a potential to
   sustain a high level of diversity of polypore fungi.},

Journal = {TROPICS},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Tropical forests are considered as phosphorus (P)-poor ecosystems, where
   microorganisms are suggested to allocate more resources to P acquisition
   compared to carbon (C) and/or nitrogen (N) acquisition. Therefore,
   ratios of activities of acid/alkaline phosphomonoesterase (AP) to
   C-acquiring enzymes such as beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and C and/or
   N-acquiring enzymes such as beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) and
   leucine amino peptidase (LAP) are generally larger in tropical forest
   soils (i.e., BG: AP and (NAG+LAP): AP are smaller). However, those
   ratios were never reported for enzymes in throughfall. In this short
   note, we reported that both BG: AP and (NAG I LAP): AP of throughfall
   samples were smaller in five tropical forests than those in a temperate
   forest, which was consistent with generally-observed patterns in soils.
   This implies that phyllosphere microorganisms may allocate more
   resources to obtain P in P-poor tropical forest canopy, which should be
   considered in future P cycling quantifications in forest ecosystems.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {326-338},
Abstract = {Philotheca sect. Erionema includes 14 species from eastern Australia and
   one from south-western Australia. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis
   of the section, including samples of all species, using sequences of the
   ITS and ETS regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results were broadly
   congruent with a previous analysis based on morphological and flavonoid
   data. The analysis is consistent with the monophyly of the section and
   supports the monophyly of six species represented by multiple samples.
   Philotheca verrucosa (A. Rich.) Paul G. Wilson was resolved as
   paraphyletic with respect to P. freyciana Rozefelds but with poor
   support. Philotheca glasshousiensis, P. myoporoides and P. myoporoides
   subsp. myoporoides were clearly polyphyletic, including separate
   geographic clades and the classification of each of these taxa requires
   revision. In particular, disjunct northern populations of P.
   glasshousiensis probably represent a distinct species, the five
   subspecies of P. myoporoides could be treated as separate species and at
   least two other distinct groups that are currently included under the
   circumscription of subsp. myoporoides could be treated as species. The
   phylogeny revealed deeply divergent, geographically overlapping clades
   in eastern Australia and substantial distances (up to 900 km) between
   sister taxa. We infer that biogeography of the group has been shaped
   largely by vicariant differentiation of taxa.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {431-437},
Abstract = {The major goal of this study was to re-analyse a published molecular
   dataset based on ITS and matK sequences of the genus Ceratophyllum
   (Ceratophyllaceae) within a cladistic framework, operating only with
   rooted trees. The problem is lack of an identifiable suitable outgroup
   to Ceratophyllum. We show different ways to root trees and thus resolve
   the sister group relationships within this genus. We root the trees
   using an all zero outgroup or a combination of exemplar taxa from among
   monocots (Acorus), eudcots (Ranunculus) and Chloranthus. Ceratophyllum
   echinatum was consistently strongly supported as sister to all of the
   remaining taxa of the genus. This observation is congruent with the
   earlier results of Les who noted the uniqueness of C. echinatum in a
   series of comprehensive morphological and biosystematic studies. We,
   here, transfer C. echinatum to a new and presumably monotypic genus
   Fassettia Mavrodiev. The exact taxonomic circumscription of Fassettia
   requires further investigation.},

Abstract = {Macro-morphological data were analysed to assess the distinctiveness and
   revise the taxonomy of 14 species, varieties and tag-named taxa in five
   informal species groups of ebracteate-erect forget-me-nots endemic to
   New Zealand. The following nine species are recognised: Myosotis
   albosericea Hook.f., M. brockiei L.B.Moore \& M.J.A.Simpson, M. capitata
   Hook.f., M. concinna Cheeseman, M. goyenii Petrie, M. laeta Cheeseman,
   M. monroi Cheeseman, M. rakiura L.B.Moore, and M. traversii Hook.f.
   Three species have two allopatric subspecies each in the South Island,
   distinguished by few, minor morphological characters, including Myosotis
   brockiei subsp. brockiei and M. brockiei subsp. dysis Courtney \& Meudt
   subsp. nov., M. goyenii subsp. goyenii and M. goyenii subsp. infima

   comb. et stat. nov. and M. traversii subsp. traversii. Myosotis x
   cinerascens Petrie is hypothesised to be a rare natural hybrid involving
   M. traversii subsp. cantabrica and another species, possibly M.
   colensoi. Several vegetative and floral characteristics can distinguish
   the study taxa from one another and from other ebracteate-erect species.
   The nine species plus M. x cinerascens are included in the taxonomic
   treatment, and the key also includes other recently revised
   ebracteate-erect species.},

Abstract = {In the tropics, the area covered by degraded and fragmented secondary
   forests has expanded following forest fires and intensive land-use. We
   studied a fragmented secondary forest in South Kalimantan Province,
   Indonesia, to gain ecological information and to quantify the effect of
   human activities on accumulated biomass and tree composition. A
   fragmented secondary forest of about 0.5 ha was divided into 27 edge and
   18 inside plots with size of 10 mx10 m and the stand biomass, tree
   composition and human activities were analyzed. Mean aboveground biomass
   (AGB) in edge and inside plots were 63.2 and 71.2 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively and the difference was insignificant (t-test: p 0.1), while
   the Shannon-Wiener index (H') value of the later tended larger than
   former (t-test: p<0.1). Native trees tended to be more in inside plots
   comparing with edge plots, and human planted trees were identified in
   mainly edge plots. There were also large differences in biomass (wood)
   removal by rural people (1.350 and 0.248 Mg ha(-1) year(-1),
   respectively). The characteristics of each type of fragmented secondary
   forest were influenced by the human activity of wood collection:
   small-diameter trees, which should have been successors to the existing
   canopy, were frequently removed.},

Abstract = {An interim hierarchical classification (i.e. biogeographical
   regionalisation or area taxonomy) of the world's terrestrial regions is
   provided, following the work of Morrone published in Australian
   Systematic Botany in 2015. Area names are listed according to the
   International Code of Area Nomenclature so as to synonymise redundant
   names. The interim global terrestrial regionalisation to the subregion
   level recognises 3 kingdoms, 2 subkingdoms, 8 regions, 21 subregions and
   5 transition zones. No new names are proposed for the regions; however,
   Lydekker's Line is renamed Illiger's Line. We note that some regions
   still require area classification at the subregion level, particularly
   the Palearctic, Ethiopian and Oriental regions. Henceforth, the
   following interim global regionalisation may be used as a template for
   further revisions and additions of new areas in the future.},

Title = {Phyllodes and bipinnate leaves of Acacia exhibit contemporary
   continental-scale environmental correlation and evolutionary
   transition-rate heterogeneity},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {595-608},
Abstract = {In Acacia, 90\% of species have drought-tolerant phyllodes as their
   adult foliage, the remaining species have bipinnate leaves. We conducted
   tests for relationships between foliage type and 35 bioclimatic
   variables at the continental scale and found significant correlations of
   both `moisture seasonality' and `radiation in the coldest quarter' with
   foliage type. Bipinnate species have lower species mean values of each
   variable, growing in stable soil moisture and generally darker
   environments (longer nights and lower incident radiation), on average.
   Evolutionary transformations between bipinnate and phyllodinous adult
   foliage exhibit asymmetry across the Acacia phylogeny, with
   transformations from bipinnate leaves to phyllodes occurring times
   faster than the reverse. At least three (and up to seven) transitions
   from phyllode to bipinnate adult foliage were inferred. Foliage type in
   the most recent common ancestor of extant Acacia is unresolved, some
   analyses favour a phyllodinous ancestor, others a bipinnate ancestor.
   Most ancestral nodes inferred as having bipinnate adult foliage had
   median age estimates of less than 5 million years (Ma), half having ages
   between 3 and 1.5 Ma. Acacia lineages with bipinnate adult foliage
   diversified during the Pliocene, perhaps in response to wetter climatic
   conditions experienced by the continental margin during this period.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Monospecific Rhizophora spp. trees have been planted for several decades
   in the Philippines to offset heavy mangrove deforestation resulting
   mainly from aquaculture pond construction. The reforested mangrove
   studies are required for evaluating their ecological roles. We surveyed
   the forest structure, biomass, and net primary production (NPP) at an
   18-year-old R. mucronata plantation site (PL) and a secondary natural
   mangrove site (NM) at Batan Bay Estuary, Philippines. The survey showed
   that PL had a>8,000 ha(-1) tree density, 351.6 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and
   73.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP, exceeding the values at NM (670 ha(-1 )tree
   density, 130.7 Mg ha(-1) biomass, and 22.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) NPP). The
   low biomass quantity in NM was due to the residual effects of a typhoon
   in November 2013; however, the NPP showed a quick recovery which implies
   the disturbance-adapted characteristics of pioneer species such as
   Avicennia marina and Sonneratia alba. At PL, the biomass and NPP were
   large, though it has been known that monospecific Rhizophora spp.
   plantation has been vulnerable to the risk of stand destruction due to
   strong typhoons. We concluded that the A. marina and S. alba, which
   dominated as natural mangrove stand, are suitable for mangrove
   reforestation because it quick recovered even after the typhoon impacts.},

Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {In the southeast Asian lowland dipterocarp forest of Peninsular Malaysia
   (Pasoh Forest Reserve), upper canopy tree species with heterobaric
   leaves show severe midday depression of net assimilation rate (A)
   accelerated by patchy stomatal closure, although it is still unclear
   whether it always happens or not. We added the in situ observations at
   various meteorological conditions over the last decade to evaluate the
   frequency and environmental conditions of patchy stomatal closure in
   Dipterocarpus sublamellatus Foxw., an emergent tree with heterobaric
   leaves through leaf-gas exchange measurements combined with numerical
   simulations and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Our observation
   revealed that on days with moderate leaf temperature (<35 celcius) and

Title = {Further food for thought: higher tropical mountains revisited once again},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {43-57},
Abstract = {D.H. Janzen argued that tropical mountains, for their heights, pose
   greater migration barriers than temperate mountains owing to lower
   temperature seasonality, and consequent greater niche and ecosystem
   specialization. These result in distinct altitudinal zonation under
   hardly varying temperature lapse rates. The Asian Far East alone
   provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis owing to latitudinal
   continuity of evergreen forests from equator to warm temperate zone.
   With data from four mountains, we find Janzen's hypothesis broadly
   correct. The primary and most consistent mediator of forest zonation and
   therefore species' habitat specificity is soil, itself indirectly
   mediated by climate. But declining habitat niche specificity does not
   proceed north along a continuum, instead in a series of latitudinal
   steps initiated by quite sudden habitat changes. Tropical montane
   forests are altitudinally floristically and structurally zoned by
   factors only indirectly mediated by temperature. Equatorial forests
   experience continuously wet climates and a frost line at c.4100 m. North
   of 8 degrees N, temperature and rainfall seasonality increases and
   winter air frosts descend to c.2000 m. Upper montane forest becomes
   truncated, while lower montane forest continues to the frost line which
   remains constant in moist climates. The margin of the wet tropics is
   pushed north to 27 degrees N by the Himalaya. Annual frost at c.2000 m
   here marks a narrow ecotone between tropical lower montane forest and
   warm temperate evergreen lucidophyll forest, a formation unique to east
   Asia. In equably moist South China, the lowland tropical-warm temperate
   ('subtropical') margin returns to the Tropic of Cancer and appears to be
   narrow at all altitudes. The temperate forests exhibit less distinct and
   inconsistent altitudinal zonation, instead manifesting an altitudinal
   floristic and structural continuum mediated by winter frost frequency
   and intensity.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal and geographic variations in the green moisture content and

   models for three bamboo species (Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C.,
   Bambusa maculata Widjaja, and Gigantochloa atter (Hassk) Kurz ex Munro)
   naturally grown in four locations in Lombok Island, Indonesia. The mean
   green moisture contents and basic densities were 74.2\% and 0.69 g
   cm(-3) for B. vulgaris. 78.5 \% and 0.65 g cm(-3) for B. maculata, and
   80.3 \% and 0.65 g cm(-3) for G. atter, respectively. No significant
   differences in green moisture content and basic density were found among
   the species. A significant negative correlation between basic density
   and green moisture content was found in all three species. Based on the
   results of model selections for longitudinal variations, the green
   moisture content decreased with an increase in the culm height in all
   three species, and basic density tended to increase from the base to the
   top of the culm. Relatively large geographical variation was found in
   the green moisture content and basic density of G. atter. although the
   main reasons for variation of these properties were individual culm in
   three species.},

Abstract = {Eremophila R.Br. comprises at least 238 species endemic to Australia,
   with many more having not yet been formally described. Three putative
   new taxa, namely, E. sp. Hamersley Range (K. Walker KW 136), E. sp.
   Calvert Range (A. A. Burbidge 738) and E. sp. Rudall River (P. G. Wilson
   10512), were segregated from a broadly defined E. tietkensii F.Muell. \&
   Tate by J. Hurter at the Western Australian Herbarium in 2012. Both E.
   sp. Hamersley Range and E. sp. Rudall River are listed as being of
   conservation concern in Western Australia, the former occurring in the
   Pilbara region in areas of prospective interest for mining development.
   We sought to determine whether these phrase-named entities should be
   formally described as new species, using multivariate analyses of
   morphometric and molecular data derived from specimens in the Western
   Australia Herbarium. Eremophila sp. Ruda!! River could not be adequately
   separated from E. tietkensii by either morphological or molecular data,
   and is here included within that species. By contrast, E. sp. Hamersley
   Range and E. sp. Calvert Range are clearly morphologically and
   genetically distinct. We thus describe them here as the new species E.
   naaykensii A.L.Curtis \& K.R.Thiele and E. hurteri A.L.Curtis \&
   K.R.Thiele. The recognition of these taxa will help inform their

Abstract = {Spyridium Fenzl is a genus of similar to 45 species endemic to
   south-western and south-eastern Australia. This study provides the most
   comprehensive phylogenies of Spyridium to date, analysing both entire
   chloroplast genomes and the nuclear ribosomal array (185-5.8S-26S).
   There was substantial incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear
   phylogenies, creating phylogenetic uncertainty, but some clear
   relationships and biogeographic patterns could be established. Analyses
   support the monophyly of Spyridium, identifying an early east-west split
   at the base of the nuclear phylogeny and deep divergences of New South
   Wales and Tasmanian endemic clades. We also found evidence of more
   recent dispersal events between eastern and western Australia and
   between Tasmania and the mainland. Eleven taxa were found to be
   monophyletic in the nrDNA phylogeny and two were clearly polyphyletic
   (S. eriocephalum Fenzl and S. phylicoides Reissek). Although the
   polyphyly of S. eriocephalum correlates with the two varieties,
   suggesting distinct taxa, further research is required on S.

Abstract = {The Rubiaceae tribe Psychotrieae sensu lato and its two largest genera,
   Psychotria L. and Palicourea Aubl., have been considered taxonomically
   controversial for a long time. We aimed to identify structural features
   of the ontogeny of the fruits and seeds with taxonomic potential for the
   tribe by using species of these two genera, and Rudgea jasminoides
   (Cham.) Mull.Arg. The samples were obtained from a herbarium and from
   Brazilian state parks, and sectioned by using a rotation microtome. The
   fruits were found to be derived from an inferior ovary, and were
   characterised by a fleshy mesocarp and sclerenchymatic sinuate pyrene.
   The seeds were pachychalazal and arillate. The fruit was classified as a
   pomaceous drupoid nuculanium. The investigation showed the utility of
   some fruit features to discriminate species. Our study also showed that
   ontogenetic features of fruits and seeds are very homogeneous in
   Palicourea and Psychotria, which supports the inclusion of both genera
   in the tribe Psychotrieae.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {477-484},
Abstract = {Nicotiana is found predominantly in the Americas and Australia, but also
   has representatives in Africa and the Pacific Islands. All native
   Australian Nicotiana species belong to section Suaveolentes. The number
   of species in this section is uncertain and subject to revision. An
   example of this uncertainty is the taxonomic status of a South
   Australian Nicotiana accession colloquially termed `Corunna'. Here, we
   report sequences for nuclear and plastid markers for N. sp. Corunna
   (D.E.Symon 17088) and accessions of two other Australian species, N.
   burbidgeae and N. benthamiana. Phylogenetic comparison of these
   sequences with those of other members of Nicotiana places all three taxa
   in N. section Suaveolentes and shows that `Corunna' represents a
   distinct phylogenetic lineage in a well supported clade along with N.
   goodspeedii, N. maritima, N. amplexicaulis and N. suaveolentes. Phenetic

Title = {Stocking density and distribution in relation to vegetation in a

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in a communal grazing system
   provides pastoralists with a range of grazing sites to select for their
   livestock. When fencing spatially constrains herds, there is reduced
   access to ecological heterogeneity, which may have a negative impact on
   livestock and the grazing resource. This study investigated temporal and
   spatial changes in stocking densities and distribution within the six
   major vegetation types of the Leliefontein pastoral area in Namaqualand,
   South Africa. This semi-arid, biodiverse area of about 2000 km(2)
   supports a spatially-constrained mobile pastoral system based on small
   stock production. Over the data period from 1999 to 2006, the location
   of 256 small stock herds, their temporal occupancy and herd size were
   used to determine stocking densities within the daily grazing radius of
   herds. These grazing radii were overlaid using GIS to produce stocking
   density distributions over the landscape. The density and location of
   herds were unevenly distributed when assessed monthly and annually.
   Parts of the study area were consistently overstocked whereas others
   remained ungrazed. We argue that the recommendation of fixed stocking
   rates within this variable environment is inappropriate because forage
   availability and quality fluctuate within and between years and within
   drought cycles. We conclude that development interventions should rather
   focus on reducing stocking densities during and after drought periods.
   This would benefit pastoralists through reduced livestock mortalities
   and the vegetation would recover more quickly from the impacts of
   drought.},

Title = {Northern Australia Climate Program: supporting adaptation in rangeland
   grazing systems through more targeted climate forecasts, improved
   drought information and an innovative extension program},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {87-100},
Abstract = {The Northern Australia Climate Program (NACP) is a fully integrated
   research, development and extension (RDandE) program operating across
   extensive pastoral regions of northern Australia. The NACP aims to
   improve existing climate models and forecast tools, develop new products
   to meet user needs and build the capacity of rangeland producers to
   manage the challenges posed by droughts (or failed wet seasons) and
   climate variability.
   Climate information gaps identified through earlier surveys of graziers
   and communities in rural and remote Australia informed the design of the
   research component of the NACP, which aims to address the low and
   variable accuracy of seasonal climate forecasts in many regions, the
   need for proof of value of forecasts and relevance of existing forecast
   systems and technologies, and perceived lack of effective support from
   climate experts for the use of climate resources and technologies in
   agricultural decision making. The development and extension components
   of the program aim to improve climate literacy and the use of climate
   information. Building on the research program, they deliver a climate
   service that provides local extension and technical support, with a
   focus on building trust in climate information through locally sourced,
   industry connected NACP trained and supported extension advisers called
   Climate Mates. Two-way information flow between decision makers and
   researchers, facilitated by the Climate Mates, ensures that forecasts
   and decision- and discussion-support tools developed through the program
   are regionally relevant and targeted to the needs of end users.
   Monitoring and evaluation of the program indicates that this approach is
   contributing to positive outcomes in terms of awareness and knowledge of
   climate forecasting and products, and their adoption and use in decision
   making (i.e. practice change). In the longer term, the Climate Mates
   have potential for enduring impact beyond the program, leaving a
   knowledgeable and trusted climate resource across regional northern
   Australia.},

Title = {Missing shots: has the possibility of shooting wolves been lacking for
   20 years in France's livestock protection measures?},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {401-413},
Abstract = {Wolves were exterminated in France in the late 19th and early 20th
   centuries. Therefore, livestock breeders and herders were unprepared
   when wolves arrived from Italy in 1993, the year after France committed
   to the European Union (EU) to protect wolves. Today, similar to 580
   wolves, whose numbers are growing exponentially, are present in over
   one-third of France. During the last 10 years, livestock deaths from
   wolves have grown linearly from 3215 in 2009 to 12 451 in 2019, despite
   France implementing extensive damage protection measures since 2004,
   including reinforced human presence, livestock guard dogs, secured
   pasture fencing and electrified night pens. The failure to prevent
   damage is clear. Wolves enter mosaic landscapes where grazing livestock
   are abundant and easy prey. Wolves are intelligent and opportunistic. As
   a strictly protected species, it seems they no longer associate
   livestock with humans and humans with danger. Half of the successful
   attacks now occur during the day, notwithstanding the presence of dogs
   and humans. Considering the high costs of unsatisfactory protection,
   France recently modified its wolf management policy. In addition to
   non-lethal means of protection, breeders that have suffered several
   attacks by wolves are now permitted, by derogation to the law, to
   defensively shoot wolves. Based upon evidence from other countries, we
   suggest re-establishing a reciprocal relationship with wolves. Breeders
   and herders should be allowed to shoot wolves to defend their herds
   against wolf attacks, not after several successful predation events.
   Defence shooting would also upgrade the efficiency of non-lethal means,
   as warning signals for wolves to respect. Rather than passive
   coexistence, we need to embrace a dynamic and ever-evolving process of
   coadaptation between humans and wolves, relying on the adaptive
   capacities of both.},

Title = {Designing a payment for ecosystem services scheme, the practical

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {387-400},
Abstract = {Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are an innovative solution
   to reduce environmental degradation. However, most existing experience
   with PES implementation is related to the agricultural, forestry and
   marine sectors, and the application of PES in rangelands is limited.
   Although a PES could be an option to reduce rangeland degradation, there
   is no specific framework or experience for its implementation in Iran.
   Financial resources for funding the scheme are important, although
   funding by itself is not sufficient, and details are important in
   designing a successful PES system. This study aimed to design and
   introduce the framework of a PES scheme based on field surveys,
   information collection and analysis emphasising soil and water
   conservation functions, and identification and discussion of the
   challenges and obstacles facing implementation of the designed
   framework. After delineating the vegetation types on rangeland
   ecosystems, their current ecological condition was considered the
   baseline, and minimum and maximum payments were considered, equal to the
   livestock reduction compensation and the total value of the increased
   ecosystem services as a result of PES implementation respectively.
   Results suggest designing the practical steps of PES schemes is
   complicated despite the concept's simplicity, and a lack of clear
   property rights can increase complexity and multiply the costs.
   Considering different socioeconomic and ecological contexts, and the
   detailed framework in all the processes of identification and
   investigation, development, pilot testing, and project operation can
   increase the effectiveness of PES schemes. Our findings appear useful
   for policy-making to balance utilisation pressure in natural areas, not
   only in Iran, but also in many arid and semiarid rangelands elsewhere.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {435-445},
Abstract = {China is about to embark on a new round of grassland policies as part of
   its 14th Five-Year-Plan. Although current grassland policies have
   generally been perceived positively in arresting widespread grassland
   degradation, concerns have arisen that the current policies may not be
   effective in achieving the desired reduction in livestock numbers.
   Furthermore, there are concerns the incentive-based payments that are
   part of these policy programs may not reflect herder opportunity costs
   or the marginal environmental benefits of the program, with associated
   issues of herder satisfaction and compliance. Changes to current policy
   settings are being considered in response to these concerns. This paper
   reports on an interdisciplinary and ex-ante analysis of alternative
   policy settings affecting grazing and livestock management in terms of
   their environmental impacts, net social benefits and other impacts. The
   analysis finds that a bundle of instruments involving both positive and
   negative herder incentives is needed if desired stocking rates are to be
   achieved. The impact on herder incomes, both positive and negative
   depending on the grassland biome, along with transaction costs of
   implementing the policies, have the most influence on net social
   benefits.},

Title = {Sequence capture data support the taxonomy of Pogonolepis (Asteraceae:

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Variation in breeding systems between species of the same taxonomic
   group complicates the consistent application of species concepts, and
   perhaps even the logically consistent circumscription of species.
   Several genera of arid-zone ephemerals in the Angianthus clade
   (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae: Gnaphaliinae) contain both outcrossing and
   non-outcrossing species. The latter are recognised by producing an order
   of magnitude fewer pollen grains per anther and an often reduced number
   of corolla lobes, and they are frequently more widespread than are the
   former. In its current taxonomy, the genus Pogonolepis comprises an
   otherwise morphologically indistinguishable pair of one outcrossing and
   one non-outcrossing species. I generated sequence capture data to test
   the genetic segregation of P. stricta and P. muelleriana and the utility
   of sequence capture data for species circumscription and diagnostics.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed the two species to form two specimen
   clades, supporting the current taxonomy. Contrary to expectations,

Title = {Taxonomic revision of the southern hemisphere pygmy forget-me-not group
   (Myosotis; Boraginaceae) based on morphological, population genetic and
   climate-edaphic niche modelling data},

Abstract = {A taxonomic revision of the southern hemisphere pygmy forget-me-not
   group (Myosotis L.; Boraginaceae) is presented here. Climate-edaphic
   niches are modelled and compared for five species in the pygmy group,
   namely, M. antarctica Hook.f., M. brevis de Lange \& Barkla, M. drucei
   (L.B.Moore) de Lange \& Barkla, M. pygmaea Colenso and M. glauca
   (G.Simpson \& J.S.Thomson) de Lange \& Barkla, and one unnamed putative
   taxon, M. ``Volcanic Plateau{''}. In this case, niche-modelling data
   mostly do not aid species delimitation, but morphological and genetic
   data provide evidence for recognising the following three species within
   the group: M. brevis and M. glauca (both endemic to New Zealand), and an
   enlarged M. antarctica (native to New Zealand, Campbell Island and
   Chile). Myosotis antarctica is here circumscribed to include M.
   antarctica sens. strict., M. drucei and M. pygmaea. The following two
   allopatric subspecies of M. antarctica are recognised on the basis of
   minor morphological differences: subsp. antarctica (formerly M.
   antarctica from Campbell Island and Chile, M. drucei and M. ``Volcanic
   Plateau{''}) and subsp. traillii Kirk (formerly known by New Zealand
   botanists as M. pygmaea Colenso, an illegitimate name). For all three
   species, which are considered Threatened or At Risk, most of their
   genetic variation is partitioned between rather than within populations,
   meaning that conserving as many populations as possible should be the
   priority to minimise risk of extinction.},

Title = {Can dingoes increase graziers' profits and help maintain Australia's
   rangelands?},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {129-135},
Abstract = {Australia's largest land carnivore, the dingo, has been targeted by
   control programs in many agricultural landscapes since European
   settlement because of the judgement that dingoes cause costs to
   producers through the killing of livestock. As Australian pastoralists,
   we challenge the assumption that dingoes will only cause costs to
   producers. Based on our personal experiences and from research, we
   provide an alternative view, namely that in certain circumstances, there
   are major economic and ecological benefits of maintaining dingoes in
   grazing landscapes by controlling the unmanaged grazing pressure. As
   cattle producers, we have obtained significant financial gains for our
   family businesses, and environmental benefits on our properties by
   maintaining dingoes. Dingoes greatly reduce high-density populations of
   larger kangaroo species and some feral animals, especially goats. Such
   unmanaged grazing is persistently identified as a major factor in
   landscape degradation across large areas of Australian rangelands. The
   Australian pastoral industry as a whole, and the government departments
   that support it, need to evaluate, consider and discuss the economic and
   ecological benefits as well as the costs of maintaining dingoes in
   Australian pastoral landscapes.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-128},
Abstract = {Beef producers in the mulga lands of south-western Queensland and
   north-western New South Wales, Australia, face the challenges of
   inherently low productivity and profitability, exacerbated by widespread
   pasture degradation and high climate and market variability. Our
   objective was to use the farm-management economics framework to assess
   the ability of management strategies and investment options to improve
   profitability and build the overall resilience of beef cattle properties
   in the mulga lands. Options were assessed for a hypothetical,
   representative beef cattle property in south-western Queensland (20 000
   ha; initial stocking rate 600 adult equivalents). Firstly, strategies
   were assessed for their ability to improve profitability when operated
   as a beef business. Secondly, two alternative investment options were
   assessed: (1) conversion to rangeland meat goat production; and (2)
   conversion to carbon farming through carbon sequestration. Herd and
   economic modelling software were used to conduct property-level, partial
   discounted cash-flow budgets to assess each strategy over a 30-year
   investment period. Results indicated very limited potential to improve
   the profitability and resilience of an existing beef cattle enterprise
   in the mulga lands. However, full or partial conversion to rangeland
   meat goat production or carbon farming improved property-level returns
   and viability.},

Title = {Loss of grassland ecosystem service values based on potential vegetation
   in China},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {363-375},
Abstract = {Grassland resources in China have diverse categories and span extensive
   areas. Existing studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services
   in China at different scales, but there are few reports on the potential
   loss of grassland ecosystem services in China. On the basis of the
   class-level compatibility of the two existing grassland classification
   systems, this study separately estimated the ecosystem service valves
   (ESVs) of Chinese potential grassland ecosystems (Comprehensive
   Sequential Classification System, CSCS) and existing grassland
   ecosystems (Vegetation Habitatology Classification System, VHCS). In
   addition, we also calculated the loss of ESVs between the two grassland
   classification systems and further analysed the reasons for the loss.
   The results are as follows: (1) the total amount of ESVs provided by the
   existing grassland in China was 64 929.87 x 10(8) Ren Min Bi (RMB) per
   year, in which lowland meadow and alpine meadow provide higher ESVs than
   the other 16 grassland classes; (2) the total ESV of Chinese potential
   grasslands was 83 632.88 x 10(8) RMB per year, of which IE29 (frigid
   temperate humid tundra, alpine meadow) and IF36 (frigid perhumid rain
   tundra, alpine meadow) contributed most to the total ESV (16.9\%); (3)
   the ESVs of grassland in China decreased by 18 703.01 x 10(8) RMB per
   year compared with the potential value; the ESV loss mainly occurred in
   areas where the original grassland decreased and the secondary grassland
   increased; and (4) anthropogenic disturbances such as grazing, felling
   and indiscriminate cultivation and climate change are the main reasons
   for loss of ESV owing to grassland degradation.},

Title = {An online system for calculating and delivering long-term carrying

   modelling and outputs},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {159-172},
Abstract = {A combination of field data and models have been used to estimate
   long-term carrying capacity (LTCC) of domestic livestock in Queensland
   grazing lands. These methods have been synthesised and coupled with
   recent developments in science and information technology to provide a
   fully-automated approach of modelling LTCC through the FORAGE online
   system. In this study, the GRASP model was used to simulate pasture
   growth with parameter sets and safe pasture utilisation rates defined
   for 225 land types across Queensland. Distance to water points was used
   to assess the accessibility of pastures to livestock. Spatial analysis
   classified the property into unique areas based on paddock, land type
   and distance to water points, which estimated pasture growth, pasture
   utilisation and accessibility at a sub-paddock scale. Thirteen foliage
   projective cover (FPC) classes were used in modelling the pasture system
   to deal with the non-linear relationship between tree and grass
   interactions. As `proof of concept', remotely-sensed individual-date
   green ground cover data were used to optimise the GRASP model parameters
   to improve the model performance, and a Monte Carlo analysis provided
   uncertainty estimates for model outcomes. The framework provides an
   efficient and standardised method for estimating LTCC. To test the
   system, LTCCs from 43 `benchmark' properties were compared with
   simulated LTCCs, and 65\% of the modelled LTCCs were within +/- 25\% of
   the benchmark LTCCs. Due to uncertainties in model inputs at the
   property scale and in model simulation, the modelled LTCC should be used
   as a starting point for further refinement of actual property LTCC.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {425-433},
Abstract = {One key tool to manage fragile ecosystems in arid lands is knowledge of
   land degradation. For this purpose, field-based soil and vegetation
   characteristics were related to remote sensing information extracted
   from Landsat OLI moving standard deviation index (MSDI), normalised
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index
   (SAVI) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) in degraded
   (watering points and livestock camps) and reference sites of arid
   rangelands of Iran. Values of spectral indices along grazing gradients
   at a distance of 50-1500 m from the centre of degradation were also
   extracted and analysed. Statistical analysis (t-test and ordination
   analysis) shows that MSDI is a sensitive index of landscape
   heterogeneity and, unlike other indices, exhibits a significant
   difference between degraded and reference sites. MSDI was sensitive to
   grazing gradients around watering points and livestock camps, and
   declined with increasing distance from these areas, although this varied
   between different sites due to grazing intensity and characteristics of
   soil and vegetation cover. Soil analysis showed that the amount of
   organic carbon, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter
   (GMD) and soil stability indicator (SSI) at reference sites were
   significantly higher than those at degraded areas. Ordination analysis
   confirmed the results of t-test regarding the high potential capability
   of MSDI in separating degraded areas. This simple and practical index
   can be used to determine ecological thresholds and investigating
   rangeland condition in arid ecosystems.},

Title = {Predicted effects of simulated ambient warming and moisture on forage

Abstract = {Sustainable forage and livestock production in grazed grasslands are
   threatened by global climatic change. In this study, we examined how
   forage quality at the species and community levels in Mongolian drylands
   might be affected by warming and additional moisture. Four different
   treatments, a control, open-top chambers (OTCs) only, OTCs with heaters,
   and OTCs with additional watering, were set up in the field, and air and
   soil temperature and soil moisture were monitored. A vegetation survey
   was conducted and plants were harvested during summer, 1 and 2 years
   after experimental treatments were established. The harvested plant
   samples were separated into a dominant species (Stipa) or `other
   species', and analysed to determine acid detergent fibre (ADF) and in
   vitro dry-matter digestibility (IVDMD). ADF was measured with the
   detergent method and the digestibility with the pepsin-cellulase assay.
   Overall, the warming treatments alone (OTC and OTC with heater)
   increased ADF 10\% and 5\% more than did the control at the species and
   community levels respectively, and decreased digestibility 12\% and 11\%
   below the control at the community level. Changes in plant nutritional
   value may have occurred as a result of changes in plant structure for
   some or all the plant species monitored, and an indirect effect of the
   shift in botanical species composition owing to warming. Unlike moist
   grassland, grass nutrition in arid grasslands was sensitive to
   treatments associated with the predicted effects of global warming as
   the results of changes in plant nutrition. It is therefore highly
   possible that Mongolian livestock production will be negatively affected
   as a result of ongoing global warming.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {137-147},
Abstract = {Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) of rangeland ecosystems is
   driven by interactions among multiple environmental factors. This study
   aimed to model the combined effects of precipitation, elevation, and
   soil conditions on ANPP variation along an elevation gradient. Ground
   surveys and vegetation sampling were conducted in 2016 through 26
   sampling sites along two elevation profiles in the rangelands of
   Moghan-Sabalan, Ardabil Province, Iran. At each sampling site, the ANPP
   of each plant functional type (PFT; grasses, forbs, and shrubs) was
   measured, and soil samples were taken from 0-15 to 15-30 cm depth.
   Regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to
   investigate the factors affecting both total and PFT ANPP. Soil
   variables were the best predictors of grass (R-2 = 0.51), forb (R-2 =
   0.61), shrub (R-2 = 0.71), and total (R-2 = 0.76) ANPP. The SEM
   interpretation suggested that precipitation is the most important direct
   driver of ANPP with R-2 values of 0.20 (Total), 0.30 (Shrubs), 0.26
   (Grasses), and 0.10 (Forbs). Whereas soil factors were good predictors
   in the regression models, the SEM models demonstrated that soil factors
   were generally unimportant compared with climate, likely owing to the
   close links between soil-forming factors and climate. The results make
   it possible to estimate annual ANPP combined with climate forecasts and
   leads to more accurate estimates of future grazing capacity by policy
   makers and stakeholders.},

Title = {An online system for calculating and delivering long-term carrying
   capacity information for Queensland grazing properties. Part 1:
   background and development},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {143-157},
Abstract = {This paper (Part 1) describes the development of a new online system
   that estimates long-term carrying capacity (LTCC) for grazing properties
   across Queensland, Australia. High year-to-year and multi-year rainfall
   variability is a dominating feature of the climate of Queensland's
   grazing lands, and poses major challenges for extensive livestock
   production. The use of LTCC is one approach used by graziers to reduce
   the impact of rainfall variability on land condition and financial
   performance. Over the past 30 years, scientists, graziers and their
   advisors have developed a simple approach to calculating LTCC ((average
   annual pasture growth x safe pasture utilisation) divided by annual
   animal intake). This approach has been successful at a property scale
   (regional south-west Queensland) and in a wider application through
   Grazing Land Management (GLM) regional workshops. We have built on these
   experiences to develop an online system (as described in detail in Part
   2; Zhang et al. 2021; this issue) that incorporates the simple LTCC
   approach with advances in technology and grazing science to provide LTCC
   information for Queensland grazing properties. Features of the LTCC
   system are: (1) assimilation of spatial datasets (cadastral data,
   grazing land types, climate data, remotely-sensed woody vegetation
   cover); (2) a pasture growth simulation model; (3) land type parameter
   sets of biophysical attributes; and (4) estimates of safe pasture
   utilisation. The `FORAGE LTCC report' is a major product of the system,
   describing individual property information that allows detailed analysis
   and explanation of the components of the LTCC calculation by land type
   and land condition. The online system rapidly analyses property spatial
   data and calculates paddock/property LTCC information. For the 10 months
   between November 2020 and August 2021, over 4000 grazing property
   reports have been requested in Queensland, and has proven to be a sound
   basis for `discussion support' with grazier managers and their advisors.},

   Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {109-119},
Abstract = {Since 1964, maps showing areas of drought declaration in Queensland,
   Australia were created or updated as drought declarations changed. Prior
   to 1964, drought declarations were based on railway lines rather than
   specific areas. By using a railway distance buffer, drought declaration
   areas based on local government areas could be mapped. A literature
   review of the history of Queensland drought declarations, enabled
   mapping of the extent and duration of drought declarations for the
   period 1936-1964. Analysis of the changes in these areas enabled the
   duration of each drought episode to be determined. These data and
   information were then combined with the mapped drought declarations
   areas (1964-2020) to enable an assessment of drought area and duration
   in Queensland since 1936. There were 13 drought episodes of differing
   durations. Calculating the area percentage of Queensland that was
   drought declared from 1936 to the present (2020) identified an
   increasing duration of drought declaration. This increase appears to be
   due to the changes in the administration process to remove a drought
   declaration area (revocation) which have occurred since 1982.},

Title = {Artificial shade shelters mitigate harsh microclimate conditions and
   enhance growth in tropical tree seedlings planted in degraded land},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {121-132},
Abstract = {We evaluate the efficacy of artificial shade shelters in promoting
   seedling growth and ecophysiological traits in degraded tropical forest
   land. Seedlings of Dyera costulata were planted in an open control plot
   and two open-top shade shelters (2 and 3 m in height). Leaf traits,
   including nitrogen content, the ratio of variable to maximum
   fluorescence (Fv/Fm), and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were assessed
   in the nursery prior to planting, and again at 2, 7, 12, and 16 months
   after planting. Seedling height, diameter, biomass, and leaf number were
   also assessed. Shade shelters reduced light intensity to approximately
   70 \% and maximum temperature by up to 3.1 degrees C. Minimum daily air
   humidity was up to 12 \% higher in the shelters relative to the open
   control. Seedling growth was better under both shelters relative to the
   open control, but particularly for the 2 m shelter. Seedlings planted in
   the open lost roughly half their leaves immediately after planting due
   to environmental stress, whereas leaves were retained by seedlings under
   the shelters. A decrease in the Fv/Fm ratio was observed in the open
   control both 2 and 7 months after planting, indicating photoinhibition.
   The maximum photosynthetic rate decreased in all conditions immediately
   after planting, but seedlings under the shelters recovered faster,
   especially in the 2 m shelter. Decreases in leaf number and
   photosynthetic capability in the initial stages following planting may
   limit seedling growth in open conditions. The improved growth and
   ecophysiological parameters under the shelters persisted for up to 16
   months after planting, indicating that shelters may be valuable tools
   for reforestation and rehabilitation in degraded tropical forests.},

Title = {The impact of tree removal on standing grass biomass, seedling
   establishment and growth of woody species},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-32},
Abstract = {The removal of trees in rangelands can create gaps and lead to increased
   grass production that could suppress subsequent tree seedling
   establishment and growth. However, gaps can also enhance the growth of
   remaining trees. We conducted a field experiment at two savanna sites
   with different soil texture and woody species. We used 24 plots at each
   site to determine the effect of tree-removal intensities (0\%, 10\%,
   20\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%) on grass production, tree-seedling
   establishment and growth, and growth of the remaining large trees. Site
   I was on previously cultivated severely-eroded clay-dominated soils,
   encroached by a monospecific stand of Vachellia tortilis. Site 2 had
   never been cultivated, and was on sandy soils with several woody
   species. At Site 1, 75 and 100\% tree removal significantly reduced
   standing grass biomass towards the end of the first growing season, with
   no differences towards the end of the second season. At Site 2, tree
   removal significantly increased standing grass biomass. There was no
   significant effect of tree removal on tree seedling establishment at
   Site 1, but at Site 2 tree removal had a significantly negative effect
   on overall tree seedling establishment. At both sites, there were no
   significant differences in tree seedling growth. Moderate (50\%) to high
   (75\%) removal of trees had a positive effect on the growth of remaining
   large trees at both study sites. We found that tree seedling
   establishment could be affected by the level of grass biomass following
   tree removal, but other factors including soil erosion are also
   important considerations. Reduced tree competition facilitates growth of
   remaining large trees. An implication of these findings is that,
   regardless of the substantial costs of woody plant control, the recovery
   of key ecosystem services such as an increased forage production may not
   be realised. However, we recognise that this may be system-specific.},

Abstract = {Across its entire range in Australia's western and southern rangelands,
   Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum {[}R.Br.] A.DC.) is on a path
   towards `extinction in the wild'-the International Union for the
   Conservation of Nature's penultimate category of conservation risk.
   Sandalwood populations have substantially diminished or become locally
   extinct, predominantly a consequence of land clearing for agriculture,
   introduced grazers, disruption of key ecological processes (e.g. seed
   dispersal, fire regimes) and 175 years of intensive commercial
   exploitation for its fragrant, high value timber. The status of the
   world's last wild-harvested species of sandalwood is significant to both
   conservation and rangeland management, and the implementation of a
   science-based sustainable yield approach to management of this species
   is vital. By highlighting the scale and precipitous rate of decline and
   identifying key drivers affecting mortality and recruitment, this review
   outlines the conservation and restoration needs of the species in situ
   to conserve remaining wild populations, and the need to transition to
   science-based resource management actions such as farm-based plantation
   production.},

Title = {Can extension programs improve grazing management in rangelands: a case
   study in Australia's Great Barrier Reef catchments},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {447-459},
Abstract = {A key challenge in reducing sediment moving from grazing lands into the
   Great Barrier Reef in Australia is to encourage beef cattle producers to
   improve management practices. Excessive grazing pressures cause land
   degradation, leading to both increased sediment runoff and lower future
   profits. Although higher grazing rates may be possible (and profitable)
   in better seasons, slow rates of adjustment to poorer seasons can lead
   to overgrazing and negative impacts on land condition. For policymakers
   the challenge is to find mechanisms that encourage or signal producers
   to be more precise in their management and avoid overstocking. Some of
   the most common options include extension programs, grant programs that
   use financial incentives, and regulation.
   In this paper we outline a conceptual framework that shows why extension
   may be a more powerful driver of management change than incentive
   programs, and then test this through an evaluation of a case study
   program conducted with beef cattle producers in catchments of the Great
   Barrier Reef, Australia. The pathway involving landholders to implement
   management change was through improved efficiency and productivity, as
   these are the issues that drive ongoing participation in broader
   environmental programs.
   The results present multiple lines of evidence to infer positive
   outcomes of an extension program in terms of changed management
   practices, which may be expected to generate improved productivity and
   better water quality outcomes. These can be grouped into three key
   areas. First, outcomes show positive improvement relative to the Grazing
   Water Quality Risk framework for the Great Barrier Reef catchments,
   which is designed to assess the links between land management and water
   quality. This indicates that resource condition is likely to improve and
   sediment emissions should be reduced over time. A second outcome is
   increased landholder engagement and improved understanding of their
   business and engagement in future programs, which should underpin
   ongoing adoption. A third outcome is improved management of risk and
   developing the skills to do this through data collection and monitoring,
   which should improve management responses in drought years.},

Title = {An objective prioritisation method for agriculture RD\&E},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {149-158},
Abstract = {We aimed to develop and test a relatively objective method for rapidly
   and accurately assessing the priority for research of interventions
   tendered as potential solutions to a prevailing problem in agriculture.
   In this test, our method aimed to direct research of evidenced-based
   strategies to ameliorate consistently high rates of foetal and calf loss
   experienced in northern Australia's beef herd. Detailed reviews of
   factors affecting foetal and calf loss and potential solutions were
   conducted. A simple economic analysis, based on rating management
   interventions for their impact on earnings before interest and tax, was
   then developed to enable rapid simultaneous business-impact comparison
   of multiple options. If the outcome value for an option is negative, it
   suggests that the option is less profitable than is prevailing practice,
   if approximately zero, it suggests that the option is very marginal, and
   more positive values suggest a higher potential benefit. The values
   obtained were further analysed by rating for incidence and
   researchability to derive research priority. This sequence of activities
   was conducted by peers representing a broad spectrum of beef business
   (managing an estimated 0.4 million cattle), science and agribusiness
   representatives from across northern Australia. A sensitivity analysis
   demonstrated that the method was robust in ranking both business impact
   and research priority. Ten foetal and calf-loss minimisation
   interventions were rated by producer and agribusiness representatives
   and the project team as a high priority for business. Four of these were
   excluded because of low incidence or low researchability, leaving six
   rated as having highest priority for research. Informal feedback from
   many participants indicated high satisfaction with the proposed method.
   The conclusion was that this method, with suggested variations,
   successfully discriminated priority for a large range of potential
   interventions for calf loss research, development and extension (RD\&E).
   The method described could readily supplant commonly used more
   subjective methods and be used to assess priority for RD\&E of other
   issues for multiple agricultural commodities, as well as simply for
   rapid assessment of management options within a production enterprise.},

Title = {Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of understorey biomass in
   semi-arid woodlands of south-eastern Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-59},
Abstract = {When managing grazing pressure for conservation, understanding forage
   dynamics is essential. In south-eastern Australia, ongoing grazing is
   inhibiting regeneration in several semi-arid woodland communities.
   Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest, 1817)) have
   been identified as a key component of total grazing pressure. They are
   thought to switch from grass to lower-quality browse, including tree
   seedlings, when grass biomass falls below 400 kg ha(-1). One static
   threshold may not adequately capture the spatial and temporal hazard
   associated with kangaroo grazing, and this study aimed to explore how
   grassy biomass varies across a case-study landscape. Understorey biomass
   and species composition data were collected in the field on seven
   occasions between December 2016 and May 2019. We used Generalised Linear
   Mixed Models (GLMMs) to describe the influence of environmental and
   herbivory variables on total (live and dead) understorey, live
   understorey, and grass (live and dead) biomass. Canopy cover showed the
   strongest influence on understorey biomass, with more biomass found in
   open sites than in woodland. Understorey biomass levels were lowest in
   summer and autumn. Grass biomass, in particular, fell below the 400 kg
   ha(-1) forage-switch threshold in wooded areas during this time. We
   anticipate that an increased understanding of understorey biomass
   dynamics will inform managers as to when and where to focus management
   efforts to promote regeneration and sustained recovery of these
   semi-arid woodlands. Results of this study suggest that conducting
   management efforts before the summer/autumn decline in understorey
   biomass, particularly in woodlands, is critical in reducing the browsing
   risk to seedlings.},

Title = {Microbial nutrient limitation in tropical forest soils determined using
   the V-T model contradicts the traditional view that C is the major
   limiting element},
Journal = {TROPICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {59-63},
Abstract = {Traditionally, microbial activity in tropical forest soils has been
   thought to be limited predominantly by carbon (C) availability,
   prompting investigations of whether phosphorus (P) is a stronger
   limiting factor (next to C) than other nutrients. However, a recently
   developed enzyme vector model has sometimes shown that P or nitrogen
   (N), but not C, is the predominant limiting factor, likely due to biased
   C vs. N vs. P limitation thresholds. In the latest update of this
   approach (the V-T model) this problem was addressed by revising the
   threshold, or balance point, that represents the enzymatic ratio at
   which microbial metabolism is not limited by nutrients. However, it
   remains unclear whether results obtained using the V-T model are
   consistent with the traditional view that C is the predominant limiting
   element for soil microbial activity. In this short note, I analyzed the
   microbial resource limitations of tropical forest soils using the V-T
   model approach based on previously published global data, and discussed
   the consistency of the results with the traditional view. The V-T model
   results showed that up to 78 \% of the data indicated that P, and not C,
   was the limiting element, contradicting the traditional view. This
   finding may have been the result of a bias in the balance point toward C
   limitation (i.e., the balance point, or threshold, used for determining
   microbial nutrient limitation is under C-limited condition, rather than
   under no nutrient limitation), resulting in underestimation of C
   limitation. The present study suggest that the V-T model requires
   further improvement; however, the traditional view of C limitation of
   soil microbial activity is also poorly supported, and further direct
   observation is needed.},

Abstract = {A new Rafflesia population was found in Naha Jaley, Sarawak. in 2012.
   This study aimed to identify this Rafflesia species and investigate its
   bud growth. First, we described the flower characteristics and compared
   them with Rafflesia keithii and R. tucm-mudae, which are candidate
   species for the flower. Also, we investigated the phylogenetic position
   of this Refflesia within Rafflesiaceae using DNA analysis. To estimate
   bud growth curve, we observed bud development from April 2013 to
   November 2013 in the field. Based on morphological comparisons and
   phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed the newly discovered population of
   the Rafflesia at Naha Jaley was R. turn-mudae, which is the new locality
   of the species at the most Eastern side of the known distribution for
   this species. The results indicated that absolute growth rate was
   greater in larger buds. We also estimated that it took a year to bloom
   from the initial bud stage. The mortality in one of our sites was very
   high, with more than 80 \% of buds dead prior to flower opening. This
   flower would be vulnerable to extinction due to their extraordinary
   characteristics and anthropogenetic effects. Finally. we discussed how
   Rafflesia populations in Naha Jaley can be conserved both in-situ and
   ex-situ.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {In the mountainous areas of northern Thailand, a tea agroforestry system
   referred to as the ``miang tea garden{''} has been maintained by
   smallholders for more than a hundred years. To discuss the ecological
   advantages of the miang tea garden system, we determined the spatial
   distribution patterns of these gardens and the relationship between
   shade trees and tea trees, emphasizing their aboveground biomass. We
   developed an allometric model for estimating the aboveground biomass of
   the stool-shaped tea trees. The area utilized for tea tree cultivation
   was approximately 72 \% of the total study area, and the remaining 28 \%
   was classified as forest patches or abandoned gardens. In miang tea
   gardens, trees other than tea trees were used by farmers to moderate the
   amount of sunlight reaching the tea leaves. Additionally, these trees
   ensured an alternative source of income for the farmers. However, we
   suggest that the canopy openness should be maintained at more than 25 \%
   to prevent tea leaf growth inhibition. The carbon content in the miang
   tea garden system was 45.51 +/- 21.68 Mg C ha(-1), considerably higher
   than that in other types of upland agriculture. The miang tea garden
   could represent an efficient land-use system supporting sustainable
   economic activities in areas with geographical limitations for the
   cultivation of other crops.},

Abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important, but research on SOC in Mexican
   semi-arid grasslands is limited. The objective of this research was to
   estimate SOC and develop an ecological model to predict soil carbon
   stocks (SCS) in the semi-arid grasslands of northern Mexico. Sites with
   different plant cover were selected along the Central Valleys region,
   and soil samples collected at two microsites (bare soil and beneath
   grass) at two depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm) and analysed for SOC. Plant
   cover, precipitation, temperature, soil texture and elevation were
   included as predictor variables to create a SCS prediction model through
   correlation and regression analyses. SOC varied from 0.465\% +/- 0.04
   (mean +/- s.e.m.) in low plant cover-sandy loam soil-low rainfall
   grasslands to 2.77\% +/- 0.29 in high plant cover-clay loam soil-high
   rainfall grasslands. The SOC was higher under grass than bare soil at
   all sites, while most sites showed similar SOC across soil depth. The
   prediction model integrated plant cover, mean annual precipitation,
   elevation and soil sand content (P < 0.0001) as explanatory variables,
   and reasonably predicted SCS (R-2 = 0.798) in semi-arid grasslands of
   northern Mexico. Our model can be used in grasslands with similar
   vegetation, climate and soil in northern Mexico, although extrapolation
   requires caution since further validation at different sites is
   required.},

Title = {Queensland's multi-year Wet and Dry periods: implications for grazing
   enterprises and pasture resources},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {121-142},
Abstract = {Year-to-year variability in rainfall has long been recognised as a major
   issue in managing livestock enterprises across Australia's grazing
   lands. Extension products documenting rainfall variability have been
   developed over the last 30 years and have been keenly sought by
   producers and their advisors. This paper describes multi-year rainfall
   variability from 1889 to 2020 and provides the basis for classifying the
   131 years of rainfall into 18 discrete Wet (7), Average (2) and Dry (9)
   periods as presented in the `Queensland's Extended Wet and Dry Periods'
   poster. The classification was consistent with: analysis of fluctuations
   and trends in the long-term time series of reported livestock numbers;
   drought declarations for government assistance; and documented periods
   of pasture resource degradation and recovery. Rainfall during the nine
   Wet and Average periods was +18\% above the long-term average annual
   rainfall (LTAAR), in contrast to the Dry periods with -17\% below LTAAR.
   Wet periods (including Average) were on average 7 years in duration,
   ranging from 5 to 9 years. Dry periods were on average 8 years in
   duration and ranged from 5 to 13 years. Detailed analysis of the effects
   of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon indicated that:
   (a) the Wet/Dry periods were dominated by different frequencies and
   amounts of rainfall in La Nina/El Nino years; (b) rainfall in ENSO
   neutral years was generally above and below average rainfall for the Wet
   or Dry periods respectively; (c) the frequency of ENSO year-types was
   less important than the overall rainfall surplus (or deficit) in La Nina
   (or El Nino) years within the Wet (or Dry) periods respectively; and (d)
   the timing of Wet and Dry periods was correlated with indices of
   quasi-decadal and inter-decadal variability in components (sea surface
   temperatures and atmospheric pressures) of the global climate system.
   Climatic risk assessment systems for grazing management at multi-year
   timescales are yet to be developed.},

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Potential natural vegetation (PNV), the final successional stage of
   vegetation, plays a key role in ecological restoration, the design of
   nature reserves, and development of agriculture and livestock
   production. Meteorological data from historical and current periods
   including the last inter-glacial (LIG), last glacial maximum (LGM), mid
   Holocene (MH) periods and the present day (PD), plus derived data from
   2050 and 2070, in conjunction with the Comprehensive and Sequential
   Classification System (CSCS) model, were used to classify global PNV.
   The 42 classes of global PNV were regrouped into 10 groups to facilitate
   analysis of spatial changes. Finally, spatio-temporal patterns and
   successional processes of global PNV as well as the response to climate
   changes were analysed. Our study made the following five conclusions.
   (1) Only one missing class (IA1 frigid-extrarid frigid desert, alpine
   desert) arose in periods of LIG, MH, 2050, and 2070 for global PNV. (2)
   The frigid-arid groups were mainly distributed in higher latitudes and
   elevations, but temperate-humid groups and tropical-perhumid groups
   occurred in middle and low latitudes, respectively. Temperate zonal
   forest steppe, warm desert, savanna and tropical zonal forest steppe
   increased, while six other groups decreased. (3) The conversion from
   temperate zonal forest steppe to tundra and alpine steppe from LIG to
   LGM occupied the largest area, indicating a drastic shift in climate and
   the associated response of terrestrial vegetation sensitive to climate
   change. (4) The CSCS could be used to simulate the long-term succession
   of global PNV. (5) As a consequence of global warming, forests shifted
   to the northern hemisphere and Tibet, areas with much higher latitude
   and elevation. The PNV groups with greater shift distance revealed the
   more serious effects of global climate change on vegetation.},

Title = {The application of near infrared spectroscopy to predict faecal nitrogen
   and phosphorus in multiple ruminant herbivore species},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {415-423},
Abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was applied to determine faecal
   nitrogen and phosphorus using a temporo-spatially diverse dataset
   derived from multiple ruminant herbivore species (i.e. cattle, bison,
   deer, elk, goats, and sheep). Single-species NIRS calibrations have
   previously been developed to predict faecal constituents. Multi-species
   NIRS calibrations have previously been developed for herbivore faecal
   nitrogen but not for faecal phosphorus. Faecal samples representing a
   herd or flock composite were analysed via NIRS (400-2498 nm).
   Calibration sets for faecal nitrogen and phosphorus were developed from:
   (1) all samples from all six species, (2) all cattle samples only, (3)
   all samples except those from bison, (4) all samples except those from
   deer, (5) all samples except those from elk, (6) all samples except
   those from goats, and (7) all samples except those from sheep.
   Validation sample sets included: (1) each of the individual species
   (predicted with a cattle only-derived calibration), and (2) each of the
   individual species (other than cattle) predicted with a multi-species
   calibration constructed from all cattle samples plus those samples from
   the remaining four species (i.e. `leave-one-out'). All multiple
   coefficient of determination (R-2) values for faecal nitrogen
   calibrations were >= 0.97. Corresponding standard error of cross
   validation (SECV) values were <= 0.13. Validation simple coefficient of
   determination (r(2)) and standard error of prediction (SEP) of each
   alternate species using the cattle-derived calibration ranged from 0.76
   to 0.84, and 0.28 to 0.5 respectively. Similar values for the sequential
   species leave-one-out validation for faecal nitrogen were 0.67 to 0.89,
   and 0.17 to 0.47 respectively. All R-2 values for faecal phosphorus
   calibrations were >= 0.79; corresponding SECV were <= 0.14. Validation
   r(2) and SEP of each alternate species using the cattle-derived
   phosphorus calibration were <= 0.63 and >= 0.13 respectively. Similar
   values for the sequential species leave-one-out validation were <= 0.66
   and >= 0.22 respectively for faecal phosphorus. Multi-species faecal
   NIRS calibrations can be developed for monitoring applications in which
   determination of faecal nitrogen is appropriate, e.g. free-ranging
   herbivore nutrition, nitrogen deposition from animal faeces on
   rangelands with declining forage quality, or runoff from confined animal
   feeding operations. Similar calibrations for faecal phosphorus require
   additional research to ascertain their applicability.},

Abstract = {Woody plant encroachment threatens herbaceous plant productivity in many
   rangelands globally. We evaluated the impact of bush clearing on grass
   tiller, leaf and biomass production, and tuft sizes in the Kgomo-kgomo
   and Makapaanstad rangelands in North-West Province, South Africa. In
   each rangeland, the number of tillers and leaves, tuft sizes and biomass
   of eight dominant grass species were recorded in bush-cleared and
   uncleared treatments. The treatment and species interacted significantly
   (P < 0.001) for tiller and leaf production and tuft sizes. Bush clearing
   increased tiller production of bunch grasses but not stoloniferous
   grasses. At Kgomo-kgomo, bunch grasses (Panicum maximum (Jacq.) and
   Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy] had three to six times more
   tillers and leaves per plant in the cleared than uncleared treatment. At
   Makapaanstad, only annual bunch grasses {[}Brachiaria eruciformis
   (Sibth. \& Sm.) Griseb and Tragus berteronianus (Schult.)] attained
   twice as many tillers and leaves per plant in the cleared compared to
   uncleared treatment. Biomass was 1776 +/- 159 and 696 +/- 159 g m(-2) in
   cleared and uncleared treatments respectively at Kgomo-kgomo and 1358
   +/- 258 and 1089 +/- 258 g m(-2) at Makapaanstad. The tufts of bunch
   grasses were nearly twice as large in the cleared compared with the
   uncleared treatment at Kgomo-kgomo, whereas only stoloniferous grass
   tufts increased at Makapaanstad. Overall, bush clearing improved grass
   productivity and performance, but the responses varied by species.},

Abstract = {Astragalus variabilis Bunge is a widespread locoweed that threatens
   livestock production in desert grassland. No research has reported its
   possible ecological functions due to focus being on its negative effect
   on livestock production. This study aimed to assess the effects of A.
   variabilis on soil properties and its possible role in improving soil
   quality in desert grassland. Soil samples were collected in Astragalus
   patches and the adjacent bare patches over two successive growing
   seasons in Alxa desert grassland where A. variabilis was favoured to
   spread. Soil properties including texture, water content, dry bulk
   density, porosity, available nutrients, organic matter, and soil
   microbial biomass were determined at 15 study sites. There was no
   significant difference in soil texture between Astragalus-dominant and
   bare patches; but organic matter (OM), available N and P, and microbial
   biomass in surface soil (0-30 cm) were significantly higher in
   Astragalus patches. Furthermore, microbial biomass showed a
   significantly positive correlation with available nutrients and OM.
   Levels of water soluble salt were significantly lower in A. variabilis
   surface soils under drought conditions. Results suggested that A.
   variabilis was associated with some positive changes in soil properties,
   and was potentially important in improving soil chemical and microbial
   properties in desert grassland ecosystems. Consequently, total
   elimination of locoweed should not necessarily be considered the best
   solution to locoweed poisoning in livestock.},

Abstract = {Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict.
   They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of
   rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing
   excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and
   environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to
   pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and
   intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these
   competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland
   grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is
   largely under the control of the people who manage the business.
   However, there are significant external influences that can impede
   progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this
   paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional
   experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental
   sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing
   enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial
   and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry,
   and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially
   antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude
   with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve
   (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Diet quality, liveweight change and responses to N supplements by cattle

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Experiments during 4 years examined the diets selected, growth, and
   responses to N supplements by Bos indicus-cross steers grazing
   summer-rainfall semi-arid C4 Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) rangelands
   at a site in north-western Queensland, Australia. Paddock groups of
   steers were not supplemented (T-NIL), or were fed a non-protein N
   (T-NPN) or a cottonseed meal (T-CSM) supplement. In Experiment 1, young
   and older steers were measured during the late dry season (LDS) and the
   rainy season (RS), while steers in Experiments 2-4 were measured through
   the annual cycle. Because of severe drought the measurements during
   Experiment 3 annual cycle were limited to T-NIL steers. Pasture
   availability and species composition were measured twice annually. Diet
   was measured at 1-2 week intervals using near infrared spectroscopy of
   faeces (F.NIRS). Annual rainfalls (1 July-30 June) were 42-68\% of the
   long-term average (471 mm), and the seasonal break ranged from 17
   December to 3 March. There was wide variation in pasture, diet (crude
   protein (CP), DM digestibility (DMD), the CP to metabolisable energy
   (CP/ME) ratio) and steer liveweight change (LWC) within and between
   annual cycles. High diet quality and steer liveweight (LW) gain during
   the RS declined progressively through the transition season (TS) and
   early dry season (EDS), and often the first part of the LDS. Steers
   commenced losing LW as the LDS progressed. In Experiments 1 and 2 where
   forbs comprised <= 15 g/kg of the pasture sward, steers selected
   strongly for forbs so that they comprised 117-236 g/kg of the diet.
   However, in Experiments 3 and 4 where forbs comprised substantial
   proportions of the pasture (173-397 g/kg), there were comparable
   proportions in the diet (300-396 g/kg). With appropriate stocking rates
   the annual steer LW gains were acceptable (121-220 kg) despite the low
   rainfall. The N supplements had no effect on steer LW during the TS and
   the EDS, but usually reduced steer LW loss by 20-30 kg during the LDS.
   Thus during low rainfall years in Mitchell grass pastures there were
   substantial LW responses by steers to N supplements towards the end of
   the dry season when the diet contained c. c. <7.0 g CP/MJ ME.},

Title = {Some soil factors constraining buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.)
   seedling growth rate across a range of acid red Kandosols in Queensland,
   Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {77-95},
Abstract = {Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) has passionate grazing industry
   advocates and biodiversity conservation detractors around the world due
   to its ability to readily establish and spread on certain soil types. A
   more detailed understanding of what soil factors influence the success
   of seedling establishment will offer guidance to anyone wishing to
   either encourage or discourage buffel grass establishment in a
   particular area. Twenty soils from land types where buffel grass had a
   varied history of successful establishment and persistence in south
   western Queensland, Australia were assessed in a pot trial for their
   influence on early seedling growth rate of buffel grass. Some currently
   had buffel grass growing there. Aspects of the chemistry of each soil
   were compared against the rate of seedling growth of buffel grass cv.
   Biloela that was sown with or without a phosphate coating on the seed.
   Available soil phosphorus had a major influence on seedling growth in
   the absence of a phosphate fertiliser coating, but levels of other
   factors such as exchangeable aluminium and calcium were also critical.
   Several multiple regression equations with differing soil parameters
   included proved equally good at predicting buffel seedling growth but
   they did not greatly improve on the strong correlation with available
   soil phosphorus. This seemed due to the interchangeability amongst soil
   pH, cation exchange capacity and degree of clay as controlling factors,
   over and above available phosphorus. Thus, where available soil
   phosphorus is marginal for rapid buffel seedling growth, soil pH,
   exchangeable aluminium and total exchangeable cation levels could have
   similar importance in determining whether buffel grass colonised or
   failed to gain a foothold in that area.},

Abstract = {Producer reliance on drought subsidies instead of proactive planning and
   timely destocking in low rainfall years has prompted Queensland
   government investment in promoting business and drought resilience.
   GrazingFutures (AU\$6 million budget, 2016-2022) is an extension project
   focussed on enhancing business management skills of extensive livestock
   producers in western Queensland, Australia. The region's rangelands are
   in productivity decline, span 1 million km2 and are managed by graziers
   operating more than 2400 livestock businesses (beef, sheep and goats).
   The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries delivers
   GrazingFutures as a component of the Drought and Climate Adaptation
   Program, in partnership with regional natural resource management groups
   and other public and private organisations. Project delivery emphasised
   upskilling multi-agency staff and livestock producers to promote
   practice change within three whole of business themes: (1) grazing land
   management; (2) animal production; and (3) peoplebusiness. Three
   independent surveys (2018, 2019, 2020) indicated positive practice
   change was occurring in grazing businesses as a consequence of the
   project. Graziers instigated management changes even under major
   environmental challenges including extended drought (2013-2020), an
   extreme flood event in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This
   paper details the rationale, progress against the objectives, challenges
   and future direction of the GrazingFutures extension project.},

Abstract = {Assessing current and potential future grassland vegetation types and
   distribution has important practical implications in grassland
   management. In this study, historical and projected climate data from
   Inner Mongolia were used to classify grassland classes for two
   historical (1960-1986 and 1986-2011) and two future periods (2021-2024
   and 2041-2060) using the Comprehensive and Sequential Classification
   System (CSCS). Changes of grassland classes in these time periods were
   investigated. The results indicated that (1) using the CSCS provided an
   efficient approach to investigate the impact of historical and future
   climate on grassland classes and their distribution in Inner Mongolia
   over time and space; (2) since 1986, the precipitation in Inner Mongolia
   has declined, decreasing the semi-humid zone area and expanding that of
   arid and semi-arid areas. The area of Tundra and alpine steppe,
   Temperate zonal humid grassland and Temperate zonal forest steppe
   decreased, and that of Frigid desert, Semi-desert, and Steppe group
   increased; and (3) under the projected increase in temperature and
   decrease in precipitation in large areas in Inner Mongolia by 2060, the
   area of arid grassland classes will likely expand (Frigid desert,
   Semi-desert, and Steppe), and the grassland classes of Tundra and alpine
   steppe may gradually disappear. Government investment in infrastructure
   and grassland management measures such as introducing drought tolerant
   grass species and improved precipitation utilisation through irrigation
   are needed to adapt to the changing climate. Inner Mongolia should take
   advantage of the benefits of the increase in temperature in the eastern
   semi-humid region that would permit reduced grazing pressure in the
   western arid region.},

Title = {Achieving drought resilience in the grazing lands of northern Australia:
   preparing, responding and recovering},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {67-76},
Abstract = {Northern Australia is characterised by high rainfall variability and
   extended droughts that challenge sustainable and profitable management
   of grazing properties. To achieve drought resilience, emphasis must be
   placed on supporting livestock managers to prepare for drought as well
   as implementing appropriate drought response and recovery actions. Here
   we describe insights and learnings gained from working with scientists,
   industry development and extension officers, and property managers, to
   enable more profitable and drought resilient extensive livestock
   production systems across northern Australia. We provide examples from
   the modelling and analysis of hypothetical grazing properties
   representative of enterprises across northern Australia. To prepare for
   drought, we principally propose the application of the farm-management
   economics framework to identify investment strategies which can improve
   enterprise resilience through building wealth over the longer term. The
   critical first step in drought preparedness for beef businesses was the
   implementation of management strategies to achieve the optimal herd
   structure, steer sale age, and breeder body condition. Other key
   strategies to improve profitability across northern Australia were (1)
   addressing a phosphorus deficiency for cattle through effective
   supplementation and (2) establishing adapted perennial legume-grass
   pastures to improve steer nutrition. In addition, we identify the
   benefits of working closely with livestock managers and industry to gain
   adoption of proven technologies that effectively improve decision-making
   capacity and the drought preparedness of extensive livestock production
   systems. The usefulness of the farm-management economics approach to
   assess the relative value of alternative tactical destocking and
   restocking decisions during drought response and recovery is also
   discussed. These latter analyses can highlight important differences
   between options in terms of future profit and cash flow, as well as the
   ability to rapidly return the property to the most profitable herd
   structure and age of turnoff, with consideration of production and
   financial risk. Additionally, integrating pasture growth models with
   herd or flock economic models can provide insights into the effects, on
   profitability and sustainability, of alternative destocking and later
   restocking strategies over the longer term. Combined, the
   farm-management economics framework approach can support more informed
   decision-making by livestock producers and hence enable more profitable
   and drought resilient extensive livestock production systems. However,
   achieving drought resilience in the grazing lands of northern Australia
   will require emphasis on drought preparation, in addition to appropriate
   action in response and recovery phases of drought. Key to this approach
   is increasing the adoption of strategies that enhance drought
   preparedness.},

Title = {Prospects for sustainable use of the pastoral areas of Australia's
   southern rangelands: a synthesis},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {185-209},
Abstract = {There is growing recognition of the need to achieve land use across the
   southern Australian rangelands that accommodates changing societal
   preferences and ensures the capacity of future generations to satisfy
   their own preferences. This paper considers the prospects for
   sustainable use of the pastoral lands based either on continued grazing
   or emerging, alternative land uses. After an overview of the southern
   rangelands environment, the status of the pastoral industry, its
   environmental impacts, and key issues for pastoral management, we
   propose four principles and 19 associated guidelines for sustainable
   pastoralism. Although some continued withdrawal of land from pastoralism
   is anticipated, we expect that pastoralism will continue throughout much
   of the region currently grazed, particularly in the higher rainfall
   environments in the east. Within these areas, sustainable pastoral land
   use should be achievable by the application of four broad management
   principles, as follows: (1) manage grazing within a risk management
   framework based on the concept of tactical grazing, (2) develop
   infrastructure to allow best management of both domestic and
   non-domestic grazing pressure, (3) incorporate management of invasive
   native scrub, where required, into overall, ongoing property management
   and (4) manage grazing to enhance biodiversity conservation at landscape
   scale. Application of these principles and guidelines will require the
   development of appropriate policy settings, particularly in relation to
   kangaroo management, climate change, and natural resource governance,
   together with innovative approaches to research, development and
   extension. Policy development will also be required if the new industry
   of carbon sequestration is to deliver socio-ecological benefits without
   perverse outcomes. Other emerging industries based on renewable energy
   or ecosystem services appear to have considerable potential, with little
   risk of adverse ecological consequences.},

Title = {Social-identity dynamics in rural communities: a motive for resistance
   to change},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {299-307},
Abstract = {This research found that rural social resistance to change and newcomers
   can be explained in part by the influence of social-set membership.
   Eighty-nine interviews were conducted in two Australian inland rural
   communities with population <2000 and analysed with a recognised
   cultural dynamics framework. This found attachment to local social
   identity, social hierarchy and cultural norms that represented social
   power. Established residents defended the status quo when valued facets
   of social identity were perceived to be threatened, resisting efforts to
   introduce change. Persons representing a challenge to established local
   identity norms could be socially undermined and censured to preserve the
   power of dominant social sets, defending their preferred narratives and
   norms. Understanding social identity influences can explain rural
   communities' tendency to conservatism, why newcomers and new ideas are
   often derided, ignored or attacked. It can explain the motives for
   negative social capital and suggests social identity as a factor in
   small town newcomer business failure, and resistance to new knowledge
   transfer and practice adoption. Welcome and induction to local social
   codes is critical to newcomer integration. Outsiders and newcomers may
   meet discretely with like-minded or similar persons to safely fulfil
   social needs or influence as a social minority, providing support to
   their own unique group. Where residents cannot find inclusion, they may
   disengage. Understanding social identity can provide insights for
   community leaders, development practitioners, extension officers and
   newcomers struggling to serve and innovate in rural and rangelands
   communities.},

Abstract = {To protect the grassland ecosystem's security, and coordinate the
   utilisation of grassland resources, explicitly estimating the response
   of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of 10 grassland groups to future
   climate change is necessary. Based on the Comprehensive and Sequential
   Classification System (CSCS) and modified Carnegie Ames Stanford
   Approach (CASA) model, in conjunction with four Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the response of
   China's grassland NPP to climate change was simulated and estimated.
   Results showed that: (1) the simulation accuracy of modified CASA model
   (R-2 = 0.65) is 34\% higher than that of CASA model, indicating that the
   modified CASA was suitable for estimating grassland NPP in China; (2)
   annual mean NPP and total NPP (2001-18) were 138.4 g C m(-2) year(-1)
   and 495.7 T g C, respectively; compared with the period 2001 18, NPP
   during the 2050 under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 were
   predicted with increases of 34.8\%, 35.9\%, 34.9\% and 35.8\%,
   respectively; and (3) from the present-day to the 2050, the NPP of Warm
   desert exhibited the largest increase (73.2-76.3\%), while that of
   Tundra and alpine grassland the smallest (1.3-1.6\%). These differences
   in NPP increase likely lead to differences in grassland carrying
   capacity. To respond to the impact of future climate change on
   grassland, grassland classification management strategies according to
   different groups should be implemented as grassland NPP changes
   differently in different grassland groups.},

Title = {From National Drought Policy to National Drought Agreement: the
   evolution of Australia's drought response},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {77-86},
Abstract = {Australia has had a formal National Drought Policy for nearly three
   decades. Over that time, the policy has morphed, with the programs that
   make up the policy being revised and replaced as it has sought to
   address both the concerns of the farm business and the welfare needs of
   farm families. The stated principles underpinning the policy have
   remained relatively stable, focusing on farmer self-reliance and risk
   management. The most recent iteration, embodied in a December 2018
   National Drought Agreement, is very similar in stated intent to the
   original 1992 policy. Despite attempts to focus on risk management,
   however, the policy remains to a large extent crisis driven, with
   changes to the policy, particularly big-ticket spending, frequently
   announced during severe drought. As a result of the tension between the
   political imperative to respond during drought events and the desire to
   promote self-reliance and drought preparedness among farmers, the
   original policy's ambition of avoiding ad hoc reactions has not been
   achieved, and the risk management/self-reliance theme is reflected more
   rhetorically than in policy substance. These tensions reflect the
   challenge of juggling the conflicting values around drought support,
   between broad community sympathy for farmers which is activated during
   drought, and aspirations of a risk management approach which requires
   longer term thinking and the avoidance of ad hoc policy making.},

Abstract = {To examine the role of plant functional traits and phylogenetic
   relationships in predicting plant community species coexistence and
   diversity maintenance, we measured 73 species and six functional traits
   along a slope aspect gradient on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. We
   calculated the net relatedness index (NRI), the nearest taxon index
   (NTI), phylogenetic diversity (PD), functional diversity, and analysed
   phylogenetic signals. The results show that the species richness, plant
   composition, and PD changed substantially from northern to southern
   aspects, and the phylogenetic structure of the community changed from
   clustering to over-dispersion. Weak phylogenetic signals in plant
   height, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf potassium content were recorded.
   We conclude that the influencing factor(s) of species coexistence on
   northern and north-western aspects is limiting similarity (interspecific
   competition), whereas on southern and south-western aspects, habitat
   filtering (environmental effect) is predominant. On western aspects, the
   influencing factors are driven by three processes: limiting similarity,
   habitat filtration, and random processes. Results suggest that niche
   processes (including habitat filtration and limiting similarity) are the
   main mechanisms for species coexistence and diversity maintenance on
   aspects of the alpine meadow in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan
   plateau, while random processes appear at the transitional zone (the
   western aspect in our study) between aspects.},

Title = {Species replacement and transitional zones in natural grasslands with

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {23-33},
Abstract = {Heterogeneity creates borders, limits and contrasts between patches. In
   turn, this pattern generates new processes. Linked to heterogeneity,
   ecological systems have limits where layout is essential to
   understanding system organisation. This study analysed internal
   heterogeneity in natural grassland using: (1) estimation of species
   replacement in space, and (2) identification of transitional zones and
   definition of their ecological features in an extremely flat area of the
   Flooding Pampa, Argentina. Transition analysis was conducted at three
   sites; 77 plots in total. In each plot, all species, their cover
   percentage and the proportion of bare soil were recorded and soil
   samples (0-20 cm depth) measured for pH and electrical conductivity.
   With floristic data, we explored the relationship between pairwise
   similarities in community structure and pairwise differences in space,
   adjusting similarity as a linear or non-linear function of geographical
   distance. We then conducted a cluster analysis to identify transitional
   zones, which were associated with large vegetation units described for
   the Flooding Pampa. Floristic composition in transitional zones was
   analysed according to the proportions of species and combinations
   characteristic of the different plant communities. Finally, we
   synthetised topo-edaphic measured information with a Principal Component
   Analysis to analyse transitional zone environmental properties. Joining
   hierarchical classification methods and Indicator Species Analysis for
   single species and combinations, we highlighted internal heterogeneity,
   often not noticed in these environments. Rotational livestock grazing
   contribute to heterogeneity that is typical of these grasslands.
   Knowledge about transitional zones strongly supports the development of
   management strategies to prevent grassland degradation.},

Title = {Breaking the wildfire cycle: progressive fire management can shift fire

Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},

Volume = {44},

Pages = {279-288},
Abstract = {Extensive late dry season fires in northern Australia have long been
   considered detrimental to biodiversity conservation, pastoral production
   and other cultural and landscape values. Fire management programs in
   these landscapes typically aim to shift the fire regime from wildfires
   occurring predominately in the late dry season (LDS), when they tend to
   be extensive and destructive, to prescribed burns in the early dry
   season (EDS), when fires are generally smaller and less intensive. The
   intent is to create heterogeneity in vegetation age classes, reduce the
   scale of LDS fires and, in doing so, retain long-unburnt vegetation, a
   critical asset for biodiversity in a flammable landscape. Boodjamulla
   National Park, in Queensland's Gulf Country, experienced a cycle of
   large LDS wildfires every 5 years for most of its history as a pastoral
   property and park until a progressive EDS burning program was
   introduced. Although there is limited information for defining the ideal
   fire regime for spinifex (Triodia spp.) rangelands, this program has
   improved a range of spatial metrics which the Queensland Parks and
   Wildlife Service (QPWS) believes can only benefit biodiversity; these
   include decreased annual and LDS area burnt; a greater number of small
   burnt patches; shorter distances between recently burnt and long-unburnt
   spinifex; and, consequently, a greater area of long-unburnt spinifex
   embedded in the mosaic across the landscape. There has been an
   improvement in the ecological parameters of these landscapes, as well as
   the protection and persistence of fire-sensitive vegetation communities
   and species, because of the burn program.},

Abstract = {The fall of phyllodes from Acacia aneura F.Muell. ex Benth. (mulga) in
   central Australia was studied over 22 months from mid-1958 at four
   locations within a livestock reserve north of Alice Springs in the
   Northern Territory, in order to identify rainfall or seasonal triggers.
   Phyllode fall increased by at least an order of magnitude for short
   periods following rain of 15-20 mm or more on a `mature' mulga site and
   similar trends were apparent for `young' and `desert form' mulga on the
   same site, and on a second, independent, `mature' site. When rates of
   phyllode fall were high after substantial rain, at both `mature'
   locations, similar to 30\% of nitrogen and similar to 50\% of phosphorus
   were withdrawn before abscission, suggesting that mulga was markedly
   conservative of these nutrients. Conversely, under dry conditions, when
   phyllode fall was relatively low (<200 mg m(-2) day(-1)), concentrations
   of nitrogen and phosphorus in fallen phyllodes were higher.
   Concentrations of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium did not vary
   consistently with increasing rate of phyllode fall, although overall
   levels of calcium and potassium were considerably higher in the second
   `mature' location. This legacy study is of renewed interest given the
   potential of mulga communities to contribute to national carbon stocks,
   and the consequent need for robust field-based data on growth dynamics
   and carbon fluxes.},

Title = {Resilience of the pastoral component of Moroccan small ruminant systems
   in mountain areas},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {257-266},
Abstract = {Small ruminant farming is the main rural occupation in mountain areas of
   Morocco. This activity is subject to numerous pressures, including
   repeated climatic hazards that modify pastoral resource availability and
   trigger changes in production systems. This study aimed to identify and
   analyse changes in availability and utilisation of pastoral resources
   acknowledged by farmers over the past 40 years for the small ruminant
   farming systems of the Central High Atlas region of Morocco. We
   hypothesised, on the basis of previous research, that resilience of the
   pastoral component of such systems increases with elevation. We
   interviewed 50 farmers in three municipalities of Azilal province, at
   moderate (800-1400 m), medium (1400-1800 m) and high (1800-3000 m)
   elevations. In the 1970-1980s, pastoral resources were abundant and
   mobile flocks grazed collective rangelands. Subsequently, repeated
   droughts and the increased stock numbers promoted by agricultural
   policies led to the deterioration of resource abundance and quality,
   especially palatable plants. At moderate elevations, wooded areas and
   phytomass declined; erosion occurred at high elevations. Traditional
   systems diversified by including agricultural activities. At moderate
   elevations, livestock farming intensified, with the adoption of a
   productive breed, concentrate distribution and the grazing of fallow
   land. Currently, flock mobility is limited and rangelands provide less
   than 60\% of sheep requirements. At high elevations, the pastoral
   component persisted at the cost of a diversification of pastoral areas
   and greater flock mobility. Rangelands are still collectively managed
   and provide almost 90\% of sheep requirements. Since rangelands remain a
   major feed source, changes in pastoral resources can be considered as a
   major driver of change in livestock systems. The sustainability of small
   ruminant farming systems at these elevations thus depends on the
   conservation of rangeland.},

Title = {A new net primary productivity model and new management strategy of
   grassland classification based on CSCS in China},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {285-295},
Abstract = {The discovery of grassland field, form and biomass in China was central
   to the sustainable development of grassland. In this study, the
   realistic spatial distribution patterns of grasslands were clarified
   through the combination of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program
   (IGBP) and the Comprehensive and Sequential Classification System
   (CSCS). An optimal net primary productivity (NPP) model suitable for
   Chinese grasslands was introduced by integrating the classification
   indices-based model (CIM) with the Normalised Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI), and comparing it with the standard classical model (Miami,
   Schuur, CIM, CASA model). Using the optimal model as the algorithm
   basis, the net primary production spatial pattern of grassland in China
   was determined. The results showed that: (1) the total area of grassland
   was similar to 374.3 x 104 km(2) in 2018, mainly distributed in
   north-western China. Among the grassland super-class groups, Tundra and
   alpine steppe were largest, and Warm desert smallest; (2) the optimal
   modified CIM had the highest prediction efficiency, and the overall
   accuracy was higher than the standard classical model (Miami, Schuur,
   CIM, CASA model). It achieved the accurate calculation of grassland NPP
   in China; (3) different grassland super-class groups had different
   carbon fixation efficiency per unit area, resulting in huge differences
   in total NPP. Among the various grassland super-class groups, the
   temperate humid grassland, steppe, tundra and alpine steppe had high
   conversion efficiency per unit area of NPP, whereas that for warm desert
   and the savanna was low. The total NPP was 388.04 x 10(12) g C/year in
   the study area in 2018. The results provide a basis for the rational
   arrangement of grassland ecological and productive functions, and are
   significant for developing a new strategy of grassland classification
   management in China.},

Abstract = {The influence of short-duration, concentrated kraaling (enclosure) has
   been documented for plants, wildlife, and macro-invertebrates. However,
   limited information is available on its impact on ground-dwelling
   spiders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of
   short-duration kraaling, time since cattle removal, and microhabitat
   variables on spider assemblages in Matabeleland North Province,
   Zimbabwe. We used a matched-pair and space for time design (inside vs
   outside previously kraaled inclusions) across 11 sites, using four
   cattle herds (H-1, H-6, H-7 and H-Nguni). Spiders were sampled in the
   early and late rainy season with pitfall traps left open for 14-day
   sampling periods and emptied twice in each period. We captured 634
   spiders, comprising 63 species in 44 genera and 18 families. The most
   abundant family was Lycosidae (37\%; 16 spp.), followed by Gnaphosidae
   (15\%; 10 spp.) and Salticidae (14.5\%; 7 spp.). Generalised linear
   mixed models showed that generic richness was greater in sites with more
   bare ground. However, this effect was reversed in previously kraaled
   sites, and was particularly evident for spider abundance that responded
   negatively relative to unkraaled sites. Furthermore, with a U-shaped
   recovery, generic richness increased with time since kraaling.
   Model-based multivariate models showed that short-duration kraaling had
   a significant impact on spider assemblage structure, but this impact was
   relatively small compared with the effect of seasonality. Most of the
   species that made significant contributions to this multivariate
   response were less abundant in kraaled sites. Spider diversity,
   therefore, had a weak negative response to short-term kraaling. However,
   these impacts should also be assessed at broader scales, including areas
   where cattle go to graze during the day.},

Title = {A production-scale evaluation of nutritional monitoring and decision
   support software for free-ranging cattle in an arid environment},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-46},
Abstract = {Range cattle in semi-arid regions are commonly limited by lack of
   nitrogen and other nutrients from grazing low-quality forage, with
   managers needing to monitor diet quality to address nutrient
   limitations. Near-infrared spectroscopy of faecal samples (FNIRS) is an
   accurate method used to determine diet quality in grazing animals. When
   combined with a nutritional balance software such as the Nutritional
   Balance Analyser (NUTBAL), FNIRS can monitor nutritional status and
   estimate weight change. We aimed to test the ability of NUTBAL to
   predict animal performance as represented by body condition score (BCS)
   in cattle grazing on a semi-desert rangeland. BCS and faecal samples
   were collected from a Red Angus herd (n = 82) at the Santa Rita Ranch
   (June 2016-July 2017). Standing biomass and botanical composition were
   measured before each grazing period, and relative utilisation was
   measured following each grazing period. During the midpoint of grazing
   in each pasture, 30 BCS and a faecal composite of 15 samples were
   collected. Faecal derived diet quality varied between a maximum of
   10.75\% crude protein (CP) and 61.25\% digestible organic matter (DOM)
   in early August 2016, to a minimum value of 4.22\% CP and 57.68\% DOM in
   January 2017. Three NUTBAL evaluations were conducted to determine the
   likelihood of accurately predicting animal performance: one with typical
   user defined inputs; one with improved environment and herd descriptive
   inputs; and one with these improvements plus the use of metabolisable
   protein in the model. This third evaluation confirmed the ability of
   FNIRS:NUTBAL to predict future BCS within 0.5 BCS more than 75\% of the
   time. With this information, cattle managers in semi-arid regions can
   better address animal performance needs and nutrient deficiencies.},

Title = {The substitution effect of grass-fed livestock products on grain-fed
   livestock products from the perspective of supply-side reform in China},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {377-387},
Abstract = {Clarification of the direction of China's future agricultural structural
   transformation is important, particularly by analysing the dynamic
   characteristics of upgrading the food consumption structure, especially
   the relationship between grain and grass-fed livestock products, and by
   predicting future food consumption patterns. Based on the food
   equivalent unit (FEU) and the arable land equivalent unit (ALEU),
   characteristics of meat consumption elasticity across China and between
   regions were analysed using the extend linear expenditure system for
   national meat consumption elasticity and regional changes. Similarly, in
   addition to the substitution effect of grass-fed livestock products on
   grain-fed livestock products, the prediction of the future gap in demand
   for grass-fed livestock products was explored. Results indicated that:
   (1) from 2005 to 2012, the per-capita food consumption on average has
   stabilised at 460 kg FEU per year. The consumption of grain-fed
   livestock products is stable, and that for grass-fed livestock products
   has increased dramatically since 2000; (2) there is a substitution
   effect of consumption of grass-fed on consumption of grain-fed livestock
   products on individual and regional scales; (3) By 2035, the overall
   demand gap for future grass-fed livestock products in China will be 1.14
   x 10(10) kg, and the main demand will be in grain farming areas. Based
   on the aggregated advantage index of each region, the seven grassland
   ecological-economic regions are divided into three priority groups for
   grassland agricultural development.},

Title = {Building cultural capital in drought adaptation: lessons from discourse
   analysis},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {101-108},
Abstract = {As governments and primary industries work to build the climate
   resilience of Australian agriculture, individual producers are often
   called upon to implement strategies to become more adaptive in the face
   of drought. These strategies include infrastructural changes to
   agricultural businesses, changes to practices, and the adoption of new
   skills and knowledge. The transition towards greater drought
   adaptiveness will also demand broader cultural shifts in the way that
   drought is defined and approached as an issue facing primary producers.
   This paper presents the results of a discourse analysis conducted as
   part of social research exploring the cultural barriers to drought
   preparedness within the Queensland Government's Drought and Climate
   Adaptation Program (DCAP). Focusing on media and government accounts,
   the analysis found two different ways of framing drought and its
   management in Queensland agriculture. The first, which is dominant in
   media accounts, emphasises the disruptive power of drought, presenting
   it as a profound difficulty for producers that is managed using
   endurance, hope and ingenuity. This frame adopts highly evocative
   discursive strategies oriented towards mobilising community sentiment
   and support for producers. The second, which is less prominent overall,
   downplays drought's disruptive power and counters the emotionality of
   the adversity discourse by presenting drought as a neutral business risk
   that can be managed using rational planning skills and scientific
   knowledge. In discussing these two frames, this paper suggests
   strategies whereby drought adaptation frames might be made more powerful
   using more meaningful and emotive narratives that showcase it as a vital
   practice for ensuring agricultural livelihoods and rural futures in a
   changing climate.},

Title = {Livestock indirectly decrease nest abundance of two shrub-nesting
   species in Patagonian Monte Desert},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {375-385},
Abstract = {Domestic livestock may indirectly affect bird species through changes in
   vegetation structure (e.g. cover), reducing the availability of food,
   nesting sites, refugia and, therefore, reproduction in many ecosystems
   worldwide. However, it remains unclear how the effect of livestock on
   vegetation structure can influence insectivorous birds that use shrubs
   for nest construction and placement rather than for feeding. Several
   species from the Furnariidae family inhabit Monte Desert, Argentina,
   exhibiting an extraordinary diversity in nest placement and structure
   that allows them to survive habitat aridity. Nest abundance and size of
   two common furnariid species, Pseudoseisura gutturalis and Leptasthenura
   aegithaloides, were studied across a cumulative livestock impact
   gradient (livestock impact by years grazed). These bird species use
   large, closed-nests (\~{}40 cm and \~{}100 cm length, respectively)
   built with thorny branches placed on thorny shrubs. The study
   encompassed nine independent rangelands within the same habitat, but
   with increasing livestock density, establishing a gradient in grazing
   intensity. In each rangeland, nest abundance, nest and supporting plant
   characteristics, vegetation structure and the percentage of browsing
   were assessed. Plant cover was lower in rangelands with higher livestock
   impact, and this was associated with lower nest abundance and nest size.
   Nest abundance of L. aegithaloides was halved, whereas P. gutturalis was
   decreased 10-fold comparing the extremes of the livestock impact
   gradient (0.06 vs 1.63 cattle ha(-1) x years). Nests tended to be
   smaller and more spherical with increasing livestock impact. The
   significant and positive association between nest abundance and
   vegetation structure together with the importance of mating and
   reproduction for bird lifecycles suggests that the nest abundance of
   these species could be used as an indicator of habitat degradation.
   Therefore, furnariid nest abundance could be used as a first step for
   diagnosing ecosystem health and designing ecologically sustainable
   management practices in Monte Desert. Changes in vegetation structure
   (e.g. cover) such as those imposed by livestock may unpredictably affect
   plant-associated species affecting their reproduction, demography and
   ecosystem biodiversity.},

Title = {Is ground cover a useful indicator of grazing land condition?},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-64},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed ground cover data play an important role in Australian
   rangelands research development and extension, reflecting broader global
   trends in the use of remotely sensed data. We tested the relationship
   between remotely sensed ground cover data and field-based assessments of
   grazing land condition in the largest quantitative analysis of its type
   to date. We collated land condition data from 2282 sites evaluated
   between 2004 and 2018 in the Burdekin and Fitzroy regions of Queensland.
   Condition was defined using the Grazing Land Management land condition
   framework that ranks grazing land condition on a four point ordinal
   scale based on dimensions of vegetation composition, ground cover level
   and erosion severity. Nine separate ground cover derived indices were
   then calculated for each site. We found that all indices significantly
   correlated with grazing land condition on corresponding sites. Highest
   correlations occurred with indices that benchmarked ground cover at the
   site against regional ground cover assessed over several years. These
   findings provide some validation for the general use of ground cover
   data as an indicator of rangeland health/productivity. We also
   constructed univariate land condition models with a subset of these
   indices. Our models predicted land condition significantly better than
   random assignment though only moderately well; no model correctly
   predicted land condition class on >40\% of sites. While the best models
   predicted condition correctly at >60\% of A and D condition sites,
   condition at sites in B and C condition sites was poorly predicted.
   Several factors limit how well ground cover levels predict land
   condition. The main challenge is modelling a multidimensional value
   (grazing land condition) with a unidimensional ground cover measurement.
   We suggest that better land condition models require a range of
   predictors to address this multidimensionality but cover indices can
   make a substantial contribution in this context.},

Title = {The use of Australian native grains as a food: a review of research in a
   global grains context},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {223-233},
Abstract = {Australian native grains have an extended history of human consumption;
   however, their place in diets was disrupted when colonisation triggered
   a shift away from traditional lifestyles for Aboriginal people. Despite
   being time- and energy-intensive to harvest, the inclusion of native
   grains in diets is thought to have offered considerable adaptive
   advantage by assisting human occupation of arid and semiarid zones.
   Ethnographic evidence has shown that Aboriginal people developed
   specialised tools and techniques to transform grain into more edible
   forms. Research on native grain consumption has mainly been conducted
   from an ethnographic perspective, with the objective of furthering
   understanding of Aboriginal societies, instead of the agricultural or
   food science significance of these plant species. Consequently, a
   research gap in all aspects of Australian native grains in modern
   food-production systems from the paddock to plate has emerged, and is
   being filled by research projects in multiple parts of the country due
   to surging interest in this food system. There is a critical need for
   Aboriginal communities, land managers, food industry professionals and

   they will be of most benefit to people and the planet.},

Abstract = {To analyse the variation of species abundance distribution (SAD)
   patterns with scale, and consider its formation mechanism and ecological
   process in alpine meadow in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China,
   study areas were established, nine permanent plots were randomly
   selected, and 72 quadrats were investigated. Four diversity indices were
   selected, including species richness, the Margalef, Shannon-Wiener and
   Simpson indices and relative importance values to quantify community
   assembly and biodiversity. Species accumulation curves were used to
   describe the SADs of the alpine meadow, and three model types used to
   fit the SADs. The results showed the following: (I) the Cyperaceae
   families were the respective dominance family in alpine meadow in the
   eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China; (2) at sampling scales from 0.25
   to 2 m(2), the total species richness and diversity indices increased;
   (3) total SADs were scale-dependent; the statistical model could not fit
   the SADs; the neutral theory model could explain SADs patterns at
   smaller spatial scales (0.25-I m(2)), and the niche process gradually
   replaced the neutral process in importance and became the main mechanism
   for determining SADs with the increase of sampling scales (1.25-2 m(2));
   (4) for common species, the niche model (geometric series model) could
   fit the SAD of common species at different sampling scales, which
   indicates that the niche process is the main mechanism to determine the
   SAD of common species; and (5) for rare species, with the change of
   sampling scale, the fitting model of rare species is different, which
   indicates that the SAD of rare species is affected by a variety of
   uncertain factors. In general, niche differentiation processes had a
   major effect on the biodiversity patterns of alpine meadow in
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

Title = {The spatial pattern of agricultural land use in China during the
   Holocene Megathermal},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {321-327},
Abstract = {During the Holocene Megathermal, China entered a stage of extensive
   agricultural farming, although there are few reports on the possible
   distribution pattern of agricultural land use. The main objective of
   this paper is to discuss issues related to the spatial pattern of
   agricultural land use in China during the Holocene Megathermal.
   According to historic and archaeological information, three widely
   planted crops (foxtail millet, broom millet and rice) were selected to
   represent the main crops, and their distribution was assumed to reflect
   the agricultural land-use pattern at that time. From the perspective of
   these crops and their required climate conditions and based on
   proxy-based ancient temperature and precipitation data combined with
   modern climate data, an average annual accumulated temperature of >= 10
   degrees C in the Holocene Megathermal was retrieved and spatially
   interpolated to capture a picture of land use. Validation was conducted
   using archaeological data from 141 agricultural heritage sites. The
   results indicated that in the Holocene Megathermal, agricultural farming
   activities were widespread in China The northern-most boundary of
   agricultural land use was north of Daxinganling, and the southern-most
   boundary extended to Hainan Island. In the region of the Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau where climate is currently much colder than during the Holocene
   Megathermal, the environment for foxtail millet and broom millet was
   suitable from the eastern segment of the Qilian Mountains to Lhasa. This
   study provides a reference for exploring the distribution pattern of
   agricultural land use in the early period of agricultural production in
   China and provides useful information for agricultural archaeology.},

Title = {Modelling and assessment of climate change and policy response - the
   distribu tion and area of Kobresia meadow in the Three-River Headwaters
   Region, China},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},

Pages = {297-308},
Abstract = {How the suitable distribution of a given grassland type will respond to
   policy implementation and climate change is a prerequisite and the basis
   for effective grassland management and sustainable development. The
   maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model as a comprehensive evaluation method at
   species level was successfully used to simulate the temporal and spatial
   changes in the geographical distribution of Kobresia meadow in China's
   Three-River Headwaters (TRH) region under the context of policy
   implementation and climate change. There were three main findings.
   First, there are the six dominant environmental variables affecting the
   distribution of Kobresia meadow (these being elevation, precipitation
   variation coefficient, March precipitation, April precipitation, April
   minimum temperatures, and May minimum temperatures: their threshold
   values are 3500-4000 m, 86-100, 8.5 mm, 12 mm, -3.5 degrees C and 1.5
   degrees C, respectively, which indicate the most suitable conditions for
   Kobresia meadow distribution). Second, under current (2005-2014) climate
   conditions, the suitable distribution of Kobresia meadow gradually
   decreases from east to west, with the largest area in the east.
   Implementation of the ecological conservation policy in the TRH has
   greatly improved the ecological environment in lower elevation and high
   population areas. This has benefited the growth of Kobresia meadow and
   enlarged its suitable areas. Third, compared with the current
   distribution, areas suitable for Kobresia meadow will increase by
   25.4-33.0\% in the 2050s (2041-2060) and 17.4-33.0\% in the 2070s
   (2061-2080) under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
   scenarios. More importantly, from the 2050s to the 2070s, areas suitable
   for Kobresia meadow will decrease or stabilise, bringing new challenges
   for protection and utilisation.},

Title = {Herders' willingness-to-participate in the Grassland Ecological
   Compensation and Award Policy in China: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Since implementation of its first phase, the Grassland Ecological
   Compensation and Award Policy (GECAP; 2011-2015) has significantly
   influenced participants' livelihoods in China.
   Willingness-to-participate (WTP) is an important component of successful
   policy implementation. The effects of influential factors on herders'
   WTP have received considerable research effort, although no systematic
   literature review or quantitative analysis has been conducted to provide
   evidence-based policy insights. Focusing on 3405 observations extracted
   from 13 empirical studies, this research conducted a meta-analysis and
   aggregated the effects of factors affecting Chinese herders' WTP in the
   GECAP. The study also analysed the heterogeneity in influential factors
   and its sources. Factors increasing herders' WTP included a higher
   formal education level, a higher farm income from raising livestock,
   access to larger grassland area, improved grassland condition, and
   better policy understanding. The cumulative effects of the number of
   livestock and grassland area on herders' WTP had increased since the
   policy was implemented. We examined publication bias that may arise from
   research with favourable results being more likely to be published and
   found that publication bias was statistically insignificant for the
   selected case studies. However, we found significant heterogeneity in
   household income and number of livestock. The sources of heterogeneity
   included regional differences, publication year, and sampling method.
   Future policy modification and formulation should better incentivise
   active participation of herders by targeting specific pastoral regions
   and herder groups at certain income levels and/or herd size.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of above-ground biomass in semi-arid rangelands},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-175},
Abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB), as a key biophysical and functional
   parameter of rangeland ecosystems, plays an important role in ecosystem
   carbon (C) stocks. The aim of this study was to explore the important
   environmental drivers of AGB in an arid rangeland by using structural
   equation modelling (SEM). Vegetation and soil (physical and chemical
   properties) were sampled using randomised-systematic methods within
   sampling plots. The topographic (elevation, slope, aspect, hillshade
   (i.e. a technique for showing the topographical shape of hills and
   mountains to indicate relative slopes and mountain ridges)) and climatic
   (mean temperature (MT), mean precipitation (MP), actual
   evapo-transpiration (AET) and land-surface temperature (LST)) properties
   were extrapolated using a raster-based digital elevation-model (DEM)
   map, and their values extracted at each sampling plot. SEM was then
   applied to assess the direct and indirect impacts of environmental
   factors on AGB. The AGB was directly affected by soil (41\%, P< 0.05)
   and climatic properties (34\%, P< 0.05). The effect of topographical
   factors on AGB was non-significant (P> 0.05). However, climatic
   properties were directly affected by topographical properties, with a
   path coefficient of 34\%. Among soil properties, nitrogen, phosphorus
   and potassium concentrations, silt content and soil pH were the key
   factors affecting AGB. Climatic variables (MT, MP) were equally
   effective in explaining the climate latent variable (with loading
   factors of -0.97 and 0.99 respectively) and AGB changes. This study
   highlighted the importance of soil and climatic properties in AGB
   variation. SEM simplified and revealed the complex relationships among
   ecosystem components affecting AGB, which could assist proper management
   of rangelands.},

Abstract = {Since 1990, the number of livestock in Mongolia has more than doubled.
   In large areas of Mongolia, grassland degradation is now a problem of
   national concern. A survey was done of 10 herders in two Soums
   (Altanbulag and Khashaat; heavily and moderately degraded, respectively)
   to measure the animals (sheep, goats, cattle and horse numbers, sex and
   weights) and grasslands (species and biomass) every 3 months from April
   2017 to December 2018. Rainfall is mostly in summer and mean monthly
   temperatures vary from -20 to 20 degrees C. Throughout the study, the
   grassland herbage mass in summer was less than 0.5 t dry matter/ha,
   below that considered sustainable for the steppe. Herders had 200-1000
   sheep equivalents (SE, 50 kg base weight), moved camps 2-4 times each
   year and stocking rates varied from 0.5-1 SE/ha. Female animals reached
   their mature weights by 4 years of age (sheep 50 kg, goats 40 kg, cattle
   350 kg, horses 300 kg). Animals only grew over summer, but a significant
   part of that was compensatory gain in animals >1 year old. Over winter,
   sheep and goats lost 21-29\% of their liveweight, cattle and horses
   15-30\%. The weaning rate was 43-48\% across species. The male:female
   ratio (>2 years old) was sheep 63\%, goats 72\%, cattle 27\% and horses
   106\%. All animals are managed in common mobs with no particular control
   of breeding. Areas where the efficiency of livestock production and
   grassland productivity could be improved are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to explore bird species diversity and
   conservation challenges in Lake Arekit located in the Guraghe Zone of
   Ethiopia. Point counts along the shoreline of the lake were employed to
   identify and record birds. Potential threats to the lake were identified
   through field observation and via key informant interviews. A total
   number of 56 bird species belonging to 23 families, and 11 orders were
   observed. One species, the Blue winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) was
   endemic, three species were near-endemic, and five species were
   vulnerable in their conservation status. A significantly higher number
   of species (i.e., 47) was recorded in the dry season than in the wet
   season (i.e., 24). The relative abundance of birds was also
   significantly higher during the dry season (t = 2.23, P > 0.05). The
   study also showed that Lake Arekit is under severe threats including
   urbanization with unwise waste disposals, siltation, and intensive
   agricultural expansion. Therefore, urgent stakeholder actions are
   required to save this lake and thereby the vast array of its
   biodiversity particularly the birds.},

Abstract = {Microbial biogeographical patterns in Mediterranean ecosystems are
   becoming widely documented; however, the influences of slope aspect on
   the microbial community composition and structure are poorly understood.
   This study tested the hypotheses that slope aspect and organic matter
   content would influence microbial diversity patterns and distribution.
   Sets of five soil samples were collected from different slope aspects
   (north slope, south slopes, and valley bottom) and bacterial and fungal
   communities were examined using the 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 region
   sequencing, respectively, on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Organic matter
   and soil moisture varied significantly across all sites but did not
   influence microbial diversity patterns. Community structure (Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity) indicated that each site had a distinct microbial
   community, and soil moisture along with organic matter modulated the
   community structure. Relative abundance of key bacterial taxa
   (Actinobaderia and Baderiodetes) and fungal taxa (Asconlycola was
   significantly influenced by slope aspect. Our results show, for the
   first time, that the often reported slope aspect dynamics of the soil
   microbiomes do in fact influence bacterial and fungal community
   composition and structure. Overall, taken together with previous studies
   from the region, this study provides novel insight on the
   physio-chemical properties that modulate the biogeographical patterns of
   soil microbes and contributes to our knowledge of factors that mediate
   microbial ecology in Mediterranean ecosystems.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {A generalization of Moran model of evolution is created using
   object-oriented method of modelling. A population consists of
   individuals which have a genotype and a phenotype. The genotype is
   inherited by descendants and it can mutate. The phenotype is dependent
   on the genotype. Moreover, the phenotype causes changes in the fitness
   of the individuals (natural selection which four kinds are defined and
   analysed). Evolution of the population appears spontaneously. This model
   is used to analyse how population size influence the rate of evolution.
   Evolution is manifested by two processes: the increase of the phenotype
   size (morphological evolution) and number of mutations accumulated on
   genes (molecular evolution). The rate of evolution increases if
   population size increases. An adaptive natural selection causes
   nonlinear changes in the phenotype size and number of mutations
   accumulated on genes. A competitive natural selection causes linear
   evolution. A surviving natural selection causes the faster evolution
   than a reproductive natural selection.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal pollution has become a serious global problem in soil
   contamination. Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental toxic
   pollutant to plants, which can greatly affect their growth and
   development, or even lead to their death. In the present study, we
   performed a comparative transcriptome analysis to identify the
   regulators and pathways that were involved in Cd absorption and
   transportation in the roots, leaves and fruits of wild-type and mutant
   pepper plants. A total of 883,591,943 million reads were mapped to the
   reference genome, and 33,927 genes were identified. Sample reads and the
   reference genome alignment efficiency were between 78.99\% to 84.57\%.
   Finally, 798 differentially expressed genes (Dais) were identified in
   the roots, leaves and fruits of the mutant and wild-type plants,
   including 80 up-regulated DEGs and 718 down-regulated DEGs. The DGEs
   were mostly related to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and
   glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. In addition, some vital DEGs
   were identified in absorption/transportation-related pathways, such as
   ABC transporter and P-type ATPase. The results revealed that several
   genes were related to the regulation of Cd absorption and
   transportation. Collectively, our findings provided valuable insights
   into the molecular mechanism of Cd absorption and transportation in
   pepper.},

Title = {Does a bacterial infection lead to a nutritional deficiency in foraging
   Allenby's gerbils?},
Journal = {ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Bacterial infections can have both direct (physiological) and indirect
   (ecological) costs for their hosts. The direct costs of infection may
   include nutritional deficiencies, which reduce body condition over time,
   and result in the hosts modifying their foraging behaviour to compensate
   for any losses. Allenby's gerbils are commonly infected with the
   Mycoplasma haemomuris-like bacteria, which may induce choline (essential
   vitamin) and arginine (amino acid) deficiencies. Gerbils should
   therefore alter their behaviour to make up for any shortfalls in
   nutrient production and retention. We tested two predictions. 1)
   infected gerbils would compensate for nutrient losses by spending more
   time foraging in patches, including, during riskier periods of owl
   presence, and in riskier open microhabitats. Furthermore, infected
   gerbils would preferentially forage from patches supplemented with
   choline and arginine enriched food over control food. 2) Alternatively,
   if infection did not create a nutrient deficiency, then infected
   individuals would display a similar pattern of patch use to uninfected
   individuals, and harvest similar amounts of food from supplemented and
   control patches. Our findings supported the second prediction. There was
   no observed difference in foraging behaviour between infected and
   uninfected individuals. Moreover, infected gerbils did not selectively
   forage more intensively from food patches enriched with either choline
   or arginine seed over the control patches. These results suggest that
   this bacteria-gerbil interaction does not result in a nutrient
   deficiency as observed for other Mycoplasma-rodent systems.},

Abstract = {The majority of lizard clades are ancestrally and predominantly diurnal.
   The only major taxon in which most species are nocturnal is the Gekkota
   (geckos and pygopodids). As ectothermic thermoregulators, lizard
   metabolic rates are highly temperature dependent, and diurnal lizards
   therefore demonstrate higher metabolic rates than nocturnal ones.
   Furthermore, exposure to solar radiation is thought to reduce
   ectothermic longevity by increasing both metabolic costs and the rate of
   accumulating harmful mutations through UV radiation (UVC specifically).
   In being nocturnal, ectothermic species may reduce their intrinsic
   mortality rates and thus live longer. To test this hypothesis, we
   collected literature data on the maximum longevities of 740 lizard
   species, of which 185 are geckos. We examined whether geckos live longer
   than other lizards, and whether activity time affects gecko longevity.
   While geckos live relatively long for lizards of their size, their
   activity time was found to be unrelated to longevity, contradicting our
   predictions. We suggest that diurnal species may have evolved higher
   resistance to UV radiation via thicker, more keratinized skin. Elevated
   metabolic rates do not automatically equate with faster aging. Mortality
   through extrinsic causes (e.g., predation) may impose much stronger
   selective pressures than intrinsic causes.},

Abstract = {The discovery of magnetosome and magnetotaxis in its most simple form in
   the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) had created the tremendous impetus.
   MTB, spanning multiple phyla, are distributed worldwide, and they form
   the organelles called magnetosomes for biomineralization. Eight
   phylotypes of MTB belong to Alphaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae. MTB
   show preference for specific redox and oxygen concentration. Magnetosome
   chains function as the internal compass needle and align the bacterial
   cells passively along the local geomagnetic field (GMF). The nature of
   magnetosomes produced by MTB and their phylogeny suggest that
   bullet-shaped magnetites appeared about 3.2 billion years ago with the
   first magnetosomes. All MTB contains ten genes in conserved mamAB operon
   for magnetosome chain synthesis of which nine genes are conserved in
   greigite-producing MTB. Many candidate genes identify the aero-, redox-,
   and perhaps phototaxis. Among the prokaryotes, the MTB possess the
   highest number of O-2-binding proteins. Magnetofossils serve as an
   indicator of oxygen and redox levels of the ancient environments. Most
   descendants of ancestral MTB lost the magnetosome genes in the course of
   evolution. Environmental conditions initially favored the evolution of
   MTB and expansion of magnetosome-formation genes. Subsequent changes in
   atmospheric oxygen concentration have led to changes in the ecology of
   MTB, loss of magnetosome genes, and evolution of nonMTB.},

   samples belonging to epiphytic lichens were collected. Additional 300
   and 137 samples of epiphytic lichens were used for chemical and
   toxicological analyses, respectively. The following two generally
   accepted lichen indicator indices were calculated: poleotolerance index
   (PI) and atmospheric purity index (API). When calculating the latter,
   the lichen species Xanthoria parietina was used as the baseline.
   Epiphytic lichens in small settlements were represented by 50 species
   (28 genera, 8 families). In large cities, 55 (Bryansk) and 53 (Oryol)
   species of epiphytic lichens were detected. The number of species in
   small settlements was 1.5 times lower than that of large cities. There
   were 8-15 and 25-32 species of epiphytic lichens in the central region
   and in the periphery of Bryansk, respectively. The number of epiphytic
   lichen species detected in the parks was 41. Within the territory of
   large cities, 17 species of lichens were identified as potential
   indicators, since they were found in every second or fourth sample.
   Maximum concentrations of lead were recorded in industrial areas of
   cities, as well as near major roads with traffic intersection and
   bridges and in some dormitory suburbs. This is a distinctive feature of
   large cities - the predominance of lead in lichen thalli, which is
   primarily associated with vehicles. In small cities in which there are
   no specific industrial enterprises (metallurgical plants, etc.), other
   heavy metals - manganese and iron - prevail in the thalli of lichens. In
   this work, new methods are adopted - mapping pollution with the use of
   nitrophilous epiphytic lichens that reflect the ongoing macro processes
   of nitrification in urban areas. The authors have proposed and tested
   the following lichen indicator methods: the use of indicator species
   (epiphytes-nitrophytes) of various sensitivities and the study of their
   distribution within the territory. The mapping method has been
   substantiated, which takes into account the API and zoning of
   territories according to the level of general pollution. Among the
   indicator species, Xanthoria parietina turned out to be the most
   suitable one.},

Abstract = {We describe a new species of gecko in the Lepidodactylus novaeguineae
   Group from Salawati Island, West Papua Province, Indonesia. The new
   species can be distinguished from all congeners by a unique combination
   of aspects of body size, shape, colouration, and scalation. The holotype
   and only known specimen is a mature male with a snout-vent length of
   less than 33 mm, suggesting it is the smallest species of
   Lepidodactylus; however, to confirm that, larger sample sizes of the
   nominate species and other species are required. The Lepidodactylus
   novaeguineae Group has a wide distribution across the western, northern,
   and eastern margins of New Guinea, but it seems to be most often
   associated with islands (including land-bridge islands) or geological
   terranes derived from former island arcs.},

Abstract = {1935 gecko species (and 224 subspecies) were known in December 2019 in
   seven families and 124 genera. These nearly 2000 species were described
   by similar to 950 individuals of whom more than 100 described more than
   10 gecko species each. Most gecko species were discovered during the
   past 40 years. The primary type specimens of all currently recognized
   geckos (including subspecies) are distributed over 161 collections
   worldwide, with 20 collections having about two thirds of all primary
   types. The primary type specimens of about 40 gecko taxa have been lost
   or unknown. The phylogeny of geckos is well studied, with DNA sequences
   being available for similar to 76\% of all geckos (compared to similar
   to 63\% in other reptiles) and morphological characters now being
   collected in databases. Geographically, geckos occur on five continents
   and many islands but are most species-rich in Australasia (which also
   houses the greatest diversity of family-level taxa), Southeast Asia,
   Africa, Madagascar, and the West Indies. Among countries, Australia has
   the highest number of geckos (241 species), with India, Madagascar, and
   Malaysia being the only other countries with more than 100 described
   species each. As expected, when correcting for land area, countries
   outside the tropics have fewer geckos.},

Abstract = {Citizen Science involves people as part of a scientific enquiry.
   However, in an age of great environmental changes, citizens are faced
   with degradation that affects ecosystem structure and function. Their
   role as drivers of change can be also relevant for biodiversity
   conservation. As in Citizen Science, where the citizens, properly
   trained, can initiate a widespread and fine-grained knowledge process,
   it is also possible to start a Citizen Management process, where
   citizens, adequately trained in problem solving, can change the state of
   an environmental system, with positive effects on the latter and on
   themselves. To prepare citizens for the acquisition of a problem solving
   and management paradigms, a quick meeting carried out with citizens by a
   senior manager as facilitator can be an opportunity to explain some
   basic steps: introducing them to the concept of `problem', the
   definition of a project team and SMART objectives, the use of creativity
   during brainstorming, choosing an approach to the decision-making
   process and defining a strategy (actions, times, roles, resources,
   monitoring, and adaptation). According to the Hill and Westbrook's SWOT
   approach, we suggest a list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
   threats that characterize the Citizen Management approach.},

Abstract = {Messor arenarius (Fabricius) is a harvester ant species, which is mainly
   distributed in deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. Ants of this
   species dig their nests in loess or sandy soils. In Israel, this ants'
   species is distributed in the Negev Desert and in sandy soils along the
   Mediterranean Coastal Plain. In this work, 12 sites of natural habitats
   in the Northern Coastal Plain of Israel were surveyed for surface
   activity of M. arenarius ants. These ants were found in 3 out of these
   12 natural habitats. Two of these sites where M. arenarius ants were
   found were subjected to disturbance, caused by development works during
   the period of this survey. It is concluded, that the populations of M.
   arenarius in the Northern Mediterranean Coastal Plain of Israel are
   endangered. It is also concluded, that the presence of either Artemisia
   monosperma or Retama raetam bushes in certain habitats in the Northern
   Coastal Plain of Israel, are not necessary or sufficient conditions for
   presence of M. arenarius in these same habitats.},

Volume = {67},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Traditional fish farming carried out in wetland is declining in many
   countries of Mediterranean Europe. This decline can lead to a lack of
   management of the reeds that tend to age progressively. In this work we
   compared, through a wide temporal range (2001-2019), the densities of
   four habitat-specialized birds (warblers), strictly linked to Phragmites
   australis reed-beds in a coastal wetland on the Tyrrhenian central
   Italy. In this wetland, following the abandonment of fish farming, the
   average density of reeds significantly decreased, and both the average
   reed diameter and habitat heterogeneity showed a significant increase.
   Comparing 2001 to 2019, we observed an increase in the total density of
   breeding warblers. The two species of Acrocephalus (scirpaceus and
   arundinaceus), and Cettia cetti showed a marked increase in density,
   while Cisticola juncidis showed a clear decrease. More particularly, a
   significant increase in Cettia cetti (p < 0.001) and a decrease in
   Cisticola juncidis (p < 0.05) emerged when comparing bird biomasses.
   Species diversity and evenness were more high in 2019 than in 2001. Our
   data suggest that: (i) these species could be considered indicators of
   long-term reed-bed changes and (ii) their biomass may be used as a more
   effective metric when compared to abundance.},

Abstract = {Green roofs are expected to contribute to higher biodiversity in urban
   surroundings. Typically, green roofs have been designed with low plant
   diversity. However, plant diversity can be enhanced by controlling
   resource availability and creating distinct niches. Here we hypothesize
   that by using different drainage heights during the short plant-growing
   season in a semi-arid green roof system we can create distinct niches
   and plant communities. Our experiment took place at the University of
   Haifa, north Israel. We tested three different heights of drainage
   outlet: 10 cm under the surface of the substrate (Low), 1 cm under the
   surface of the substrate (Medium) and 3 cm above the surface of the
   substrate (High) on plant species-composition in green-roof gardens.
   Grasses cover was higher in High and Medium drainages while forbs cover
   was higher in Low drainage. Species richness was the highest in Low
   drainage while diversity indices showed the opposite trend. We conclude
   that by changing the height of the drainage we can create different
   niches and change species composition in a short time period of one
   growing season. This way we can create more diverse green roof
   communities and enhance biodiversity in urban areas, particularly in
   semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play an important ecological role in arid
   and semi-arid ecosystems. So far, most studies on BSCs have focused on
   deserts, while rarely examining the successional process of BSCs in
   artificial/restored grassland. This study aimed to explore the natural
   succession and characteristics of BSCs during the recovery process of an
   artificial grassland in the Source Zone of the Yellow River. Six sites
   in two grassland types, i.e. one healthy alpine meadow and five
   artificial grasslands, were selected in Maqin county, Qinghai Province.
   These artificial grasslands have been established for varying growth
   periods ranging from 1 to 18 years. We examined vegetation
   characteristics in relation to BSC types, BSC coverage and thickness at
   these six sites. Mosses appeared at the early stage of the natural
   succession of the grassland, and lichens and visible algal crusts
   followed. The dominant moss species was Barbula unguiculate. BSC
   coverage increased significantly with recovery period. BSC thickness
   increased initially in the early stage of recovery but decreased after
   14 years of recovery. At an appropriate level (0 similar to 30\%), an
   increase in litter coverage can increase BSCs thickness, but excessive
   litter (> 30\%) can reduce BSCs coverage (P < 0.05). Therefore, an
   increase in the total coverage of vegetation and maintenance of a
   suitable litter coverage (< 30\%) are important to promote the
   establishment and succession of BSCs in recovered grasslands.},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormone levels vary within a forager based upon
   environmental stressors such as illumination and riskier habitats, and a
   forager's response to environmental variables depends upon its
   glucocorticoid levels. 1-sere, we report on a laboratory experiment in
   which we manipulated cortisol in Allenbyi's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni
   allenbyi) to test the relationship between cortisol and behavior. We
   then quantified the resulting blood cortisol levels and feeding behavior
   in gerbils. Thirty gerbils were injected with 21-day slow-release
   cortisol pellets drawn from 5 different dosages. We quantified the
   physiological response to pellet implantation in gerbils by measuring
   cortisol level in blood serum using ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
   Assay). We fed gerbils daily by mixing millet seeds into the sand inside
   rodent cages and measured the remaining seeds the following day to
   quantify feeding efforts. Some evidence supports that subcutaneous
   supplementation of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the gerbils led to higher
   blood serum levels. Cortisol levels varied according to time period of
   measurement. Gerbils that received lower dosages consumed most of the
   food presented to them when compared to those receiving the highest
   doses. In this manner, we delineate a pattern on cortisol hormone level
   variation over time following dosing and consequences in feeding
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the biodiversity and carbon (C) functions of karst forests
   is scarce. This study comprehensively compared the species diversity and
   floristic characteristics, biomass and its allocation, leaf and soil C
   and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and photosynthetic capacity of dominant
   tree species between peak clump depression (PCD)-type and plateau
   surface (PS)-type karst forests on the basis of two large plots (i.e., 1
   and 2 ha, respectively) in southwestern China. Results showed that
   PCD-type karst forest exhibits higher biodiversity and more tropical
   family and genus types than PStype karst forest. These two types of
   karst forest presented similar total biomass, but PCD-type karst forest
   allocated more biomass to supporting roots and less biomass to absorbing
   roots. PS-type karst forest had higher C/N ratios in leaves and soils
   than PCD-type karst forest. Deciduous tree species in PS-type karst
   forest had low net photosynthetic rates, resulting in lower net
   photosynthetic rate in PS-type karst forest than in PCD-type karst
   forest. Species richness and C storage in the karst morphologies would
   be considerably enhanced if degraded vegetation in different types of
   karst area could be successfully restored to forests according to
   respective morphological and vegetation features. A comprehensive
   understanding of the biodiversity and C functions of karst vegetation is
   essential to biodiversity conservation, regional C storage estimation,
   vegetation management and restoration, and potential global change
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal niche partitioning are common strategies to reduce
   competition between closely related species. While spatial partitioning
   is widely studied, temporal partitioning, especially in marine
   environments, is much less documented. The lionfish Pterois miles is
   common in the Red Sea and have recently established populations within
   the Mediterranean Sea. However, to date, the sympatric and closely
   related Pterois radiata has yet to become established outside its native
   range. In this study, we focus on describing spatio-temporal patterns of
   activity in P miles and P radiata within their native range. This may
   help understand their coexistence mechanisms and whether the presence of
   one species can influence the probability of the other species to become
   established. We used visual surveys across day and night to assess
   activity patterns and the tendency of the species to co-occur. We found
   that while P miles is a flexible crepuscular, P. radiata is strictly
   nocturnal. However, we detected only slight spatio-temporal segregation
   between the species. Hence, the coexistence of these two species may not
   be related to habitat or temporal partitioning. However, we do find a
   more generalist behavior of P miles in terms of activity duration, which
   adds to its known broad diet and habitat use patterns, and may jointly
   explain its introduction success.},

Abstract = {According to central-place-foraging theory, selectivity of central-place
   foragers to larger or more profitable food items should increase as the
   distance from their nest to the food increases. In this research it was
   checked, if the selectivity of ants of the species Messor arenarius
   (Fabricius) to larger food items increases as a function of the distance
   from their nest entrance to the food site. In food choice experiments,
   whole wheat seeds and halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally were
   offered to M. arenarius ants at the same points. These ants preferred
   halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally over whole wheat seeds, in all
   the distances from nest entrance that were checked in this research -
   1m, 5m or 10m from nest entrance. According to these findings, M.
   arenarius ants did not show increased selectivity to different wheat
   particles within a distance range of 1m- 10m from their nest entrance.
   It is possible that since the nutritional value of wheat is relatively
   high, these ants could not evaluate the nutritional value of wheat
   particles that were offered to them.},

Title = {Experimental size- and sex-specific predation on dung flies by amphibian

Abstract = {Because predator-prey interactions in nature are multifarious, linking
   phenomenological predation rates to underlying behavioral or ecological
   mechanisms is challenging. Size- and sex-specific predation has been
   implicated as a major selective force keeping animals small, directing
   the evolution of body size and sexual size dimorphism. We experimentally
   assessed predation by 4 amphibian and 3 arthropod species (bug, fly,
   spider) on 3 species of dung flies with similar ecology but contrasting
   body sizes, sexual size dimorphism, and coloration. Predators were
   offered a size range of male and/or female individuals of one prey
   species. As expected based on optimal foraging theory, some anurans
   (Bufo bufo) preferred larger prey individuals, others (Bombina
   variagata, Rana esculenta) showed no preference. Small juvenile Rana
   temporaria metamorphs preferred small prey, as did all arthropod
   predators, a pattern that may be explained by gape limitation or larger
   prey escaping better. Presumably more mobile males were not preyed upon
   more frequently or faster than cryptic females, even when conspicuously
   colored. Contrary to expectation, predation rates on flies in mixed
   groups facilitating mating activity were not higher, nor was predation
   generally sex-specific, hence contributing little to sexual dimorphism.
   We conclude that the size-selectivity of predators, and hence the
   viability selection pattern exerted on their prey, depends foremost on
   the relative body sizes of the two in a continuous fashion, in addition
   to any specific prey defense mechanisms. Therefore, the mechanistic
   study of predation requires integration of both the predator and prey
   perspectives, and phenomenological field studies of predation remain
   indispensable.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian Jackdaw is thought to be archetypically monogamous, but
   recent tagging research uncovered extra-pair copulations in the species.
   Here we examined extra-pair paternity (genetic monogamy) in Eurasian
   jackdaws breeding in the Judean Hills, Israel, at the global edge of the
   species range, using a set of highly polymorphic molecular
   microsatellites. We found roughly a sixth of nests sampled showed
   deviations from monogamy, more than previously found in DNA
   fingerprinting studies of jackdaws, suggesting a mixed mating strategy
   in this population. These findings support the trend of extra-pair
   paternity in avian species, even when social monogamy remains the rule,
   and highlight the importance of continued study of species throughout
   their geographical range.},

Abstract = {Fifty-eight percent of the 43 known species of the Bent-toed Geckos
   (Cyrtodactylus) from Myanmar are found only in karstic habitats in the
   Shan Plateau and Salween and Ayeyarwady basins. A stochastic character
   mapping analysis indicated that the occupation of karstic habitats
   evolved at least four times independently in Burmese lineages with both
   Sundaic and Indian origins. Karstic habitats not only serve as foci for
   speciation but are refugia for species extirpated from the surrounding
   forested habitats due to agricultural development. Despite the high
   levels of biodiversity and site-specific endemism in karstic habitats in
   Myanmar, they are some of the least protected ecosystems. The immense
   financial returns from unsustainable resource extraction (cement
   manufacturing) makes the challenge of legal karst conservation extremely
   difficult. Sadly, their continued exploitation for limestone shows no
   signs of abating. Until karst habitats in Myanmar are thoroughly
   investigated, a significant portion of this country's herpetological
   diversity will remain underestimated and unprotected.},

Abstract = {Quality seedlings are vital to the success of any reforestation project.
   This can be attained and improved by employing nursery management
   practices like root pruning. This study was carried out to determine the
   effect of root pruning on root growth potential and growth of kamagong
   seedlings. Three-month-old seedlings were obtained from the Learning
   Laboratory for Forestry and Agroforestry, College of Forestry and
   Natural Resources, University of the Philippines - Los Banos, where
   treatments non-root pruned and root pruned were applied to seedlings
   repotted in larger polybags. After 80 days, root pruning did not
   significantly affect height and root collar diameter growth. Shoot dry
   mass, root collar diameter, root length, total tree dry mass, sturdiness
   quotient, seedling mortality were consistent in between treatments.
   Non-root pruned seedlings yielded significantly higher root volume and
   root dry mass while root pruned seedlings have significantly higher
   shoot height, root: shoot ratio, and seedling quality index. Attainment
   of moderate Root Growth Potential (RGP) based on root length and root
   volume was influenced by root pruning. Expressions of RGP were
   positively and significantly correlated to root dry mass, sturdiness
   quotient and seedling quality index. In conclusion, root pruning of this
   critically endangered species increases its quality as planting stock.},

Abstract = {Awareness can influence consumer judgment while making a decision, and
   thus can help to restore a positive image in the marketplace. The
   present study was based on 262 green consumer samples, considering
   awareness as a direct antecedent for green consumer behaviour, and
   treating the role of attitude as an intermediary construct. Notably,
   empirical findings for this link are inconsistent. Partial Least Squares
   Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLSv3.0 was applied
   to analyze the data, while examining nine hypotheses. Despite
   discrepancies reported in past studies and although awareness was
   constantly essential but not sufficient for green behaviour, both green
   product awareness and green consumer behaviour were empirically
   significant. The study also confirmed the Attitude-Behaviour-Context
   (ABC) theory developed to interpret green behaviour on contextual
   variables, which were all empirically significant. Green attitude
   mediated the relationship between awareness and green behaviour. But it
   showed no path to the relationship between green value, green trust and
   green behaviour when examining indirect effects. This study provides new
   insights into the potential strategy that could be used to improve
   positive green behaviour. These findings can help policymaker formulate
   strategies to promote green behaviour in a circular economy like
   Malaysia.},

Title = {Taxonomic assessment of two pygopodoid gecko subspecies from Western
   Australia},

Abstract = {Subspecies designations for herpetofauna in Western Australia were
   largely coined in the 20th century where rigorous evolutionary concepts
   to species were not consistently applied. Rather, subspecies tended to
   designate geographic populations of similar-looking taxa to nominate
   forms, usually differing in size, pattern or colour and, at best, a few
   scalation differences. Here we re-evaluate two pygopodoid taxa from
   Western Australia using a combination of published and original genetic
   data coupled with a reassessment of morphology. We review these
   differences in light of an integrative taxonomic approach that looks to
   find multiple independent lines of evidence to establish the
   evolutionary independence of populations. For the pygopod species
   Pletholax gracilis, we found consistent diagnostic characters (e.g. body
   size, visibility of ear opening, scalation) and a deep genetic
   divergence between the two subspecies. We therefore raise each
   subspecies to full species: P. gracilis and P. edelensis. The two
   subspecies of the carphodactylid gecko Nephrurus wheeleri were also
   assessed, and we found strong genetic and morphological evidence (e.g.
   body size, scalation, pattern) to raise these to full species: N.
   wheeleri and N. cinctus. By revisiting Storr's morphological insights
   and newly acquired genetic evidence, in addition to a thorough
   re-examination of morphological traits, our study provides a robust
   foundation to raise Stores morphological subspecies into full species
   based upon multiple lines of evidence. Such an approach applied to other
   subspecies in the Australian herpetofauna also may result in revised
   taxonomies.},

Abstract = {Historical and contemporary processes shaping striking variation in
   terrestrial biodiversity along elevational gradients have received much
   attention from evolutionary biologists, often by way of comparisons to
   latitudinal environmental gradients. Here we synthetically review what
   is known of the diversity and origin of upland endemic geckos across the
   Malesian region (south-east Asia and Melanesia). Approximately 20\% of
   the regional gecko fauna is endemic to mountains, but only around 8\%
   have distributions centred on what we consider true montane habitats
   over 1000 metres above sea level. A majority of upland lineages lack
   close relatives in surrounding lowlands (although there are many
   exceptions) and some are highly phylogenetically divergent (e.g.,
   estimated divergence from all other gecko taxa dating to the mid-Miocene
   or earlier). In several cases upland radiations are allied to other taxa
   centred on small islands or in disturbed lowland habitats, but absent or
   exceptionally rare in most lowland rainforest areas. A number of other
   upland lineages may have originated on smaller islands that are now
   merged into larger landmasses such as Sumatra and New Guinea. Based on
   often deep phylogenetic divergences, low community diversity and
   disjunct distributions across uplands and islands, we suggest that at
   least some upland lineages are more limited by biotic interactions than
   they are by climate. As global climates continue to warm in coming
   decades, such taxa may be particularly affected by upslope shifts of
   competitors and predators from lower elevations.},

Abstract = {The present paper focuses on the ability of the European Leaf-toed
   gecko, Euleptes europaea, an endemic species of the western
   Mediterranean, to live in low-nutrient habitats. Its distribution is
   mainly insular and particularly noteworthy is its ability to live on
   islets and rocks. This work includes data originating from surveys
   carried out on 111 islands surrounding the island of Corsica (France) in
   search of herpetofauna. E. europaea is able to survive on the smallest
   islets, with low habitat complexity, suggesting a pre-adaptation of this
   species to island life. Moreover, high population densities associated
   with a low biomass seem to facilitate survival on island.},

Title = {Comparative mitochondrial phylogeography of two legless lizards

Abstract = {Sclerophyll woodlands and open forests once covered vast areas of
   eastern Australia, but have been greatly fragmented and reduced in
   extent since European settlement. The biogeographic and evolutionary
   history of the biota of eastern Australia's woodlands also remains
   poorly known, especially when compared to rainforests to the east, or
   the arid biome to the west. Here we present an analysis of patterns of
   mitochondrial genetic diversity in two species of Pygopodid geckos with
   distributions centred on the Brigalow Belt Bioregion of eastern
   Queensland. One moderately large and semi-arboreal species, Paradelma
   orientalis, shows low genetic diversity and no clear geographic
   structuring across its wide range. In contrast a small and
   semi-fossorial species, Delma torquata, consists of two moderately
   divergent clades, one from the ranges and upland of coastal areas of
   south-east Queensland, and other centred in upland areas further inland.
   These data point to varying histories of geneflow and refugial
   persistance in eastern Australia's vast but now fragmented open
   woodlands. The Carnarvon Ranges of central Queensland are also
   highlighted as a zone of persistence for cool and/or wet-adapted taxa,
   however the evolutionary history and divergence of most outlying
   populations in these mountains remains unstudied.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) is increasingly recognised as a useful tool
   for prioritising species and regions for conservation effort. Increased
   availability of spatial and phylogenetic data for reptiles now
   facilitates their inclusion in phylogenetically-informed conservation
   prioritisation efforts. Geckos are a highly divergent and diverse clads
   that comprises almost 20\% of global reptile diversity. Their global
   distribution is coincident with numerous anthropogenic threats, making
   them worthy of conservation prioritisation. Here, we combine
   phylogenetic, spatial distribution and extinction risk data for geckos
   with global human encroachment data to identify both regions and species
   representing irreplaceable gecko diversity at risk from human pressure.
   We show that high levels of irreplaceable gecko diversity are restricted
   to regions under intense human pressure, such as India, Sri Lanka and
   the Caribbean. There is a lack of extinction risk data for the western
   regions of Angola and Namibia, and yet these regions harbour high levels
   of irreplaceable diversity. At the species level, geckos display more
   unique PD than other lizards and snakes and are of greater conservation
   concern under our metric. The PD represented by Data Deficient geckos is
   at comparable risk to that of Endangered species. Finally, estimates of
   potential gecko diversity loss increase by up to 300\% when species
   lacking extinction risk data are included. Our analyses show that many
   evolutionarily unique gecko species are poorly known and are at an
   increased risk of extinction. Targeted research is needed to elucidate
   the conservation status of these species and identify conservation
   priorities.},

Abstract = {The Haynei is one of seven species aggregates (clusters of species
   having similar flower morphology) recognized in section Oncocyclus of
   genus Iris. This aggregate, characterized by dark-colored flowers, is
   represented by six species in Israel and adjacent Jordan. There is,
   however, no knowledge of the genetic relationship of these species
   making verification of their taxonomic status impossible. We
   investigated genetic variation in this group using analysis of whole
   chloroplast genomes and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP).
   We also used species distribution modeling (SDM) to predict species
   ranges under current climatic conditions. We found some population
   groups within the currently recognized species of section Oncocyclus to
   represent dramatically different genetic entities which devaluates a
   general trend of merging many previously recognized species of section
   Oncocyclus based on their flower morphology. Despite the importance of
   homoploid hybridization in this group's evolution and some apparently
   sporadically happening inter-specific gene flow, the main evolutionary
   forces in Oncocyclus appear to be vicariance and spatial isolation. Our
   findings suggest that some of the currently recognized species in
   section Oncocyclus need revision. A revision must be based on genetic
   analyses allowing the reconstruction of ancestry and recognition of the
   importance of vicariance and spatial isolation in the evolution of this
   group. The implications of the present findings for conservation are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The combined effects of two temperatures (20 degrees and 25 degrees C)

   Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata and Scenedesmus obliquus on
   the life history of Euchlanis dilatata were evaluated. Our work
   integrated: effects of temperature on the activation energy (Ea), and
   evaluation of the rate of decrease or increase through the temperature
   coefficient (Q10) in the different biological processes of the life
   table of E. dilatata, including, morphometric values and hatching egg
   percentages. The best conditions to reach the highest instantaneous
   growth rate (r) in E. dilatata were 25 degrees C fed with N. oculata (1
   x 106 cells/mL) while the lowest r value was registered with C. vulgaris
   with both temperatures. In the mean generation time and age at first
   reproduction, the Ea was higher at 20 degrees C, where Q10 values < 1
   indicate that these rates decrease with increasing the temperature. We
   found an exception to the temperature-size rule when rotifer was fed C.
   vulgaris at 25 degrees C. Moreover, the rotifer fed with S. obliquus
   reached the maximum size. Our hypothesis is that when temperature
   increase 5 degrees C, the rotifer may shorten its embryonic development,
   thereby increasing r and net reproduction rate.},

Abstract = {Species diversity-productivity relationship is often, but not always,
   scale dependent. We hypothesize that the arrangement of environmental
   heterogeneity along a rainfall gradient, as a surrogate for
   productivity, determines whether scale dependence of beetle diversity at
   our sandy sites exists. We chose seven geographically distant landscapes
   (360 kms from south to north) within a mean annual rainfall range of
   30-585mm, each having six clusters of five uniformly distributed pitfall
   traps (within a range of 0.24 km(2)). Vegetation and physical variables
   were measured within each landscape and its clusters to characterize
   both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We used species diversity of
   each cluster and the accumulative species diversity in a landscape as
   local and regional diversity, respectively. Between-clusters
   dissimilarity in diversity reflected the turnover of species within a
   landscape. We used environmental measures in each cluster and at the
   entire landscape to indicate local and regional heterogeneity,
   respectively, and changes between transects to characterize the
   within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity. Beetle diversity and
   productivity showed a unimodal pattern at both spatial scales, with a
   peak at intermediate productivity of ca. 300 mm. Envirorunental
   heterogeneity increased with productivity both at the local and at the
   landscape scales, but within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity
   did not change with productivity. Between-clusters dissimilarity in
   diversity was higher at intermediate productivity, explaining the
   unimodal pattern at the landscape scale. We suggest that the scale
   independence in our study results from the equal distribution of
   environmental heterogeneity within a landscape. We propose that the
   exploration of the diversity-productivity relationship across scales
   should consider the way heterogeneity is distributed along the
   productivity gradient.},

Abstract = {Around 6.000 plant species in China have ornamental uses. This study
   aims to identify new ornamental plant species that are able to survive
   in urban environments of China and not stand out from the landscaping
   plants growing in the local parks, gardens, and walkways. The list of
   ornamental plants includes exclusively open-ground plants. The study on
   29 wild plant species commonly found across Southern China involved
   growing plants from 9.200 seeds and measuring their survival at the
   first (herbals) and the fifth 5 year of age (shrubs and trees). Of all
   study plants, 16 showed high germination and survival rates (over 50\%)
   and can be used in park and city landscaping, whereas other specimens
   demonstrated survival rates lower than 50\%. For lianas, the number of
   species suitable for landscaping is 3. Low germination rates did not
   determine a rapid decline in survival during the first and fifth years.
   Herbals turned out to have the highest germination rates (over 50\% in 6
   out of 7 specimens). Among trees, species that may be planted together
   along sidewalks to form groves and plantations include Rex latfolia,
   Delavaya toxocarpa, and Vernicia fordii. Among vines, Trachelospermum
   jasminoides or star jasmine can be used as a tree climber. Among shrubs
   and herbals, Melastoma dodecandrum and Corydalis edulis can be planted
   in flower beds and rock gardens. This work examines plant species not
   only from the decorative prospective but also in terms of suitability
   for growing in urban conditions.},

Abstract = {Analysis of water source and moisture transfer characteristics of desert
   plants is of great significance for ecological restoration in arid
   areas. In this study, the water source utilized by the desert plant,
   Haloxylon ammodendron, was analysed using the stable isotope technique,
   and the water transportation characteristics were obtained based on the
   proportional heat balance method under different weather conditions. The
   results showed that (1) before raining, the moisture of H. ammodendron
   mainly relied on groundwater (the average contribution rate was 34.14\%)
   and on soil water located at a depth of 120-180cm (the average
   contribution rate was 29.87\%). After the rain, H. ammodendron mainly
   absorbed soil water from a depth of 60-120cm (the average contribution
   rate was 33.19\%) and groundwater (the average contribution rate was
   30.67\%); (2) the stem flow of H. ammodendron showed an obvious diurnal
   variation, showing a ``midday rest{''} phenomenon. The stem flow showed
   a peak value, and in sunny days, it was similar to 2 fold higher than
   that in cloudy days. (3) The stem flow rate of H. ammodendron varied
   regularly overtime as follows: August > July > September > June > May,
   and the meteorological factors affecting its stem flow were solar
   radiation (0.826) > atmospheric temperature (0.598) > humidity (-0.573).
   The results provide basic support for the ecological conservation of the
   desert plant H. ammodendron, while also having important implications
   for ecological restoration in arid regions.},

Abstract = {The grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, is a widespread species
   distributed in the wild and in granaries. Our earlier extensive
   biological studies indicated that the beetle shows incipient sympatric
   speciation (SS) in the wild at Evolution Canyon I (EC-I), Israel, and
   allopatric speciation, in a granary. Here we provide genome-wide
   evidence supporting our adaptive evolution scenario involving two models
   of speciation, SS in the wild, and allopatric in the granary. The EC-I
   microsite is a hot spot of SS across life from bacteria to mammals
   caused by the sharp opposite microclimates. The tropical hot, dry and
   savannoid biome dubbed the ``African{''} slope (AS), sharply contrasts
   with the opposite temperate, cool, humid, and forested biome on the
   European{''} slope (ES), separated by only similar to 250 meters. The
   third allopatric granary population is 26 km north of EC-I. The granary
   population showed larger genomic, morphological, and behavioral
   distances, smaller genome size, more unique transposable elements, and
   reproductive isolation, displaying faster genomic divergence than
   between the wild populations at EC-I. The incipient SS of the wild
   populations, and the speciation of the granary population are reinforced
   by the substantial genomic divergence among the three beetle
   populations, supporting again the evolutionary scenario of incipient SS
   with gene flow at EC-I and allopatric speciation in the granary
   population. We propose additional studies in Israel, the Mediterranean
   basin, and worldwide, to negate alternative explanations, based on a
   broader sampling and analysis.},

Title = {Pyrogenic carbon improves the physiological performance of a C-3 species
   planted on a green roof},
Journal = {ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plants utilizing C-3 physiology have a more difficult time establishing
   in rooftop environments than plants with more heat and drought adapted
   constitutions, such as species that employ crassulacean acid metabolism
   (CAM). CAM species are much less susceptible to limitations of shallow,
   infertile soil-less media under abiotic and biotic stress. It is thought
   that soil amendments might improve rooftop media in a way that allows
   for C-3 species to prosper in rooftop environments. While compost is
   typically added to media to achieve this goal, we hypothesized that the
   addition of an anthropogenic pyrogenic carbon (PyC) supplement, instead,
   would enable better organic and mineral sorption and water retention,
   resulting in improved physiological performance of C-3 species. To test
   this, we grew a C-3 legume species, wild indigo (Baptisia tinctoria
   R.Br. ex), in control compost-amended media and media amended by PyC on
   a rooftop in Massachusetts, USA. We found PyC-amended media had greater
   mean organic and mineral nutrient sorption. We also found 16\% greater
   soil water holding capacity (GWL/psi(g)) than control media. In
   addition, wild indigo photosynthetic intrinsic water use efficiency
   (iWUE) was significantly increased by 19\% when grown in PyC-amended as
   compared to control media. We conclude that amending green roof media
   with PyC provides greater benefits than compost amendments for
   colonization of a C-3 legume, wild indigo. Our results gathered over
   seven years suggest that PyC from converted waste stream cardboard could
   be used to improve the rooftop performance of other leguminous species,
   including agricultural crops.},

Abstract = {The depletion of the natural environment and earth-wide natural
   resources have led to the increasing demand for green products. This has
   made young consumers carry on the green, and as a result, it affects the
   organization's bottom line in building a positive image and goodwill
   message. This research explored the facet to investigate while applying
   some constructs from the Ajzen's existing theory of planned behaviour
   (TPB) model with additional construct. 250 viable responses were applied
   and path modelling using SmartPLS 3.0 analyses was used to establish the
   model proposed. The results indicate that among the TPB constructs,
   perceived behavioural control (PBC), green perceived attitude (GPA), and
   other contextual constructs influence pro-environmental behaviour (PEB)
   positively. Looking at the relative importance of constructs, perceived
   green culture (PGC) followed by (GPA) had a stronger impact on PEB. The
   study provides evidence that young green consumers exhibit great concern
   towards environment, through model supportability and the inclusion of
   additional constructs which was supported in the TPB providing insight,
   and holding a sense of responsibility in the consumption pattern for a
   peaceful future. The obtained results can promote scientific progress in
   the respective research area and policy implications.},

Title = {Cell-specific expression and individual function of prohormone
   convertase PC1/3 in Tribolium larval growth highlights major
   evolutionary changes between beetle and fly neuroendocrine systems},

Abstract = {Background The insect neuroendocrine system acts in the regulation of
   physiology, development and growth. Molecular evolution of this system
   hence has the potential to allow for major biological differences
   between insect groups. Two prohormone convertases, PC1/3 and PC2, are
   found in animals and both function in the processing of neuropeptide
   precursors in the vertebrate neurosecretory pathway. Whereas
   PC2-function is conserved between the fly Drosophila and vertebrates,
   ancestral PC1/3 was lost in the fly lineage and has not been
   functionally studied in any protostome. Results In order to understand
   its original functions and the changes accompanying the gene loss in the
   fly, we investigated PC1/3 and PC2 expression and function in the beetle
   Tribolium castaneum. We found that PC2 is broadly expressed in the
   nervous system, whereas surprisingly, PC1/3 expression is restricted to
   specific cell groups in the posterior brain and suboesophageal ganglion.
   Both proteases have parallel but non-redundant functions in adult
   beetles' viability and fertility. Female infertility following RNAi is
   caused by a failure to deposit sufficient yolk to the developing
   oocytes. Larval RNAi against PC2 produced moulting defects where the
   larvae were not able to shed their old cuticle. This ecdysis phenotype
   was also observed in a small subset of PC1/3 knockdown larvae and was
   strongest in a double knockdown. Unexpectedly, most PC1/3-RNAi larvae
   showed strongly reduced growth, but went through larval moults despite
   minimal to zero weight gain. Conclusions The cell type-specific
   expression of PC1/3 and its essential requirement for larval growth
   highlight the important role of this gene within the insect
   neuroendocrine system. Genomic conservation in most insect groups
   suggests that it has a comparable individual function in other insects
   as well, which has been replaced by alternative mechanisms in flies.},

Title = {Sex-specific plasticity and the nutritional geometry of
   insulin-signaling gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Background Sexual-size dimorphism (SSD) is replete among animals, but
   while the selective pressures that drive the evolution of SSD have been
   well studied, the developmental mechanisms upon which these pressures
   act are poorly understood. Ours and others' research has shown that SSD
   in D. melanogaster reflects elevated levels of nutritional plasticity in
   females versus males, such that SSD increases with dietary intake and
   body size, a phenomenon called sex-specific plasticity (SSP). Additional
   data indicate that while body size in both sexes responds to variation
   in protein level, only female body size is sensitive to variation in
   carbohydrate level. Here, we explore whether these difference in
   sensitivity at the morphological level are reflected by differences in
   how the insulin/IGF-signaling (IIS) and TOR-signaling pathways respond
   to changes in carbohydrates and proteins in females versus males, using
   a nutritional geometry approach. Results The IIS-regulated transcripts
   of 4E-BP and InR most strongly correlated with body size in females and
   males, respectively, but neither responded to carbohydrate level and so
   could not explain the sex-specific response to body size to dietary
   carbohydrate. Transcripts regulated by TOR-signaling did, however,
   respond to dietary carbohydrate in a sex-specific manner. In females,
   expression of dILP5 positively correlated with body size, while
   expression of dILP2,3 and 8, was elevated on diets with a low
   concentration of both carbohydrate and protein. In contrast, we detected
   lower levels of dILP2 and 5 protein in the brains of females fed on low
   concentration diets. We could not detect any effect of diet on dILP
   expression in males. Conclusion Although females and males show
   sex-specific transcriptional responses to changes in protein and
   carbohydrate, the patterns of expression do not support a simple model
   of the regulation of body-size SSP by either insulin- or TOR-signaling.
   The data also indicate a complex relationship between carbohydrate and
   protein level, dILP expression and dILP peptide levels in the brain. In
   general, diet quality and sex both affect the transcriptional response
   to changes in diet quantity, and so should be considered in future
   studies that explore the effect of nutrition on body size.},

Title = {Phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae: origin, structure, diversification, and
   systematic relevance},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Background Phloem wedges furrowing the wood are one of the most
   notorious, widespread types of cambial variants in Angiosperms. Many
   lianas in Malpighiaceae show these variations in the arrangement of the
   secondary tissues. Here we explore their ontogeny, structure, and
   evolution in Malpighiaceae, where phloem wedges appeared multiple times,
   showing how they have contributed to the anatomical diversification of
   the family. Using a broad sampling with 143 species from 50 genera,
   covering all major lineages in Malpighiaceae, we crossed data from
   ontogeny, stem anatomy, and phylogenetic comparative methods to
   determine ontogenetic trajectories, final anatomical architectures, and
   evolution within the most recent phylogeny for the family. Results
   Phloem wedges appeared exclusively in lianas and disappeared in shrub
   lineages nested within liana lineages. At the onset of development, the
   vascular cambium is regular, producing secondary tissues homogeneously
   across its girth, but soon, portions of the cambium in between the leaf
   insertions switch their activity producing less wood and more phloem,
   initially generating phloem arcs, which progress into phloem wedges. In
   the formation of these wedges, two ontogenetic trajectories were found,
   one that maintains the continuity of the cambium, and another where the
   cambium gets dissected. Phloem wedges frequently remain as the main
   cambial variant in several lineages, while in others there are
   additional steps toward more complex cambial variants, such as fissured
   stems, or included phloem wedges, the latter a novel type of interxylary
   phloem first described for the family. Conclusions Phloem wedges evolved
   exclusively in lianas, with two different ontogenies explaining the 10
   independent origins of phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae. The presence of
   phloem wedges has favored the evolution of even more complex cambial
   variants such as fissured stems and interxylary phloem.},

Title = {Heterochrony and repurposing in the evolution of gymnosperm seed
   dispersal units},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Background Plant dispersal units, or diaspores, allow the colonization
   of new environments expanding geographic range and promoting gene flow.
   Two broad categories of diaspores found in seed plants are dry and
   fleshy, associated with abiotic and biotic dispersal agents,
   respectively. Anatomy and developmental genetics of fleshy angiosperm
   fruits is advanced in contrast to the knowledge gap for analogous fleshy
   structures in gymnosperm diaspores. Improved understanding of the
   structural basis of modified accessory organs that aid in seed dispersal
   will enable future work on the underlying genetics, contributing to
   hypotheses on the origin of angiosperm fruits. To generate a structural
   framework for the development and evolution of gymnosperm fleshy
   diaspores, we studied the anatomy and histochemistry of Ephedra
   (Gnetales) seed cone bracts, the modified leaves surrounding the
   reproductive organs. We took an ontogenetic approach, comparing and
   contrasting the anatomy and histology of fleshy and papery-winged seed
   cone bracts, and their respective pollen cone bracts and leaves in four
   species from the South American clade. Results Seed bract fleshiness in
   Ephedra derives from mucilage accumulated in chlorenchyma cells, also
   found in the reduced young leaves before they reach their mature, dry
   stage. Cellulosic fibers, an infrequent cell type in gymnosperms, were
   found in Ephedra, where they presumably function as a source of
   supplementary apoplastic water in fleshy seed cone bracts. Papery-winged
   bract development more closely resembles that of leaves, with
   chlorenchyma mucilage cells turning into tanniniferous cells early on,
   and hyaline margins further extending into ``wings{''}. Conclusions We
   propose an evolutionary developmental model whereby fleshy and
   papery-winged bracts develop from an early-stage anatomy shared with
   leaves that differs at the pollination stage. The ancestral fleshy bract
   state may represent a novel differentiation program built upon young
   leaf anatomy, while the derived dry, papery-winged state is likely built
   upon an existing differentiation pattern found in mature vegetative
   leaves. This model for the evolution of cone bract morphology in South
   American Ephedra hence involves a novel differentiation program
   repurposed from leaves combined with changes in the timing of leaf
   differentiation, or heterochrony, that can further be tested in other
   gymnosperms with fleshy diaspores.},

Title = {Duplication and expression patterns of CYCLOIDEA-like genes in
   Campanulaceae},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Background CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like transcription factors pattern floral
   symmetry in most angiosperms. In core eudicots, two duplications led to
   three clades of CYC-like genes: CYC1, CYC2, and CYC3, with orthologs of
   the CYC2 clade restricting expression dorsally in bilaterally
   symmetrical flowers. Limited data from CYC3 suggest that they also play
   a role in flower symmetry in some asterids. We examine the evolution of
   these genes in Campanulaceae, a group that contains broad transitions
   between radial and bilateral floral symmetry and 180 degrees
   resupination (turning upside-down by twisting pedicle). Results We
   identify here all three paralogous CYC-like clades across Campanulaceae.
   Similar to other core eudicots, we show that CamCYC2 duplicated near the
   time of the divergence of the bilaterally symmetrical and resupinate
   Lobelioideae. However, in non-resupinate, bilaterally symmetrical
   Cyphioideae, CamCYC2 appears to have been lost and CamCYC3 duplicated,
   suggesting a novel genetic basis for bilateral symmetry in Cyphioideae.
   We additionally, utilized qRT-PCR to examine the correlation between
   CYC-like gene expression and shifts in flower morphology in four species
   of Lobelioideae. As expected, CamCYC2 gene expression was dorsoventrally
   restricted in bilateral symmetrical flowers. However, because
   Lobelioideae have resupinate flowers, both CamCYC2A and CamCYC2B are
   highly expressed in the finally positioned ventral petal lobes,
   corresponding to the adaxial side of the flower relative to meristem
   orientation. Conclusions Our sequences across Campanulaceae of all three
   of these paralogous groups suggests that radially symmetrical
   Campanuloideae duplicated CYC1, Lobelioideae duplicated CYC2 and lost
   CYC3 early in their divergence, and that Cyphioideae lost CYC2 and
   duplicated CYC3. This suggests a dynamic pattern of duplication and loss
   of major floral patterning genes in this group and highlights the first
   case of a loss of CYC2 in a bilaterally symmetrical group. We illustrate
   here that CYC expression is conserved along the dorsoventral axis of the
   flower even as it turns upside-down, suggesting that at least late CYC
   expression is not regulated by extrinsic factors such as gravity. We
   additionally show that while the pattern of dorsoventral expression of
   each paralog remains the same, CamCYC2A is more dominant in species with
   shorter relative finally positioned dorsal lobes, and CamCYC2B is more
   dominant in species with long dorsal lobes.},

Title = {Whole body regeneration and developmental competition in two botryllid
   ascidians},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background Botryllid ascidians are a group of marine invertebrate
   chordates that are colonial and grow by repeated rounds of asexual
   reproduction to form a colony of individual bodies, called zooids,
   linked by a common vascular network. Two distinct processes are
   responsible for zooid regeneration. In the first, called blastogenesis,
   new zooids arise from a region of multipotent epithelium from a
   pre-existing zooid. In the second, called whole body regeneration (WBR),
   mobile cells in the vasculature coalesce and are the source of the new
   zooid. In some botryllid species, blastogenesis and WBR occur
   concurrently, while in others, blastogenesis is used exclusively for
   growth, while WBR only occurs following injury or exiting periods of
   dormancy. In species such as Botrylloides diegensis, injury induced WBR
   is triggered by the surgical isolation of a small piece of vasculature.
   However, Botryllus schlosseri has unique requirements that must be met
   for successful injury induced WBR. Our goal was to understand why there
   would be different requirements between these two species. Results While
   WBR in B. diegensis was robust, we found that in B. schlosseri, new
   zooid growth following injury is unlikely due to circulatory cells, but
   instead a result of ectopic development of tissues leftover from the
   blastogenic process. These tissues could be whole, damaged, or partially
   resorbed developing zooids, and we defined the minimal amount of
   vascular biomass to support ectopic regeneration. We did find a common
   theme between the two species: a competitive process exists which
   results in only a single zooid reaching maturity following injury. We
   utilized this phenomenon and found that competition is reversible and
   mediated by circulating factors and/or cells. Conclusions We propose
   that WBR does not occur in B. schlosseri and that the unique
   requirements defined in other studies only serve to increase the chances
   of ectopic development. This is likely a response to injury as we have
   discovered a vascular-based reversible competitive mechanism which
   ensures that only a single zooid completes development. This competition
   has been described in other species, but the unique response of B.
   schlosseri to injury provides a new model to study resource allocation
   and competition within an individual.},

Title = {Evolution and expression of LEAFY genes in ferns and lycophytes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factors are present in algae
   and across land plants. The available expression and functional data of
   these genes in embryophytes suggest that LFY genes control a plethora of
   processes including the first zygotic cell division in bryophytes, shoot
   cell divisions of the gametophyte and sporophyte in ferns, cone
   differentiation in gymnosperms and floral meristem identity in flowering
   plants. However, their putative plesiomorphic role in plant reproductive
   transition in vascular plants remains untested. Results We perform
   Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses for the LFY gene lineage
   in embryophytes with expanded sampling in lycophytes and ferns. We
   recover the previously identified seed plant duplication that results in
   LEAFY and NEEDLY paralogs. In addition, we recover multiple
   species-specific duplications in ferns and lycophytes and large-scale
   duplications possibly correlated with the occurrence of whole genome
   duplication (WGD) events in Equisetales and Salviniales. To test
   putative roles in diverse ferns and lycophytes we perform LFY expression
   analyses in Adiantum raddianum, Equisetum giganteum and Selaginella
   moellendorffii. Our results show that LFY genes are active in vegetative
   and reproductive tissues, with higher expression in early fertile
   developmental stages and during sporangia differentiation. Conclusions
   Our data point to previously unrecognized roles of LFY genes in
   sporangia differentiation in lycophytes and ferns and suggests that
   functions linked to reproductive structure development are not exclusive
   to seed plant LFY homologs.},

Title = {Panarthropod tiptop/teashirt and spalt orthologs and their potential
   role as ``trunk{''}-selector genes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Background In the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, the homeodomain
   containing transcription factor Teashirt (Tsh) appears to specify trunk
   identity in concert with the function of the Hox genes. While in
   Drosophila there is a second gene closely related to tsh, called tiptop
   (tio), in other arthropods species only one copy exists (called
   tio/tsh). The expression of tsh and tio/tsh, respectively, is
   surprisingly similar among arthropods suggesting that its function as
   trunk selector gene may be conserved. Other research, for example on the
   beetle Tribolium castaneum, questions even conservation of Tsh function
   among insects. The zinc-finger transcription factor Spalt (Sal) is
   involved in the regulation of Drosophila tsh, but this regulatory
   interaction does not appear to be conserved in Tribolium either. Whether
   the function and interaction of tsh and sal as potential
   trunk-specifiers, however, is conserved is still unclear because
   comparative studies on sal expression (except for Tribolium) are
   lacking, and functional data are (if at all existing) restricted to
   Insecta. Results Here, we provide additional data on arthropod tsh
   expression, show the first data on onychophoran tio/tsh expression, and
   provide a comprehensive investigation on sal expression patterns in
   arthropods and an onychophoran. Conclusions Our data support the idea
   that tio/tsh genes are involved in the development of ``trunk{''}
   segments by regulating limb development. Our data suggest further that
   the function of Sal is indeed unlikely to be conserved in trunk vs head
   development like in Drosophila, but early expression of sal is in line
   with a potential homeotic function, at least in Arthropoda.},

Title = {Brachiopod and mollusc biomineralisation is a conserved process that was
   lost in the phoronid-bryozoan stem lineage},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background Brachiopods and molluscs are lophotrochozoans with hard
   external shells which are often believed to have evolved convergently.
   While palaeontological data indicate that both groups are descended from
   biomineralising Cambrian ancestors, the closest relatives of
   brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, are mineralised to a much lower
   extent and are comparatively poorly represented in the Palaeozoic fossil
   record. Although brachiopod and mollusc shells are structurally
   analogous, genomic and proteomic evidence indicates that their formation
   involves a complement of conserved, orthologous genes. Here, we study a
   set of genes comprised of 3 homeodomain transcription factors, one
   signalling molecule and 6 structural proteins which are implicated in
   mollusc and brachiopod shell formation, search for their orthologs in
   transcriptomes or genomes of brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, and
   present expression patterns of 8 of the genes in postmetamorphic
   juveniles of the rhynchonelliform brachiopod T. transversa. Results
   Transcriptome and genome searches for the 10 target genes in the
   brachiopods Terebratalia transversa, Lingula anatina, Novocrania
   anomala, the bryozoans Bugula neritina and Membranipora membranacea, and
   the phoronids Phoronis australis and Phoronopsis harmeri resulted in the
   recovery of orthologs of the majority of the genes in all taxa. While
   the full complement of genes was present in all brachiopods with a
   single exception in L. anatina, a bloc of four genes could consistently
   not be retrieved from bryozoans and phoronids. The genes engrailed,
   distal-less, ferritin, perlucin, sp1 and sp2 were shown to be expressed
   in the biomineralising mantle margin of T. transversa juveniles.
   Conclusions The gene expression patterns we recovered indicate that
   while mineralised shells in brachiopods and molluscs are structurally
   analogous, their formation builds on a homologous process that involves
   a conserved complement of orthologous genes. Losses of some of the genes
   related to biomineralisation in bryozoans and phoronids indicate that
   loss of the capacity to form mineralised structures occurred already in
   the phoronid-bryozoan stem group and supports the idea that mineralised
   skeletons evolved secondarily in some of the bryozoan subclades.},

Title = {Daphnia as a versatile model system in ecology and evolution},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Water fleas of the genus Daphnia have been a model system for hundreds
   of years and is among the best studied ecological model organisms to
   date. Daphnia are planktonic crustaceans with a cyclic parthenogenetic
   life-cycle. They have a nearly worldwide distribution, inhabiting
   standing fresh- and brackish water bodies, from small temporary pools to
   large lakes. Their predominantly asexual reproduction allows for the
   study of phenotypes excluding genetic variation, enabling us to separate
   genetic from non-genetic effects. Daphnia are often used in studies
   related to ecotoxicology, predator-induced defence, host-parasite
   interactions, phenotypic plasticity and, increasingly, in evolutionary
   genomics. The most commonly studied species are Daphnia magna and D.
   pulex, for which a rapidly increasing number of genetic and genomic
   tools are available. Here, I review current research topics, where the
   Daphnia model system plays a critical role.},

Title = {Fossils and plant evolution: structural fingerprints and modularity in
   the evo-devo paradigm},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Fossils constitute the principal repository of data that allow for
   independent tests of hypotheses of biological evolution derived from
   observations of the extant biota. Traditionally, transformational series
   of structure, consisting of sequences of fossils of the same lineage
   through time, have been employed to reconstruct and interpret
   morphological evolution. More recently, a move toward an updated
   paradigm was fueled by the deliberate integration of developmental
   thinking in the inclusion of fossils in reconstruction of morphological
   evolution. The vehicle for this is provided by structural
   fingerprints-recognizable morphological and anatomical structures
   generated by (and reflective of) the deployment of specific genes and
   regulatory pathways during development. Furthermore, because the
   regulation of plant development is both modular and hierarchical in
   nature, combining structural fingerprints recognized in the fossil
   record with our understanding of the developmental regulation of those
   structures produces a powerful tool for understanding plant evolution.
   This is particularly true when the systematic distribution of specific
   developmental regulatory mechanisms and modules is viewed within an
   evolutionary (paleo-evo-devo) framework. Here, we discuss several
   advances in understanding the processes and patterns of evolution,
   achieved by tracking structural fingerprints with their underlying
   regulatory modules across lineages, living and fossil: the role of polar
   auxin regulation in the cellular patterning of secondary xylem and the
   parallel evolution of arborescence in lycophytes and seed plants; the
   morphology and life history of early polysporangiophytes and
   tracheophytes; the role of modularity in the parallel evolution of
   leaves in euphyllophytes; leaf meristematic activity and the parallel
   evolution of venation patterns among euphyllophytes; mosaic deployment
   of regulatory modules and the diverse modes of secondary growth of
   euphyllophytes; modularity and hierarchy in developmental regulation and
   the evolution of equisetalean reproductive morphology. More generally,
   inclusion of plant fossils in the evo-devo paradigm has informed
   discussions on the evolution of growth patterns and growth responses,
   sporophyte body plans and their homology, sequences of character
   evolution, and the evolution of reproductive systems.},

Title = {The diversity and evolution of electric organs in Neotropical
   knifefishes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The Gymnotiformes, also known as the South American or Neotropical
   knifefishes, include the strongly electric Electrophorus electricus and
   many other weakly electric species. These fish possess specialised
   electric organs that are able to release electric discharges into the
   water, for electrolocation and communication, and sometimes for
   predation and defence. All Gymnotiform species possess a myogenic
   electric organ (mEO) derived from the muscle tissue, and members of the
   Apteronotidae family uniquely possess a neurogenic electric organ (nEOs)
   derived from the nervous tissue. A mEO may consist of `Type A'
   electrocytes that develop within the tail muscle (for example, in
   Apteronotus leptorhynchus), or `Type B' electrocytes that develop below
   the tail muscle (for example, in Brachyhypopomus gauderio). In this
   review, we discuss the diversity in the anatomy, electric discharge and
   development of electric organs found in different Gymnotiform species,
   as well as the ecological and environmental factors that have likely
   contributed to this diversity. We then describe various hypotheses
   regarding the evolution of electric organs, and discuss the potential
   evolutionary origin of the nEO: a pair of nerve cords that are located
   on either side of the aorta in B. gauderio, and which may have expanded
   and developed into a nEO in the Apteronotidae family during its
   evolution from a common ancestral species. Finally, we compare potential
   Gymnotiform phylogenies and their supporting evidence.},

Title = {Adenylate cyclase A amplification and functional diversification during
   Polyspondylium pallidum development},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: In Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddis), adenylate cyclase A
   (ACA) critically generates the cAMP oscillations that coordinate
   aggregation and morphogenesis. Unlike group 4 species like Ddis, other
   groups do not use extracellular cAMP to aggregate. However, deletion of
   cAMP receptors (cARs) or extracellular phosphodiesterase (PdsA) in
   Polyspondylium pallidum (Ppal, group 2) blocks fruiting body formation,
   suggesting that cAMP oscillations ancestrally control post-aggregative
   morphogenesis. In group 2, the acaA gene underwent several duplications.
   We deleted the three Ppal aca genes to identify roles for either gene
   and tested whether Ppal shows transient cAMP-induced cAMP accumulation,
   which underpins oscillatory cAMP signalling.
   Results: In contrast to Ddis, pre-aggregative Ppal cells did not produce
   a pulse of cAMP upon stimulation with the cAR agonist 2'H-cAMP, but
   acquired this ability after aggregation. Deletion of Ppal aca1, aca2 and
   aca3 yielded different phenotypes. aca1(-) cells showed relatively thin
   stalks, aca2(-) showed delayed secondary sorogen formation and aca3(-)
   formed less aggregation centers. The aca1(-)aca2(-) and aca1(-)aca3(-)
   mutants combined individual defects, while aca2(-)aca3(-) and
   aca1(-)aca3(-)aca2(-) additionally showed > 24 h delay in aggregation,
   with only few aggregates with fragmenting streams being formed. The
   fragments developed into small fruiting bodies with stalk and spore
   cells. Aggregation was restored in aca2(-) aca3(-) and aca1(-) aca3(-)
   aca2(-) by 2.5 mM 8Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeant activator of
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Like Ddis, Ppal sorogens also
   express the adenylate cyclases ACR and ACG. We found that prior to
   aggregation, Ddis aca(-)/ACG cells produced a pulse of cAMP upon
   stimulation with 2'H-cAMP, indicating that cAMP oscillations may not be
   dependent on ACA alone.
   Conclusions: The three Ppal replicates of acaA perform different roles
   in stalk morphogenesis, secondary branch formation and aggregation, but
   act together to enable development by activating PKA. While even an
   aca1(-) aca3(-) aca2(-) mutant still forms (some) fruiting bodies,
   suggesting little need for ACA-induced cAMP oscillations in this
   process, we found that ACG also mediated transient cAMP-induced cAMP
   accumulation. It, therefore, remains likely that post-aggregative Ppal
   morphogenesis is organized by cAMP oscillations, favouring a previously
   proposed model, where cAR-regulated cAMP hydrolysis rather than its
   synthesis dominates oscillatory behaviour.},

Title = {Comparisons of cell proliferation and cell death from tornaria larva to
   juvenile worm in the hemichordate Schizocardium californicum},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Background There are a wide range of developmental strategies in animal
   phyla, but most insights into adult body plan formation come from
   direct-developing species. For indirect-developing species, there are
   distinct larval and adult body plans that are linked together by
   metamorphosis. Some outstanding questions in the development of
   indirect-developing organisms include the extent to which larval tissue
   undergoes cell death during the process of metamorphosis and when and
   where the tissue that will give rise to the adult originates. How do the
   processes of cell division and cell death redesign the body plans of
   indirect developers? In this study, we present patterns of cell
   proliferation and cell death during larval body plan development,
   metamorphosis, and adult body plan formation, in the hemichordate
   Schizocardium californium (Cameron and Perez in Zootaxa 3569:79-88,
   2012) to answer these questions. Results We identified distinct patterns
   of cell proliferation between larval and adult body plan formation of S.
   californicum. We found that some adult tissues proliferate during the
   late larval phase prior to the start of overt metamorphosis. In
   addition, using an irradiation and transcriptomic approach, we describe
   a genetic signature of proliferative cells that is shared across the
   life history states, as well as markers that are unique to larval or
   juvenile states. Finally, we observed that cell death is minimal in
   larval stages but begins with the onset of metamorphosis. Conclusions
   Cell proliferation during the development of S. californicum has
   distinct patterns in the formation of larval and adult body plans.
   However, cell death is very limited in larvae and begins during the
   onset of metamorphosis and into early juvenile development in specific
   domains. The populations of cells that proliferated and gave rise to the
   larvae and juveniles have a genetic signature that suggested a
   heterogeneous pool of proliferative progenitors, rather than a set-aside
   population of pluripotent cells. Taken together, we propose that the
   gradual morphological transformation of S. californicum is mirrored at
   the cellular level and may be more representative of the development
   strategies that characterize metamorphosis in many metazoan animals.},

Title = {Early embryogenesis and organogenesis in the annelid Owenia fusiformis},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Background: Annelids are a diverse group of segmented worms within
   Spiralia, whose embryos exhibit spiral cleavage and a variety of larval
   forms. While most modern embryological studies focus on species with
   unequal spiral cleavage nested in Pleistoannelida (Sedentaria +
   Errantia), a few recent studies looked into Owenia fusiformis, a member
   of the sister group to all remaining annelids and thus a key lineage to
   understand annelid and spiralian evolution and development. However, the
   timing of early cleavage and detailed morphogenetic events leading to
   the formation of the idiosyncratic mitraria larva of O. fusiformis
   remain largely unexplored.
   Results: Owenia fusiformis undergoes equal spiral cleavage where the
   first quartet of animal micromeres are slightly larger than the vegetal
   macromeres. Cleavage results in a coeloblastula approximately 5 h
   post-fertilization (hpf) at 19 degrees C. Gastrulation occurs via
   invagination and completes 4 h later, with putative mesodermal
   precursors and the chaetoblasts appearing 10 hpf at the dorso-posterior
   side. Soon after, at 11 hpf, the apical tuft emerges, followed by the
   first neurons (as revealed by the expression of elav1 and
   synaptotagmin-1) in the apical organ and the prototroch by 13 hpf.
   Muscles connecting the chaetal sac to various larval tissues develop
   around 18 hpf and by the time the mitraria is fully formed at 22 hpf,
   there are FMRFamide(+) neurons in the apical organ and prototroch, the
   latter forming a prototrochal ring. As the mitraria feeds, it grows in
   size and the prototroch expands through active proliferation. The larva
   becomes competent after similar to 3 weeks post-fertilization at 15
   degrees C, when a conspicuous juvenile rudiment has formed ventrally.
   Conclusions: Owenia fusiformis embryogenesis is similar to that of other
   equal spiral cleaving annelids, supporting that equal cleavage is
   associated with the formation of a coeloblastula, gastrulation via
   invagination, and a feeding trochophore-like larva in Annelida. The
   nervous system of the mitraria larva forms earlier and is more
   elaborated than previously recognized and develops from anterior to
   posterior, which is likely an ancestral condition to Annelida.
   Altogether, our study identifies the major developmental events during
   O. fusiformis ontogeny, defining a conceptual framework for future
   investigations.},

Title = {The Nereid on the rise: Platynereis as a model system},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {The Nereid Platynereis dumerilii (Audouin and Milne Edwards (Annales des
   Sciences Naturelles 1:195-269, 1833) is a marine annelid that belongs to
   the Nereididae, a family of errant polychaete worms. The Nereid shows a
   pelago-benthic life cycle: as a general characteristic for the
   superphylum of Lophotrochozoa/Spiralia, it has spirally cleaving embryos
   developing into swimming trochophore larvae. The larvae then
   metamorphose into benthic worms living in self-spun tubes on macroalgae.
   Platynereis is used as a model for genetics, regeneration, reproduction
   biology, development, evolution, chronobiology, neurobiology, ecology,
   ecotoxicology, and most recently also for connectomics and single-cell
   genomics. Research on the Nereid started with studies on eye development
   and spiralian embryogenesis in the nineteenth and early twentieth
   centuries. Transitioning into the molecular era, Platynereis research
   focused on posterior growth and regeneration, neuroendocrinology,
   circadian and lunar cycles, fertilization, and oocyte maturation. Other
   work covered segmentation, photoreceptors and other sensory cells,
   nephridia, and population dynamics. Most recently, the unique advantages
   of the Nereid young worm for whole-body volume electron microscopy and
   single-cell sequencing became apparent, enabling the tracing of all
   neurons in its rope-ladder-like central nervous system, and the
   construction of multimodal cellular atlases. Here, we provide an
   overview of current topics and methodologies for P. dumerilii, with the
   aim of stimulating further interest into our unique model and expanding
   the active and vibrant Platynereis community.},

Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Pigmentation patterning systems are of great interest to understand how
   changes in developmental mechanisms can lead to a wide variety of
   patterns. These patterns are often conspicuous, but their origins remain
   elusive for many marine fish species. Dismantling a biological system
   allows a better understanding of the required components and the
   deciphering of how such complex systems are established and function.
   Valuable information can be obtained from detailed analyses and
   comparisons of pigmentation patterns of mutants and/or variants from
   normal patterns. Anemonefishes have been popular marine fish in
   aquaculture for many years, which has led to the isolation of several
   mutant lines, and in particular color alterations, that have become very
   popular in the pet trade. Additionally, scattered information about
   naturally occurring aberrant anemonefish is available on various
   websites and image platforms. In this review, the available information
   on anemonefish color pattern alterations has been gathered and compiled
   in order to characterize and compare different mutations. With the
   global picture of anemonefish mutants and variants emerging from this,
   such as presence or absence of certain phenotypes, information on the
   patterning system itself can be gained.},

Title = {Characterizing Hox genes in mayflies (Ephemeroptera), with Hexagenia
   limbata as a new mayfly model},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Background Hox genes are key regulators of appendage development in the
   insect body plan. The body plan of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) nymphs differs
   due to the presence of abdominal appendages called gills. Despite
   mayflies' phylogenetic position in Paleoptera and novel morphology
   amongst insects, little is known of their developmental genetics, such
   as the appendage-regulating Hox genes. To address this issue we present
   an annotated, early instar transcriptome and embryonic expression
   profiles for Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and Abdominal A proteins in
   the mayfly Hexagenia limbata, identify putative Hox protein sequences in
   the mayflies H. limbata, Cloeon dipterum, and Ephemera danica, and
   describe the genomic organization of the Hox gene cluster in E. danica.
   Results Transcriptomic sequencing of early instar H. limbata nymphs
   yielded a high-quality assembly of 83,795 contigs, of which 22,975 were
   annotated against Folsomia candida, Nilaparvata lugens, Zootermopsis
   nevadensis and UniRef90 protein databases. Homeodomain protein phylogeny
   and peptide annotations identified coding sequences for eight of the ten
   canonical Hox genes (excluding zerknullt/Hox3 and fushi tarazu) in H.
   limbata and C. dipterum, and all ten in E. danica. Mayfly Hox protein
   sequences and embryonic expression patterns of Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A
   appear highly conserved with those seen in other non-holometabolan
   insects. Similarly, the genomic organization of the Hox cluster in E.
   danica resembles that seen in most insects. Conclusions We present
   evidence that mayfly Hox peptide sequences and the embryonic expression
   patterns for Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A are extensively conserved with other
   insects, as is organization of the mayfly Hox gene cluster. The protein
   data suggest mayfly Antp, Ubx, and Abd-A play appendage promoting and
   repressing roles during embryogenesis in the thorax and abdomen,
   respectively, as in other insects. The identified expression of eight
   Hox genes, including Ubx and abd-A, in early instar nymphs further
   indicates a post-embryonic role, possibly in gill development. These
   data provide a basis for H. limbata as a complementary Ephemeridae model
   to the growing repertoire of mayfly model species and molecular
   techniques.},

Title = {Fleshy or dry: transcriptome analyses reveal the genetic mechanisms
   underlying bract development in Ephedra},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background Gnetales have a key phylogenetic position in the evolution of
   seed plants. Among the Gnetales, there is an extraordinary morphological
   diversity of seeds, the genus Ephedra, in particular, exhibits fleshy,
   coriaceous or winged (dry) seeds. Despite this striking diversity, its
   underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the
   limited studies in gymnosperms. Expanding the genomic and developmental
   data from gymnosperms contributes to a better understanding of seed
   evolution and development. Results We performed transcriptome analyses
   on different plant tissues of two Ephedra species with different seed
   morphologies. Anatomical observations in early developing ovules, show
   that differences in the seed morphologies are established early in their
   development. The transcriptomic analyses in dry-seeded Ephedra
   californica and fleshy-seeded Ephedra antisyphilitica, allowed us to
   identify the major differences between the differentially expressed
   genes in these species. We detected several genes known to be involved
   in fruit ripening as upregulated in the fleshy seed of Ephedra
   antisyphilitica. Conclusions This study allowed us to determine the
   differentially expressed genes involved in seed development of two
   Ephedra species. Furthermore, the results of this study of seeds with
   the enigmatic morphology in Ephedra californica and Ephedra
   antisyphilitica, allowed us to corroborate the hypothesis which suggest
   that the extra envelopes covering the seeds of Gnetales are not
   genetically similar to integument. Our results highlight the importance
   of carrying out studies on less explored species such as gymnosperms, to
   gain a better understanding of the evolutionary history of plants.},

Title = {Post-metamorphic skeletal growth in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus
   and implications for body plan evolution},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background: Understanding the molecular and cellular processes that
   underpin animal development are crucial for understanding the diversity
   of body plans found on the planet today. Because of their abundance in
   the fossil record, and tractability as a model system in the lab,
   skeletons provide an ideal experimental model to understand the origins
   of animal diversity. We herein use molecular and cellular markers to
   understand the growth and development of the juvenile sea urchin
   (echinoid) skeleton.
   Results: We developed a detailed staging scheme based off of the first-4
   weeks of post-metamorphic life of the regular echinoid Paracentrotus
   lividus. We paired this scheme with immunohistochemical staining for
   neuronal, muscular, and skeletal tissues, and fluorescent assays of
   skeletal growth and cell proliferation to understand the molecular and
   cellular mechanisms underlying skeletal growth and development of the
   sea urchin body plan.
   Conclusions: Our experiments highlight the role of skeletogenic proteins
   in accretionary skeletal growth and cell proliferation in the addition
   of new metameric tissues. Furthermore, this work provides a framework
   for understanding the developmental evolution of sea urchin body plans
   on macroevolutionary timescales.},

Title = {The red flour beetle T. castaneum: elaborate genetic toolkit and
   unbiased large scale RNAi screening to study insect biology and
   evolution},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum has emerged as an important
   insect model system for a variety of topics. With respect to studying
   gene function, it is second only to the vinegar fly D. melanogaster. The
   RNAi response in T. castaneum is exceptionally strong and systemic, and
   it appears to target all cell types and processes. Uniquely for emerging
   model organisms, T. castaneum offers the opportunity of performing time-
   and cost-efficient large-scale RNAi screening, based on commercially
   available dsRNAs targeting all genes, which are simply injected into the
   body cavity. Well established transgenic and genome editing approaches
   are met by ease of husbandry and a relatively short generation time.
   Consequently, a number of transgenic tools like UAS/Gal4, Cre/Lox,
   imaging lines and enhancer trap lines are already available. T.
   castaneum has been a genetic experimental system for decades and now has
   become a workhorse for molecular and reverse genetics as well as in vivo
   imaging. Many aspects of development and general biology are more
   insect-typical in this beetle compared to D. melanogaster. Thus,
   studying beetle orthologs of well-described fly genes has allowed
   macro-evolutionary comparisons in developmental processes such as axis
   formation, body segmentation, and appendage, head and brain development.
   Transgenic approaches have opened new ways for in vivo imaging.
   Moreover, this emerging model system is the first choice for research on
   processes that are not represented in the fly, or are difficult to study
   there, e.g. extraembryonic tissues, cryptonephridial organs, stink gland
   function, or dsRNA-based pesticides.},

Title = {Duplication of spiralian-specific TALE genes and evolution of the
   blastomere specification mechanism in the bivalve lineage},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Background Despite the conserved pattern of the cell-fate map among
   spiralians, bivalves display several modified characteristics during
   their early development, including early specification of the D
   blastomere by the cytoplasmic content, as well as the distinctive fate
   of the 2d blastomere. However, it is unclear what changes in gene
   regulatory mechanisms led to such changes in cell specification
   patterns. Spiralian-TALE (SPILE) genes are a group of spiralian-specific
   transcription factors that play a role in specifying blastomere cell
   fates during early development in limpets. We hypothesised that the
   expansion of SPILE gene repertoires influenced the evolution of the
   specification pattern of blastomere cell fates. Results We performed a
   transcriptome analysis of early development in the purplish bifurcate
   mussel and identified 13 SPILE genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the SPILE
   gene in molluscs suggested that duplications of SPILE genes occurred in
   the bivalve lineage. We examined the expression patterns of the SPILE
   gene in mussels and found that some SPILE genes were expressed in
   quartet-specific patterns, as observed in limpets. Furthermore, we found
   that several SPILE genes that had undergone gene duplication were
   specifically expressed in the D quadrant, C and D quadrants or the 2d
   blastomere. These expression patterns were distinct from the expression
   patterns of SPILE in their limpet counterparts. Conclusions These
   results suggest that, in addition to their ancestral role in quartet
   specification, certain SPILE genes in mussels contribute to the
   specification of the C and D quadrants. We suggest that the expansion of
   SPILE genes in the bivalve lineage contributed to the evolution of a
   unique cell fate specification pattern in bivalves.},

Title = {Distinct tooth regeneration systems deploy a conserved battery of genes},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Vertebrate teeth exhibit a wide range of regenerative
   systems. Many species, including most mammals, reptiles, and amphibians,
   form replacement teeth at a histologically distinct location called the
   successional dental lamina, while other species do not employ such a
   system. Notably, a lamina-less'tooth replacement condition is found in a
   paraphyletic array of ray-finned fishes, such as stickleback, trout,
   cod, medaka, and bichir. Furthermore, the position, renewal potential,
   and latency times appear to vary drastically across different vertebrate
   tooth regeneration systems. The progenitor cells underlying tooth
   regeneration thus present highly divergent arrangements and potentials.
   Given the spectrum of regeneration systems present in vertebrates, it is
   unclear if morphologically divergent tooth regeneration systems deploy
   an overlapping battery of genes in their naive dental tissues.
   Results: In the present work, we aimed to determine whether or not tooth
   progenitor epithelia could be composed of a conserved cell type between
   vertebrate dentitions with divergent regeneration systems. To address
   this question, we compared the pharyngeal tooth regeneration processes
   in two ray-finned fishes: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and three-spine
   stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These two teleost species diverged
   approximately 250 million years ago and demonstrate some stark
   differences in dental morphology and regeneration. Here, we find that
   the naive successional dental lamina in zebrafish expresses a battery of
   nine genes (bmpr1aa, bmp6, cd34, gli1, igfbp5a, Igr4, Igr6, nfatc1, and
   pitx2), while active Wnt signaling and Lef1 expression occur during
   early morphogenesis stages of tooth development. We also find that,
   despite the absence of a histologically distinct successional dental
   lamina in stickleback tooth fields, the same battery of nine genes
   (Bmpr1a, Bmp6, CD34, Gli1, igfbp5a, Lgr4, Lgr6, Nfatc1 , and Pitx2) are
   expressed in the basalmost endodermal cell layer, which is the region
   most closely associated with replacement tooth germs. Like zebrafish,
   stickleback replacement tooth germs additionally express Lef1 and
   exhibit active Wnt signaling. Thus, two fish systems that either have an
   organized successional dental lamina (zebrafish) or lack a
   morphologically distinct successional dental lamina (sticklebacks)
   deploy similar genetic programs during tooth regeneration.
   Conclusions: We propose that the expression domains described here
   delineate a highly conserved ``successional dental epithelium{''} (SDE).
   Furthermore, a set of orthologous genes is known to mark hair follicle
   epithelial stem cells in mice, suggesting that regenerative systems in
   other epithelial appendages may utilize a related epithelial progenitor
   cell type, despite the highly derived nature of the resulting functional
   organs.},

Title = {Distal-less and spalt are distal organisers of pierid wing patterns},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Two genes, Distal-less (Dll) and spalt (sal), are known to be involved
   in establishing nymphalid butterfly wing patterns. They function in
   several ways: in the differentiation of the eyespot's central signalling
   cells, or foci; in the differentiation of the surrounding black disc; in
   overall scale melanisation (Dll); and in elaborating marginal patterns,
   such as parafocal elements. However, little is known about the functions
   of these genes in the development of wing patterns in other butterfly
   families. Here, we study the expression and function of Dll and sal in
   the development of spots and other melanic wing patterns of the Indian
   cabbage white, Pieris canidia, a pierid butterfly. In P. canidia, both
   Dll and Sal proteins are expressed in the scale-building cells at the
   wing tips, in chevron patterns along the pupal wing margins, and in
   areas of future scale melanisation. Additionally, Sal alone is expressed
   in the future black spots. CRISPR knockouts of Dll and sal showed that
   each gene is required for the development of melanic wing pattern
   elements, and repressing pteridine granule formation, in the areas where
   they are expressed. We conclude that both genes likely play ancestral
   roles in organising distal butterfly wing patterns, across pierid and
   nymphalid butterflies, but are unlikely to be differentiating signalling
   centres in pierids black spots. The genetic and developmental mechanisms
   that set up the location of spots and eyespots are likely distinct in
   each lineage.},

Abstract = {Background Understanding the relationship between macroevolutionary
   diversity and variation in organism development is an important goal of
   evolutionary biology. Variation in the morphology of several plant and
   animal lineages is attributed to pedomorphosis, a case of heterochrony,
   where an ancestral juvenile shape is retained in an adult descendant.
   Pedomorphosis facilitated morphological adaptation in different plant
   lineages, but its cellular and molecular basis needs further
   exploration. Plant development differs from animal development in that
   cells are enclosed by cell walls and do not migrate. Moreover, in many
   plant lineages, the differentiated epidermis of leaves, and leaf-derived
   structures, such as petals, limits organ growth. We, therefore, proposed
   that pedomorphosis in leaves, and in leaf-derived structures, results
   from delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to
   reproductive maturity. This idea was explored for petal evolution, given
   the importance of corolla morphology for angiosperm reproductive
   success. Results By comparing cell morphology and transcriptional
   profiles between 5 mm flower buds and mature flowers of an entomophile
   and an ornitophile Loasoideae species (a lineage that experienced
   transitions from bee- to hummingbird-pollination), we show that
   evolution of pedomorphic petals of the ornithophile species likely
   involved delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to
   flower maturity. We also found that developmental mechanisms other than
   pedomorphosis might have contributed to evolution of corolla morphology.
   Conclusions Our results highlight a need for considering alternatives to
   the flower-centric perspective when studying the origin of variation in
   flower morphology, as this can be generated by developmental processes
   that are also shared with leaves.},

Title = {Case not closed: the mystery of the origin of the carpel},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The carpel is a fascinating structure that plays a critical role in
   flowering plant reproduction and contributed greatly to the evolutionary
   success and diversification of flowering plants. The remarkable feature
   of the carpel is that it is a closed structure that envelopes the ovules
   and after fertilization develops into the fruit which protects, helps
   disperse, and supports seed development into a new plant. Nearly all
   plant-based foods are either derived from a flowering plant or are a
   direct product of the carpel. Given its importance it's no surprise that
   plant and evolutionary biologists have been trying to explain the origin
   of the carpel for a long time. Before carpel evolution seeds were
   produced on open leaf-like structures that are exposed to the
   environment. When the carpel evolved in the stem lineage of flowering
   plants, seeds became protected within its closed structure. The
   evolutionary transition from that open precursor to the closed carpel
   remains one of the greatest mysteries of plant evolution. In recent
   years, we have begun to complete a picture of what the first carpels
   might have looked like. On the other hand, there are still many gaps in
   our understanding of what the precursor of the carpel looked like and
   what changes to its developmental mechanisms allowed for this
   evolutionary transition. This review aims to present an overview of
   existing theories of carpel evolution with a particular emphasis on
   those that account for the structures that preceded the carpel and/or
   present testable developmental hypotheses. In the second part insights
   from the development and evolution of diverse plant organs are gathered
   to build a developmental hypothesis for the evolutionary transition from
   a hypothesized laminar open structure to the closed structure of the
   carpel.},

Title = {A chelicerate Wnt gene expression atlas: novel insights into the
   complexity of arthropod Wnt-patterning},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {The Wnt genes represent a large family of secreted glycoprotein ligands
   that date back to early animal evolution. Multiple duplication events
   generated a set of 13 Wnt families of which 12 are preserved in
   protostomes. Embryonic Wnt expression patterns (Wnt-patterning) are
   complex, representing the plentitude of functions these genes play
   during development. Here, we comprehensively investigated the embryonic
   expression patterns of Wnt genes from three species of spiders covering
   both main groups of true spiders, Haplogynae and Entelegynae, a
   mygalomorph species (tarantula), as well as a distantly related
   chelicerate outgroup species, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. All
   spiders possess the same ten classes of Wnt genes, but retained
   partially different sets of duplicated Wnt genes after whole genome
   duplication, some of which representing impressive examples of sub- and
   neo-functionalization. The harvestman, however, possesses a more
   complete set of 11 Wnt genes but with no duplicates. Our comprehensive
   data-analysis suggests a high degree of complexity and evolutionary
   flexibility of Wnt-patterning likely providing a firm network of
   mutational protection. We discuss the new data on Wnt gene expression in
   terms of their potential function in segmentation, posterior elongation,
   and appendage development and critically review previous research on
   these topics. We conclude that earlier research may have suffered from
   the absence of comprehensive gene expression data leading to partial
   misconceptions about the roles of Wnt genes in development and
   evolution.},

Title = {A CYC-RAD-DIV-DRIF interaction likely pre-dates the origin of floral
   monosymmetry in Lamiales},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Background An outstanding question in evolutionary biology is how
   genetic interactions defining novel traits evolve. They may evolve
   either by de novo assembly of previously non-interacting genes or by en
   bloc co-option of interactions from other functions. We tested these
   hypotheses in the context of a novel phenotype-Lamiales flower
   monosymmetry-defined by a developmental program that relies on
   regulatory interaction among CYCLOIDEA, RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF
   gene products. In Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon), representing Lamiales,
   we tested whether components of this program likely function beyond
   their previously known role in petal and stamen development. In Solanum
   lycopersicum (tomato), representing Solanales which diverged from
   Lamiales before the origin of Lamiales floral monosymmetry, we
   additionally tested for regulatory interactions in this program. Results
   We found that RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF are expressed in snapdragon
   ovaries and developing fruit, similar to their homologs during tomato
   fruit development. In addition, we found that a tomato CYCLOIDEA
   ortholog positively regulates a tomato RADIALIS ortholog. Conclusion Our
   results provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that the
   developmental program defining floral monosymmetry in Lamiales was
   co-opted en bloc from a function in carpel development. This expands our
   understanding of novel trait evolution facilitated by co-option of
   existing regulatory interactions.},

Title = {Insights into how development and life-history dynamics shape the
   evolution of venom},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Venomous animals are a striking example of the convergent evolution of a
   complex trait. These animals have independently evolved an apparatus
   that synthesizes, stores, and secretes a mixture of toxic compounds to
   the target animal through the infliction of a wound. Among these
   distantly related animals, some can modulate and compartmentalize
   functionally distinct venoms related to predation and defense. A process
   to separate distinct venoms can occur within and across complex life
   cycles as well as more streamlined ontogenies, depending on their
   life-history requirements. Moreover, the morphological and cellular
   complexity of the venom apparatus likely facilitates the functional
   diversity of venom deployed within a given life stage. Intersexual
   variation of venoms has also evolved further contributing to the massive
   diversity of toxic compounds characterized in these animals. These
   changes in the biochemical phenotype of venom can directly affect the
   fitness of these animals, having important implications in their diet,
   behavior, and mating biology. In this review, we explore the current
   literature that is unraveling the temporal dynamics of the venom system
   that are required by these animals to meet their ecological functions.
   These recent findings have important consequences in understanding the
   evolution and development of a convergent complex trait and its
   organismal and ecological implications.},

Title = {Among the shapeshifters: parasite-induced morphologies in ants
   (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) and their relevance within the EcoEvoDevo
   framework},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {As social insects, ants represent extremely interaction-rich biological
   systems shaped by tightly integrated social structures and constant
   mutual exchange with a multitude of internal and external environmental
   factors. Due to this high level of ecological interconnection, ant
   colonies can harbour a diverse array of parasites and pathogens, many of
   which are known to interfere with the delicate processes of ontogeny and
   caste differentiation and induce phenotypic changes in their hosts.
   Despite their often striking nature, parasite-induced changes to host
   development and morphology have hitherto been largely overlooked in the
   context of ecological evolutionary developmental biology (EcoEvoDevo).
   Parasitogenic morphologies in ants can, however, serve as ``natural
   experiments{''} that may shed light on mechanisms and pathways relevant
   to host development, plasticity or robustness under environmental
   perturbations, colony-level effects and caste evolution. By assessing
   case studies of parasites causing morphological changes in their ant
   hosts, from the eighteenth century to current research, this review
   article presents a first overview of relevant host and parasite taxa.
   Hypotheses about the underlying developmental and evolutionary
   mechanisms, and open questions for further research are discussed. This
   will contribute towards highlighting the importance of parasites of
   social insects for both biological theory and empirical research and
   facilitate future interdisciplinary work at the interface of
   myrmecology, parasitology, and the EcoEvoDevo framework.},

Title = {Linking the evolution of development of stem vascular system in
   Nyctaginaceae and its correlation to habit and species diversification},
Journal = {EVODEVO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background Alternative patterns of secondary growth in stems of
   Nyctaginaceae is present in all growth habits of the family and have
   been known for a long time. However, the interpretation of types of
   cambial variants have been controversial, given that different authors
   have given them different developmental interpretations. The different
   growth habits coupled with an enormous stem anatomical diversity offers
   the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of complex
   developments, to address how these anatomies shifted within habits, and
   how the acquisition of novel cambial variants and habit transitions
   impacted the diversification of the family. Methods We integrated
   developmental data with a phylogenetic framework to investigate the
   diversity and evolution of stem anatomy in Nyctaginaceae using
   phylogenetic comparative methods, reconstructing ancestral states, and
   examining whether anatomical shifts correspond to species
   diversification rate shifts in the family. Results Two types of cambial
   variants, interxylary phloem and successive cambia, were recorded in
   Nyctaginaceae, which result from four different ontogenies. These
   ontogenetic trajectories depart from two distinct primary vascular
   structures (regular or polycyclic eustele) yet, they contain shared
   developmental stages which generate stem morphologies with deconstructed
   boundaries of morphological categories (continuum morphology). Unlike
   our a priori hypotheses, interxylary phloem is reconstructed as the
   ancestral character for the family, with three ontogenies characterized
   as successive cambia evolving in few taxa. Cambial variants are not
   contingent on habits, and their transitions are independent from species
   diversification. Conclusions Our findings suggest that multiple
   developmental mechanisms, such as heterochrony and heterotopy, generate
   the transitions between interxylary phloem and successive cambia.
   Intermediate between these two extremes are present in Nyctaginaceae,
   suggesting a continuum morphology across the family as a generator of
   anatomical diversity.},

Abstract = {Dermacentor marginatus is a vector disease of both humans and animals
   and transmits the causative agents of Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) and
   the spotted fever group (Rickettsia raoultii and R. slovaca), as well as
   of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Dermacentor reticulatus can transmit
   various pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Babesia spp., tick
   encephalitis virus, Coxiella burnetii, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, and
   Rickettsia spp. and can cause serious skin lesions. Herein, ecological
   niche modeling (ENM) is used to characterize the niches of these two
   ticks and describe their potential distributional patterns under both
   current and future climate conditions, as a means of highlighting
   geographic distributional shifts that may be of public health
   importance. We assessed distributional implications of five general
   circulation models (GCMs), under two shared socioeconomic pathways
   (SSP245 and SSP585) for the period 2041-2060. Predictions for D.
   marginatus showed broad suitable areas across western, central, and
   southern Europe, with potential for expansion in northern and eastern
   Europe. Dermacentor reticulatus has suitable areas across western,
   central, and northern Europe. Under future scenarios, new expansions
   were observed in parts of northern and eastern Europe and highland areas
   in central Europe. Despite broad overlap between the niches of the
   ticks, D. marginatus has a broader niche, which allows it to show
   greater stability in the face of the changing climate conditions. Areas
   of potential geographic distributional expansion for these species
   should be monitored for actual distributional shifts, which may have
   implications for public health in those regions.},

Abstract = {Herbivory can induce changes in flower traits influencing the community
   of flower-visiting insects and ultimately impacting the plant's
   reproductive output. Here, we investigated how leaf herbivory on sweet
   pepper plants, Capsicum annuum L., by Diabrotica speciosa (Germar)
   adults influences the community of insect floral visitors and alters
   plant reproduction. In an experimental field, we found that flowers of
   herbivore-infested plants were less visited by insects than those of
   uninfested plants. A similar pattern was found for the abundance of the
   three most common species of floral visitors in the collections, Apis
   mellifera (Linnaeus), Toxomerus sp.1, and Trigona spinipes (Fabricius).
   The insect community associated with the flowers of herbivore-infested
   plants was distinct, less rich, and diverse than that of uninfested
   plants. Leaf herbivory also impacted flower abundance that likely
   influenced the visual attraction of insects. The changes in
   flower-visiting insect community associated with herbivore-infested
   plants coincided with a reduced number of fruits, which were smaller and
   contained fewer seeds than those from uninfested plants. Our results
   suggest that leaf herbivory by D. speciosa results in direct and
   indirect costs to the plants through modifications in abundance and
   composition of flower-visiting insect community.},

Abstract = {Numerous temperate peatlands are currently experiencing an accelerated
   process of woody encroachment. Such encroachment may have harmful
   impacts on peatland biodiversity and functions. Our objective was to
   investigate the recent history of woody encroachment in a temperate bog
   using plant macrofossil, testate amoeba, aerial photograph analyses, and
   plant inventories. We also explored some plausible triggering drivers of
   the phenomenon and its impacts on plant richness, composition, and beta
   diversity. We showed that the recent woody encroachment was mainly
   associated with the native Betula populifolia and the exotic Frangula
   alnus. It began in the 1960s at the bog margins following a decrease in
   the water table and recurrent fire events, both likely associated with
   agricultural activities in the surrounding catchment. We found an
   increase in species richness with tree cover and basal area, but no
   effect of tree encroachment on beta diversity. Still, we found a
   significant compositional turnover from light-demanding bog specialists
   to terrestrial, exotic or ruderal species with tree basal area. It seems
   unlikely that the bog will naturally come back to its previous
   unforested state on a human life's timescale as the observed changes are
   related to regional factors rather than in situ disturbance.},

Abstract = {We examined the changes in tropical forest diversity, structure and
   trait composition during primary succession after volcanic disturbance.
   Whilst many studies have examined early stages of succession, fewer have
   looked at a precisely dated older location: 200 years old in this
   instance. To do this, we established a 0.5 ha plot on the lower slopes
   of Gunung (Mount) Tambora (Sumbawa, Indonesia) in which we enumerated
   and identified all trees >= 10 cm dbh, determined their key traits and
   calculated forest above-ground biomass. Saplings (1.5-3.0 cm dbh) were
   enumerated in one quarter of this area. We recorded 214 stems >= 10 cm
   dbh within 21 taxa contributing to an above-ground biomass of 135 Mg
   ha(-1). Most trees had light wood and broad distributions suggestive of
   early successional traits, but leaves were generally small; most trees
   were insect pollinated and animal dispersed as expected at later stages
   of succession. Saplings were variable in their density and showed some
   floristic similarity with adult trees, but differences indicated the
   future trajectory of succession. Our floristic and structural data from
   the poorly studied drier forests of eastern Indonesia show that this
   200-year-old forest is still undergoing succession at a slow rate.},

Abstract = {Numerical simulations were carried out based on a conceptual
   cryohydrogeological model of a permafrost mound near Umiujaq, Nunavik
   (Quebec), Canada, to assess the impacts of climate warming and changes
   in surface conditions on permafrost degradation. The 2D model includes
   groundwater flow, advective-conductive heat transport, phase change and
   latent heat. Changes in surface conditions which are characteristic of
   the site were represented empirically in the model by applying
   spatially- and temporally-variable ground surface temperatures derived
   from linear regressions between monitored surface and air temperatures.
   After reaching a transient steady-state condition close to present-day
   conditions, the simulations were then extended to 2100 under
   hypothetical climate warming scenarios and using imposed changes in
   surface conditions consistent with observed on-site evolution. The
   simulations show that the development of a thermokarst pond and
   shrubification respectively induce ground warming of up to 0.5 degrees C
   and 1.5 degrees C, upward migration of the permafrost base by up to 2
   and 4 m, and a decrease in the lateral permafrost extent of 1 and 7 m,
   relative to a reference case without changes in surface conditions.
   Feedback from permafrost degradation which drives changes in ground
   surface conditions should be included in future numerical modelling of
   permafrost dynamics.},

Abstract = {Estimating the resilience time of an ecosystem may lead to different
   values depending on the compartment or function of interest and the
   measurement method. We sought to estimate the resilience of a cork oak
   (Quercus suber L.) stand - a typical west Mediterranean forest type - 8
   years after a wildfire, using three independent indicators. Each
   represents a function or a characteristic of the ecosystem: (i) the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a remote sensing-based
   proxy of photosynthetic activity, (ii) the vegetation profile, based on
   an estimation of the vegetation cover at different heights above ground,
   and (iii) the avifauna composition, a component of animal biodiversity.
   The NDVI seems to have recovered a value close to its pre-fire value
   about 9 years after the fire. Recovering a vertical vegetation profile
   similar to that before the fire requires a longer time, tentatively
   estimated to not less than a dozen years. Recovery of the pre-fire
   avifauna is likely to require an even longer time, which could not be
   estimated from our 8-year monitoring period. The indicator based on
   avifauna appears to be the most discriminating indicator, among the
   three compared here, for estimating the time required for full recovery
   of the ecosystem over the long term.},

Abstract = {Calicioid lichens and fungi form a diverse polyphyletic group whose
   species richness is often associated with old-growth forests and
   ecological continuity. One of the last intact forest landscapes south of
   the 50th parallel in Quebec includes the Ya'nienhonhndeh territory,
   which has been the focus of a protected area project directed by the
   Huron-Wendat First Nation for more than ten years. To contribute to the
   characterization of its conservation value, we report the calicioids
   from the area. We identified 34 species in eight genera from 187 samples
   collected in old-growth stands of balsam fir, black spruce and yellow
   birch. Our four most remarkable discoveries are Chaenotheca nitidula
   Tibell (n = 11), Chaenothecopsis australis Tibell (n = 1), and C. tsugae
   Rikkinen (n = 2), which are reported for the first time from the
   province, as well as Sclerophora coniophaea (Norman) Mattsson \&
   Middelb. (n = 18), which is rare in North America and was previously
   reported only once in Quebec. As a result of this inventory, the
   Ya'nienhonhndeh is now the second richest area known for calicioids in
   Quebec, after Parc national de la Gaspesie. We conclude that it is an
   ancient forest ecosystem whose conservation value is high based on its
   unique biodiversity, and that it warrants protection.},

Abstract = {The induction of biocrusts through inoculation-based techniques has
   gained increasing scientific attention in the last 2 decades due to its
   potential to address issues related to soil degradation and
   desertification. The technology has shown the most rapid advances in the
   use of biocrust organisms, particularly cyanobacteria and mosses, as
   inoculants and biocrust initiators. Cyanobacteria and mosses are
   poikilohydric organisms - i.e., desiccation-tolerant organisms capable
   of reactivating their metabolism upon rehydration - that can settle on
   bare soils in abiotically stressing habitats, provided that selected
   species are used and an appropriate and customized protocol is applied.
   The success of inoculation of cyanobacteria and mosses depends on the
   inoculant's physiology, but also on the ability of the practitioner to
   identify and control, with appropriate technical approaches in each case
   study, those environmental factors that most influence the inoculant
   settlement and its ability to develop biocrusts.
   This review illustrates the current knowledge and results of biocrust
   induction biotechnologies that use cyanobacteria or mosses as
   inoculants. At the same time, this review's purpose is to highlight the
   current technological gaps that hinder an efficient application of the
   technology in the field.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests play an important role in the storing of
   significant amounts of biomass and carbon. However, carbon storage in
   these forests is linked to biotic, edaphic and climatic factors as well
   as human interventions. The forest structure and carbon storage in
   relation to human interventions and soil properties were studied in
   tropical dry forest patches located in a transition region of the
   Similipal Biosphere Reserve, India. Random sampling of vegetation and
   soil was done in 30 plots of 50 x 20 m in size. A total of 41 adult tree
   species, 50 juvenile tree species and 28 climber species were recorded
   within the study area. The average carbon stock of the forest was 179.54
   +/- 9.56 Mg ha(-1), of which adult trees were the highest contributors
   (55\%) followed by soil organic carbon (36\%), woody climbers (6\%) and
   juvenile trees (3\%). There was a significant effect of lopping, cutting
   of trees and soil properties on forest structure and carbon stock. This
   study confirms that anthropogenic disturbances and edaphic factors play
   a significant role in the variation of carbon stocks of biomass and
   soils in the forest.},

Abstract = {Biological soil crust (BSC) is an essential part of arid and semiarid
   regions; however information concerning the spatial heterogeneity of the
   interactions between crust, plants and soil microbes is limited.
   Sampling was confined to an area either covered with Erica spp. shrubs
   interspaced by crust cover (Cladonia rangiformis) or uncovered by crust.
   Along a straight line of 100 cm from the base of the shrubs towards
   their periphery and at successive distances of 20 cm, soil samples were
   collected once. The biomass, the composition and the network of
   interactions among the members of the soil microbial communities as well
   as the activity of soil enzymes involved in the C, N and P cycle were
   estimated. Crust coverage exerted a significant allelopathic negative
   effect on soil microbial biomasses due to the leaching of lichen's
   antimicrobial substances. In contrast, the crust effect on enzyme
   activity was positive, probably due to the amelioration of soil abiotic
   conditions. The distance from the base of Erica spp. affected the total
   microbial and bacterial biomass, with lower values at the base of the
   shrubs. The composition of microbial communities between the different
   sampling points exhibited significant dissimilarities. Network analysis
   revealed that in uncrusted soils the most connected microbial network
   was at samples collected from a distance of > 60 cm (bare soils), while
   in crusted soils this was at samples collected at the base of shrubs. We
   concluded that microbial biomass showed limited response to spatial
   heterogeneity, while the composition and the topology of interactions
   among the microbial members reflected a heterogeneous soil environment
   existing on a small spatial scale in Mediterranean areas. The microbial
   community in bare soil appeared to be the most robust against future
   disturbances.},

Title = {Ecological correlates of crop yield growth and interannual yield

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Artificial selection and genetic engineering plus an expanding
   repertoire and use of agrochemical inputs have allowed a rapid and
   continuous increase in crop yield (i.e., volume production per unit
   area) over the last century, which is needed to fulfill food demands
   from a growing human population. However, the first signs of yield
   deceleration and stagnation have already been reported for some globally
   important crops. Therefore, the study of the drivers of yield growth and
   its variation is essential for directing research and policies aiming at
   ensuring food security in the forthcoming years. We used data on mean
   and variability in annual yield growth for 107 globally important crops
   to assess the role of environmental (i.e., climatic region) and plant
   intrinsic traits (i.e., type of harvested organ, pollinator dependence,
   and life form) as drivers of change in yield growth and its stability.
   We applied a comparative approach to control for biases associated with
   phylogenetic non-independence among crops, an approach rarely used in
   agronomic studies. Average yield growth and its variation were not
   phylogenetically structured. Yield growth decreased with increasing
   pollinator dependence in tree crops but not in herbaceous and shrubby
   crops. Interannual yield variation tended to increase with increasing
   pollinator dependence, and it was higher in crops from temperate
   regions, in those cultivated for their reproductive organs, and in tree
   and shrubby crops as compared with herbaceous ones. Information on
   ecological correlates of crop yield growth and interannual yield
   variation can be used in the design of more sustainable and diversified
   agriculture schemes.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the short-term impacts of projected climate
   warming on two dominant tree species of the Hayat-ul-Mir subtropical
   scrub forest of Pakistan. Seedlings of Acacia modesta and Olea
   ferruginea were exposed to ambient (T-o) and warming temperature (T-o +
   2.3 degrees C and T-o + 4.5 degrees C) with control (M-15\%) and
   elevated (M-20\%) soil moisture in plant growth chamber for 90 days. T-o
   + 4.5 degrees C induced detrimental effects on both species inhibiting
   seed germination and reducing their growth rate, biomass accumulation
   and allocation, however promoted development of root nodules (12 +/- 4,0
   nodules/root) in A. modesta. T-o + 2.3 degrees C with M-20\% was
   beneficial for O. ferruginea with significant increase in stem height
   (4.8 +/- 1.4 cm), elongated roots (31.2 +/- 3.4 cm), branch development
   (9 +/- 1.7), biomass accumulation (8.69 +/- 0.4 g) and higher foliar
   nutrient concentration but for A. modesta it only promoted root
   elongation (16.5 +/- 1.3 cm) and biomass accumulation in stem (1.05 +/-
   0.1 g) and foliage (0.08 +/- 0.001 g). A. modesta grew better under T-o
   with significantly high germination and survival rate. A future 2.3
   degrees C warming could be ecologically significant to induce shifts in
   the structure and function of the Hayat-ul-Mir forest.},

Abstract = {Caribbean islands are important hotspots for endemic species,
   concentrating high biodiversity on exceptionally small areas. Cozumel
   Island is not an exception, yet little published information exists on
   its bird diversity. In this study, we assessed the contribution of each
   major ecosystem of Cozumel Island (i.e., tropical forest, mangrove, palm
   thicket, and urban setting) to the island's avian diversity. Avian
   richness was highest in tropical forests, followed by mangroves, palm
   thickets, and urban setting. Bird densities were highest in urban
   settings, followed by tropical forests, mangroves, and palm thickets.
   Species composition similarity among ecosystems was low, with the most
   dissimilar ecosystem being the urban setting. Interestingly, we recorded
   the highest number of unique species in mangroves, followed by tropical
   forests, urban settings, and palm thickets. Tropical forests and
   mangroves of Cozumel Island are the main ecosystems harboring high avian
   diversity, with tropical forests housing high avian densities and
   endemics and mangroves including the most unique species. As expected,
   the contribution of urban settings to the avian diversity of Cozumel
   Island is limited and includes some highly abundant invasive species, of
   which the Eurasian Collared-Dove could represent a major ecological
   threat.},

Abstract = {Terminalia tomentosa (Roxb.) Wight \& Arn., an important tree species in
   the tropical forests of India, is often reported to have poor or no
   regeneration in many parts of the country. The present study was
   conducted to evaluate the population structure and regeneration status
   of the species in three different forest types of the Similipal
   Biosphere Reserve, along with phenological behaviours for two
   consecutive years. Leaf initiation was positively correlated with fruit
   senescence (r = 0.76, p < 0.01) and flower initiation (r = 0.63, p <
   0.01). However, a negative correlation was found between leaf initiation
   (LF2) and leaf senescence (LF5) (r = -0.42, p < 0.05). Principal
   Component Analysis showed that maximum temperature and rainfall in a
   given month are the main factors for pre-monsoon events (leaf senescence
   and fruit senescence) and post-monsoon events (growth and maturation of
   leaves and fruits). The results also revealed that regeneration failure
   of T. tomentosa was not due to phenological intensity but possibly to
   wrong phenological timing of fruit maturation. This study on
   regeneration status and phenological information of T. tomentosa could
   help develop strategies for conservation and management of this tropical
   tree species in its natural ecosystem.},

   upland boreal forest, aged 26 to 34 years, were assessed for effects on
   soil, vegetation, and successional status to study the natural recovery
   of vegetation. Six upland (five native, one non-native) and one lowland
   native species community types were identified where non-vascular had
   more communities than vascular plants. Upland boreal species that were
   likely not present in the soil seed bank, colonized the sites relatively
   quickly with a plant community of early to mid successionals, including
   persistence of a lowland species (Amblystegium serpens) and non-natives.
   Presence of a non-native community (Melilotus officinalis) 26 to 34
   years after reclamation can be concerning. Stockpiled soil texture
   (clay) and tall shrub stem density were most influential on plant
   community development. Stem density (DBH > 5 cm), self-thinning of early
   successional species (Salix, Betula papyrifera), and presence of climax
   species (Picea glauca) resembled the successional trend of natural
   boreal forests in the region. Results from this study suggest natural
   recovery of upland boreal forest on lowland peat substrate is possible
   and can support evolving plant communities.},

Title = {Decline in common milkweed along roadsides around Ottawa, Canada},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, monarch butterfly populations have been
   declining. This decline has been partly attributed to the extensive loss
   of breeding habitat through the reduction of common milkweed (Asclepias
   syriaca, the larval host plant) through herbicides. While the decline of
   milkweed has been well documented in the US, less is known about its
   decline in Canada. To take a first step in quantifying its potential
   decline, we compared roadside milkweed abundance at sites around Ottawa,
   Ontario, Canada in 2018, to a county-wide estimate of milkweed abundance
   in 1943 and 1944. We also evaluated the effect of roadside
   characteristics on milkweed abundance at these sites. Current milkweed
   density in the Ottawa region is 33-86\% lower than it was 75 years ago.
   We found milkweed at 67\% of our 100 sites and found less milkweed at
   sites with a higher number of lanes in the road adjacent to the
   roadside. Interestingly, mowing indices were not significant predictors
   of milkweed abundance. Here we document the first quantitative evidence
   for milkweed decline over the past 75 years in Canada, which has likely
   contributed to the decline of breeding monarchs in Canada.},

Abstract = {The Arasbaran Protected Area of northern Iran encompasses 160,000 ha of
   deciduous, broad-leaved forest with 78,560 ha recently designated as a
   United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's
   (UNESCO) Biosphere Reserve. Our study objectives were to (1) quantify
   whether anthropogenic pressures measurably impacted the structural
   complexity of Arasbaran forests and (2) determine which structural
   complexity indices were most sensitive to anthropogenic pressures in
   Arasbaran forests. We identified and sampled three study sites with
   high, moderate, and low levels of anthropogenic pressures and used nine
   forest structural indices to develop structural complexity indices. High
   anthropogenic pressure resulted in aggregated tree distribution,
   uniformity in tree sizes, and less heterogeneous forest structure. The
   structural indices particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressure were
   diameter differentiation, height differentiation, Gini coefficient, and
   structural diversity. Structural complexity appears to be a useful
   method for quantifying the impacts of anthropogenic pressure on montane
   deciduous forests. Regular sampling of the diameter differentiation
   index, height differentiation index, Gini coefficient and structural
   diversity index should be integrated into conservation management plans
   for the Arasbaran Protected Area.},

Abstract = {Consumptive and non-consumptive interactions of predators and prey can
   have strong direct and indirect effects on primary producers, such as
   stream algae. Increasing water temperatures may alter these interactions
   and thus influence productivity in streams. For each of 3 temperature
   treatments ('ambient', +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C), we measured the
   amount of algal biomass removed by grazing mayflies from 91 mesocosms
   after a 24-hour test period under 3 grazing treatments: lethal
   predators, non-lethal predators, and no predators. At all temperatures,
   grazers reduced algal biomass (p < 0.01), and the presence of lethal
   predators effectively dampened mayfly consumption of algae (p < 0.01).
   However, differences in algal biomass between lethal and non-lethal
   predator treatments were not significant, indicating that predators had
   no indirect behaviorally mediated effects on grazer consumption. Grazer
   removal of algal biomass marginally increased with increasing
   temperature (p = 0.051). We analyzed video data for changes in grazer
   foraging and drift behavior. Mayflies increased drift in the presence of
   lethal predators (p < 0.01) but not non-lethal predators, and no
   behavioral changes were seen with temperature increases. Mesocosms can
   help elucidate possible future shifts in trophic interactions due to
   climate warming. Yet, we found no evidence of indirect stonefly predator
   effects on grazing mayflies under these warming scenarios.},

Abstract = {The Great Whale River in subarctic Quebec, Canada, is one of the main
   freshwater inflows to Hudson Bay. This region is experiencing rapid
   climate change, with pronounced impacts on the cryosphere, and ongoing
   socio-economic development that may accelerate with future road and
   shipping links. This review integrates information available to date on
   the Great Whale River ecosystem, which we define as the river and its
   watershed, its source lakes and streams, and the river mouth environment
   and beyond the shoreline in southeastern Hudson Bay. Our aim was to
   define the current state of this ecosystem as a baseline for ongoing
   observations, with emphasis on (1) the distribution of water masses,
   optical characteristics, freshwater discharge, and ice cover; (2)
   concentrations and fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants; (3)
   abundance, production and diversity of the organisms associated with the
   sea ice ecosystem; (4) plankton abundance, biomass, production, and
   assemblages; (5) benthic abundance and diversity; (6) fish abundance,
   diversity and population dynamics; (7) marine mammal biology; and (8)
   global change impacts on freshwater and marine habitats. This synthesis
   provides a first step towards the integrated management of the Great
   Whale River ecosystem, and for similar freshwater-marine systems in the
   subarctic region.},

Abstract = {Lunar phases remarkably influence the circadian cycle of living beings.
   Early amphibian studies date back to the 1960s, but only recently has
   more research been conducted in this field. Much still needs to be
   understood to establish the behavioral pattern of this group according
   to the synodic cycle. In the present study, we sought to determine (i)
   whether the vocalization activity was influenced by the lunar phases and
   (ii) whether the influence was species-specific or affects the community
   with equal intensity. We expected a great diversity of behaviors and
   adaptations. Rayleigh's test was used to verify whether the sample
   differs significantly from the null hypothesis; Rao's test was used to
   check sample size sufficiency; and the Kiviat diagram was used to
   evaluate the activity of the species in relation to the complete synodic
   cycle. We have observed 1691 individuals of 37 species over 882 d. The
   lunar cycle influenced 78 \% of the species, with 32 \% preferring the
   lower-albedo phases. The activity pattern of each species was
   established. These results suggest that the lunar phases influence the
   vocalization activity of most species. Therefore, there is a general
   pattern of activity related to the synodic cycles; however, the
   specificities still need to be better understood.},

Abstract = {Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and its tundra habitat are a unique system
   for the study of rabies virus epidemics. Contrary to theoretical
   calculations reporting a critical density (K-T) of approximately 1
   fox/km(2) for rabies endemicity, arctic rabies persists at densities
   below this. The calculation of K-T = 1 fox/km(2) assumes uniform fox
   density across the landscape and unrestricted mixing between susceptible
   and infected foxes. We hypothesize that spatial heterogeneity arising
   from resource distribution or social structure may result in regions
   where rabies is endemic, even though average fox densities at the
   regional or landscape-level are below K-T. To expand upon the limited
   body of research surrounding arctic rabies persistence, we examine
   arctic rabies via a two-patch structure. We find that arctic rabies can
   persist in heterogeneous landscapes where the mean carrying capacity is
   below the threshold carrying capacity required for endemicity in
   homogeneous landscapes. Rabies endemicity in low-carrying capacity
   regions within heterogeneous landscapes is further facilitated by high
   transmission rates, potentially due to non-breeding foxes (i.e.
   floaters), and when between-patch movement is restricted to latent and
   infected foxes. Our results suggest that rabies may persist in
   heterogeneous landscapes when the mean carrying capacity is as low as
   0.25 foxes/km(2).},

Abstract = {Several recent dendrochronological, macrofossil and palynological
   studies have surveyed modern spruce forests at multiple locations in the
   Nain region of coastal Nunatsiavut (north-central Labrador) in order to
   reconstruct past forest composition, growth rates, species diversity and
   harvesting patterns. The present paper synthesizes original and
   previously collected data to evaluate the extent to which the dynamics
   of the region's spruce forests over the past five centuries have been
   related to anthropogenic impacts. In three key case studies, Picea
   growth release events demonstrate multiple isolated forest disturbances
   prior to the late 19th century. In general, these events correspond to
   the local human settlement history rather than to regional climatic
   trends, suggesting that ongoing human impacts on the forest extend as
   far back as the 17th century. Disturbance regimes accelerated by ca 1875
   and afterward in all of the study sites. This increase in forest
   disturbance corresponds to increased demands for wood triggered by
   socio-economic changes experienced by the region's Inuit and Settler
   communities. Ongoing surveys demonstrate the presence of markers of
   human exploitation of forests throughout the study region, and
   especially in coastal locations, suggesting that anthropogenic impacts
   are in fact generalised and not limited to specific areas of recent
   settlement.},

Abstract = {This study examines the Holocene evolution of an inland subarctic
   permafrost peatland located on the north bank of Wiyashakimi Lake
   (Nunavik, northeastern Canada). The analysis of plant macrofossils
   allowed us to reconstruct the succession of the trophic conditions of a
   palsa and a filled thermokarst pond. The accumulation of organic matter
   began at around 6290 cal. y BP. The evolution of the site then followed
   three stages: a pond (6290-5790 cal. y BP), a minerotrophic peatland
   (5790-4350 cal. y BP) and an ombrotrophic peatland (from 4350 cal. y
   BP). The establishment of permafrost caused a palsa to form at around
   170 cal. y BP, which corresponds to the coldest period of the Little Ice
   Age in northeastern Canada. A subsequent degradation of the palsa and
   the formation of a thermokarst pond were induced by the climate warming
   that began at the turn of the 20th century. The analysis of plant
   macrofossils from an adjacent filled thermokarst pond indicated three
   phases of development over a short 450-year period: subaquatic,
   minerotrophic, and ombrotrophic phases. When combined with previous
   studies of filled thermokarst ponds in northern Quebec, this result
   indicates that ponds are rapidly filling in with vegetation and acting
   as carbon sinks.},

Abstract = {Exceptionally large areas burned in 2014 in central Northwest
   Territories (Canada), leading members of the Tlicho First Nation to
   characterize this year as `extreme'. Top-down climatic and bottom-up
   environmental drivers of fire behavior and areas burned in the boreal
   forest are relatively well understood, but not the drivers of extreme
   wildfire years (EWY). We investigated the temporal and spatial
   distributions of fire regime components (fire occurrence, size, cause,
   fire season length) on the Tlicho territory from 1965 to 2019. We used
   BioSIM and data from weather stations to interpolate mean weather
   conditions, fuel moisture content and fire-weather indices for each fire
   season, and we described the environmental characteristics of burned
   areas. We identified and characterized EWY, i.e., years exceeding the
   80th percentile of annual area burned for the study period. Temperature
   and fuel moisture were the main drivers of areas burned. Nine EWY
   occurred from 1965 to 2019, including 2014. Compared to non-EWY, EWY had
   significantly higher mean temperature (>14.7 degrees C) and exceeded
   threshold values of Drought Code (>514), Initial Spread Index (>7), and
   Fire Weather Index (>19). Our results will help limit the effects of EWY
   on human safety, health and Indigenous livelihoods and lifestyles.},

Abstract = {Plains bison (Bison bison bison) are suspected to have played an
   important role in maintaining and structuring the plant communities
   throughout the Aspen Parkland. We examine the effects of a fenced bison
   herd on grassland plant communities in Riding Mountain National Park,
   Manitoba, Canada. We focus on the relationship between bison and woody
   plant encroachment along the forest-grassland ecotone, and on the
   effects that short- and long-term occupation by bison have on Festuca
   hallii grassland communities including the effects of bison
   reintroduction to a grassland area ungrazed by bison for 165 years. We
   found limited impacts of bison on the shrub community at the forest
   grassland edge. Bison rarely entered areas with dense, tall shrub
   understories, and thus bison cannot be a major factor controlling the
   ecotone. Shrub stem mortality due to fire may be a necessary precursor
   to bison effectively mitigating woody encroachment in the Aspen
   Parkland. We found limited short-term impacts of bison on grassland
   communities, with reduced sward heights but no change in composition.
   The long-term (>80 year) presence of bison was associated with greater
   species richness, reduced litter accumulation, and a distinct plant
   community composition compared to areas without bison impacts.},

Abstract = {Himalayan ecosystems provide a unique opportunity to analyze the
   determinants of species richness across large elevation gradients.
   Understanding forest diversity and structure is fundamental to set
   conservation priorities. A quantitative assessment of tree species was
   conducted in Kashmir Himalayan forests to ascertain their composition,
   stand structure and distribution in 143 plots of 50 x 50 m(2).
   Altogether, 13 species were recorded, ranging from five in subalpine
   (SA) forests to 10 in mixed conifer (MC) forests. There was a
   compositional dissimilarity among forest types. Pinus wallichiana was
   the most important species in low-level blue pine (BP) forests, whereas
   Abies pindrow prevailed in mid-elevation MC and high-elevation SA
   forests. Pinaceae contributed around 98\% of stems and was the most
   speciose family, followed by Sapindaceae and Betulaceae. Stand density
   and basal area differed among forest types and were significantly
   correlated with elevation and slope. The tree diameter class
   distribution displayed an approximate reverse J-shaped pattern
   indicating the influence of disturbance. As the first two axes of the
   canonical correspondence analysis explained more than 93\% of the
   inertia in the species-environment relation, elevation and slope are the
   main drivers of species distribution. Information about these forest
   attributes could provide better ecological insights for sustainable
   forest management.},

Abstract = {How ecological interactions vary across spatial and environmental
   gradients has received increasing attention in recent years,
   contributing to the revelation of the drivers of biodiversity. However,
   it is still unclear how the structure of ecological interactions varies
   across large spatial scales and which climatic factors are associated
   with such variation. Here, specific predictions were derived and tested
   to evaluate how climatic factors and latitude are associated with the
   structure of bat-fruit interaction networks throughout the Neotropical
   region. For each study site (n = 44 sites, encompassing 48 degrees of
   latitude), four metrics were used to describe the network structure
   (i.e., network size, connectance, modularity, and nestedness). In
   general, an increase in modularity and a decrease in connectance and
   nestedness was observed towards lower latitudes and in sites with lower
   precipitation seasonality. Moreover, plant richness within networks
   increased towards lower latitudes and in sites with higher annual
   precipitation, whereas bat richness increased at lower latitudes and in
   sites with lower precipitation seasonality. These findings partially
   confirm both energy and seasonality hypotheses and suggest that
   fruit-bearing plant richness and fruit availability associated with
   annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality can be important
   correlates shaping the structure of ecological interactions throughout
   the Neotropical region.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models are powerful tools on their own for the
   management of rare and at-risk species, but their utility as such can be
   limited if their accuracy is low, or if management policies are applied
   without consideration of the structure of the data. We tested the
   accuracy of a MaxEnt species distribution model for white-rimmed shingle
   lichen (Fuscopannaria leucosticta) in New Brunswick, Canada, and
   proposed an additional decision support-tool that matches the species
   probability of occurrence (PO) to possible management actions. The model
   was tested using two years of new field observations. Classification
   trees were used to define four groups across the range of PO values.
   Chi-squared tests were used to test the accuracy of predictions in each
   class. The model was found to accurately predict occurrences in very low
   and moderate classes, but underpredicted occurrences in low and high
   classes. We recommend using similar, data-driven support tools in the
   conservation decision-making process to minimize losses of the species
   and maximize efficacy of management.},

Abstract = {Forest-steppe habitats in central Hungary have contrasting canopy
   structure with strong influence on the spatiotemporal variability of
   ecosystem functions. Canopy differences also co-vary with terrain
   feature effects, hampering the detection of key drivers of carbon
   cycling in this threatened habitat. We carried out seasonal measurements
   of ecosystem functions (soil respiration and leaf area index),
   microclimate and soil variables as well as terrain features along
   transects for 3 years in poplar groves and the surrounding grasslands.
   We found that the terrain features and the canopy differences
   co-varyingly affected the abiotic and biotic factors of this habitat.
   Topography had an effect on the spatial distribution of soil organic
   carbon content. Canopy structure had a strong modifying effect through
   allocation patterns and microclimatic conditions, both affecting soil
   respiration rates. Due to the vegetation structure difference between
   the groves and grasslands, spatial functional diversity was observed. We
   found notably different conditions under the groves with high soil
   respiration, soil water content and leaf area index; in contrast, on the
   grasslands (especially in E-SE-S directions from the trees) soil
   temperature and vapor pressure deficit showed high values. Processes of
   aridification due to climate change threaten these habitats and may
   cause reduction in the amount and extent of forest patches and decrease
   in landscape diversity. Owing to habitat loss, reduction in carbon stock
   may occur, which in turn has a significant impact on the local and
   global carbon cycles.},

Abstract = {Close-to-nature management (CTNM) has been proposed as a promising
   forestry management approach to improve the structure and quality of
   forests, which integrates wood production and ecological service
   functions. Research on the effect of CTNM on the univariate and
   bivariate distribution of the spatial structure of forest stands
   provides a scientific basis for the evaluation of CTNM implemented in
   forestry. Here, we analyzed and compared the spatial-structure
   characteristics of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) plantations (young,
   middle-age, and near-mature stages) under CTNM 8 years after selective
   cutting and unmanaged control. We used univariate and bivariate
   distribution of three spatial-structure parameters: mingling (M),
   dominance (U), and uniform-angle index (W). Results showed that the
   effect of CTNM on spatial structure was more remarkable in middle-aged
   and near-mature Masson pine forests compared with the young forest. CTNM
   significantly improved mingling degree and promoted the horizontal
   distribution, thereby changing from a cluster to a random distribution.
   Moreover, CTNM improved the proportion of trees with a high mixing
   degree and random distribution and the proportion of trees having a
   micro-structure of random distribution with a high degree of mixture and
   dominance with a high degree of mixture in middle-aged and near-mature
   Masson pine forest. Overall, the implementation of CTNM 8 years ago
   showed a positive effect on the improvement of the spatial structure of
   Masson pine forest, but the present spatial structure is suboptimal.
   Further implementation of CTNM to adjust the mingling and uniform-angle
   index is necessary, and CTNM according to this method of frequency
   distribution of stand structure parameters can improve the success of
   forest management.},

Abstract = {We present the first-ever attempt to estimate the taxonomic diversity of
   climbing plants in India, following the recent APG IV classification. We
   used more than 100 published and unpublished sources spanning more than
   a century to compile the extensive list of climbers. Our study revealed
   that the climbing plants in India are phylogenetically diverse,
   representing 2624 species radiated across 585 genera and 104
   spermatophyte plant families. About two-thirds of the total climbers
   enumerated from the present study are lianas. Scramblers, in particular,
   are exclusively woody, unlike twiners and tendril climbers. The
   diversity of climbing mechanisms varied significantly across the 104
   climber families. We also present the revised list of global climbing
   plant families, adding significantly to the existing dataset. We found
   that the climber diversity data collected exclusively from the
   ecological inventories or the taxonomic records underestimated the
   actual climber diversity by a significant margin. We discuss some of the
   key constraints in developing a climber database and recommend a
   replicable model, integrating ecology and taxonomy-based enumerations
   for the most precise estimate of climber diversity within a defined
   geographical area. The baseline data generated through our research will
   find applications in many ecological, taxonomic, phylogenetic, and
   evolutionary studies on climbers.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the drivers of liana community structure is fundamental to
   understand the processes driving community assembly. We investigated
   variation in liana community structure (diversity, composition,
   abundance, basal area, distribution) among different elevations, and
   assessed the environmental factors structuring composition and
   distribution. We randomly established thirty 20 x 20 m plots across
   three elevations (lower = 200 m a.s.l.; middle = 500 m a.s.l.; upper =
   850 m a.s.l.) in the Mount Jerai Forest Reserve, Malaysia. We used
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis to assess the relationships between
   liana species distribution and composition, and environmental factors.
   Liana diversity differed significantly among elevations, being highest
   and lowest in the middle and upper elevations, respectively. Liana
   abundance and basal area were higher at lower elevations. Species
   abundance varied significantly across elevations. The environmental
   factors showed significant variation among the elevations. Liana species
   composition and distribution patterns were explained by elevation, soil
   moisture, Ca, P, pH and N. The different environmental factors affected
   species composition and distribution in different ways. These findings
   increase our understanding of the drivers of liana community structure
   and may be useful in liana management and conservation.},

Number = {3-4},
Pages = {347-360},

Abstract = {The Arctic has warmed significantly over the past decades. However, the
   evolution of Arctic climate during the Holocene remains to be clarified
   in more detail, and regional factors controlling aquatic ecosystem
   evolution need to be better defined to grasp the sensitivity of lakes to
   rapid environmental change. Nettilling Lake was studied for changes in
   sedimentary diatom assemblages over the last 5 000 years. Lake water pH
   was reconstructed by applying a diatom-based lake water pH inference
   model. We hypothesized that the changes in diatom assemblages were
   driven by variations in lake water transparency and attendant water
   turbidity associated with the input of fine suspended solids from
   glacial meltwaters. Reduced underwater light resulted in greater
   abundance of planktonic over benthic taxa from ca. 5 000 to 3 000 yrs.
   cal. BP, followed by less turbid conditions and proliferation of benthic
   taxa during regional cooling. The lake water was slightly alkaline
   throughout the Holocene, ranging between pH 7.1 and 7.7. Our results
   support the notion that hydrological processes, dependent on climate
   variations, have a first-order influence on the regulation of the lake
   water pH through glacial meltwater inputs, which will likely continue to
   control the lake's long-term chemical and biological evolution.},

Abstract = {The family of palms (Arecaceae) comprises around 2,400 species
   distributed throughout the world, from which nearly 100 species have
   been reported to occur in Mexico. Given their importance and the lack of
   information about their distribution patterns in the country, we applied
   stacked species distribution models to estimate the current distribution
   patterns of palms in Mexico. Only 47 species had enough presence records
   for their modeling. About 50\% of the models showed that Annual
   Precipitation had the greatest contribution to the potential
   distribution. From the species analyzed, 63\% are distributed in the
   southeast of the country with Roystonea regia as the species with the
   greatest extent (367,550 km(2)) and Coccothrinax readii occupying the
   smaller potential distribution (9,850 km(2)). It was possible to
   identify regions of the country with high species richness and where the
   establishment of new natural protected areas would help to the
   conservation of palm trees in Mexico. The southeast of Mexico represents
   the highest richness (>10 species) with about 130,000 km(2), and the
   central slope of the Mexican Pacific, a fragmented landscape with a
   medium potential distribution (>5 species). Our results represent an
   important step to guide the establishment of conservation areas for the
   family Arecaceae in Mexico.},

Abstract = {Niche differentiation by spatial segregation facilitates the coexistence
   of species sharing ecological preferences, which can buffer the impact
   of biological invasions on native species. The introduction of two
   semi-aquatic rodents, the coypu Myocastor coypus and the muskrat Ondatra
   zibethicus, to most freshwater ecosystems across Western Europe, has
   been pinpointed as a cause for the decline of the southern water vole
   (SWV) Arvicola sapidus. We investigated the co-occurrence of these three
   species in a river catchment of northwest France and whether spatial
   habitat segregation took place at two spatial scales, using hierarchical
   modelling accounting for imperfect detection. At a large spatial scale
   (river catchment), the occupancy rate of the SWV was 0.52 +/- 0.06, i.e.
   noticeably smaller compared to coypu (0.58) and muskrat (0.80). We found
   no evidence of a negative effect of the presence of the two invasive
   rodents on SWV occurrence. At a smaller spatial scale (SWV home range),
   we found weak evidence of spatial segregation in habitat use with a
   negative, although not significant, effect of muskrat. Overall, our
   results suggest that riparian habitats in the study area allow the
   southern water vole to coexist with two larger invasive rodents,
   provided that hygrophytic vegetation is preserved alongside rivers.},

Abstract = {The adaptive capacity of psammophytes to sand burial is crucial for the
   ecological restoration of coastal dune systems. The responses of
   Spinifex littoreus to different sand burial depths and levels were
   examined on the coast of Pingtan Island, Fujian Province, South China.
   The results indicated that, compared with the control group (CG), sand
   burial on the S. littoreus stolons had no signi?cant impact on the
   vertical growth of its conjoint ramets. However, the horizontal growth
   of S. littoreus stolons was stimulated and signi?cantly increased in
   half-intense (HI) and complete-intense (CI) sand burial treatments by
   24.56\% and 40.79\%, respectively. Throughout the experiment, about 96\%
   of adventitious roots were observed on the base section of stolons,
   while no roots in the control group (CG). After 20-day arti?cial sand
   burial treatments, the dry weight ratio between stem and leaf of S.
   littoreus was decreased in all three sections of stolons, especially for
   the top sections. Overall, S. littoreus can adapt to the complete and
   intense sand burial in growing season by rapid growth of stolons,
   abundant production of adventitious roots on the stolon base, and more
   germination of leaves on the stolon top.},

Abstract = {To meet the need for wood in the African savanna zone, forest
   plantations have been established since the 1930s. Exotic tree species
   of the genera Pinus and Eucalyptus are the major groups planted in the
   Western Highlands of Cameroon where they form artificial forests whose
   mycoflora is not yet documented. This study aimed at comparing the
   macro-fungi diversity in mature eucalyptus and pine plantations in
   tropical savannas, particularly in the Melap Forest Reserve. Four
   permanent plots of 1000 m(2) were installed in each plant community,
   sporophores were collected and identified from April to June 2016;
   species richness and generic diversity were calculated. A total of 125
   species were inventoried. Taxonomic diversity was significantly higher
   in Eucalyptus communities than in Pinus communities, with 107 and 33
   species respectively. The number of ectomycorrhizal species was higher
   in the eucalyptus plots where a few locally consumed species were found.
   The mycofloral abundance in Eucalyptus communities is explained by the
   presence of local tree species hosting ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as
   Uapaca guineensis.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Intensification of anthropogenic activities in many lake catchments
   during the twentieth century led to increased autochthonous organic
   matter sedimentation and degradation of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions
   due to the intensification of heterotrophic processes. These processes
   can be amplified by the effect of climate warming on thermal
   stratification in lakes. This study aimed to assess how metabolic
   disruptions affect carbon sources and pathways in lake pelagic food
   webs, focusing on methanogenic carbon. The studied lakes showed strong
   seasonal variations of carbon source availability and transfers to
   pelagic food webs, characterized by increased methanogenic carbon
   transfers to Daphnia populations in winter. The magnitude of these
   winter transfers seems to largely depend on the amount of methane stored
   in the hypolimnion during the stratification period, and thus on the
   amount of methane released with autumnal turnover. Methane production,
   storage and transfer mechanisms partly depend on thermal stratification
   intensity, but also on external factors such as land use. This study
   provides new insights into the impacts of global changes on the sources
   and pathways of carbon in pelagic food webs through their influence on
   lake metabolism and thermal regimes. These functional changes may lead
   to greater production and release of greenhouse gases into the
   atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Bamboos, abundant in tropical forests, have high potential to dominate
   disturbed areas due to their high vegetative growth rate and preference
   for disturbed habitats. However, there are no studies exploring the
   influence of forest patch characteristics and anthropogenic land-use on
   bamboo populations. We investigated the influence of landscape matrix
   characteristics on the abundance of two bamboo taxa (Merostachys sp. and
   Parodiolyra micrantha) across two different spatial scales: 600 m (113
   ha) and 1000 m (314 ha). We sampled the edge of 15 forest fragments
   (from 20.3 to 116.5 ha) in a highly disturbed landscape in Alfenas,
   Brasil. Only P. micrantha abundance was influenced by landscape metrics:
   positively by the percentage of sugarcane and coffee plantations around
   a forest fragment at 600 m, and negatively by the percentage of pasture
   at 1000 m. We suggest that cattle presence and/or the edge effect
   intensified by the adjacent pasture matrices could explain the negative
   effect of pasture, and that the disturbance caused by sugarcane and
   coffee plantations might explain the positive influence on P. micrantha
   abundance, a generalist and competitive understory species. Our results
   could help decision makers in their attempts to control bamboo
   populations and manage the landscape around forest fragments.},

Abstract = {We present the longest tree-ring chronology to date in northeastern
   North America (2233 years; 227 BCE - 2005 CE), resulting from several
   research projects conducted at the subarctic treeline in northern
   Quebec. This raw chronology of tree-ring width includes 464 black spruce
   (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) shrubs (krummholz) growing in wetlands
   and preserved within peatlands. An indexed series of 152 erect black
   spruce trees that have lived in wetlands is also presented, covering the
   period 216 BCE to 1619 CE. We compared these chronologies to a tree-ring
   series including 116 black spruce trees and krummholz having grown on
   well-drained lichen woodlands over the period 1304-2000 CE. These
   chronologies highlight the major climatic periods of the last two
   millennia. Floating chronologies dating from 2500 to 3500 years ago were
   also developed from trees preserved in frozen peat. Growth rings from
   this period are much wider than those of the last 2233 years, suggesting
   warm climatic conditions and permafrost-free peatlands during the
   transition from mid- to late Holocene. The three subarctic chronologies
   presented here underscore the relevance and usefulness of tree growth
   rings and growth forms as ecological tools to assess the influence of
   climate on subarctic ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This research presents the issue of wildlife access to garbage at
   dumpsites and suggests appropriate management in Kaeng Krachan National
   Park in Thailand. I set camera traps at three dumpsites from May 2018 to
   January 2019 (601 trap nights). I detected 38 wild species and three
   domesticated species. There were five, 20, and 13 species of reptiles,
   birds, and mammals, respectively, including the globally vulnerable
   Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and long-tailed macaque (Macaca
   fascicularis). The most prevalent species were diurnal, followed by
   nocturnal and then crepuscular. Nine species fed on food waste. Highly
   abundant species visited the dumpsites more frequently than did less
   abundant ones. Food waste quantities were correlated with the number of
   tourists, the species number, total individual animals, and species
   abundance. The likelihood of animals using dumpsites was dependent on
   the time of day, the location, the tourist season, and the group of
   animals. Feeding at dumpsites may change the ecological roles and
   foraging behaviour of wildlife, which leads to increasing populations
   and human-wildlife conflict. Proper management is required so that
   increasing waste from tourism will not negatively affect threatened
   species.},

Abstract = {The Cozumel Curassow (Crax rubra griscomi) is a critically endangered
   endemic bird from Cozumel Island, Mexico. After it was believed to be
   extinct, it was rediscovered in 1994. Its population status was assessed
   in 1994-1995, and later in 2005, predicting a population decline over
   the next four decades. A new evaluation of its population size was
   carried out in 2017 and 2019. Some of the main factors that affect the
   population size of this cracid were identified with a generalized linear
   model. With a line transect sampling effort over 360 km, a population
   size of 499 +/- 172 individuals was estimated in the tropical
   semi-deciduous forest occurring in the island, which was slightly higher
   compared to previous population evaluations. The distance to water
   bodies was significantly associated with the population size of the
   Cozumel Curassow, as well as the abundance of some species of fauna and
   flora. By modeling various scenarios, population viability was assessed
   over a period of 100 years, predicting a relatively stable population
   size with great variability depending on scenarios. However, as
   estimated in previous studies, given its small population size and
   continued threats, the Cozumel Curassow continues to be endangered.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, as in other countries, coastal urbanization and landscape
   changes are occurring at an unprecedented scale and rate, with potential
   negative impacts on local biodiversity. Nevertheless, studies of the
   impacts that such changes have on coastal dune vegetation such changes
   on coastal dune vegetation are relatively scarce. In this study, we
   examined (a) the trends of urban sprawl and landscape changes along the
   coast of Veracruz for more than 20 years; (b) the impact of urban sprawl
   on plant species richness and plant functional groups; c) how landscape
   changes have affected plant diversity and community structure. Our
   results show an increasing urbanization along the coasts of the Gulf of
   Mexico, occurring at different rates, and being higher in locations
   closest to tourist areas. Plant species richness decreased with urban
   expansion while the proportion of plant functional types was altered.
   Inland species not tolerant to the beach-dune environment became more
   abundant in the most urbanized locations while the abundance of
   psammophytes decreased. Community structure (the dominant species) was
   modified with landscape changes. Our results are useful for an adaptive
   management strategy and will help develop sustainable beach management
   plans that should include the conservation of native and highly
   specialized species, such as psammophytes.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has raised many concerns among Indigenous
   communities about virus transmission risks from wild food, particularly
   migratory birds. Snow geese contribute significantly to food security in
   Indigenous contexts, which is precarious in many communities. The risk
   to goose hunters is very unlikely as coronaviruses found in birds are
   from different genera than that of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent
   responsible for COVID-19. Nevertheless, little is currently known about
   the host tropism range of SARS-CoV-2. To address the concerns raised by
   Northern communities, we captured 500 snow geese in May 2020 at their
   stopover along the St Lawrence estuary. We took oropharyngeal and
   cloacal samples before releasing the birds. All samples were tested for
   SARS-CoV-2 within one week and were found to be PCR-negative, allowing
   us to communicate rapidly with Northern communities. The current
   pandemic has shown that the importance of understanding animals as
   potential viral reservoirs, and that a better understanding of these
   viruses will better prepare us for future spillover events. This project
   demonstrates that researchers can be quickly and efficiently mobilized
   to respond to concerns from Indigenous communities.},

Abstract = {Clear correlations between human and bird visual assessments of color
   have been documented, and are often assumed, despite fundamental
   differences in human and avian visual physiology and morphology.
   Analyses of plumage colors with avian perceptual models have shown
   widespread hidden inter-sexual and inter-specific color variation among
   passerines perceived as monochromatic to humans, highlighting the
   uncertainty of human vision to predict potentially relevant variation in
   color. Herein, we use reflectance data from 13 Larus gull species as an
   exemplar data set to study concordance between human vision and avian
   visual modeling of feather colors near, or below, the human threshold
   for discrimination. We found little evidence among gulls for sexual
   dichromatism hidden from human vision, but did find inter-specific color
   variation among gulls that is not seen by humans. Neither of these
   results were predictable a priori, and we reassert that reflectance
   measurements of actual feather colors, analyzed with avian relevant
   visual models, represent best practice when studying bird coloration.},

Abstract = {Invasive predators contributed to recent extinctions worldwide,

   the sooretama slaty antshrike (Thamnophihrs ambiguus) during two
   consecutive breeding seasons, to estimate predation rates and identify
   the predators. As invasive marmosets apparently became locally common,
   we hypothesized that they would prey upon natural nests at a higher rate
   than native predators. We found 13 nests of the antwren and 15 of the
   antshrike, of which 100\% and 73\%. respectively, were preyed upon.
   Invasive marmosets preyed upon 13 of 16 nests (81\%) with identified
   predators. affecting 90\% and 67\% of the antwren and the antshrike
   nests. This study documented that invasive primates negatively affect
   the breeding success of native birds in Brazil. We highlight the need
   for urgent measures to manage invasive marmosets to avoid the local
   extirpation of the endemic birds.},

Abstract = {We explored the unusual position. anatomy and evolutionary significance

   of the calvaria. The true occipital crest has shifted to the back along
   with the parietal. The frontal sinus has overridden a parietal sinus. We
   compared this bone reorganization with the anatomy of deer (Dania and
   Odocoileus). a gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and a bovid (Eotragus clavatus )
   in which the bones are in the primitive positions. The fetal Bos has a
   fontanelle which is not seen in Gazella or Odocoileus. An evolutionary
   succession can be developed based on the backward shift of the frontal
   and horns in Bos taurus and other Bovini.},

Title = {Carbon cycle in tropical upland ecosystems: a global review},
Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-136},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Along with habitat transformation, climate change has profound impacts
   on biodiversity and may alter ecosystem services on which human welfare
   depends. Many studies of the carbon cycle have focused on lowland
   tropical forests; however, upland forests have been less explored
   despite their pivotal role in carbon sequestration. Here, I synthesized
   the state of knowledge on the allocation of carbon in its different
   stocks (aboveground, belowground, and soil) as well as in its main
   fluxes (plant decomposition, respiration, and litterfall) in tropical
   upland ecosystems of the planet. In November 2020, a systematic review
   was carried out to identify references published from 2000 to 2020
   through a combination of key terms in Google Scholar and Scopus
   databases, thus analysing bibliographic, geographical, methodological,
   and carbon cycling information of the global upland tropics (between
   23.5 degrees N-23.5 degrees S). After analysing a total of 1967
   references according to inclusion-exclusion criteria, 135 references
   published in the last 20 years were selected. Most of the studies were
   conducted in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest of
   South America. The main factors studied were elevation and forest type.
   Forest structure and soil variables were largely associated when
   studying carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Estimations of carbon
   stocks comprised three-fourths of the total studies, while the remaining
   fraction focused on carbon fluxes. Aboveground biomass and carbon in
   soils were highly investigated, while plant decomposition and
   respiration were the components that received the least attention. Even
   though in the last 20 years there was a slight increase in the number of
   studies on carbon cycle in tropical upland forests, I found bias
   associated with the biomes and ecoregions studied (especially in the
   Andes). Elevation was the main factor examined but other essential
   aspects such as the successional gradient, landscape management,
   diversity- productivity relationship, faunal and microbial effect,
   trophic cascades, and Gadgil effect require more attention. The
   inclusion of different litter species and origins (i.e. roots and stems)
   and theoretical frameworks including home-field advantage,
   substrate-matrix interaction, and phenology-substrate match may provide
   explanatory mechanisms to better understand litter decomposition over
   these forests. Despite respiration being a paramount link that is
   closely tied to above- and belowground compartment, this flux
   constitutes one of the important gaps to fulfil in future research. For
   a comprehensive understanding of the carbon cycle in upland forests, it
   is necessary to obtain information on its main fluxes and integrate them
   into climate change mitigation plans.},

Abstract = {Neutral landscape models based on fractal algorithms are used widely by

   explanation of the algorithm in the context of neutral landscape models

   also usefully parallels theories about the hierarchical structure of

Abstract = {Increased snow cover and attenuation of light due to shrub expansion can
   lead to changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food
   resources for migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus). To determine how
   vegetation is affected by snow accumulation and shade, we conducted an
   experiment that simulated the light and snow conditions created by
   increased shrub cover at Deception Bay (Nunavik, Canada), within the
   summer range of the Riviere-aux-Feuilles caribou herd. We estimated the
   foliar biomass of two major components of the caribou diet (Betula
   glandulosa and Carex spp.). We also harvested foliar tissue to conduct
   chemical composition analyses (nitrogen, fibre, total phenolics).
   Experimental light attenuation was found to increase the nitrogen
   concentrations in B. glandulosa and Carex spp. throughout the growing
   season. Phenolic concentration in B. glandulosa decreased in early
   summer but was otherwise consistent in response to light attenuation and
   increased snow cover. Increased snow cover combined with ambient light
   had a positive effect on the foliar biomass of B. glandulosa. Increased
   snow cover and shade caused by shrub densification may therefore
   increase forage quantity and quality for caribou. We suggest
   investigating the effects of shrub expansion on other components of the
   caribou diet, such as lichens and forbs.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The lichens Erioderma pedicellatum (Hue) P.M. Jorg. and Erioderma
   mollissimum (G. Sampaio) Du Rietz are endangered species in Canada. Both
   species are obligate epiphytes found in forested wetlands near the
   Atlantic Coast. They are thought to be primarily threatened by logging
   and acid pollution, but the influence of these factors has not been
   examined at large-extents or relative to other habitat features.
   Critical habitat for protection has remained difficult to define beyond
   observed occurrences, because of the low accuracy of existing habitat
   models. To facilitate improved recovery planning and understanding of
   their ecology in the province of Nova Scotia, we created high-resolution
   distribution models for both species, incorporating elements of climate,
   forest composition, hydrology, acid pollution, and anthropogenic
   influence using the MaxEnt algorithm and a backwards stepwise selection
   process. The most important predictors were related to rainfall or an
   oceanic moderation of thermal optima. Depth to water table and the
   presence of suitable forest composition were also included, as was
   distance from roads for E. pedicellatum. The putative threats, acid
   pollution and silvicultural treatment, were not important and therefore
   excluded from models. Although both species have highly specific habitat
   requirements, E. pedicellatum appears to be more sensitive to human
   activities.},

Abstract = {The increase in anthropogenic activities that lead to fragmentation and
   habitat loss, could result in a reduction of connectivity among habitat
   patches of terrestrial species. We used ecological niche models, circuit
   and graph theories to evaluate functional connectivity among home-range
   patches and suitable habitat patches of the Mexican Leaf Frog
   (Agalychnis dacnicolor), in a heterogeneous landscape of tropical dry
   forest (TDF) in central-western Mexico. We found high connectivity among
   home-range patches within the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve (CCBR)
   and among those surrounding the CCBR. Similarly, suitable habitat
   patches along the Pacific slope (except those in the South) were
   well-connected. Conversely, we detected weak connectivity in the
   southern and eastern parts of the study area, which is in accordance
   with the poor habitat quality and fragmentation that characterize that
   zone. Suitable habitat patches with the largest areas of TDF were the
   most important in maintaining functional connectivity, but only one
   patch was within a natural protected area. Our results highlight the
   importance of conserving large and continuous patches of habitat in a
   very threatened landscape to maintain connectivity in A. dacnicolor and
   probably in other anurans.},

Abstract = {Separating the influence of climate and habitat characteristics on
   forest communities could help better understand their potential
   sensitivity to environmental change. In this study, we sampled spiders
   and beetles in similar forest types, located along a ca. 4 degrees C
   mean annual temperature spatial gradient in the boreal forest zone in
   Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we aimed to separate the effect on
   arthropod communities of two habitat-related factors that can be
   influenced by forest management (stand composition and stand age), and
   another one that cannot (climate). Overall, spider assemblages tended to
   be more abundant and species-rich in younger forest stands, while beetle
   assemblages were more abundant and species-rich in deciduous forest
   stands. Eight beetle and six spider species were significantly
   influenced by climate, independently from forest type, whereas 11 beetle
   and seven spider species were significantly influenced by both forest
   type and climate. While most of the beetle species affected by climate
   were associated with warmer locations, several spider species were more
   abundant in colder locations. By helping to ensure the retention of key
   forest types along potential dispersal pathways at the landscape level,
   forest management activities could help the conservation of species
   belonging to relatively cryptic taxa such as arthropods in a climate
   change context.},

Abstract = {Vendace is commonly assumed at low risk to recruitment overfishing. This
   assumption has been confirmed for boreal stocks but might not apply at
   lower latitudes. We evaluated the risk of recruitment overfishing at the
   southernmost extent of vendace populations by comparing fecundity,
   natural mortality, and fishing mortality of two stocks differing in
   growth with those of a population not subject to fishing. Although in
   one study lake vendace grew faster owing to high lake productivity and
   low stock density, and had substantially higher age-specific fecundity,
   intense harvest before first spawning negatively affected the stock's
   recruitment potential by reducing spawner abundance. In contrast, in the
   slow-growing stock, vendace entered the fishery after first spawning,
   and egg production per recruit was similar to that of the population not
   subject to fishing. We conclude that vendace stocks characterized by
   fast somatic growth may be at higher risk of recruitment overfishing,
   which can be reduced by protecting first-time spawners.},

Abstract = {On the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the growth of trees is strongly affected
   by climate change. Previous researchers have found that climate warming
   changes thermal and hydraulic conditions, lengthening the growing season
   and promoting tree growth. Some studies have analyzed the effects of
   drought, precipitation, and temperature on tree growth. However,
   previous studies have mainly focused on natural forests, with few
   studies on the response of plantations to climate change. Therefore, we
   studied the relationship between dendrochronology (basal area increment,
   BAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and climate factors
   to explore the response of Picea likiangensis var. rubescens plantations
   to climate change. The results showed that from 1990 to 2018, the
   temperature in the study area increased significantly; the rate of
   increase was 0.39 degrees per decade. Among the climate factors,
   self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) had the most
   significant impact on BAI. From P\_May (P\_represents the month of the
   previous year) to December, BAI was always negatively correlated with
   the scPDSI, with 9 months being significantly negatively correlated. BAI
   was significantly positively correlated with the minimum 2m temperature
   (TMN) in P\_July, P\_September, July, and September. BAI was
   significantly positively correlated with the maximum 2 m temperature
   (TMX) in P\_October, P\_December, and July. BAI was significantly
   positively correlated with the mean 2 m temperature (TMP) in P\_July,
   P\_December, and July. There is a significant positive correlation
   between BAI and annual NDVI (NDVIa), which means that NDVI can be used
   to study the response of plantations to climate change. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of the response of plantation
   growth in high-altitude areas to climate change, which is needed by
   forest managers.},

Title = {Models of poisoning effects on vulture populations show that small but

Abstract = {Vultures are among the most threatened avian taxa in the world. When
   vultures aggregate in large numbers to feed, poisoned carcasses can
   extirpate entire populations at once. In the light of shrinking numbers
   worldwide, restocking and reintroduction projects, where wild or
   captive-bred vultures are released back into nature, constitute a
   crucial management tool, successfully implemented in many countries.
   However, reestablishment of sustainable vulture populations to their
   historical ranges remains a serious challenge, especially if the threat
   of poisoning persists, which is usually the case. In this study, we
   model the outcome of a restocking project where an initial colony is
   subject to repeated poisoning events. We use as an example the isolated
   population of the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) in Cyprus. Mathematical
   considerations and model simulations show that the probability of colony
   persistence depends on the initial population size and the intensity and
   frequency of the poisoning incidents. This type of scenario creates an
   Allee effect that requires a colony to exceed a minimum size in order to
   survive. Also in this scenario, a sequence of small but frequent
   poisoning episodes is worse on average than a few large and rare ones of
   the same cumulative mortality. Future population reinforcement efforts
   for vultures should focus on the release of adult birds in adequate
   numbers for the successful establishment of sustainable colonies and
   should involve a reduction in small but persistent sources of mortality
   such as the poison baiting of small canids that until now has been
   neglected by conservation scientists.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-19},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {In this work, populations of adult and immature honeybees and their
   honey production are studied through mathematical and statistical
   modeling approaches. Those models are complementary and are presented in
   disjunct form. They were used to show different modeling methods for
   honey bee population dynamics. The statistical approach consisted of a
   generalized linear model using data from the Department of Agriculture
   of the United States of America (USDA), which showed that the
   relationship between the number of colonies and the rate of honey
   production is not constant in time but decrease over the years. These
   models showed that when a bee population is subjected to a stress factor
   (i.e., habitat destruction, Varroa mite, climate variability, season,
   neonicotinoids, among others), the abundance of individuals decreases
   over time as well as the honey produced by the colonies. Finally, the
   mathematical approach consisted of two models: (1) a smooth model, in
   which conditions of existence and stability of the equilibrium solutions
   are determined by an ecological threshold value, and (2) a non-smooth
   model where the mortality rate of bees is included as a function of the
   number of adult bees in the population.},

Abstract = {Contrast and aggregation are two components of spatial heterogeneity. To
   precisely determine the influence of varying nutrient heterogeneity on
   the foraging behavior of clonal plants, we selected Potentilla anserina
   L. as the material and designed different patch patterns, sizes and
   qualities. In Experiment 1, compared with random and uniform patch
   patterns, aggregation increased ramet density and biomass accumulation
   at the patch scale, but not at the plot scale. This implies that the
   adaptive responses of clonal plants to nutrient heterogeneity depend on
   spatial scale. We further designed three levels of patch size with the
   same fertilizer concentration at the patch scale in Experiment 2, and
   four levels of patch quality with the same total amount of fertilizer at
   the plot scale in Experiment 3. Increased ramet density and stolon
   growth rate within small patches in Experiment 2 demonstrated effects of
   heterogeneity on plant foraging responses at the patch scale, while no
   difference was found in Experiment 3. This means that the influence of
   patch size on ramet establishment and residence time was alleviated by
   patch contrast at larger spatial scales. Hence, spatial scale is a key
   factor determining the interactions between heterogeneous ecosystem
   components.},

Abstract = {Not all frugivore species are equally important to the structure and
   maintenance of mutualistic networks and identifying the most relevant
   species is of great relevance to conservation ecology. Centrality
   metrics provide insightful information on the relative contribution of
   individual fruit-eating species to the topology of the networks, but
   there is still considerable debate on what ecological traits make
   frugivores highly central. We aimed to identify whether frugivory level,
   gape width, and forest dependency are associated with the importance of
   fruit-eating birds to the networks. The relative contribution of
   individual bird species to the networks was calculated using a
   combination of three centrality metrics. A mixed-effects model showed
   that central species in the networks were highly connected forest
   specialist birds. Gape width and the proportion of fruits in the diet
   did not explain centrality. These findings are concerning because these
   birds we found to be the most important species are usually highly
   sensitive to human disturbances and because their selective defaunation
   may breakdown plant-frugivore mutualistic networks. Therefore, we
   suggest that the conservation of seed dispersal networks in forest
   fragments of the Cerrado should consider protecting forest specialized
   frugivorous birds.},

Abstract = {Changes in mass, extent, duration, and physical properties of snow are
   key elements for studying associated climate change feedbacks in
   northern regions. In this study, we analyzed snowpack physical
   properties along a `mega' transect from 47 degrees N to 83 degrees N
   (4,000 km) in northeastern Canada, which includes marked transitions
   between ecozones from boreal forest to subarctic and arctic ecosystems.
   Our unique dataset of 391 detailed snowpits acquired over the last 20
   years, complemented with snow data from weather stations, shows that
   snowpack properties such as snow water equivalent, snow depth, density,
   grain size and basal depth hoar fraction (DHF) are strongly linked to
   vegetation type. Based on these results, we propose an updated
   classification of snow types in three classes: boreal forest snow (47-58
   degrees N), tundra snow (58-74 degrees N) and polar desert snow (74-83
   degrees N), which is more appropriate to the study area than the general
   north hemisphere classification commonly used. We also show that shrub
   presence along the transect contributes to a significant increase in DHF
   development which contributes most strongly to the thermal insulation
   properties of the snowpack. Overall, our analysis suggests that
   snow-vegetation interactions have a positive feedback effect on warming
   at northern latitudes.},

Abstract = {Vegetation restoration is a fundamental method of ecological
   reconstruction in disturbed areas, and revegetation can be achieved by
   passive (spontaneous succession) and active (human-induced) approaches.
   Plant community composition, productivity, and diversity were studied in
   coal mining subsidence areas after 0-15 years of restoration with active
   (AR) and passive (PR) revegetation approaches in a semiarid region.
   Moreover, plant community composition, succession, and their
   relationships with soil variables were analyzed. The results showed that
   both PR and AR contributed to the recovery of the plant community in
   terms of plant cover, density, biomass, and diversity, with AR
   accelerating the recovery of the plant comm unity to a greater extent
   than PR. Soil moisture and organic matter had close relationships with
   the plant community variables. The plant communities in PR sites had the
   same species composition as those in non-subsidence (NS) areas, which
   led to a more natural plant community in PR than AR sites. Plant
   community structure in AR sites was altered by the introduced shrubs,
   with mesophytes developing under the introduced shrubs. These changes
   produced a different successional trajectory in AR sites from that in NS
   sites; thus, environmental fluctuations may easily change AR community
   stability in semiarid environments.},

Title = {Room to roam for African lions Panthera leo: a review of the key drivers

Abstract = {Globally, large terrestrial carnivores (Carnivora) have suffered
   precipitous declines in population and range. Today, they must persist
   in increasingly isolated natural habitat patches within a
   human-dominated matrix. Effective conservation aimed at supporting
   carnivores in such landscapes requires species-specific understanding of
   habitat requirements. We present results from a review of the published
   literature to assess the current state of knowledge regarding habitat
   preferences of the African lion Panthera leo, with the aim of
   identifying common drivers of habitat use across contexts. Using the Web
   of Science, we identified 154 usable articles and extracted information
   relating to study topic, location, habitats described, land-use type,
   and any documented habitat preferences. Only 31 studies documented
   evidence of habitat use, and collectively, they suggested that
   preferences for specific habitat types were varied and context-specific.
   The importance of prey abundance and proximity to water was highlighted
   in multiple studies. Anthropogenic factors interfered with expected
   patterns of habitat use. There was evident bias in study locations: 83\%
   of the habitat-use studies were based in only three countries, and 70\%
   were focussed on protected or managed areas. Our synthesis suggests that
   lions demonstrate behavioural plasticity in habitat use in response to
   anthropogenic pressures. To understand the limits of this plasticity and
   to manage Africa's changing landscapes effectively for roaming lions,
   future research should be focussed on analysis of habitat use outside
   protected areas, taking into account gradients of distance to water,
   prey abundance, and anthropogenic risk.},

Title = {Bats and wetlands: synthesising gaps in current knowledge and future

Abstract = {Wetland areas have decreased by up to 33\% globally over the past ten
   years, threatening the biodiversity they support and essential ecosystem
   services they provide. Despite this, the importance of wetlands for bat
   conservation and the consequences of losing these habitats are not
   comprehensively understood.
   Through a systematic literature review, we quantified the knowledge gaps
   regarding bats in wetlands by: 1) assessing research trends over time;
   2) evaluating research biases in geography, themes, species, seasons,
   and methodology; 3) creating the `bat Knowledge Index' (bKI), a standard
   indicator for measuring how well-studied bats in wetlands are per
   country; 4) compiling and summarising the ecological responses of bats
   to wetlands; and 5) assessing how bat researchers perceive the role of
   wetlands for bat conservation.
   We found strong similarities between the reviewed studies and the bat
   researchers' perceptions. However, although 75\% of respondents
   considered wetlands important for bat conservation, they rarely studied
   these habitats. Most of the studies took place in developed countries,
   leaving critical gaps in countries where wetlands are rapidly
   decreasing. The bKI can be used as a tool for land managers to
   prioritise conservation actions and resources for the protection of bats
   in wetlands geographically.
   Research topics were found to be biased towards habitat selection and
   species inventory, with many topics only superficially explored. There
   was also an important seasonal bias, resulting in many unanswered
   questions during energetically demanding periods for bats (e.g.
   migration). However, constantly evolving technological developments,
   such as bat lures and tracking devices, might aid new studies in these
   habitats.
   Up to 66\% of studies reported that wetlands benefit bat activity or
   species richness, mainly because of high prey densities and the
   availability of fresh water. However, the low number of studies and all
   the identified research gaps make `bats and wetlands' a largely
   underexplored ecological interaction between a poorly studied animal
   taxon and an increasingly threatened habitat.},

Abstract = {One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in
   degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas
   without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to
   attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance
   seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of
   artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and
   composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien
   invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the
   bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used
   artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment
   (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at
   each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these
   and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside
   the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of
   focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total
   of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a
   significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial
   perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition
   increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An
   ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed
   communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive
   exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the
   third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from
   12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most
   represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures
   for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed
   species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly
   due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore,
   artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow
   area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of
   alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about
   overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the
   arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of
   birds in this process.},

Abstract = {Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time.
   However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially
   woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to
   examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Triangulo
   Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32
   years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature
   surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the
   absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e.,
   grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby
   grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods
   (from 30.0\% to 0.0\% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from
   7.0\% in 1987 to 11.0\% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred
   within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse
   cerrado (from 34.2\% to 7.7 \%) and an increase in dense cerrado (from
   6.9\% to 39.8 \%). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied
   for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time
   (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/-
   0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss
   of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was
   the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such
   patterns are important to support plant management plans for the
   threatened Cerrado open plant formations.},

Abstract = {Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing
   animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou,
   Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution
   might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at
   such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and
   21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during
   caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and
   decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the
   distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads,
   cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger
   harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen
   landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger
   harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns,
   reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades,
   resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely
   providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou.
   We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred
   by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access,
   especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad
   scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {The startling warming of the Arctic is driving important environmental
   changes, but vegetation responses have been spatially heterogeneous and
   difficult to predict. In this context, establishing new ecological
   baselines and initiating monitoring schemes are essential. We conducted
   systematic plot-based surveys in the polar desert surrounding Alert
   (Nunavut, Canada). We aimed at (1) identifying distinct plant
   communities, (2) characterizing community attributes, including
   diversity and abundance, as well as environmental variables associated
   with each community, and (3) establishing a georeferenced baseline with
   permanent field markers allowing robust re-surveying. We used
   hierarchical clustering to categorize cover values of vascular plant
   species, cryptogams, and ground substrates from 1,320 quadrats (1 m(2)
   each) surveyed in 264 vegetation plots. Five plant communities were
   identified, with one community associated with each of the barren and
   mesic habitats, and three communities associated with wetlands. The mean
   biotic covers were generally higher at Alert (13-98\%) compared to other
   polar deserts in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. A total of 250
   quadrats from 50 vegetation plots were permanently marked, and a
   database describing all plots is available online. This study improves
   our understanding of High-Arctic plant communities and establishes an
   important vegetation monitoring reference at the northernmost
   permanently inhabited settlement on Earth.},

Title = {The BIODESERT survey: assessing the impacts of grazing on the structure

Journal = {WEB ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {75-96},

Abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is both the main land use across drylands
   worldwide and a major desertification and global change driver. The
   ecological consequences of this key human activity have been studied for
   decades, and there is a wealth of information on its impacts on
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, most field assessments of
   the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have
   been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single
   ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa
   (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT
   survey, the first systematic field survey devoted to evaluating the
   joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the
   structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This
   collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and
   has involved the collection of field data and plant, biocrust, and soil
   samples from a total of 326 45 m x 45 m plots from 98 sites located in
   25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major
   characteristics and the field protocols used in this survey. We also
   introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful
   to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of
   researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the
   current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of
   grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of
   the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our
   planet using much-needed field data.},

Abstract = {We investigated the sensitivity to vegetation cover type of active
   (PALSAR) and passive (SMAP) freeze/thaw (F/T) classification. We also
   used F/T classification from high-resolution PALSAR data (30 m) to
   follow the evolution of frozen and thawed soil states obtained from an
   adaptive algorithm with low-resolution SMAP data (36 km). We used PALSAR
   and SMAP scenes acquired from June 2015 to January 2017 over the
   Tursujuq National Park (Umiujaq, Quebec, Canada). A new F/T algorithm
   with a specific reference threshold under each vegetation type (shrub,
   grass, lichen, wetland, and bare land) is proposed to classify PALSAR
   pixels. The validation of the PALSAR F/T classification with soil
   temperature at similar to 5 cm depth revealed a greater overall accuracy
   (> 80\%), with horizontal transmitted and vertical received (HV)
   thresholds. The PALSAR F/T classification shows that a SMAP pixel is
   classified as frozen when more than 50\% of its area is frozen at the
   surface. We confirmed the sensitivity to vegetation cover type of
   passive and active F/T classification with L-band sensor.},

Title = {Influence of interspecific interference competition on the genetic

Abstract = {Understanding the effects of interspecific competition on genetic
   diversity will deepen our knowledge on species evolution. In the case of
   Calopteryx splendens and C virgo, sympatric damselfly species,
   interspecific interference competition by C. virgo has remarkable
   effects on territoriality of C. splendens resulting in reproductive
   character displacement. Since territoriality is correlated with
   phenotype and mating success. we investigated the effects of
   interspecific interference competition on genetic diversity of C.
   splendens populations. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms
   (AFLP), we determined the population genetic structure of 12 C. viendens
   populations and used the genetic diversity information to relate
   heterozygosity of C. splendens to abundance of C. virgo in sympatric
   populations. We found that heteroggosity of C. splendens males decreased
   with increasing abundance of C. virgo males. This result most likely
   reflects changes in effective population size due to interspecific
   interference competition and shows an effect on genetic structure in
   damselfly populations.},

Title = {Environmental DNA and metagenomics of terrestrial mammals as keystone
   taxa of recent and past ecosystems},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Terrestrial mammals shape their ecosystems, and mammalian community
   assemblages can be important indicators of ecosystem functioning and
   ecosystem changes over time. Numerous taxa of terrestrial mammals are
   currently threatened by habitat loss and face displacement to new
   geographical areas or systems to which they are less suited and where
   they may affect the original communities. Understanding past ecosystem
   changes is important for predicting future responses of species
   assemblages to changes in their environments. Thus, ecological and
   evolutionary history, as well as adaptive capacity, are important
   predictors of future population viability. Genomic and metagenomic
   approaches using environmental or ancient DNA offer a wealth of
   information regarding genome-wide variation of changing communities or
   of taxonomic groups over time, which may help explain past changes and
   predict future responses of communities to changes in their environment;
   however, to date, such studies are relatively scarce. We review studies
   on environmental DNA and environmental genomics of terrestrial mammals
   to assess the potential of such approaches regarding past, contemporary,
   and future terrestrial ecosystems, identify inherent challenges, and
   discuss potential applications. We elaborate on lessons to be learned
   from mammal genomics of past ecosystems and compare metabarcoding with
   general metagenetic and metagenomic techniques. We provide a
   comprehensive overview of current applications, challenges, and future
   potential of environmental DNA with regards to terrestrial mammals. As
   current major challenges regarding mammalian eDNA we identify its
   scarcity and patchy distribution, along with the persistent necessity of
   genomic reference data. While the latter are steadily increasing, the
   former can only be tackled by explicitly mapping the environment to gain
   understanding of spatial eDNA distribution. Such understanding may
   facilitate informed choices of sample sites and substrates and, together
   with new sequencing techniques, this can allow mammalian eDNA to be
   maximally exploited as a source of biodiversity data.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Termite nests act as shelters for a wide variety of invertebrates. We
   studied the Corotocini termitophile fauna (Staphylinidae, Aleocharinae)
   in nine Nasutitermes corniger nests and nine N. ephratae nests to test
   the resource size (larger nests should host more social-parasite species
   than smaller ones) and resource concentration (nests occurring closer to
   each other should host a greater richness and variety of social
   parasites) hypotheses. In total, we found 358 Corotocini individuals.
   Regression analysis did not reveal a relationship between species
   richness or population size of termitophiles and nest volume. Thus, we
   rejected the resource size hypotheses as a driver of termitophile
   diversity. Neither did distance between nests explain the richness of
   their fauna; thus, the resource concentration hypothesis was also
   rejected. In conclusion, we suggest that biological aspects, such as
   dispersal dynamics and species traits likely explain the diversity of
   termitophiles.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the morphology, genetics and distribution of

   M chalybeus Wiede-mann in Meigen, 1822, M. minutus Strobl, 1893 and M.
   robustus Veselic, Vujic \& Radenkovic, 2017. Two of the species, M.
   chalybeus and M. minutus. are morphologically very similar and often
   misidentified in the literature. Here, by employing an integrative
   taxonomic approach we provide strong evidence for the separation of M.
   chalybeus and M. minutus. Our results show their clear allopatric
   distribution: M. minutus on the Balkan Peninsula, Sicily, Sardinia and
   Corsica, while M. chalybeus is a western Mediterranean species
   distributed on the Iberian Peninsula and northwest Africa. Data on the
   distribution of M. robustus were updated, with new records from Cyprus,
   Israel and Turkey, besides its type locality (Samos in Greece). We
   provide evidence for M. chalybeus and M. minutus representing a species
   complex, named the M. chalybeus complex, which together with M. robustus
   constitute the M. chalybeus subgroup.},

Abstract = {Passive transport has likely contributed to the post-glacial dispersal
   of species in temperate regions. However, identifying such processes
   from patterns can be obscured by confounding environmental conditions.
   We studied the distribution of ground beetles in Ontario's Far North, a
   vast (450,000 km(2)) and largely intact region, to identify mechanisms
   that aid in species dispersal when confounding factors, such as
   temperature, are controlled. We tested a model of passive, riverine
   dispersal using recent records of flightless and flighted ground beetles
   from 34 sites across the region. The number of species declined with
   distance from main watershed rivers, as predicted from our model at the
   site level. Contrary to expectations, this pattern was evident with
   flighted species but not flightless species. The opposite pattern, with
   flightless species displaying a decrease with increasing distance from
   river, was evident at a regional level. These patterns are consistent
   with ground beetles carried along rivers since glacial retreat. We
   surmise that northward dispersal of these invertebrates into the boreal
   forest has been aided by vegetation and other debris flowing down
   rivers, including soil from eroded banks in which larvae and pupae
   reside. Biogeographic inferences, although often subtle, can be
   supported by broad-scale studies of intact landscapes.},

Abstract = {Depending on their reproductive strategy, different fish species either
   aggregate or disperse eggs and larvae in their reproductive habitat.
   Because yolk-sac larvae of vendace (Coregonus albula) disperse widely
   across the littoral and pelagic zones of boreal lakes, it is unclear
   where the exact spawning and egg incubation locations are. Vendace egg
   and larvae densities were studied in Lake Southern Konnevesi to clarify
   its spawning strategy. In autumn 2019.1-2 weeks prior to spawning, 500
   egg samplers were installed in five depth zones in 20 sampling plots.
   Fertilized eggs were found in 18 plots. The mean density of eggs was 74
   eggs m(-2) and the mean fertilization rate 85\%. During spawning,
   vendace dispersed their offspring throughout the lake. The
   sampling-plot-specific egg density in autumn 2019 did not correlate with
   larval density in the spring next year. The reproduction strategy of
   vendace reduces the effects of high spatial and temporal fluctuation in
   their reproduction and nursery habitats.},

Abstract = {To determine if a survival bottleneck occurs in Lake Erie's lake
   whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) population and explore possible
   mechanisms responsible, we examined contemporary and historical dynamics
   of lake whitefish eggs, larvae and juveniles. Widespread spawning and
   low overwinter egg retention were observed in 2016-2018, however
   subsequent larval CPUE remained consistent with historical observations
   when regular recruitment occurred. Highest larval CPUE was consistently
   observed in nearshore areas 3-11 km from mid-lake spawning locations.
   Fall age-1 juvenile presence was predicted by fall age-0 catches,
   indicating the bottleneck occurs during the first growing season. Our
   results suggest the following: (1) factors limiting recruitment affect
   survival during or after the pelagic larval stage to fall age-0, and (2)
   physical and biological processes underlying connectivity between
   spawning and nearshore nursery habitats may be limiting recruitment.
   Future research focusing on larval nursery habitat characterization and
   lake whitefish growth and survival may reveal mechanisms affecting
   recruitment.},

Abstract = {Whitefish is well-known for its delicious meat and consumers are willing
   to pay high prices for it, but local supply is often limited due to
   fluctuating or declining catches. It is thus expected that whitefish
   aquaculture production should increase to help meet the demand, provided
   that insufficient knowledge or other roadblocks do not interfere. Here
   we use a literature review, expert interviews, and case-study approach
   to understand the existing knowledge, current production levels. and
   limitations of whitefish aquaculture in individual countries. As shown
   through the literature review, there is sufficient technical knowledge
   to scale-up whitefish production. However, interviews with several
   experts point out different factors hindering aquaculture production:
   strict environmental regulations, established production of other
   freshwater species, and possible competition with fish imports. The
   failure to establish whitefish aquaculture in Lake Constance underlines
   this outcome, as there is nearly no chance to establish whitefish
   aquaculture in this area despite very high demand paired with
   drastically decreasing supply from capture-fisheries. As a result. at
   least 50\% of whitefish consumed at Lake Constance are imported. This
   case highlights a common pitfall in environmental management: decisions
   to forego or reduce local production often results in replacing a
   product of exceptionally high sustainability (locally produced fish)
   with imports from other countries.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effects of landscape differences
   associated with intensive agricultural activities on farmland use by
   medium and large mammals in Japan. We compared the species diversity of
   mammals that used farmland within three regions with different
   agricultural activity levels, and analyzed the relationship between the
   occurrences and escape responses of mammals in the farmland and
   surrounding landscape. We used spotlight count in intensive (high
   agricultural activity), intermediate (moderate agricultural activity),
   and non-intensive (low agricultural activity) areas. We observed 271 and
   199 occurrences of mammals in spring and autumn 2021, respectively.
   Seasonal changes in mammals occurrence were due to a decrease in the
   number of raccoon dogs observed. Species richness tended to be lower in
   intensive agricultural areas than in other areas, suggesting that
   intensive agricultural landscapes negatively affect the community
   structure of medium and large mammals. Generalized additive models
   showed that the effects of the surrounding landscape on the occurrences
   and escape responses of raccoon dogs, red foxes, and cats differed among
   species. Only raccoon dogs were negatively affected by the surrounding
   farmland, suggesting high sensitivity to agricultural activities. Our
   results have important implications for the management of ecosystems in
   Japanese agricultural areas.},

Abstract = {Fragmented suburban forests of the northeastern US are challenged by
   abundant white-tailed deer and nonindigenous plant invasions. Deer
   browsing/grazing pressure varies among sites, potentially affecting
   herbivory on nonindigenous plants and their invasion success. We aimed
   to identify a useful deer pressure indicator for suburban forests and
   then use it to relate deer pressure to grazing on and abundance of two
   herbaceous invaders, Microstegum vimineum and Alliaria petiolata. We
   compared three indicators: fecal pellet accumulation rate, deer browse
   on indigenous woody plants, and indigenous shrub layer cover. The pellet
   method produced estimates generally far below the region's known deer
   density. Browse rates and shrub layer cover were negatively correlated,
   and correlations of the three indicators with evidence of deer pressure
   from a subsequent 6.5-year exclosure experiment supported shrub layer
   cover as the better choice. Using that measure in 10 forests, we
   detected a weak pattern of more grazed stands under greater deer
   pressure, but few plants per stand were grazed; any negative influence
   of deer on these species was limited to individuals, without population
   effects. Alliaria petiolata abundance was unrelated to deer pressure,
   but M. vimineum abundance was greater in forests with more deer
   pressure, suggesting facilitation of its invasion.},

Abstract = {In tropical dry forests, wildfires are likely to become a major
   disturbance as a result of anthropogenic pressures and dryer conditions
   due to climate warming. Based on remote sensing techniques, this paper
   assesses the probability of fires occurring in the dry region of the
   Guanacaste Conservation Area (GCA), northwestern Costa Rica, testing the
   roles as fire determinants of topography, early successional forest
   stages, between-area susceptibility, and accessibility to human (roads
   and trails). Probability of fire occurrence and fire danger were
   determined based on a machine learning algorithm. Fire occurrence model
   was inferred from burned areas and fire line density; while fire danger
   was inferred from the probability of fire occurrence, the proportion of
   burned areas, and the number of fires per area. Results indicate that
   the presence of early successional vegetation on flat lowlands highly
   accessible by roads and trails are key components of fire occurrence.
   Three of the six investigated sectors show high probability of fire
   occurrence and fire danger, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of fire
   risk in the landscape. The results could be useful for the management of
   the conservation area.},

Title = {Lessons from comparative primatology for understanding trait covariation
   and diversity in evolutionary ecology},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Given the position of humans in the tree of life, comparative research
   on non-human primates has attracted the interest of researchers in
   biology, medical sciences, anthropology, psychology, and sociology.
   Covariation of species' phenotypes has been of particular interest.
   Learning from the historical development of comparative research with
   primates should thus be particularly valuable for evolutionary ecology
   and to improve understanding of phenotypic integration and diversity.
   Such learning would also help identify knowledge gaps, disputed
   questions, and new avenues of both basic and applied research in
   relation to the evolution of primate features and the conservation of
   our close relatives. We conducted a historical assessment through a
   non-systematic review and a systematic review, focusing on how the
   integration of different research lines in evolutionary ecology focused
   on primate phenotypic covariation unfolded throughout the 20th Century.
   The non-systematic review allowed us to reconstruct the history of the
   discipline from its earliest origins, when bibliometric assessments were
   more limited in scope, and to identify the most appropriate keywords for
   the systematic review. We employed a standard protocol for the
   systematic review, applying two complementary analyses: co-occurrence of
   keywords and bibliographic coupling of references. These analyses
   described the development of the conceptual and intellectual structures
   of comparative primatology from 1966 to 2020. By identifying the most
   influential researchers and concept interrelations, we highlight primate
   phenotypes critical for the development of the discipline (in
   particular, brain and body sizes and behavioural patterns), showcasing
   the reach of these investigations for evolutionary ecology. Overall, our
   findings emphasise the crucial role that comparative primatology has
   played in developing the study of phenotypic integration and the very
   onset of phylogenetic comparative methods.},

Title = {Testing for changes in rate of evolution and position of the climatic
   niche of clades},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {573-583},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is solid recognition that phylogenetic effects must be
   acknowledged to appreciate climatic niche variability among species
   clades properly. Yet, most currently available methods either work at
   the intra-specific level (hence they ignore phylogeny) or rely on the
   Brownian motion model of evolution to estimate phylogenetic effects on
   climatic niche variation. The Brownian motion model may be inappropriate
   to describe niche evolution in several cases, and even a significant
   phylogenetic signal in climatic variables does not indicate that the
   effect of shared ancestry was relevant to niche evolution. We introduce
   a new phylogenetic comparative method which describes significant
   changes in the width and position of the climatic niche at the
   inter-specific (clade) level, while making no a priori assumption about
   how niche evolution took place. We devised the R function
   phylo.niche.shift to estimate whether the climatic niches of individual
   clades in the tree are either wider or narrower than expected, and
   whether the niche occupies unexpected climates. We tested
   phylo.niche.shift on realistic virtual species' distribution patterns
   applied to a phylogeny of 365 extant primate species. We demonstrate via
   simulations that the new method is fast and accurate under widely
   different climatic niche evolution scenarios. phylo.niche.shift showed
   that the capuchin monkeys and langurs occupy much wider, and prosimian
   much narrower, climatic niche space than expected by their phylogenetic
   positions. phylo.niche.shift may help to improve research on niche
   evolution by allowing researchers to test specific hypotheses on the
   factors affecting clades' realised niche width and position, and the
   potential effects of climate change on species' distributions.},

Title = {Runway roadkill: a global review of mammal strikes with aircraftMots
   cles},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {420-435},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The number of reported collisions (i.e. strikes) between aircraft and
   wildlife is increasing globally, with consequences for personnel and
   passenger safety as well as for industry economics. These are important
   considerations for airport operators that are obliged to mitigate
   wildlife hazards at airfields. Incidents involving mammals account for
   approximately 3-10\% of all recorded strikes. However, relatively little
   research has been conducted on mammal strikes with aircraft outside of
   the USA.
   We collate mammal strike data from six major national aviation
   authorities and a global aircraft database and review the available
   scientific and grey literature. We aim to identify which mammal families
   are involved in strike events and how widespread the issue is on a
   global scale. We also aim to demonstrate the importance of consistently
   recording strike instances in national databases.
   We identified 40 families that were involved in strike events in 47
   countries. Reported mammal strike events have been increasing by up to
   68\% annually. Chiroptera (4 families) accounted for the greatest
   proportion of strikes in Australia; leporids and canids in Canada,
   Germany and the UK; and Chiroptera (5 families) and cervids in the USA.
   More mammals were struck during the landing phase of an aircraft's
   rotation than any other phase. Circa-diel strike risk was greatest at
   dusk and circa-annum strike risk was greatest during late summer, with
   some international variation. The total estimated cost of damage
   resulting from reported mammal strikes exceeded US\$103 million in the
   USA alone, over 30 years.
   Mammal strikes represent a substantial risk in airfield environments.
   Monitoring of existing wild mammal populations is required to understand
   temporal trends in presence, abundance, and activity patterns and to
   inform management decisions. Increased and accurate reporting of strike
   events globally is needed to inform Wildlife Hazard Management Plans and
   support effective strike mitigation.},

Abstract = {We studied the formation of ant communities on rock dumps at coal mine
   dump sites of different ages and in natural environments in southwestern
   Siberia. The species composition and diversity were studied by means of
   plot sampling and line-transect surveys, while the nest density of ants
   was determined using pitfall traps. Soil pH, turf extent, and vegetation
   cover were measured and their effects on the formation of ant
   communities were evaluated. Our results revealed that ants' density and
   species diversity increased with progressing recovery of the dumps. In
   the first succession phase, the soil at the dumps was alkaline and sites
   were inhabited primarily by Tetramorium caespitum. The density and the
   number of Myrmica sp. and Formica sp. nests increased with here was an
   increase in with increasing soil acidity. Lasius sp. ants were the first
   to form significant clusters of nests and to become numerically dominant
   at all the studied sites.},

Abstract = {Catches of vendace (Coregonus albula) from Pyhajarvi, a boreal lake in
   SW Finland, were exceptionally high for decades. Gradually, however,
   eutrophication and climate warming significantly changed the lake
   environment. From the 1970s to the 2010s, total phosphorus and
   chlorophyll a levels increased two- and threefold, respectively, while
   the average June-September surface temperature increased by 0.34 degrees
   C decade'. The highest population biomass of the young-of-the-year
   vendace in autumn, 6-18 (mean = 14) kg ha(-1). was recorded in
   1973-1989, a period of sustainable fishery. Overfishing in 1990-1999
   reduced autumn biomass of young-of-the-year vendace biomass to 3-11
   (mean = 6) kg ha(-1), allowing the competing planktivores perch
   (Percafluviatills), roach (Rutilus rutilus), and smelt (Osmerus -
   eperlanus) to increase and consume a larger part of the plankton
   resources. Eutrophication and climate warming appear to have favoured
   these species, and the new resource division persisted even after the
   vendace population recovered.},

Abstract = {We studied the defensive pygidial gland secretions in the adults of
   three ground beetle species of the genus Bembidion. We detected 46
   chemical compounds, of which we successfully identified 37, while nine
   remained unidentified. There were 4, 45 and 42 compounds in the pygidial
   gland secretions of Bembidion (Peryphanes) dalmatinum, B. (P.) deletum,
   and B. (Peryphus) subcostatum, respectively. n-Undecane, methacrylic
   acid and tiglic acid were common in all the studied species. Methacrylic
   acid was most abundant in the secretions of B. (P.) dalmatinum and B.
   (P.) deletum, while isovaleric acid in the secretion of B. (P.)
   subcostatum. We identified 30 compounds new to the tribe Bembidiini, 12
   of which were recorded for the first time in the family Carabidae. In
   addition, we also analyzed the morphology of the pygidial glands in B.
   (P.) dalmatinum using both bright-field and nonlinear microscopy.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships in vendace and least cisco, and their

Abstract = {I conducted a population-genetic study of the Eurasian cisco complex in
   an area extending from the Baltic Sea to the East-Siberian Sea using 30
   enzyme loci. The results indicate that the least cisco (Coregonus
   sardinella) populations from most rivers of the Kara, Laptev and
   East-Siberian sea basins are genetically fairly homogeneous, and that
   the cluster they form is different from the one for the vendace (C.
   albula) populations from the waterbodies of the Baltic and White seas
   (Nei's genetic distance (D-N) = 0.076). The least cisco and vendace
   originated from two major phylogenetic lineages of the species occurring
   as the purest form in the above regions. As a result of the evolution
   and complex interactions among local populations within the two
   phylogenetic lineages of cisco at the various stages of Middle and Late
   Quaternary glaciations, most extant modern populations are hybrid in
   origin. For example, the Barents Sea populations and the easternmost
   population from the East-Siberian Sea basin (Kolyma River) emerged as a
   result of hybridization during the last colonization wave by the least
   cisco (East Siberian) along the Arctic coast upon cisco's interaction
   with local ciscoes in the west and east The White and Kovzhskoye lake
   populations from the Caspian Sea basin, which form a joint cluster with
   them, are the hybrids of the local vendace and the descendants of the
   first wave of least cisco's (West Siberian) expansion to Europe. In this
   paper, I also discuss the most probable scenarios of cisco's
   colonization of the study area using paleolimnological reconstructions.},

Abstract = {Habitat associations of small mammals are an essential component of
   ecosystem functioning. We studied habitat associations of small mammals
   during an 8-year period in a hemiboreal forest-fannland landscape. We
   observed all five rodent and one shrew species in meadows, three species
   in forests, and two species in crop fields. Total abundance was evenly
   distributed across the three main habitat types but was biased towards
   habitat margins. The bank vole, Myodes glareolus, was associated with
   mature and middle-aged forests and avoided meadows; it was absent from
   crop fields. The yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis, occurred in
   all three main habitat types, without significant associations. However.
   its relative abundance was significantly higher in dry natural meadows
   and mid-successional forests, and it also favored ecotones. The striped
   field mouse Apodemus agrarius preferred crop fields and unmanaged
   meadows over forests. The vital hemiboreal small mammal community
   requires the preservation of heterogeneous forest-farmland complexes.},

Abstract = {Reoccupation of European landscapes by native species causes changes in

   in population density affects home range sins, we studied the strictly
   territorial herbivore Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). Twenty-four
   beavers were radio-tracked to reveal their home ranges under varying
   population densities. The mean length of occupied shorelines was 2648.0
   +/- 1530.6 m. We did not find any linkage between home range sizes and
   population densities. Our results showed that the availability of
   resources was significantly associated with the duration of site
   occupation. Thus, the space use was primarily determined by the
   availability of food resources, rather than by rising population
   density.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the variability in vendace population parameters in the
   context of a life table. Parameters related to growth. fecundity and
   survival were estimated for post-recruitment (age > 1 growing season)
   life stages of Lake Southern Konnevesi vendace in both very high and low
   population abundance regimes. Pre-recruitment survival producing
   population stability was then determined. We found a very strong
   compensatory density dependence in growth, fecundity and survival:
   during low abundance, a lifetime reproductive output of a female was
   almost 20 times that of the abundant regime. To maintain the low
   abundance regime, pre-recruitment survival must counterbalance it by
   decreasing to a very low level. Potential drivers of high variability in
   pre-recruit survival and potential for depensation, Allee effect, are
   discussed, as well as the implications of the results on fisheries
   management and risk of extinction due to anthropogenic stressors such as
   global warming or extensive predator stocking.},

Abstract = {A new species Duvalius djokovici Curcic, Pavicevic \& Vesovic is
   described, illustrated and compared with its closest relatives. It is
   tentatively placed in the subgenus Neoduvalius Muller, 1913. The new
   species is weakly pigmented, mid-sized, with no traces of eyes, with
   deep and complete frontal furrows, two pairs of elytral discal setae,
   and a distinctive form of aedeagus. It inhabits a subterranean site on
   Mt. Povlen (western Serbia), and is endemic to this mountain. We provide
   data on the distribution and biology of this new species. Additionally,
   we discuss the relations among other species of the subgenus Neoduvalius
   from western and southwestern Serbia, and provide a provisional key for
   their identification and an annotated list of Serbian Neoduvalius taxa.},

Abstract = {Re-establishment of a declined apex predator fish species in a lake
   ecosystem may have dramatic effects on other fish and plankton community
   already inhabiting the ecosystem. We studied mechanistically potential
   impacts of re-establishment of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the
   west-central European Lake Constance focusing on two commercially
   important fish species: whitefish and Eurasian perch. We compared
   simulation model outputs from two versions of an allometric trophic
   network model for Lake Constance, one with and one without the trout as
   the apex predator. The re-establishment of the declined brown trout
   reduced the perch population directly by predation and indirectly by
   increased resource competition, whereas the whitefish population was
   directly affected by increased predation. The decrease in fish biomass
   densities was highly sensitive to trout larval survivability. Both
   species showed strong compensatory behaviour by achieving higher per
   capita resource consumption when the populations decreased in the
   presence of brown trout.},

Abstract = {Long-term monitoring of the planktivorous vendace (Coregonus albula) in
   Pyhajarvi, a lake in SW Finland, revealed periods characterised by
   different types of population regulation. In 1971-1989, the vendace
   stock was strong and exhibited a two-year cycle. In 1990-1999, extreme
   weather conditions and predation resulted in recruitment failures, after
   which overfishing kept year-classes small. From 2000 onwards, the
   two-year oscillations were re-established at a lower level. Here, we
   show that the two-year cyclicity prevalent in the 1980s was consistent
   with the hypothesis of asymmetric competition between adults and
   juveniles. Food consumption by juveniles of strong year-classes retarded
   growth and weakened condition of the co-occurring adults, resulting in
   less abundant year-classes. In 2000-2018, the role of intraspecific
   competition diminished due to interspecific competition from increased
   populations of other planktivorous fish, preventing vendace from
   attaining higher abundance. Elevated temperature probably confounded the
   effects of competition, but its direct role was masked by simultaneous
   gradual eutrophication and fish assemblage changes.},

Abstract = {An accurate estimation of growth is crucial for any fish species that is
   a target in fishery. We applied a biphasic Lester model for pikeperch
   (Sander lucioperca) population that is a slow-growing one. In this
   model, age at maturity divide the growth into immature and matuire
   phases. Logistic regression models showed that both age and length were
   significant in males and females when using maturity as a dependent
   variable, and both of these variables differed between sexes. To
   estimate how the changes in used age at maturity affect the Lester model
   parameters, the effects of ages from l0\% to 90\% probability of
   maturity were analysed. The gonadosomatic index of males (max. 2\%) and
   females (max. 8.6\%) was used to select Lester models that also gave low
   estimates for the investments in reproduction (g). Low g values were
   found in the Lester models for ages from 60\% to 90\% probability of
   maturity in males, and from 30\% to 70\% in females.},

Abstract = {The tendency towards two-year cyclicity is considered typical of many
   Fennoscandian vendace populations, especially in fluctuation of
   recruitment, based on time series of individual lakes. We used two
   robust indicators to identify and quantify two-year cycles in vendace
   population proxy time series at different life-stages - spawning stock
   biomass (SB), density of newly hatched larvae (LD) and recruitment (REC)
   - from 22 Finnish lakes. Then we applied Fisher's meta-analytical test
   to assess the adequacy of the evidence to support the hypothesis that
   vendace population dynamics include two-year cyclicity. The results
   supported this hypothesis for REC but not for SB or LD. Yet. the
   indicators and test are conservative and time-series of SB and LD are
   shorter than those for REC. The appearance of cycles in REC is
   associated with high post-recruitment mortality, consequently
   practically only one spawning per cohort. Cycles may be typical for the
   recovery period from low abundance period also. Still, some populations
   with moderate post-REC mortality and non-cyclic SB abundance exhibited
   cycles in REC. Such dynamics presuppose the existence of more complex
   regulation based on the interaction of different life stages.},

Abstract = {Temperate-climate insects vary in overwintering life stages even within
   local communities, but factors driving this variation are not well
   understood. We studied the density and overwintering stages of insects
   in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and generated a
   phylogenetic tree of the insects based on DNA barcoding. The total
   number of studied individuals (of all four stages) was 2211; they
   belonged to 88 species, 36 families and 6 orders. Insect overwintering
   stages were phylogenetically conserved across species, primarily because
   particular stages dominated in related orders or families. In addition,
   immobile egg and pupal stages were common in the topsoil layer, whereas
   larvae and adults occurred generally in the top and deep soil layers;
   and larvae were often larger in the lower than in the upper soil layers.

Title = {Factors affecting spatiotemporal behaviour in the European brown hare
   Lepus europaeus: a meta-analysis},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The European brown hare Lepus europaeus is the most widely distributed
   hare species of the world, being naturally present throughout Eurasia
   and introduced as a game species in most continents. Despite the
   importance of this lagomorph for both management and conservation, a
   quantitative summary of its spatiotemporal behaviour is still lacking.
   Taking advantage of 51 selected studies conducted throughout the native
   range of the hare and spanning the last 40 years, we used meta-analytic
   approaches in order to: 1) investigate home range size in relation to
   ecological factors; 2) test preference across major habitat types; and
   3) provide a quantitative synthesis of hare activity patterns.
   Temporally adjusted home range size of hare populations decreased with
   increasing cropland cover (cereal and non-cereal crops), suggesting that
   home range size gets smaller with increasing food availability, and
   predicting that hare populations living in absence of crops would double
   their mean home range size compared to those inhabiting areas covered
   entirely by cropland. Hare populations where more males were sampled
   showed larger home ranges, in line with the polygynous mating system of
   this species. Hares preferred cropland and grassland over other habitats
   for foraging, thus selecting the two habitats characterised by the
   majority of trophic resources for this species. Yet, habitat types were
   used proportionally to their availability overall, except for the
   general avoidance of human settlements. Hares were mainly nocturnal,
   with the lowest activity during daytime, when activity was about one
   third of that at night, and showed moonlight avoidance, probably to
   limit encounters with nocturnal predators. Our work emphasises the
   importance of open habitats and especially cropland for this lagomorph,
   but also suggests some plasticity in the use of space and time by hares.
   Such plasticity may help this mammal to cope with future environmental
   changes, providing that landscape heterogeneity is maintained.},

Abstract = {In laboratory conditions, ants can combat a pathogen infection by means
   of the medicinal use of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is
   still unknown where they obtain medicinal compounds in the wild and how
   they use them. Due to an upregulation of ROS in response to herbivory,
   aphid-infested plants have been suggested to be a potential source of
   ROS for ants in the wild. We investigated whether infection would cause
   Lasius platythorax ants to change their foraging on extrafloral nectar
   on aphid-infested plants. We found no clear evidence for the ants
   significantly changing their foraging behaviour in response to the
   pathogen, nor for the extrafloral nectar to contain ROS. The aphids in
   our experiment had a relatively high concentration of ROS and future
   research should determine whether predation on aphids could be a
   potential source of both protein and ROS needed to combat a disease.},

Volume = {58},

Pages = {129-140},

Abstract = {We observed, photographed, and recopied (video and audio) spawning of
   five whitefish species - Coregonus migratorius (Baikal basin), C poled.
   C wpm. C. pidschian, C. muksun (the Ob basin) - in the spawning devices.
   All species spawned in autumn in the dark and the spawning period lasted
   10-30 days. Individual fish spawned several times during the night and
   the spawning behaviour consisted of three, cyclically repeated phases:
   courtship, mating and recovery. Spawning occurred in male-female (with
   males to be initiators) or male-male combination. and took place either
   in the water column or near the water surface. A mating act consisted of
   a rhythmic parallel movement of the fish swimming side by side with the
   synchronous release of the gametes. Three types of mating acts were
   observed: vertical (from bottom to top). horizontal and combined
   including both vertical and horizontal movements. The male in the
   spawning pair moved forward towards the female by the length of its
   head; it rhythmically struck the back of the female's abdomen by bending
   the caudal peduncle. Depending on the species and size of the fish, the
   mating act lasted for 0.3-3 s within 0.3-2 m. The frequency of rhythmic
   body collisions was on average 17 Hz for C migratorius and C. pidschian,
   while for C. tugun and C. peled it was 25-27 Hz. An egg batch released
   during the mating act amounted to about 90 eggs for C. lugun and 290-370
   for C. peled, which corresponded to 1\%-6\% of the total fecundity of a
   female. A female participated in 20-100 mating acts during 1-3 nights.
   Eggs cannibalism was also observed. During spawning, eggs were widely
   dispersed across the spawning area, which may be regarded as an
   adaptation aimed at increasing survival rate during embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {Measurements of cortisol levels in hair are a non-invasive method to
   study potential chronic stress that may affect carnivores' welfare.
   Using hair from 15 frozen and 18 taxidermied road-kill individuals. we
   aimed to provide information on the long-term physiological response of
   European wildcats (Fells silvestris silvestris) to habitat fragmentation
   and potential interspecific competition with golden jackals and red
   foxes. Our findings revealed that wildcats seemed to be unaffected by
   habitat fragmentation, suggesting that the facultative specialist
   behaviour of the species may lead to better toleration of human-altered
   environments. Red fox presence did not affect cortisol levels. However,
   significantly higher cortisol levels were measured in hairs of wildcats
   exposed to golden jackals, suggesting that the potential competition
   between the two species may lead to an increase in allostatic load in
   wildcats.},

Abstract = {Lake Inari is a subarctic, oligotrophic, regulated lake in northern
   Finland, connected via the Paatsjoki (Pasvik) River to the Arctic Ocean.
   A new coregonid species, the vendace (Coregonus albula). was introduced
   into the watershed in the 1960s and gradually established a population
   in the lake becoming part of its ecosystem. The annual vendace catch in
   1989 reached 300 tonnes, while during the following 25 years the vendace
   catches declined stabilizing at a very low level. Vendace introduction
   radically changed the fishing practices within a short time, and its
   population became fimily established in the lake. It benefited both
   fisheries and predatory fishes. especially salmonids. The vendace
   year-class strength varied greatly between 1983 and 2019. According to
   winter seine CPUE data, the strongest year-classes were up to 100 times
   greater than the weakest ones. Winter seine CPUE of one-year-old fish
   correlated positively with catches in the coming years. The growth data
   for the period 2015-2021 revealed a decrease in the youngest vendace
   age-groups.},

Abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) is a multifunctional transient structure
   of teleost embryos and larvae. The YSL performs nutritional,

   structure in different teleost species is fragmented. We aimed to
   characterize YSL of the postembryonic inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys
   nelma) along with the depletion of maternal reserves by analyzing serial
   histological sections. At hatching, the yolk complex was located
   anterior to the liver and contained a large oil globule (OG) in the
   front region, 1-2 additional OG. and the yolk itself. The YSL region
   around the OG was striated, the region surrounding the yolk was
   regionalized in an apico-basal direction. The yolk syncytial nuclei
   (YSN) were large and complex-shaped. The yolk was exhausted by
   approximately the 17th day post hatching (dph). One-two large OG
   remained in the yolk complex until the programmed death of the YSL at 31
   dph. The organization of the larval yolk complex of the inconnu was
   typical for Coregonidae. The abundance of comet-shaped YSN was its
   peculiarity.},

Title = {The challenging coexistence of forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis and
   timber concessions in central AfricaMots-cles},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With a drastic decrease in their populations over the last decades,
   forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis are facing increasing human
   pressure. Their decline will have serious ecological consequences, as
   they are key actors in shaping ecosystems. Whilst timber concessions
   host many mammal species, the interactions between selective logging and
   forest elephants remain unclear. Through an extensive literature review,
   we discussed the following: 1) the ecological and human factors that
   drive the distribution of forest elephants on a large scale as well as
   in the specific context of logged forests; 2) the contribution of forest
   elephants to the regeneration of timber species; and 3) the damage
   caused by forest elephants to timber species. Although human activities
   have the greatest impact on forest elephant distribution, it is the
   availability of food, water, and minerals that locally determines their
   use of the habitat. Under specific conditions, timber concessions may
   host large populations of forest elephants. As effective seed
   dispersers, forest elephants contribute to the regeneration of at least
   41 timber species, such as Bobgunnia fistuloides (pao rosa), one of the
   most expensive woods on the market. Damage caused by forest elephants is
   diverse and affects a wide range of species. From branch breaking to
   bark stripping, at least 61 timber species are used by forest elephants,
   and little is known about the consequences for the tree's vitality and
   wood quality. The interactions between forest elephants and logging are
   complex and involve many variables, requiring additional research.
   Nevertheless, this review suggests that timber concessions constitute
   key areas for forest elephant conservation, provided that low-impact
   logging and wildlife management are implemented.},

Title = {Factors Related to Crappie Indices of Abundance in a Large, Fluctuating
   Canyon Reservoir in Idaho},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {210-224},
Abstract = {Crappie (Pomoxis spp.) populations are challenging to manage due to
   highly variable year-class strength; however, such variability has
   rarely been investigated in western North America, where crappie often
   occupy large, steep-sided reservoirs prone to severe drawdown. We
   investigated the influence that various factors had on crappie
   abundance, as indexed by long-term trawling for larval fish and
   long-term electrofishing for older fish. Our primary findings were that:
   1) autumn age-0 crappie abundance was higher in years when larval
   abundance and reservoir flow were higher in the summer, 2) spring age-1
   crappie abundance was higher in years when fish were larger and more
   abundant entering their first winter, when hydraulic residence time was
   reduced and the reservoir volume was higher during the winter, and when
   predatory-sized smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were more
   abundant in the spring (though the latter relationship was likely not
   causative but rather a parallel response to mutually advantageous
   environmental conditions in the reservoir); and 3) age-0 crappie
   entering their first winter were larger in years with lower summer
   larval crappie abundance and wanner summer water temperature. We
   recommend autumn electrofishing to monitor crappie populations in large
   canyon reservoirs, where shorelines arc often too steep to sample fish
   with trap nets, because it provides an index of age-0 crappie abundance
   and size at the onset of their first winter as well as data on older
   crappie year classes and sympatric species; it also requires less

Title = {Generalists yet different: distributional responses to climate change
   may vary in opportunistic bat species sharing similar ecological

Abstract = {Climate change is among the key anthropogenic factors affecting species'
   distribution, with important consequences for conservation. However,
   little is known concerning the consequences of distributional changes on
   community-level interactions, and responses by generalist species might
   have many ecological implications in terms of novel interactions with
   resident species.
   In this study, we applied Ecological Niche Models and niche analysis to
   three generalist bat species, Hypsugo savii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, and
   Pipistrellus pipistrellus, which share similar ecological traits and are
   sympatric in parts of their ranges. Our aims were to investigate how
   predicted climate change will affect species' distribution and to
   analyse the degree of climatic niche overlap between the three species,
   in both the current and the future scenarios (2050 and 2070;
   Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5).
   Temperatures were the most important predictors influencing species'
   range expansion in future. According to our models, Pipistrellus kuhlii
   and Hypsugo savii may expand their geographic ranges towards northern
   latitudes, whereas the geographic range of the less thermophilous
   Pipistrellus will shift northwards, resulting in it losing the southern
   portion in Europe. The already considerable degree of climatic niche
   overlap between the three species will increase further in future.
   On the basis of our findings, within the new areas potentially colonised
   by all three species in future, alterations in community-level balance
   might occur, bringing about effects that are only partially predictable.
   In view of this, we highlight the need for further research and improved
   monitoring of bat communities in areas that are predicted to be
   particularly vulnerable to climate change.},

Title = {Benthic Insect Assemblage and Species-Level Responses to Eleven Years of
   Nutrient Addition in the Kootenai River, Idaho},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-97},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Because of their abundance and intermediate trophic level positions,
   benthic invertebrates can affect trophic dynamics in aquatic ecosystems
   by routing and regulating energy through aquatic food webs. Significant
   reductions in nutrient loading and primary production downstream from
   dams can profoundly affect benthic insect assemblages. The Kootenai
   River, a large 7th order river in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia,
   experienced such changes following construction of Libby Dam in 1972. A
   nutrient addition program was initiated in 2005 to mitigate the
   resulting cultural oligotrophication. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate long-term responses to nutrient addition among benthic insects
   at the assemblage and species levels, using replicated data collected
   from 2003 to 2016, and classified into pre-, early post-, and late
   post-nutrient addition periods. Response metrics included total
   abundance and biomass measures across all species, as well as aggregated
   species of major insect orders, five functional feeding groups, and
   species richness. We also included abundance responses from a
   substantial number of individual Chironomidae, and non-Chironomidae
   insect species. Effects of nutrient addition were assessed using
   before-after-control-impact and before-and-after analyses. Spearman's
   Rank correlation coefficients were used to express the degree of
   association between biotic and abiotic factors. Nutrient addition
   consistently contributed to increased individual and total insect
   abundance each year for over a decade without inducing substantive
   changes in community composition or species dominance. Overall, benthic
   insects responded positively to nutrient addition and did so in a
   similar fashion in the early and late nutrient addition periods.},

Abstract = {In western North America, nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
   frequently threaten native salmonids via competition and hybridization,
   so fisheries managers often implement eradication programs for
   conservation purposes. In conjunction with such programs, managers often
   construct population models to evaluate the effects of different
   management strategies designed to control the undesirable population,
   but such models require demographic data (e.g., age, growth, sex ratios,
   and survival), which are lacking for western brook trout populations.
   Brook trout were sampled from 12 alpine lakes and two streams in Idaho,
   with total length varying from 80 to 380 mm and age varying from 1 to 11
   yrs. Across all waters, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L8 varied
   from 231 to 490 mm (mean = 345 mm) and K varied from 0.15 to 0.76 (mean
   = 0.37). Survival estimates, constructed from age-length keys, were
   corrected for streams with mark-recapture data; for alpine lakes,
   corrections were made via gill net selectivity data. Survival varied
   from 0.30 to 0.56 (mean = 0.45), and except for one waterbody, estimates
   were minimally affected by correcting for capture efficiency. The
   proportion of the population that was male varied from 0.34 to 0.75
   (mean = 0.53). Our results indicate that brook trout population vital
   rates in Idaho were similar to those observed in their native range, and
   were surprisingly similar between alpine lake and stream environments.},

Title = {Effects of Stream Enhancement Structures on Water Temperature in South
   Sister Creek, Oregon},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-151},
Abstract = {We evaluated commonly used methods for monitoring stream restorations to
   inform and improve restoration monitoring and evaluation, using a
   headwater stream in the Oregon Coast Range as a case-study example.
   In-stream restoration projects are seldom monitored both pre- and
   post-restoration. In addition, frequently used low-cost methods may not
   provide sufficient data to effectively assess trends in stream
   temperature. Here, we examined what can be learned from temperature
   loggers installed in the same locations over multiple years in a
   restored stream. In-stream structures were installed between 2007 and
   2011 along a 10-km length of South Sister Creek, Oregon for the purpose
   of enhancing in-stream habitat. Summer stream temperature data were
   collected using Hobo Pro-V temperature-logging thennistors at four
   locations in 2006, prior to restoration, as well as in 2012 and 2013. In
   2013, additional temperature loggers were placed within 80 m of the four
   original loggers to investigate within-reach variability. Although
   median stream temperatures were highest in 2013 at all four multi-year
   sites, 7-day maximum temperatures were 4 to 5 degrees C cooler in
   post-treatment years than in 2006. Inter-annual variability in stream
   temperature was more closely linked to inter-annual variability in air
   temperature and solar radiation than presence of in-stream structures.
   Thermal heterogeneity was greater in reaches with deeper pools than in
   bedrock-dominated reaches. Although in-stream structures can create cool
   microhabitats, they have little influence on mean stream temperature.
   Longer pre-restoration monitoring and sensor deployment in more varied
   in-stream habitats would improve our ability to evaluate restoration
   impacts.},

Title = {Monitoring the Return of Marine-Derived Nitrogen to Riparian Areas in
   Response to Dam Removal on the Elwha River, Washington},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Number = {2},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Two sources of nitrogen to Pacific Northwest riparian areas are
   marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) via anadromous Pacific salmon
   (Oncorlomchus spp.) and atmospheric nitrogen fixation via red alder
   (Alnus rubra). The recent removal of two large dams on the Elwha River,
   WA, opened up about 60 kin of previously inaccessible river habitat for
   anadromous salmon. We used naturally abundant stable nitrogen isotopes
   to establish baseline data to monitor the influx of MDN to riparian
   zones of Elwha River tributaries post dam removal. We sampled riparian
   soil, overstory, and understory vegetation in sites with nitrogen-fixing
   A. rubra and sites with bigleaf maple (Acer mac rophyllum) at an
   undammed reference site, and along three tributaries, one between the
   former dams (accessible to anadromous salmon since 2012) and the others
   upstream of the former darns (no anadromous salmon). Based on delta N-15
   measurements of soil and vegetation, we did not detect MDN at any of the
   tributaries, including the reference tributary. However, the understory
   riparian vegetation between the former dams had a higher delta N-15 than
   the other tributaries, which may be due to upstream anthropogenic
   nitrogen sources. Although A. rubra foliage was isotopically distinct
   from A. macrophyllum, and A. rubra litter had higher total nitrogen,
   soil and understory vegetation in A. rubra and A. macrophyllum sites did
   not differ isotopically. Monitoring of these areas and those further
   upstream on the Elwha River will allow us to trace the return of MDN to
   the watershed, and help to clarify the role that anadromous fish play in
   riparian ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Trends and transitions in the growing season MODerate resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   time series at 250-m resolution were analyzed for the period from 2000
   to 2018 to understand recent patterns of vegetation change in ecosystems
   of the Yukon River basin in interior Alaska. Statistical analysis of
   changes in the NDVI time series was conducted using the ``Breaks for
   Additive Seasonal and Trend{''} method (BEAST). This structural change
   analysis indicated that NDVI breakpoints and negative 18-yr trends in
   vegetation greenness over the years since 2000 could be explained in
   large part by the impacts of severe wildfires, commonly affecting
   shrubland and forested ecosystems at relatively low elevations (< 300
   m). At least one NDVI breakpoint was detected at 29\% of the MODIS
   pixels within the Yukon River basin study area. The wannest and wettest
   years in the study time period were found to be associated with a
   sizeable fraction (30\%) of NDVI breakpoints. Among pixels with no NDVI
   breakpoints detected, both forest and shrubland trends were strongly
   skewed toward positive trend values. Results from gradual NDVI trend
   analysis supported the hypothesis that air temperature warming has
   enhanced the rates of (unburned) vegetation growth in shrubland and
   woodlands across interior Alaska over the past two decades.},

   are native to the Columbia River basin, they are uncommon in most of the

   Here we provide evidence that the species is indigenous to lakes and
   streams in the Columbia River basin of Washington State, based on
   multiple lines of testimony. Evidence includes: 1) no record of
   introductions by federal or state fish and wildlife management agencies;
   2) over 100 museum specimens collected from 1881 to 1930; 3) records of
   abundance in the tens of thousands in area lakes prior to modern
   management efforts in the 1940s; and 4) 62 diagnostic bones recovered
   from four archaeological sites dating before 1850.},

Title = {Factors Affecting Angling Fight and Air Exposure Times for Yellow Perch,
   Smallmouth Bass, and Crappie in Lentic Fisheries},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {302-308},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {The effects of catch-and-release related fight and air exposure times on
   post-release stress response or mortality of fishes has repeatedly been
   investigated, but rarely have anglers been observed to determine fight
   and air exposure times to which caught-and-released fish are actually
   exposed. We observed anglers land and either harvest or release yellow
   perch (Perca flavescens), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), white
   crappie (Pomoxis annularis), and black crappie (P. nigromaculatus) to
   evaluate associated fight time and air exposure time. A total of 237
   fight and 312 air exposure times were recorded; mean fight time was 10.1
   s (range 1 to 40 s), mean air exposure of released fish was 20.1 s
   (range 2 to 141 s), and 95\% of anglers subjected fish to < 24 s of
   fight time and < 51 s of air exposure. Landing crappie required less
   time ((X) over bar = 8.5 s) than landing yellow perch ((X) over bar =
   12.8 s) or smallmouth bass ((X) over bar = 12.9 s). Air exposure was
   longer for yellow perch ((X) over bar = 28.1 s) and smallmouth bass ((X)
   over bar = 25.9 s) than for crappie ((X) over bar = 14.9 s), and small
   fish were subjected to less air ((X) over bar = 17.6 s) than larger fish
   ((X) over bar = 28.5 s). Results of the present study suggest that air
   exposure and fight times for warm-water and cool-water fish released by
   Idaho anglers are relatively short and therefore appear to be
   biologically inconsequential. Further work is needed to support or
   refute these findings for actual anglers across a larger geographic
   area.},

Abstract = {Noise from military aircraft over the Olympic Peninsula (Washington,
   USA), has increased in recent years with changes in operations from
   nearby facilities. Further increases in training activities are
   proposed, but lack of any data that describe current noise levels has
   hindered assessment of impacts on humans and wildlife. Over a one-year
   period, we monitored three primary and two supplemental sites to
   document current noise contributions of military aircraft to the
   soundscape. We found that currently, 88\% of audible air traffic is
   military. Flight training activities were concentrated during weekdays
   and in daytime hours, with hourly percent time audible averaging 14 to
   42\%. The duration of time that military aircraft were audible in any
   hour was correlated across sites up to 51 km apart, and the site outside
   the operations area experienced substantial noise, signifying a noise
   footprint extending well beyond the operations area. Maximum loudness of
   flyover events exceeded 82 dBA (A-weighted sound pressure level), and a
   median increase of 3 to 4 dBA (i.e., a doubling of existing acoustic
   energy) from ambient periods was typical in most sites and seasons.
   Comparison of spectral power densities indicates that military aircraft
   largely impact frequencies below 1.2 kHz, averaging a 20-dB increase
   (i.e., quadrupling of loudness) in this frequency range compared with
   ambient samples. Our results demonstrate that changes in military
   operations will play a dominant role in dictating the future soundscape
   of the Olympic Peninsula, and offer an empirical basis for inquiry into
   how the proposed increases will impact people and wildlife in this
   region.},

Title = {Impact of human disturbance on temporal partitioning within carnivore
   communities},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-81},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Interspecific competition is an important evolutionary force,
   influencing interactions between species and shaping the composition of
   biological communities. In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of
   negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy
   of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit
   synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance,
   however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which
   has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the
   disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities
   could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing
   interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature
   systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate
   quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human,
   meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal
   overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders
   Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models
   investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal
   partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that
   temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a
   consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and
   relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and
   trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly
   site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and
   abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and
   competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses
   that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did
   not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human
   disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in
   interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research
   would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and
   investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously.
   Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap
   with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.},

Abstract = {In well-established flowering plant invasions, floral phenotypes that do
   not attract pollinators are predicted to be eliminated through natural
   selection. We explored this hypothesis in the invasive plant species
   Scotch broom ( Cytisus scoparius), which has yellow flowers frequented
   by a diverse community of bee species, as well as red-tinged flowers
   that are predicted to be pollinated at a significantly lower rate. We
   predicted that plants with the red-flower phenotype will have fewer
   flowers visited, produce fewer seed pods per flower, and produce fewer
   seeds per pod than the yellow-flowered type. To investigate this, we
   measured the proportion of flowers pollinated for red- and
   yellow-flowered phenotypes, observed the number of seed pods produced
   per flower, and counted seeds per pod. Although we found lower
   pollination in the red-flowered phenotype, we did not see differences in
   female fitness. Scotch broom is an invader predicted to be limited in
   fecundity by the rate of pollinator visits and would be expected to lose
   phenotypes that attract fewer pollinators. We found the persistence of a
   less-attractive phenotype, likely because the reduction in male fitness
   is not paired with a reduction in female fitness.},

Title = {Passive Restoration of a Small Mountain Stream in Eastern Oregon},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-72},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, I documented the results of 11 years of passive
   restoration of a small mountain stream in northeastern Oregon. Removal
   of the main stressors on the system, grazing and agricultural practices,
   resulted in a strong recovery of the riparian vegetation over the middle
   two-thirds of the reach. Cover of trees and shrubs tripled, tree density
   increased sevenfold, and stream shading fourfold over the period 2007
   through 2018. Average maximum daily stream temperature declined by 2.1
   to 2.8 degrees C, and average maximum diurnal temperature range narrowed
   by 3.7 to 4.6 degrees C. Recolonizing American beavers (Castor
   canadensis) played an essential role in improving the condition of the
   streambed over 18\% of the reach. Their dams and ponds initiated the
   process of streambed aggradation and transformed the single-thread,
   incised channel into a multi-thread configuration within beaver
   complexes. Vegetation expansion was much stronger in impounded than in
   un-impounded parts of the stream. Passive restoration was not effective
   in two sections, together comprising one-third of the reach. In the
   upper part of the stream, recovery stalled because of continued
   (unauthorized) trespass grazing during late summer and fall. The
   channelized lower section of the stream was too severely modified for
   measurable recovery to occur. I concluded that 11 years of passive
   restoration improved the functionality of the stream from 24\% to 32\%,
   and within beaver complexes, up to 57\% of its pre-disturbance
   condition.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Responses of Wintering Bald Eagles to Changes in Salmon
   Carcass Availability in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {307-316},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Each winter, thousands of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from
   across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed
   on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta).
   However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are
   reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source
   for eagles. The ability of eagles to adjust to these impacts is crucial
   to their survival, and their responses are currently unknown. I
   hypothesized that eagles are responding by redistributing to non-river
   habitat in search of alternative food sources. Specifically, I examined
   the redistribution of over-wintering eagles from river habitat to nearby
   agricultural areas in response to seasonal declines in carcass
   availability. Over two consecutive winters, I conducted weekly eagle
   surveys on a 30-km stretch of the Nooksack River and a 22.5-km stretch
   of farmland northwest of the river. I examined the association between
   salmon carcass distribution and eagle abundance on the Nooksack River,
   and evaluated the temporal relationship between eagle abundance on the
   Nooksack River versus neighboring farmland. I found a strong negative
   association between eagle abundance on the river versus adjacent
   farmland, and observed eagles primarily concentrated near dairy farms
   and waterfowl rafts. My results suggest that eagles are responding to
   declining carcass availability by redistributing to non-river habitat in
   search of alternative food sources, and that a substantial fraction may
   migrate to agricultural areas.},

Title = {Seasonal Catch Rates of the Endemic Olympic Mudminnow in Wetland Habitat},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-209},
Abstract = {The Olympic mudminnow (Novumbra hubbsi) is a small freshwater fish,
   endemic to western Washington State. Although the species is listed as a
   Washington sensitive species, the lack of routine monitoring has
   resulted in poor understanding of population dynamics over time needed
   to support management and conservation actions. Olympic mudminnow
   commonly live in wetlands and associated low-gradient channels with
   tannic water and soft substrates, making conventional electrofishing and
   seine sampling approaches challenging and potentially inaccurate.
   Alternatively, minnow traps can easily be set in a wide range of depths
   and habitat types and allow for more systematic, repeated sampling. The
   study purpose was to conduct monthly surveys over a 19-month period to
   help develop standardized sampling methods. Sampling using baited Gee
   minnow traps set overnight was conducted in a wetland complex that flows
   into Eld Inlet in south Puget Sound, Washington. Catch rates of Olympic
   mudminnow were highest in late summer to early autumn (August through
   November) when water depths were low and water temperatures were
   decreasing. Trap mortality was relatively low for both Olympic mudminnow
   and amphibians but increased during warm spring and summer months.
   Eighty percent of the Olympic mudminnow captured were between 44 and 56
   mm total length, and there was no difference in size between males and
   females. Gravid females were observed from October to June. Overall,
   minnow trapping appeared to be an effective method for monitoring
   Olympic mudminnow populations year round; however, sampling in the
   autumn appears to be advantageous because catch rates were high, and
   mortality was low.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions have emerged as one of the main drivers of
   biodiversity change and decline, and numbers of species classed as alien
   in parts of their ranges are rapidly rising. The European Union
   established a dedicated regulation to limit the impacts of invasive
   alien species (IAS), which is focused on the species on a Union List of
   IAS of particular concern. However, no previous study has specifically
   addressed the ecology of invasive alien mammals included on the Union
   List. We performed a systematic review of published literature on these
   species. We retrieved 262 publications dealing with 16 species, and we
   complemented these with the most up-to-date information extracted from
   global databases on IAS. We show that most of the study species reached
   Europe as pets and then escaped from captivity or were intentionally
   released. On average each year in the period 1981-2020, 1.2 species were
   recorded for the first time as aliens in European countries, and most
   species are still expanding their alien ranges by colonising
   neighbouring territories. France is the most invaded nation, followed by
   Germany, Italy, and the Russian Federation, and the muskrat Ondatra
   zibethicus, the American mink Neovison vison, and the raccoon dog
   Nyctereutes procyonoides are the most widespread species, having invaded
   at least 27 countries each. Invasive mammals of European Union concern
   are threatening native biodiversity and human well-being: worryingly,
   81\% of the 16 study species are implicated in the epidemiological cycle
   of zoonotic pathogens. Containing secondary spread to further countries
   is of paramount importance to avoid the establishment of new populations
   of invasive mammals and the related impacts on native communities,
   ecosystem services, and human health. We present a compendium on the
   ecology and impacts of invasive mammals of European Union concern. It
   can be used to assist environmental policies, identify and subsequently
   fill knowledge gaps, and inform stakeholders.},

Title = {Diet of the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes in Australia: analysis of
   temporal and spatial patterns},

Abstract = {The red fox Vulpes vulpes is one of the world's most widespread
   carnivores. A key to its success has been its broad, opportunistic diet.
   The fox was introduced to Australia about 150 years ago, and within 30
   years of its introduction was already recognised as a threat to
   livestock and native wildlife.
   We reviewed 85 fox diet studies (totalling 31693 samples) from
   throughout the species' geographic range within Australia. Mammals were
   a major component of fox diet, being present in 70 +/- 19\% of samples
   across n = 160 locations. Invertebrates (38 +/- 26\% n = 130) and plant
   material (26 +/- 25\% n = 123) were also both staple foods and often the
   dominant food category recorded. Birds (13 +/- 11\% n = 137) and
   reptiles (10 +/- 15\% n = 132) were also commonly reported, while frogs
   were scarcely represented (1.6 +/- 3.6\% n = 111) in fox diet studies.
   Biogeographical differences reveal factors that likely determine prey
   availability. Diet composition varied with ecosystem, level of
   vegetation clearing and condition, and climate zone.
   Sample type (i.e. stomach versus scat samples) also significantly
   influenced reporting of diet composition. Livestock and frogs were
   underrepresented in records based on analysis of scats, whereas small
   mammals (native rodents, dasyurid marsupials, and bats) were more likely
   to be recorded in studies of scats than in studies of stomach contents.
   Diet varied seasonally, reflecting activity patterns of prey species and
   food availability. This synthesis also captures temporal shifts in fox
   diet over 70 years (1951-2020), as foxes have switched to consuming more
   native species in the wake of successful broadscale biological control
   of the invasive European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus.
   Diet analyses, such as those summarised in this review, capture the
   evidence required to motivate for greater control of foxes in Australia.
   This synthesis also highlights the importance of integrated pest species
   management to meet biodiversity conservation outcomes.},

Abstract = {Establishment of trees in subalpine meadows is a potential indicator of
   ecological effects of climate change. Tree establishment is a multi-year
   process including cone and seed production, germination, establishment,
   and growth, with each demographic step possibly sensitive to different
   climate limitations. While most studies have focused on one or a few
   steps, this study follows a cohort of individually marked saplings for
   27 years beginning as seeds in two meadows on Hurricane Ridge, Olympic
   National Park. These meadows are examples of a south-facing tall sedge
   community type rather than the north-facing heath-shrub type where
   establishment has usually been observed. Results showed that mortality
   was high for the first few years, but number of saplings stabilized
   after the first decade. Seedling mortality during germination and
   establishment was directly related to weather that resulted in high air
   and soil temperatures and drought, while mortality of established
   saplings was indirectly related to weather through effects on growth.
   Growth was enhanced by longer growing season and warmer minimum
   temperatures; growth over three years and sapling height were predictive
   of mortality. Most sapling survival occurred in lichen (primarily
   Trapeliopsis granulosa) and Vaccinium deliciosum plant communities. Many
   saplings are growing at very low rates compared with the rate predicted
   from adult trees. It is also apparent that while microsite within meadow
   (e.g., relative snow depth) is important in determining sapling success,
   the landscape position of meadows (e.g., north versus south aspect)
   exerts a higher-level control over whether a subalpine meadow is likely
   to disappear with warming climate.},

Title = {Effects of Post-Fire Timber Harvest and Mastication on Shrub Regrowth in
   the Sierra Nevada Mountains: A Lake Tahoe Case Study},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {3-4},

Abstract = {Increasingly large high-severity wildfires in dry forests of the western
   United States have led to concern about how best to regenerate new
   forests after wildfires. Harvesting fire-killed trees, burning woody
   debris, and tree planting are commonly used reforestation strategies.
   This study evaluated the effects of a novel forest restoration approach
   that involved masticating un-merchantable dead trees and spreading the
   woody debris generated across the site to prevent erosion from the 2007
   Angora Fire in Lake Tahoe, California. Woody material covered 82\% of
   the site after treatment, with an average depth of 6.6 cm, and volume of
   190 tonnes per hectare. We found that this treatment reduced shrub
   regrowth, compared to an untreated area nearby, and that shrub regrowth
   was inversely related to fuel depth. Seven years after the fire, shrub
   cover averaged only 50\% on treated plots compared to 92\% on untreated
   plots. The tallest shrubs averaged 69 cm in height on the treated site
   compared to 114 cm on nearby untreated sites. Tree seedlings planted on
   the treated site averaged 141 cm in height, well above the height of the
   shrubs. Advantages of this approach include controlling erosion while
   reducing drought stress, reducing the potential for weed introduction,
   and reducing the need for herbicide to control shrub competition.
   Although leaving a layer of woody material where new trees have been
   planted does constitute a fire hazard, so too does a vigorous shrub
   layer. Managers should consider and weigh these factors when deciding on
   a postfire reforestation strategy.},

Title = {Biomass Regressions for Understory Species in Young-Growth Sitka
   Spruce-Western Hemlock Forests of Southeast Alaska},

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Quantifying forest understory biomass is important for understanding
   ecological processes, but there are few methods for non-destructive
   measurement of understory biomass in southeast Alaska. We developed
   cover-to-biomass equations for common understory species in young-growth
   Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)
   forests. A sampling method of visually estimating cover and
   destructively measuring biomass was used at 35 stands aged 10 to 67
   years on Prince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska from 2007 to 2018.
   Linear cover to biomass regressions were fitted for 42 species and other
   genera. In addition to total biomass, regressions were fitted by part
   (leaves, twigs, wood) for all woody species. Regressions were also
   fitted for graminoid, fern, forb, shrub, tree, and conifer functional
   classes. We demonstrate the utility of these regressions by applying
   them to the Tongass-wide young-growth studies, a rich dataset with
   understory cover measurements from treated and un-treated stands in four
   young-growth age classes. Understory biomass was greater in 0- to
   5-year-old even-aged stands than stands greater than 15 years old.
   Treated stands (thinned, etc.) had a greater understory biomass, annual
   growth, and carbon than untreated stands older than 15 years.
   Additionally, biomass composition became less woody with increasing
   stand age in treated stands. These regressions provide an approach to
   estimate understory biomass, which can be used for evaluation of forest
   functions, including understory dynamics, wildlife habitats, and total
   stand carbon.},

Abstract = {Accurate information on reproductive ecology is necessary to develop
   conservation actions for at-risk wildlife species. Our objective was to
   describe female reproductive parameters and den use of two subspecies of
   wild, untrapped Pacific martens (Humboldt marten, Martes caurina
   humboldtensis; Sierran marten, M. c. sierrae) of conservation interest
   in California. We used radio telemetry and remotely triggered cameras to
   monitor 10 Humboldt martens (2014 to 2016) and six Sierran martens (2016
   to 2017) over 23 total denning periods. For Humboldt martens, mean
   parturition date was 13 April, proportion of adult females reproducing
   was 80\% (n = 12 of 15), and mean litter size was 1.8 +/- 0.6 kits ((x)
   over bar +/- SD). For Sierran martens, mean parturition date was 29
   April, proportion of adult females reproducing was 87\% (n = 7 of 8),
   and mean litter size was 1.9 +/- 0.7 kits. Humboldt and Sierran marten
   dens were predominantly located in woody structures, with live trees,
   snags, and logs comprising 91\% and 79\% of dens, respectively. Although
   reproductive ecologies of Humboldt and Sierran martens were largely
   similar, Sierran marten parturition dates were significantly later. We
   compare our study populations to other North American marten populations
   and examine factors that could influence consistency or variability in
   reproductive parameters between populations.},

Abstract = {Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is a long-lived tree found in
   high-elevation forests of western North America that is declining due to
   the non-native white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and
   climate-driven outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
   pondemsae; MPB). The National Park Service established a monitoring
   program for whitebark pine in seven parks, including Sequoia \& Kings
   Canyon, Yosemite, Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, Mount Rainier, Olympic,
   and North Cascades National Parks. Using these data, we summarized stand
   structure, presence of blister rust, and MPB prevalence to provide a
   baseline for future monitoring. Next, we used a stochastic,
   size-structured population model to speculate on future trends in the
   seven national park populations under conditions of increased MPB
   activity and ongoing blister rust infection observed in Crater Lake. We
   found that blister rust infected 29 to 54\% of whitebait pine in all the
   parks except the two southernmost, Sequoia \& Kings Canyon and Yosemite,
   where infections rates were 0.3\% and 0.2\%, respectively. The
   proportion of dead trees in Sequoia \& Kings Canyon and Yosemite was low
   (0 to 1\%), while they ranged from 10 to 43\% in the other parks. Model
   projections suggested an average population decline of 25\% in the parks
   over the next century using Crater Lake conditions, declines which are
   possible if blister rust continues to spread and climate change results
   in a significant increase in the frequency or severity of MPB outbreaks.
   Overall, our study describes conditions at seven western parks and
   illustrates potential rates of whitebark pine decline if pest outbreaks
   and/or blister rust infections worsen.},

Title = {Effects of Livestock Exclusion on Stream Banks and Riparian Vegetation
   in Washington and Oregon},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Livestock exclusion is a widespread restoration technique in the Pacific
   Northwest to protect and improve riparian and stream habitats. To assess
   stream restoration outcomes from excluding livestock, the Washington
   State Salmon Recovery Funding Board and the Oregon Watershed Enhancement
   Board evaluated 12 livestock exclusion projects from 2004 to 2017 using
   a before-after control-impact design. Paired treatment and control
   reaches were monitored once before restoration implementation (year 0)
   and several years after implementation (years 1, 3, 5, and 10) to assess
   bank erosion, bank canopy cover, riparian vegetation structure, pool
   tail fine sediment, and exclosure fencing function. Livestock exclusion
   significantly reduced bank erosion and bare ground. Bank erosion in
   treatment reaches decreased from 44\% pre-project to 11\% by year 10. In
   treatment reaches, bare ground was over 1.5 times lower in year 10 than
   pre-project. Most treatment reaches had intact fencing at the conclusion
   of the ten-year monitoring period, but there were instances where
   fencing did not fully function as intended, allowing livestock to access
   riparian areas inside the exclosure. Several metrics did not respond
   over time, which may be the result of several factors, including
   limitations of the sampling protocols, evidence of livestock grazing in
   treatment reaches, lack of site stratification, control reaches that
   were not well matched with treatment reaches, and short-duration of
   pre-project data collection. Despite these limitations, we still
   detected significant decreases in bank erosion and bare ground within
   treatment reaches. Future livestock exclusion monitoring should consider
   focus on ensuring fence maintenance, improved monitoring oversight, and
   the use of more quantitative monitoring protocols.},

Abstract = {Genetic analyses have become increasingly powerful, more readily
   available to biologists, and have made ever more degraded DNA
   potentially useful. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are a
   relatively new ``class{''} of markers that show promise for use with
   degraded or archived samples. We sequenced a panel of 298 SNPs from
   Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tissue in three comparative
   studies to determine the effect of DNA quality at sampling, time in
   archive, and tissue type and preservation method on SNP genotyping
   success using logistic regression. The first study evaluated pristine
   DNA from live adults sampled at three hatcheries and archived up to 6
   years. The second study compared samples from carcasses with varying
   levels degradation (i.e., condition) and archived up to 15 years. The
   third study compared heart and fin samples preserved either in ethanol
   or on paper from carcasses with varying levels of degradation and
   processed within 6 months. Genotyping success for fresh tissue did not
   decline over the 6-year archive period at two of the three hatcheries,
   suggesting sample handling techniques may be more influential than time
   in archive. Genotyping success of archived carcass samples depended more
   on carcass condition than time in archive. Heart tissue genotyped
   consistently more often than fin samples from all but poor condition
   carcasses. Based on these results, we make tissuesampling
   recommendations for different intended purposes. We also provide simple,
   post-collection sample handling procedures that can increase genotyping
   success regardless of tissue or preservation method.},

Abstract = {The puma Puma concolor is the fourth largest wild felid and the most
   widespread native terrestrial mammal of the Americas. We synthesised
   published literature documenting the biotic interactions of pumas, in
   order to: 1) advance our understanding of the ecological roles pumas
   play in natural systems, and 2) support strategic decision-making about
   conservation investments, public education, and whole-ecosystem
   conservation management. We divided puma biotic interactions into five
   categories: 1) diet and prey regulation, 2) fear effects on prey
   (including trophic cascades), 3) effects via carrion production, 4)
   effects on other carnivores, and 5) ecosystem services. We reviewed 162
   studies that met our search criteria, which described 543 ecological
   interactions between pumas and 485 other species. Puma diet and prey
   regulation was the most common research topic. The geographic
   distribution of research was highly skewed towards the USA and Canada,
   and research in Tropical moist forests was underrepresented. We found a
   steep increase in the number of scientific publications exploring the
   biotic interactions associated with pumas over time, but publications
   that reported effect sizes or measured the strength of interactions did
   not increase as quickly. We noted numerous gaps in our knowledge of puma
   biotic interactions and found few well-controlled studies of prey fear
   effects, trophic cascades, or ecosystem services. We conclude that pumas
   are influential ecological actors in natural systems and important
   brokers of energy and nutrients throughout ecosystems in the Western
   Hemisphere, linking disparate species from many trophic levels.
   Ultimately, we found evidence for investing in and prioritising the
   protection and restoration of puma populations to conserve biodiversity
   in the Americas.},

Title = {Of mammals and milk: how maternal stress affects nursing offspring},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-147},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A large body of research shows that maternal stress during an
   offspring's early life can impact its phenotype in both the short and
   long term. In the Vertebrata, most research has been focused on maternal
   stress during the prenatal period. However, the postnatal period is
   particularly important in mammals because maternal milk provides a
   conduit by which maternal hormones secreted in response to stressors
   (glucocorticoids, GCs) can reach offspring. Moreover, lactation outlasts
   gestation in many species. Though GCs were first detected in milk over
   40 years ago, few studies have explored how they affect nursing
   offspring, and no reviews have been written on how maternal stress
   affects nursing offspring in the natural world. We discuss the evolution
   of milk and highlight its importance in each of the three mammalian
   lineages: monotremes (subclass Monotremata), marsupials (infraclass
   Marsupialia), and eutherians (infraclass Placentalia). Most research on
   the effects of milk GCs on offspring has been focused on eutherians, but
   monotremes and marsupials rely on their mothers' milk for a
   proportionally longer period of time, and so research on these taxa may
   yield more insight. We show that GCs are important for milk production,
   both during an individual nursing bout and over the entire lactation
   period, and review evidence of GCs moving from maternal blood to milk,
   and eventually to nursing offspring. We examine evidence from rodents
   and primates of associations between GC levels in lactating females
   (either blood or milk) and offspring behaviour and growth rates. We
   discuss ways that maternal stress may impact these offspring phenotypes
   outside of milk GCs, such as changes to: (1) milk output, (2) other milk
   constituents (e.g. macronutrients, growth factors, cytokines), and (3)
   maternal care behaviour. Critical to understanding the fitness impacts
   of elevated maternal GC levels during lactation is to place this within
   the context of the natural environment. Species-specific traits and
   natural histories will help us to understand why such maternal stress
   produces different offspring phenotypes that equip them to cope with and
   succeed in the environment they are about to enter.},

Title = {A systematic review into the suitability of urban refugia for the
   Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-38},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Urban growth and intensification are projected to increase as the global
   human population increases. Historically, urban areas have been
   disregarded as suitable wildlife habitat, but it is now known that these
   areas can be biodiverse and that wildlife species can adapt to the
   environmental conditions. One such urban-dwelling species is the
   Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, which has suffered population
   declines in several countries throughout its range in recent decades.
   The current published literature was systematically reviewed to
   determine whether or not urban habitats are suitable refugia for red
   squirrels, through identifying and discussing key topics regarding the
   urban ecology of red squirrels. Urban environments can support higher
   population densities of red squirrels than rural areas, probably due to
   the widespread and reliable provision of anthropogenic supplemental food
   alongside natural food sources. The availability and quality of urban
   greenspaces are important determinants of the suitability of urban
   habitats for red squirrels, as they provide natural food sources and
   nesting sites. Despite the barriers present in urban landscapes (e.g.
   roads), red squirrels can still disperse and maintain gene flow at the
   population level. Road traffic accidents appear to be a significant
   cause of mortality in some urban red squirrel populations, and seasonal
   peaks of mortality occur during the autumn months. Diseases (e.g.
   squirrelpox virus) can also be a significant cause of mortality,
   although effects differ between populations and depend on whether grey
   squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are present. Many of the predation events
   that affect red squirrels appear to be due to free-ranging domestic and
   feral cats Felis catus, although there is currently little evidence to
   suggest that predation is a limiting factor for urban red squirrel
   populations. We conclude that urban areas can be suitable refugia for
   red squirrels, provided that high-quality greenspaces are maintained.
   Mitigation measures may also be necessary to reduce population mortality
   and to prevent disease outbreaks.},

Title = {Redefining the study of sexual dimorphism in bats: following the odour

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is the condition in which males and females of the
   same species are easily distinguished by specific traits (secondary sex
   characteristics), often related to body size, colour patterns, weapons,
   and ornaments. Males of many mammal species tend to be larger or more
   ornamented than females, and these characteristics tend to be more
   pronounced in polygynous, diurnal, and open-habitat species.
   Bats have long been considered a largely non-sexually dimorphic group
   due to lack of conspicuous differences in body size and other cranial
   and skeletal characters. However, bats, like many mammals, exhibit a
   diverse array of soft-tissue integumentary glands and non-glandular
   odour-producing structures with intense odorous substances that have not
   been thoroughly investigated, although postulated functions include
   facilitating mate selection in their generally polygynous associations.
   To date, there has been no systematic assessment of the occurrence or
   expression of sexually dimorphic traits in bats, many of which show
   intriguing sexual dimorphism in soft tissue, and most of which involve
   intense odours. In this study, we review evidence of integumentary
   glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures known in bats, as a
   first step towards identifying future research pathways to study sexual
   dimorphism in bats.
   Highly variable glands and non-glandular odour-producing structures have
   been noticed in ten different regions of the body, but are most
   frequently found on the head and the ventral region of the neck. They
   have been described in nearly 9\% of bat species and in 70\% of 21
   extant bat families.
   Our review, based on extremely scattered and unevenly detailed
   literature, unveils the extraordinary sexual dimorphism that has been
   observed in Chiroptera to date, identifying not only target body parts
   where sexually dimorphic traits are likely to be found, but also
   critical avenues for future investigation and discoveries, and stressing
   the importance of the timing of secondary sexual trait observations,
   behavioural studies, and chemical analyses.},

Title = {Hydrologic and Nutrient Fluxes in a Small Watershed with Changing

Abstract = {Nonpoint-source nutrients contribute to eutrophication of surface
   waters. While effects of particular management actions are difficult to
   identify at the watershed scale, assessing nutrient fluxes over time can
   illuminate the net impact of trends in land use and management. We
   investigated nutrient fluxes in upper Kamm Creek in northwest Washington
   State to determine if historical changes in land management, responding
   to economic and regulatory shifts, had impacted nutrient export. We
   compared current (October 2015 to September 2018) nitrogen and
   phosphorus fluxes in Kamm Creek to data from a previous study (1993 to
   1998). We found significantly higher current fluxes of nitrate, and
   significantly lower current fluxes of orthophosphate (P) and total
   phosphorus (TP), compared to the historical sampling period. The
   increased annual nitrate flux resulted from slightly higher average
   discharge and significantly higher nitrate concentrations throughout the
   year. In contrast, current P and TP concentrations were significantly
   lower throughout the year than previously. The Nooksack River, which
   receives water from the study stream, showed similar patterns for P and
   TP, but not nitrate. Kamm Creek had reduced phosphorus fluxes and
   increased nitrate fluxes between the 1993 to1998 and 2015 to 2018 time
   periods. The watershed experienced several concurrent land-use changes,
   including reductions in hay and corn acreage, increases in berry crop
   acreage, legislation to reduce manure application, and altered use of
   nitrate-enriched groundwater. We cannot currently distinguish among
   these. Further understanding relationships between specific management
   changes and nutrient fluxes will help to maintain local agricultural
   productivity and improve water quality.},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels in the western US are under-studied compared to their
   eastern cousins, and no western species receive federal protection.
   Mussel distribution throughout Oregon's rivers and streams is poorly
   documented, and there are limited historical records to inform
   assessments of whether, and by how much, current populations may have
   declined. We launched a long-term project to characterize freshwater
   mussel populations throughout the Willamette River basin. Surveys were
   conducted in the mainstem Willamette River and a major tributary, the
   Middle Fork Willamette, during three years. A two-stage sampling process
   was used; transects were surveyed qualitatively, and then 0.25 m(2)
   quadrats were placed randomly in transects for quantitative surveys.
   Mussels visible at the substrate surface were counted using viewing
   scopes and snorkeling, and scuba diving in deeper water. To facilitate
   detection of juveniles (< 3.50 cm long) and calculation of the burial
   factor, some quadrats were double sampled; mussels visible at the
   surface were counted, then the substrate was excavated to a depth of 10
   to 20 cm, and all mussels (surface and buried) were counted and their
   shell length measured. Dense western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata)
   populations were found at all locations, but they differed greatly in
   length class structure, density, and presence of juveniles. Some sites
   also contained small numbers of floaters (Anodonta spp.), and notably, a
   single western ridgemussel (Gonidea angulata) was found in a highly
   urbanized reach. These surveys provide baseline data on the current
   status of several freshwater mussel populations in the Willamette River
   basin.},

Title = {Temporal Variability in Climate-Growth Response of Mountain Hemlock at
   Treeline in Washington and Oregon},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {286-301},
Month = {SUM-FAL},
Abstract = {Climate-growth relationships in altitudinal treeline forests are
   particularly informative because they represent the upper limit of a
   species range where growth is often especially sensitive to climatic
   variation. Radial growth response to climatic variables typically ranges
   from energy limited to water limited. In the Pacific Northwest region of
   North America, treeline forests are typically energy limited. Results
   from a recent study (Marcinkowski et al. 2015) indicate a change in
   climate-growth relationships over time in treeline mountain hemlock
   (Tsuga mertensiana) in northern Washington state. Here, we investigate
   whether these same relationships hold across 700 km of the range of
   treeline mountain hemlock in Oregon and Washington. Using cores from
   trees > 200 years old, we examined temporal and spatial variability of
   climate-growth relationships since the early 20th century. Results
   indicate 1) a potential weakening of energy limitation in forest growth
   at treeline, 2) a nonstationary growth response to climate variables
   through time, and 3) different patterns of growth response to climate
   from north to south. Climate-growth relationships were generally similar
   between different aspects in the same geographic location, with some
   exceptions. Correlations between climate variables and radial growth
   differ over time (ranging from significantly positive to significantly
   negative), indicating the non-stationary nature of climate-growth
   relationships. These results identify where changes in growth-limiting
   variables may be occurring at treeline. Additional changes in the
   effects of climate change on growth at treeline are expected, and may be
   temporally complex.},

Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},

Abstract = {We investigated the influences of height, light availability, leaf
   structure, and season on bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh) leaf
   physiology in northern California to improve our understanding of
   productivity and carbon sequestration in western forests. Using hydrated
   cuttings and lab-based measurements, we found that leaf mass-to-area
   ratio and maximum photosynthetic capacity increased with height and
   distance from the bole. In situ, we measured leaf physiology throughout
   tree crowns from June through September and found that predawn water
   potential was remarkably constant, indicating sustained access to water.
   We also found that midday water potential generally decreased with
   height and distance from the bole, noticeably decreased at the end of
   the growing season, and did not fall below -2 MPa, suggesting ample
   access to water and/or stomatal regulation to maintain hydrated water
   status. At midday, light availability and stomatal conductance of water
   vapor generally increased with height and distance from the bole.
   Stomatal conductance peaked in the treetop in June, in the mid-crown in
   July and August, and in the low-crown in September, demonstrating
   temporal and spatial optimization of crown resources in response to
   changing light quality, climatic conditions, and water status across the
   season to maximize carbon uptake at the tree level. Together, our water
   potential and light measurements suggest that light availability is a
   stronger determinant of leaf morphology and physiology than hydraulic
   limitation in this species. These findings provide information on
   seasonal physiology in a widespread deciduous hardwood species, thereby
   strengthening our understanding of forest productivity in a
   predominantly coniferous region.},

Abstract = {A deformed rib from a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) was found
   among more than 100 mammoth bones excavated from an alfalfa field at the
   Tonnemaker Hill Farm in the Frenchman Hills north of Royal City, Grant
   County, Washington. The mammoth remains were deposited within
   -fine-grained Missoula flood sediments sometime after 16 ka. We
   performed a detailed examination of the rib, including computerized
   tomography imaging, and investigated the possible etiology of the
   deformity. The deformity consists of hypertrophic bone formation
   localized toward the distal (sternal) end of the rib. The circumference
   of the lesion is nearly twice that of the medial circumference of the
   rib diaphysis. This lesion is consistent with an incompletely healed
   fracture or a fracture nonunion with pseudarthrosis (false joint)
   formation. Gross examination and computerized tomography scan images of
   the proximal aspect of the rib, as well as cursory inspection of the
   other skeletal remains, have yet to reveal definitive evidence of other
   bony abnormalities. We surmise, therefore, that this fracture was the
   consequence of blunt force trauma in a healthy animal. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of a rib fracture with incomplete healing or
   false joint formation in a M. columbi individual in the Pacific
   Northwest. We suspect the incidence of rib fractures among M. columbi
   was greater than the Pacific Northwest literature suggests and encourage
   examination of existing collections for evidence of similar findings.
   The incidence and frequency of such injuries may provide insight into M.
   columbi behavior.},

Abstract = {Sculpins (family Cottidae) are a group of small nongame fishes, native
   to Idaho's colder streams, and have value for biodiversity and as
   indicators of water quality. We analyzed abiotic and biotic data,
   including habitat characteristics and presence of co-occurring trout and
   char (family Salmonidae) species, from 115 streams from the northern
   Idaho Pan-handle to identify the physical characteristics and biotic
   communities of the streams associated with sculpin presence (or absence)
   and population density. For comparison. and to determine if the results
   of the northern dataset could be attributed to the rest of the state, a
   second dataset from state-wide sampling was also analyzed, as was a
   subset of both datasets that had no observations of non-native brook
   trout and rainbow trout. Sculpins were more likely to be present and in
   higher densities in streams with abundant riffle microhabitats that were
   mostly free of sediment (identified as Rosgen channel types B, C, and F
   for northern Idaho and types B and C for the entire state). More
   sculpins were also found in streams lacking brook trout and rainbow
   trout. Knowledge of sculpin habitats and the impacts of non-native
   salmonids may be useful in interpreting water quality evaluations, as
   well as in improving native fisheries restoration projects and fisheries
   management for Idaho streams.},

Abstract = {The invasive virile crayfish Faxonius virilis (Hagen 1870) has recently
   been documented in the upper Snake River drainage of Idaho, but its
   distribution is poorly known. Our objective was to determine the
   presence and distribution of F. virilis in the Henrys Fork drainage of
   the Snake River. Sampling was conducted during summer and autumn 2018 at
   30 sites located in Henrys Fork River drainage, including the major
   tributaries Teton River, North Fork Teton River, South Fork Teton River,
   and Moody Creek. We used baited minnow traps and kick nets to determine
   presence of F. virilis. Absence was only reported if we unsuccessfully
   captured F. virilis using kick nets because this technique is more
   effective. Faxonius virilis was detected in all five streams. We did not
   detect F. virilis at sites at the upstream extent of sampling. This
   pattern suggests that F. virilis are invading the drainage in an
   upstream direction. Presence of species of conservation concern (e.g.,
   Yellowstone cutthroat trout {[}Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri Jordan and
   Gilbert 1883], bluehead sucker {[}Catostomus discobolus Cope 1871], and
   western pearlshell {[}Margaritifera falcata Gould 1850]) warrant
   additional research to determine the effect of F. virilis on these
   species.},

Title = {Isolation by Distance and Proximity to Urban Areas Affect Genetic

Abstract = {The English sole (Parophrys vetulus, family Pleuronectidae) is an
   abundant ground fish used as a sentinel of marine pollution in the
   inland marine waters of Washington and Oregon. We used 15 microsatellite
   loci to evaluate patterns of genetic variability within and among 17
   collections of sole from coastal sites and within the southern Salish
   Sea. Over 470 alleles were identified in 15 loci, and high levels of
   genetic richness, as estimated by expected heterozygosity (HE) and
   allele richness (AR), were detected. Fish sampled from coastal areas at
   the northern end of our study area had the lowest values of genetic
   richness, in contrast to collections at the southern end. The level of
   differentiation among all collections was low: mean FST value was
   0.0006. Nineteen comparisons had statistically significant FST values
   (mean FST of 0.0029) and involved comparisons involving three locations
   associated with urban areas (Port Gardner {[}Everett, WA], Sinclair
   Inlet {[}Bremerton, WA], and Commencement Bay {[}Tacoma, WA]). A
   statistically significant, but weak, isolation-by-distance pattern was
   seen in the five coastal collections over 1,100 km of coastline. In the
   Salish Sea collections, the pattern of differentiation was patchy and
   marked by several distinctive collections in close proximity to urban
   areas. The pattern of differentiation in the Salish Sea parallels
   differences seen in ecotoxicological characteristics of the English sole
   that inhabit separate urban embayments differing in pollution
   characteristics. Future work can focus on evaluating the stability and
   meaningfulness of this subtle variability in a time of local and global
   environmental changes.},

Title = {Inviable Seed Set Affects Arthropod Damage to Seeds of Western Juniper
   (Juniperus occidentalis)},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Retention and development of fruits containing inviable seeds has been
   considered anomalous, because such seeds cannot contribute to plant
   fitness. Although trees in the genus Juniperus are conifers and thus not
   true fruiting plants, junipers package seeds within fruit-like female
   cones commonly referred to as ``berries,{''} and juniper seeds often
   exhibit high levels of inviability. We tested the prediction that
   inviable seeds in western juniper (J. occidentalis) reduce levels of
   pre-dispersal seed predation by arthropods. From 2009 to 2014 we
   assessed production of berries and seeds in two northeast California
   populations of western juniper and documented presence of four
   arthropods (three seed predators, one fruit predator) as well as
   condition of seeds. The number of inviable seeds per juniper berry was
   directly associated with numbers of the pulp-feeding frugivore in
   berries collected both in fall and spring, suggesting that trees may
   abort seeds within berries experiencing heavy frugivore damage.
   Consistent with the hypothesis that inviable seeds can reduce seed
   predation, numbers of a granivorous mite were inversely related to
   numbers of inviable seeds in fall berry collections. However, the
   pattern switched to a direct relationship between mites and inviable
   seeds in spring-collected berries, perhaps due to the timing of mite
   infestation during berry development. Inviable seeds occurred most
   frequently during a year of mast production of juniper berries, and the
   lowest levels of seed damage by a granivorous chalcid wasp occurred
   during the mast year. The following year saw the greatest levels of seed
   damage by granivorous moths and mites, possible hold-over effects from
   large populations built during the mast year. The production of inviable
   seeds, together with satiating granivores through masting, may represent
   complementary mechanisms for reducing pre-dispersal seed predation.},

Title = {A Small Proportion of Breeders Drive American Bullfrog Invasion of the
   Yellowstone River Floodplain, Montana},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {231-242},

Abstract = {The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a non-native invader
   of aquatic habitats across the northwestern United States. It recently
   invaded the Yellowstone River, Montana, and has spread to over 140 km of
   floodplain habitat. We analyzed seven microsatellites in 528 tadpoles
   sampled across nearly the entire Yellowstone River invasion (about 140
   river km) to characterize invasion genetics, compare our results with
   those of a recent mtDNA study (Kamath et al. 2016), and to inform
   control efforts. Microsatellite variation supports the mtDNA-based
   hypothesis of at least two independent introductions to the floodplain
   from genetically divergent populations in the midwestern United States,
   followed by massive range expansion. One introduction is associated with
   the upstream extent of the invasion near Park City, Montana and the
   other more broadly with downstream populations. All sites were
   characterized by small effective numbers of breeders (N-b; harmonic mean
   = 9.97), and therefore, a small proportion of highly successful adults
   may drive the invasion by producing large families. Microsatellites and
   mtDNA produced discordant estimates of genetic admixture between the
   upstream and downstream invasions, which may reflect small effective
   population size. Although we observed isolation by distance using both
   types of markers, microsatellites appear to reflect population structure
   resulting from secondary contact between the two introductions, as
   opposed to structure resulting from equilibrium between gene flow and
   genetic drift. Most sites showed evidence for genetic bottlenecks, which
   supports the recent history of invasion. Small Nb paired with known high
   localized extinction rates following colonization suggests focused
   removal of post metamorphic life stages at sites less likely to go
   extinct on their own could help limit invasion by bullfrogs.},

Title = {Cellobiase Activity as an Indicator of Fungal Decay in the Wood of
   Woodpecker Nest Cavities in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Woodpeckers require trees and snags with decayed wood in order to
   excavate nest and roost cavities, and interior wood hardness is
   considered an important factor determining where a woodpecker can create
   a cavity. In most ecosystems, saprophytic fungi are responsible for the
   decay and softening of wood, and are thought to be important in
   providing soft wood for woodpecker cavity excavation. We conducted a
   study of cellulose-degrading enzymes in the wood surrounding woodpecker
   nest cavities. We measured wood hardness, percent wood density loss
   (PWDL), and activity of cellobiase (an extracellular fungal cellulase
   that degrades cellulose) within wood surrounding the nest cavities of
   the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), black-backed woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus),
   and hairy woodpecker (D. villosus) in Oregon and Washington. We found
   that mean wood hardness was significantly lower, and cellobiase and PWDL
   were significantly higher, at nest cavities than controls for each
   woodpecker species. Wood hardness was higher and cellobiase lower at
   nests of black-backed woodpecker than northern flicker, but did not
   differ among the other woodpecker species. Our results suggest that
   increased amounts of cellobiase result in softer wood due to the
   increased decay caused by higher fungal enzyme activity and that
   measuring cellobiase can be used to estimate wood decay without directly
   measuring wood hardness. All four woodpecker species selected nest
   substrates with softer wood and higher fungal enzyme activity than
   controls. This supports findings from previous studies of the importance
   of saprophytic fungi for woodpecker cavity excavation.},

Title = {Comparative Population Dynamics, Flight Periods, and Volatile Pheromone
   Attraction of Tragosoma harrisii and Tragosoma soror (Coleoptera:

Abstract = {Pheromone parsimony is widespread within the longhorned beetles
   (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which share a number of highly conserved
   volatile pheromone motifs. This parsimony reflects their life histories,
   ecology, and distribution. We conducted field bioassays testing
   attraction of cerambycids to 12 volatile pheromone lures at sites in
   both northern and southern Idaho over a period of three years. Our
   overall goals were to investigate the role of volatile pheromones in the
   geographic distribution of cerambycid species, interactions within
   cerambycid communities in reproductive isolation, and to identify
   attractive pheromones that can be used to develop lures for monitoring
   cerambycids. This study focused on the genus Tragosoma (subfamily:
   Prioninae). Trapping results suggested a regional split between
   populations of T. harrisii LeConte and T. soror Laplante within Idaho,
   with the more abundant of the two species at our sites being T. harrisii
   in northern Idaho and T. soror in southern Idaho. We found the flight
   periods of T. harrisii and T. soror overlapped, suggesting that flight
   period is not being used by these two species as a mechanism to prevent
   inter-specific cross-attraction among their populations in Idaho. Our
   results increase understanding of the ecology of Tragosoma species, and
   the role of pheromones and flight period phenology in maintaining
   reproductive isolation, and will aid in development of lures for
   monitoring cerambycids.},

Title = {Spatial and land-use determinants of bat species richness, functional

Abstract = {Bats are one of the most species-rich mammal groups in the Tropics. This
   highly radiated group embodies many distinct ecomorphological traits,
   prompting their functional diversity. Furthermore, bat assemblages
   typically have high beta-diversity due to distinctive compositions
   across geographic gradients. We aimed to understand the distribution of
   multifaceted bat diversity metrics (i.e. species richness, functional
   richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, and local contribution to
   beta-diversity) as a function of land-cover variables, environmental
   productivity and complexity, and anthropogenic features in the largest
   Tropical country worldwide: Brazil. We gathered data on bat distribution
   based on empirical published datasets and embodied the assemblages at
   the metacommunity scale, based on 10-km radial clusters. We obtained
   spatial data on land cover, gross primary production, vegetation height,
   and human population density for the same radial clusters. We analysed
   the data via diversity metrics, descriptive statistics, and generalised
   additive models. Our results showed that two main metaregions
   (central-western Amazon and the Atlantic coast) embrace the largest
   richness of bat species. The major positive predictor of bat diversity
   metrics was vegetation height. Bat diversity metrics throughout Brazil
   were also significantly influenced by agriculture (negatively) and urban
   cover (partially positively). We can conclude that bat diversity is more
   predictable from vegetation height and landscape features - especially
   agriculture and urban cover - at the metacommunity scale, whereas
   functional and local contributions to beta-diversity metrics are more
   predictable from spatial autocorrelations, with some biome-induced
   constrained effects. For the conservation of Brazilian bats and the many
   ecosystem services they provide, it is absolutely essential to prevent
   the further collapse of Brazilian biomes that is currently ongoing and
   fuelled by landscape changes, expansion of agribusiness frontiers,
   deforestation, and fires.},

Title = {Denning, metabolic suppression, and the realisation of ecological
   opportunities in Ursidae},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {465-481},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Through realisation of ecological opportunities, populations and species
   can experience relaxed selection pressures, facilitating ecological
   release and leading to rapid speciation and morphological
   diversification. Behavioural plasticity in response to environmental
   change contributes to diversification by exposing individuals to novel
   conditions through their interactions with resources or dispersal to new
   areas. Despite strong theoretical support, demonstrations of this
   evolutionary process are rare.
   The family Ursidae is the product of one or more adaptive radiations
   following the Miocene-Pliocene transition. Denning behaviour associated
   with over-winter seclusion, fasting, and parturition coinciding with
   seasonally decreased food availability appears to be paraphyletic in
   Ursidae phylogenies. However, female bears of all species undergo
   varying degrees of seclusion and fasting during parturition and early
   post-natal care, which is not consistent with periods of seasonally
   decreased food availability. As denning behaviour is tightly linked to
   fitness through energetics and reproduction, these behaviours are
   suspected to be under strong selection. Mechanisms responsible for the
   observed variability among species, populations, and individuals have
   not been explored.
   In this review, we detail the evolutionary history of extinct and extant
   Ursidae regarding expression of denning behaviour and as a function of
   realised ecological opportunities. We compare behaviours across Ursidae
   and contextualise our results within extant species ecology.
   We demonstrate the role of relaxed extrinsic and intrinsic factors in
   the expression of metabolic suppression among Ursidae species, and
   across populations and reproductive groups, through the realisation of
   ecological opportunities. In doing so, we propose a more refined
   consideration of and perspective on this behaviour and provide a
   mechanism for the adaptive radiation in Ursidae.},

Title = {The wild boar Sus scrofa in northern Eurasia: a review of range
   expansion history, current distribution, factors affecting the northern

Abstract = {The wild boar Sus scrofa is one of the most widely distributed large
   mammal species in the world, existing on all continents except
   Antarctica. In the late 20th Century, its geographical range expanded
   naturally and through intentional releases. Despite the environmental,
   social, and economic importance of the wild boar, its current
   distribution in northern Eurasia remains uncertain, and the factors that
   limit and promote expansion in northern ecosystems are unknown. We aimed
   to summarise the history of wild boar range expansion and current
   distribution in the countries of northern Eurasia. We also assess the
   relative importance of climate (both harshness and warming), habitat
   (both current diversity and possible change), predators, releases,
   supplementary feeding, and hunting in limiting or promoting the
   distribution and range expansion of the species. We review hunting
   management and other regulations that may affect further northward
   expansion. Information on wild boar expansion and distribution was
   collated from available scientific publications, official statistics,
   volunteer reports, and expert knowledge. The effects of natural factors
   (climate harshness, habitat variation, predators) and anthropogenic
   factors (climate warming, habitat change, releases, supplementary
   feeding, hunting) on wild boar distribution were assessed using
   estimates (scores) provided by experts from the target regions. The wild
   boar in Europe is distributed up to 64 degrees N. In Asia, the northern
   distributional limit is up to 61 degrees N. The species' northern
   distributional limit is further north in the west than in the east of
   the geographic range. Experts regarded climate harshness, habitat, and
   hunting as the most important factors limiting wild boar distribution.
   Important factors that promote the expansion of the wild boar's range
   include climate warming and supplementary feeding. Our analysis of the
   official approaches to wild boar management suggests that the northern
   Eurasian countries do not have a united approach to the challenge of
   wild boar expansion. Collaboration between managers, policymakers, and
   researchers is needed for monitoring the wild boar distribution and
   range expansion throughout northern Eurasia. This data collection is
   especially important now, as parts of Europe and Asia are facing the
   challenge of African swine fever as well as other human-wildlife
   conflicts related to increasing wild boar populations.},

Title = {Variation in red fox Vulpes vulpes diet in five continents},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-342},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Understanding variation in the diet of widely distributed species can
   help us to predict how they respond to future environmental and
   anthropogenic changes.
   2. We studied the diet of the red fox Vulpes vulpes, one of the world's
   most widely distributed carnivores. We compiled dietary data from 217
   studies at 276 locations in five continents to assess how fox diet
   composition varied according to geographic location, climate,
   anthropogenic impact, and sampling method.
   3. The diet of foxes showed substantial variation throughout the
   species' range, but with a general trend for small mammals and
   invertebrates to be the most frequently occurring dietary items.
   4. The incidence of small and large mammals and birds in fox diets was
   greater away from the equator. The incidence of invertebrates and fruits
   increased with mean elevation, while the occurrence of medium-sized
   mammals and birds decreased.
   5. Fox diet differed according to climatic and anthropogenic variables.
   Diet richness decreased with increasing temperature and precipitation.
   The incidence of small and large mammals decreased with increasing
   temperature. The incidence of birds and invertebrates decreased with
   increasing mean annual precipitation. Higher Human Footprint Index was
   associated with a lower incidence of large mammals and a higher
   incidence of birds and fruit in fox diet.
   6. Sampling method influenced fox diet estimation: estimated percentage
   of small and medium-sized mammals and fruit was lower in studies based
   on stomach contents, while large mammals were more likely to be recorded
   in studies of stomach contents than in studies of scats.
   7. Our study confirms the flexible and opportunistic dietary behaviour
   of foxes at the global scale. This behavioural trait allows them to
   thrive in a range of climatic conditions, and in areas with different
   degrees of human-induced habitat change. This knowledge can help us to
   place the results of local-scale fox diet studies into a broader context
   and to predict how foxes will respond to future environmental changes.},

Abstract = {Bears, Ursidae, are considered omnivores, except for giant pandas
   Ailuropoda melanoleuca and polar bears Ursus maritimus. However,
   omnivory includes a wide range of dietary variation and trophic
   positions, making bear dietary ecology unclear. We inferred bear trophic
   positions from delta N-15 (parts per thousand) values and examined their
   correlation with diets reported in the literature, including frequency
   of human-bear conflicts (livestock predation and crop damage incidents).
   Overall, N-15 signatures were consistent with diet estimates. Bear
   species with higher N-15 signatures differed more from each other,
   including cases of large regional intraspecific variance, than bear
   species with lower N-15 signatures. Bear trophic position and frequency
   of reports of human-bear conflicts were uncorrelated, suggesting that
   livestock predation by bears is an opportunistic behaviour rather than a
   response to food availability dynamics.},

Abstract = {Coastal cutthroat trout {[}Oncorirynchus clarkii clarkii (Richardson,
   1836)] from the marine waters of Puget Sound, WA, was documented as a
   new host for the ectoparasite Argulus pugettensis (Dana, 1852). The
   prevalence of A. pugettensis was 66\% (49 of 74) on cutthroat trout and
   0\% (0 of 55) on coho salmon {[}O. kisutch (Walbaum, 1792)] collected
   during the winter of 2017/2018. Infestations occurred most frequently on
   the dorsal surface, with intensities ranging from 1 to 26 argulids per
   fish (mean intensity 3.94 = 4.93 S.D.). In contrast, the prevalence of
   the common salmon louse {[}Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1837)] was
   72\% for cutthroat trout and 31\% for coho salmon. Relative to other
   native salmonids, little is known regarding the status, ecology and
   threats for coastal cutthroat trout. New information reported here is a
   first step in understanding the relationship between this wild, native
   trout and infestations by parasitic sea lice and should be followed by
   future studies aimed to identify population level consequences.},

Abstract = {Anderson and Ruxton (Mammal Review, 2020) reviewed the evolution of
   powered flight and laryngeal echolocation in bats. They hypothesised
   that powered flight and laryngeal echolocation evolved in separate
   lineages of handwing gliders. We note that fossil, character evolution,
   and developmental evidence contradicts their hypothesis, and we test
   their handwing gliding model, finding it aerodynamically implausible. We
   conclude that the traditional view of bat evolution (that flight and
   laryngeal echolocation evolved in the common ancestor of all bats, with
   the latter being lost in pteropodids) is more plausible than the
   proposed novel hypothesis.},

Title = {The geography of diet variation in Neotropical Carnivora},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-128},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Mammalian carnivores (order Carnivora) perform important regulatory
   functions in terrestrial food webs. Building a comprehensive knowledge
   of the dietary patterns of carnivorans and the factors determining such
   patterns is essential for improving our understanding of the role of
   carnivorans in ecosystem functioning.
   2. In the Neotropics, there are 64 extant species of terrestrial
   Carnivora, but information on their trophic ecology is diffuse. We
   compiled and analysed the available quantitative dietary data for
   Neotropical carnivorans, aiming to detect patterns of intraspecific and
   interspecific dietary variation at a large geographical scale.
   3. The resulting database encompasses information on trophic
   interactions of 37 native carnivoran species from six families across 14
   countries. There are clear geographical biases towards southern Brazil,
   Chile, and Argentina, and a noticeable knowledge gap within the Amazon.
   Also, most studies are focused on canids and felids, especially Puma
   concolor, Panthera onca, Cerdocyon thous, Leopardus pardalis, and
   Chrysocyon brachyurus, whereas for 27 native species, we found no
   quantitative dietary information.
   4. Neotropical carnivorans consume species from at least 651 genera of
   vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. We found clear species-specific
   dietary patterns and marked differences between Neotropical felids and
   canids. Although predators generally exhibit high levels of consistency
   in their diets regarding prey body mass, we detected significant
   intraspecific variation for all species analysed across study sites.
   5. Body mass imposes strong constraints on prey use, but biogeographical
   differences in prey availability and human influence may drive the
   geographical variation we found. Overall, observed patterns show not
   only similarities with resource-use patterns found for carnivorans in
   other continents, such as nestedness driven by body mass, but also
   differences, such as high levels of frugivory and consumption of
   invertebrates by canids. Assessing resource-use patterns is the first
   step towards a better understanding of processes underlying the
   organisation of trophic interactions, and is imperative for addressing
   impacts of defaunation on ecosystems and for informing conservation
   efforts.},

Title = {Cats Felis catus as a threat to bats worldwide: a review of the evidence},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {323-337},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cats Felis catus, in all their forms (domestic, free-roaming/stray and
   feral), have been identified as a major global threat to biodiversity,
   especially birds and small mammals. However, there has been little
   previous consideration of the extent and impact of predation of bats by
   cats, or of whether specific characteristics make certain species of
   bats particularly vulnerable to predation by cats.
   We reviewed the impact of cats on bats, based on a collation of
   scientific literature and the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN) Red List database. Our aim was to produce a synthesis of
   the extent to which cats prey upon and threaten bats. We also collated
   available data on cat diet, which provide information on predation rates
   of bats by cats.
   Few studies (n = 44) have identified bat species preyed upon or
   threatened by cats, with a disproportionate number of studies from
   islands. In these studies, 86 bat species (about 7\% of the global
   extant tally) are reported as preyed upon or threatened by cats, and
   about one quarter of these species are listed as Near Threatened or
   threatened (IUCN categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, or
   Vulnerable). In IUCN Red List assessments, cats are more frequently
   mentioned as a threat to threatened or Near Threatened bat species than
   to non-threatened species (IUCN category Least Concern).
   In studies reporting on the incidence of bats in cat dietary samples
   (scats, stomachs and guts), the frequency of occurrence of bats in
   samples averaged 0.7 +/- 2.1\% (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 102).
   Many studies had sample sizes that were too small to be likely to detect
   bats.
   All forms of cat are reported to kill bats, and such predation has been
   reported in all major terrestrial habitats. We conclude that predation
   by cats is an under-appreciated threat to the world's bat species.},

Title = {Distribution, Relative Abundance, and Length of Sculpins in the Elwha
   River Watershed Following the Removal of Two Hydroelectric Dams},

Abstract = {Dam removal often shows positive effects for many fish species,
   especially migratory species. In contrast, information regarding the
   effects on less migratory species is lacking. The Elwha River,
   Washington had two hydroelectric dams removed from 2011 to 2014, which
   resulted in the loss of two reservoirs. Because of glacial history, the
   Elwha River system has a depauperate freshwater fish fauna, including
   just two sculpin species (coastrange sculpin {[}Cottus aleuticus] and
   prickly sculpin {[}C. asper]). Both species exhibit a similar migratory
   life history strategy, which includes a planktonic larval stage that
   drifts downstream to a nursery area (e.g., lake, large river, or
   estuary), followed by an upriver movement pattern. Due to these
   characteristics, Elwha River dam removal and loss of the reservoirs may
   have had important effects on these two sculpin species. We sampled
   sculpins with longitudinal electrofishing surveys in 2018 and 2019 to
   evaluate their current distribution, relative abundance, and body size.
   These metrics were generally similar to other river systems in the
   Pacific Northwest, with fewer and larger migratory sculpins upstream.
   Additionally, we compared our findings to pre-dam surveys. After dam
   removal, sculpins in upstream reaches were less abundant and had a
   smaller range of sizes. This suggests the population characteristics of
   sculpins in the Elwha River has changed, but it is unclear how indirect
   effects, such as anadromous salmonid (Salmonidae) increases, may
   influence their overall abundance. This study also provides a baseline
   to monitor sculpin population changes in the future.},

Title = {Riverscape View of Fish Assemblages, Habitat, and Stream Temperatures
   During Summer Low Flows in the Chehalis River, Washington},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-172},
Abstract = {The Chehalis River is a coastal river in southwestern Washington State
   where decision makers are considering options to reduce flood damage and
   improve freshwater habitats. This study focused on the mainstem river
   above and below the location of a potential dam, one of the
   flood-reduction options being considered. Our objectives were to
   describe spatial patterns of fish species, physical habitat, and stream
   temperature, and identify associations between fish species and the
   physical environment at two spatial scales. Data were collected in
   spatially continuous reaches following a ``riverscape{''} approach, and
   patterns in the data were described using three different ordination
   techniques. Most of the variation in fish species composition occurred
   at the sub-basin scale (entire study area), with additional but minor
   patterns at the reach (1-km) scale. At the sub-basin scale, fish species
   composition was organized in an upstream (salmonid) to downstream
   (cyprinid) replacement pattern and was best explained by the combination
   of river location, habitat, and temperature. At the reach scale,
   physical habitat and stream temperature differentiated juvenile trout
   versus coho salmon in the salmonid-dominated upstream extent of our
   study area, and dace versus shiner in the cyprinid-dominated downstream
   extent. We conclude that salmon and steelhead are particularly
   vulnerable to habitat loss upstream of the proposed dam because they
   disproportionately use this area as summer rearing habitat. Protection
   and restoration of headwater areas, such as our study area in the
   Chehalis River, will be critical to support salmonid populations into
   the future.},

Title = {Ecoregion-Rather Than Sympatric Legumes-influences Symbiotic
   Bradyrhizobium Associations in Invasive Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius)
   in the Pacific Northwest},
Journal = {NORTHWEST SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Plant-microbe mutualisms can determine the success of invasive plants.
   Legumes (Fabaceae) are particularly successful invaders in a variety of
   habitats. This is partly due to their ability to access atmospheric
   nitrogen through microbial mutualists (rhizobia) in their root systems,
   which allow them to colonize a wide variety of disturbed or
   nutrient-poor habitats. While many plant-rhizobia mutualisms are highly
   species-specific, plant promiscuity with different species of rhizobia
   can significantly enhance the success of invasive legumes, since the
   availability of suitable rhizobial mutualists in a new geographic area
   may serve as a limiting factor. Scotch broom (Fabaceae:
   Cytisusscoparius) is one of the most problematic invasive legumes in the
   Pacific Northwest (PNW), yet very little is known about the Scotch
   broom-rhizobia system. We explored the rhizobial communities of root
   nodules of Scotch broom and sympatrically occurring legumes across three
   major ecoregions (coast, valley, and mountain) in the western PNW
   (Washington, Oregon, and California) to better understand the Scotch
   broom-rhizobia system in nature. We found that bradyrhizobia are the
   exclusive rhizobial mutualists of Scotch broom but that there is
   promiscuity at the species level. While there was very little overlap
   with rhizobial communities of sympatric native and naturalized legumes,
   ecoregion did influence the species composition of Scotch
   broom-associated rhizobial communities. Our findings suggest that Scotch
   broom is not reliant on sympatric legumes to provide a source of
   suitable rhizobial mutualists. but instead forms spatially variable
   associations with a range of other bradyrhizobia.},

Title = {Ecosystem roles and conservation status of bioturbator mammals},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-207},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The action of biological reworking of soils is referred to as
   bioturbation, and many species of mammals globally have an important
   role in soil disturbance, modifying ecosystem characteristics. We
   examined global patterns in the distribution, conservation status, and
   threats to the world's bioturbator mammals and illustrated the relevant
   roles these species play in ecosystem engineering related to soil
   processes and services. We searched the data available on 3932
   non-flying land-dwelling mammals included in the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. Using existing literature and
   online databases, we determined that 869 (22\%) of the non-flying
   land-dwelling mammals accessed can be considered as bioturbators in
   three distinct groups: foragers (n = 123), semi-fossorial species (n =
   652), and strictly fossorial species (n = 94). Of the world's
   bioturbator mammal species, 16\% are threatened, 2\% are already
   Extinct, and 8\% are classified as Data Deficient. Foragers have the
   highest percentage of threatened (35\%) and Extinct (5\%) species, while
   strictly fossorial species have the highest percentage of Data Deficient
   species (12\%). Although the majority of bioturbator mammal species are
   found in Asia (32\%), Oceania is the continent with the highest
   percentage of threatened (27\%) and Extinct (11\%) bioturbator species,
   while Central and South America have the highest percentage of species
   classified as Data Deficient (24\%). The threats experienced by the
   greatest number of bioturbator mammal species are activities related to
   agriculture and aquaculture (29\%), and biological resource use (22\%).
   Soil bioturbation can improve ecosystem health by reducing soil
   compaction, increasing nutrient cycling, soil moisture, microbe
   diversity, plant recruitment, and carbon storage. The loss of
   bioturbator mammals could trigger cascading effects throughout the
   ecosystems they inhabit. A better understanding of their conservation
   status is important so that effective conservation measures can be
   developed.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Environmental change and anthropogenic pressure are primary drivers of
   biodiversity loss, particularly in wetland ecosystems that have been
   modified significantly. Among wetland specialists, mammals may be
   particularly vulnerable to extinction. We aimed to increase
   understanding of threats and knowledge gaps faced by 11 mammal species
   inhabiting wetlands throughout India.
   We adopted a systematic literature search protocol following an
   evidence-based conservation approach to obtain information on
   conservation threats and identify knowledge gaps for each species. Each
   species received threat scores based on the occurrence and magnitude of
   ecological and anthropogenic threats, a score based on its International
   Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List category, and a
   knowledge gap score. A cumulative conservation threat score based on the
   four individual scores was calculated for each species to assess overall
   conservation threats.
   Only about 10\% of the literature search results were relevant. Of the
   major research categories, ecology was the most well-studied, whereas
   the impact of anthropogenic pressure on wetland mammals was the least
   studied. Pressing ecological and anthropogenic threats, scientific
   knowledge gaps, and conservation needs contributed to a high cumulative
   threat score for the sangai Rucervus eldii eldii (cumulative threat
   score = 34), followed by the wild Asian buffalo Bubalus arnee (threat
   score = 33) and the Bengal marsh mongoose Herpestes palustris (threat
   score = 32). Poaching/hunting, habitat loss due to development, and
   changes in land-use practices were found to be the major anthropogenic
   threats resulting in decreasing population trends. We identified
   knowledge gaps concerning the ecology of wetland mammals (e.g.
   population abundance). It is essential that these knowledge gaps are
   filled for effective conservation planning.
   We identified important areas (population ecology, disease ecology,
   human-wildlife conflict, changes in land use) that should be considered
   as research priorities for wetland mammals in India, in order to make
   conservation efforts more effective and enable management planning, to
   ensure the long-term survival of these mammals.},

   using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Nine ecdysteroids
   were detected. The spectrum of these ecdysteroids was similar in bat
   species which take their preferred food items from the same insect
   order. The spectrum of blood-borne ecdysteroids was broader in the
   autumn than in the summer, and higher concentrations of
   20-hydroxyecdysone (the most common ecdysteroid) occurred in samples
   from large bat species than from small ones. Ecdysteroids may have
   anabolic effects on insectivorous bats and may also affect their
   blood-feeding arthropod parasites.},

Abstract = {We investigated fish species richness, community composition, density,
   and diversity along a spatial gradient of tidal influence in the shallow
   wetlands of the Columbia River. Our findings revealed distinct seasonal
   and spatial patterns in fish community composition, proportions of
   native and non-native fish species, and occurrence of fish that are
   potential juvenile salmon competitors and predators. We observed
   increased species richness and diversity with increased distance from
   the mouth of the Columbia River. Proportions of non-native species
   increased as well, and were especially high near the urban areas of the
   lower Columbia River. Species richness, density, and proportion of
   non-native species were higher during the summer months and positively
   correlated with water temperature. Juvenile salmonid density was highest
   in the spring, and salmonids were largely absent in the summer when
   non-native fish species were most abundant. Future increases in
   temperature, as expected with climate change, will favor further
   expansion of warm-water species, likely changing food web dynamics and
   having unpredictable effects on salmonids and other native fish
   populations.},

Title = {Sex-specific evolution of a Drosophila sensory system via interacting
   cis- and trans-regulatory changes},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {37-60},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The evolution of gene expression via cis-regulatory changes is well
   established as a major driver of phenotypic evolution. However,
   relatively little is known about the influence of enhancer architecture
   and intergenic interactions on regulatory evolution. We address this
   question by examining chemosensory system evolution in Drosophila.
   Drosophila prolongata males show a massively increased number of
   chemosensory bristles compared to females and males of sibling species.
   This increase is driven by sex-specific transformation of ancestrally
   mechanosensory organs. Consistent with this phenotype, the Pox neuro
   transcription factor (Poxn), which specifies chemosensory bristle
   identity, shows expanded expression in D. prolongata males. Poxn
   expression is controlled by nonadditive interactions among widely
   dispersed enhancers. Although some D. prolongata Poxn enhancers show
   increased activity, the additive component of this increase is slight,
   suggesting that most changes in Poxn expression are due to epistatic
   interactions between Poxn enhancers and trans-regulatory factors.
   Indeed, the expansion of D. prolongata Poxn enhancer activity is only
   observed in cells that express doublesex (dsx), the gene that controls
   sexual differentiation in Drosophila and also shows increased expression
   in D. prolongata males due to cis-regulatory changes. Although expanded
   dsx expression may contribute to increased activity of D. prolongata
   Poxn enhancers, this interaction is not sufficient to explain the full
   expansion of Poxn expression, suggesting that cis-trans interactions
   between Poxn, dsx, and additional unknown genes are necessary to produce
   the derived D. prolongata phenotype. Overall, our results demonstrate
   the importance of epistatic gene interactions for evolution,
   particularly when pivotal genes have complex regulatory architecture.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of mammalian carnivore translocations},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {554-572},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Carnivore conservation translocations are assumed to provide numerous
   ecological benefits, including conservation of the translocated
   carnivores, regulation of prey species and restoration of ecosystems.
   Reviews of mammalian carnivore conservation translocations and resultant
   ecosystem effects have focussed on large carnivores. We reviewed global
   terrestrial carnivore conservation translocations across all taxa,
   including taxonomic bias, problems influencing their population
   establishment and their ecosystem effects. We obtained data from 536
   conservation translocations of 54 species of terrestrial mammalian
   carnivore (order Carnivora and family Dasyuridae, 30 g-196 kg),
   comprising mostly Mustelidae, Canidae, and Felidae species. A third of
   all projects translocated carnivores into South Africa and a third into
   fenced reserves. Significant bias occurred relative to threat status,
   with over-representation of Mustelidae and Canidae conservation
   translocations relative to the number of threatened species in each
   family. Additionally, conservation translocations of small carnivores
   were generally under-represented compared to those of large carnivores.
   Seventeen percent of small carnivore conservation translocations failed,
   compared with 25\% of large carnivore conservation translocations;
   failure was primarily due to reported anthropogenic mortality. Effects
   on resident prey species or ecosystems of carnivore conservation
   translocations were rarely investigated. We found no significant
   relationship between the carnivore family or size and effects on prey or
   ecosystems; however, prey impacts were frequently attributed to Felidae,
   and ecosystem effects were frequently attributed to Canidae and Felidae.
   Challenges to translocations of mammalian carnivores include threats to
   resident threatened prey species and difficulties in monitoring the
   ecological effects of carnivore conservation translocations. Poor
   postrelease monitoring and a lack of empirical studies remain persistent
   problems, contributing to the poor understanding of ecosystem effects
   following carnivore conservation translocations.},

Title = {What can whiskers tell us about mammalian evolution, behaviour, and
   ecology?},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-163},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Most mammals have whiskers; however, nearly everything we know about
   whiskers derives from just a handful of species, including laboratory
   rats Rattus norvegicus and mice Mus musculus, as well as some species of
   pinniped and marsupial.
   We explore the extent to which the knowledge of the whisker system from
   a handful of species applies to mammals generally. This will help us
   understand whisker evolution and function, in order to gain more
   insights into mammalian behaviour and ecology.
   This review is structured around Tinbergen's four questions, since this
   method is an established, comprehensive, and logical approach to
   studying behaviour. We ask: how do whiskers work, develop, and evolve?
   And what are they for?
   While whiskers are all slender, curved, tapered, keratinised hairs that
   transmit vibrotactile information, we show that there are marked
   differences between species with respect to whisker arrangement,
   numbers, length, musculature, development, and growth cycles.
   The conservation of form and a common muscle architecture in mammals
   suggests that early mammals had whiskers. Whiskers may have been
   functional even in therapsids.
   However, certain extant mammalian species are equipped with especially
   long and sensitive whiskers, in particular nocturnal, arboreal species,
   and aquatic species, which live in complex environments and hunt moving
   prey.
   Knowledge of whiskers and whisker use can guide us in developing
   conservation protocols and designing enriched enclosures for captive
   mammals.
   We suggest that further comparative studies, embracing a wider variety
   of mammalian species, are required before one can make large-scale
   predictions relating to evolution and function of whiskers. More
   research is needed to develop robust techniques to enhance the welfare
   and conservation of mammals.},

Title = {Spatial mapping memory: methods used to determine the existence and type
   of cognitive maps in arboreal mammalsMots cles},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Researchers have used multiple methods to understand spatial mapping
   memory used by arboreal mammals for orientation: the change-point test,
   measures of path tortuosity, field experiments with feeding platforms,
   nearest-neighbour feeding tree methods, complex calculations of travel
   route parameters, and theoretical models. This literature review
   provides details of all of these methods, highlights previous results
   from spatial mapping memory studies, and discusses perspectives for
   future studies. Previous studies have shown that various arboreal
   mammals, mostly in the order Primates, can memorise spatial environments
   using a cognitive map. Two types of maps are characterised: the
   topological map, based on landmarks and reused routes, and the Euclidean
   map, including the ability to create shortcuts by measuring distances
   and distinguishing between directions. Most of the studies showed that
   mammals do not travel randomly but, due to the difficulty of determining
   which spatial map is used, the use of cognitive maps remains
   hypothetical. When studying spatial mapping memory, data collection and
   analysis should account for the species' characteristics, such as the
   home-range size, food preferences, and types of movements. The role of
   sensory cues (visual, auditory, olfactory) is crucial to understanding
   spatial orientation. The most relevant way to determine how arboreal
   mammals orientate themselves in space is by using a mix of methods:
   random theoretical models, collecting data in a controlled environment,
   measuring different parameters of travel patterns, and considering the
   use of sensory cues and environmental factors of the study sites.
   Research pertaining to spatial mapping memory in arboreal mammals and
   forest-dwelling mammals is important for understanding cognitive
   abilities in mammal species, and more studies are needed in mammals of
   various orders.},

Abstract = {Some bat species in the families Phyllostomidae, Megadermatidae, and
   Nycteridae have long been known to consume terrestrial vertebrates and,
   more recently, reports of aerial-hawking vespertilionid carnivores have
   surfaced. We review the diets, hunting behaviour and roosting ecology of
   17 bat species that are known to consume terrestrial vertebrates:
   Vampyrum spectrum, Chrotopterus auritus, Trachops cirrhosus, Macroderma
   gigas, Megaderma (Lyroderma) lyra, Nycteris grandis, Nyctalus
   lasiopterus, Nyctalus aviator, Ia io, Antrozous pallidus, Cardioderma
   cor, Phyllostomus hastatus, Mimon (Gardnerycteris) crenulatum, Mimon
   cozumelae, Tonatia saurophila, Tonatia bidens, and Lophostoma
   silvicolum. Data on their diet and roosts were obtained from 241
   original works, with considerable differences in the amount of research
   and information available among species. Carnivorous bats were found to
   belong to an ecologically diverse group and share little but their diet.
   Therefore, we define a carnivorous bat as a bat that, either year-round
   or seasonally, uses terrestrial vertebrates as the main component of its
   diet, at least in part of its geographic range. We conclude from
   available data that Mimon crenulatum, Lophostoma silvicolum, Mimon
   cozumelae, Phyllostomus hastatus, Tonatia bidens, Tonatia saurophila,
   Cardioderma cor, and Antrozous pallidus use vertebrates as a minor part
   of their diet and should not be considered carnivorous. The nine other
   species we reviewed do fit into the definition of carnivorous bats, and
   can be further subdivided based on their ecology and the seasonality of
   their habits into three categories: year-round predominantly gleaning
   carnivores (Chrotopterus auritus, Trachops cirrhosus, and Vampyrum
   spectrum), seasonal predominantly gleaning carnivores (Megaderma lyra,
   Macroderma gigas, and Nycteris grandis) and seasonal aerial-hawking
   bird-eating carnivores (Ia io, Nyctalus aviator, and Nyctalus
   lasiopterus).},

Title = {Unravelling the historical biogeography of the European rabbit

Abstract = {Understanding the biogeography of species in space and time is essential
   for the development of evidence-based conservation and management plans.
   In this paper we propose a biogeographical spatial modelling approach
   based on the favourability function, and developed under a fuzzy logic
   framework, to unravel the historical biogeography of the two European
   wild rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus (Oca) and
   Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus (Occ), in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We
   first reviewed published and unpublished information (PhD theses,
   scientific papers, technical reports, etc.) on the occurrence of each
   rabbit subspecies throughout the IP. We compiled data from 201 Iberian
   rabbit populations and from genetic information of 4348 rabbits that was
   used to identify subspecies. Only populations in which all rabbits
   surveyed belonged to one subspecies were considered in the modelling
   procedure. We modelled rabbit subspecies' distribution separately for
   populations in which nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences were
   available. We employed a trend surface analysis developed by logistic
   regressions, which applied the favourability function and fuzzy logic
   operations. Using our approach we indentify the expansion cores from
   which both rabbit subspecies would have expanded after isolation during
   the last glaciations. Furthermore, we reveal the possible existence of a
   competitive exclusion zone between both rabbit subspecies that may have
   prevented their further expansion. Finally, our study shows that the Oca
   subspecies is distributed in north-western areas previously attributed
   to Occ. This assessment of the actual and historical distribution of
   each rabbit subspecies may allow more specific conservation
   interventions, as the two subspecies are not just genetically distinct
   but also ecologically and behaviourally different. Our methodological
   approach could be useful in unravelling the historical biogeography of
   other lesser-known species.},

Title = {An assessment of current wolf Canis lupus domestication hypotheses based
   on wolf ecology and behaviour},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {304-314},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The dog was the first domesticated animal. Its derivation from grey
   wolves Canis lupus is important to the study of mammalian domestication,
   and wolf domestication is an active area of investigation. Recent
   popular books have promoted a hypothesis that wolves domesticated
   themselves as opposed to the earliest hypothesis that featured pup
   collection, adoption, and artificial selection. Continuing research has
   produced a greater understanding of wolf ecology and behaviour,
   including new insights into the wolf's interaction with humans. Several
   characteristics make the wolf conducive to domestication: its sociality,
   catholic diet, excellent individual and cultural memory, inbreeding
   tolerance, varied personalities, and adaptable lifestyle. The wolf's
   fear of humans is the main impediment and that alone is a factor
   strongly disfavouring the self-selection hypothesis. However, collecting
   young pups from dens and raising them would foster their socialising
   with humans as pack members. Neither hypothesis explains how wolves
   undergoing domestication were separated reproductively from their wild
   relatives, an important condition for domestication. We combine
   information from the literature with information from our own research
   on wild wolves, archaeology, and canid morphology. We explain how pup
   collection and deliberate or incidental selection and encouragement to
   breed with similarly raised wolves could keep incipient dogs separated
   reproductively from wild relatives. The key is humans regularly feeding
   the wolves and keeping only those able to live harmoniously with humans.
   Well-fed, human-dependent wolves would remain near their food supply and
   in the company of humans, thus increasing their bonds to humans and vice
   versa. Outbreeding with wild wolves would thus be avoided. Generation
   after generation of these human-fed, raised, and selected wolves would
   become increasingly dependent on humans and shaped by them. The
   pup-adoption hypothesis presented here is more in keeping with basic
   wolf ecology and behaviour than the self-domestication hypothesis.},

Title = {Trends in cetacean research in the Eastern North Atlantic},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {436-453},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cetaceans are considered ecosystem engineers and useful bioindicators of
   the health of marine environments. The Eastern North Atlantic is an area
   of great geographical and oceanographic complexity that favours
   ecosystem richness and, consequently, cetacean occurrence. Although this
   occurrence has led to relevant scientific research on this taxon,
   information on the composition of this research has not been assessed.
   We aimed to describe and quantify the evolution of research on cetaceans
   in the Eastern North Atlantic, highlighting the main focal areas and
   trends.
   We considered 380 peer-reviewed publications between 1900 and 2018. For
   each paper, we collected publication year, research topics and regions,
   and species studied. We assessed differences among regions with distinct
   socio-economic landscapes, and between coastal and oceanic habitats. To
   evaluate the changes in scientific production over time, we fitted a
   General Additive Model to the time series of numbers of papers.
   Although research in this region has been increasing, the results show
   relatively little research output in North African and coastal regions
   within the study area. Moreover, except for four studies, research was
   restricted to a few miles around the coast of the main islands, leaving
   offshore regions less well surveyed. There was little research on
   genetics, acoustics, and behaviour. Most papers were focused on the
   Azores and Canary Islands, and mostly involved Tursiops truncatus,
   Delphinus delphis, and Physeter macrocephalus. Species considered
   Endangered or Near Threatened were the subjects of only 10\% of the
   studies.
   We suggest a greater research focus on beaked whales (Ziphiidae) in
   Macaronesia, as well as collaborative efforts between research teams in
   the region, by sharing data sets, and aiming to produce long-term
   research. Moreover, a Delphi method approach, based on questionnaires
   answered by experts, could be attempted to identify priority research
   for cetaceans in these areas.},

Title = {Diet composition of the golden jackal Canis aureus in south-east Europe
   - a review},

Abstract = {The golden jackal Canis aureus is spreading throughout Europe and
   settling in countries where it has never been found before.
   Understanding its trophic ecology is increasingly important as it
   colonises new areas and ecosystems.
   This paper aims to review the diet studies that have been performed on
   the golden jackal in Europe and provide a complete overview of its food
   intake, feeding behaviour and strategy.
   Golden jackals were found to eat mainly small mammals (54\% biomass),
   followed by domestic animals, ungulates and plants; together, these
   items make up 90\% of the golden jackal's diet. Birds and lagomorphs
   were also often found in the diet. Domestic animals and ungulates were
   primarily consumed as carcasses, and not hunted or killed by golden
   jackals.
   The diet composition differs greatly between areas and seasons, which
   points towards the golden jackal as a highly adaptive opportunistic
   omnivore, and demonstrates its ability to use many available food
   resources. The golden jackal provides regulating and maintenance
   ecosystem services as a scavenger and consumer of crop pests.},

Title = {Directional asymmetry and direction-giving factors: Lessons from flowers

Abstract = {Directional asymmetry is a systematic difference between the left and
   right sides for structures with bilateral symmetry or a systematic
   differentiation among repeated parts for complex symmetry. This study
   explores factors that produce directional asymmetry in the flower of
   Iris pumila, a structure with complex symmetry that makes it possible to
   investigate multiple such factors simultaneously. The shapes and sizes
   of three types of floral organs, the falls, standards, and style
   branches, were quantified using the methods of geometric morphometrics.
   For each flower, this study recorded the compass orientations of floral
   organs as well as their anatomical orientations relative to the two
   spathes subtending each flower. To characterize directional asymmetry at
   the whole-flower level, differences in the average sizes and shapes
   according to compass orientation and relative orientation were computed,
   and the left-right asymmetry was also evaluated for each individual
   organ. No size or shape differences within flowers were found in
   relation to anatomical position; this may relate to the terminal
   position of flowers in Iris pumila, suggesting that there may be no
   adaxial-abaxial polarity, which is very prominent in many other taxa.
   There was clear directional asymmetry of shape in relation to compass
   orientation, presumably driven by a consistent environmental gradient
   such as solar irradiance. There was also clear directional asymmetry
   between left and right halves of every floral organ, most likely related
   to the arrangement of organs in the bud. These findings indicate that
   different factors are acting to produce directional asymmetry at
   different levels. In conventional analyses not recording flower
   orientations, these effects would be impossible to disentangle from each
   other and would probably be included as part of fluctuating asymmetry.},

Title = {What does modularity mean?},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {377-403},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modularity is now generally recognized as a fundamental feature of
   organisms, one that may have profound consequences for evolution.
   Modularity has recently become a major focus of research in organismal
   biology across multiple disciplines including genetics, developmental
   biology, functional morphology, population and evolutionary biology.
   While the wealth of new data, and also new theory, has provided exciting
   and novel insights, the concept of modularity has become increasingly
   ambiguous. That ambiguity is underlain by diverse intuitions about what
   modularity means, and the ambiguity is not merely about the meaning of
   the word-the metrics of modularity are measuring different properties
   and the methods for delimiting modules delimit them by different,
   sometimes conflicting criteria. The many definitions, metrics and
   methods can lead to substantial confusion not just about what modularity
   means as a word but also about what it means for evolution. Here we
   review various concepts, using graphical depictions of modules. We then
   review some of the metrics and methods for analyzing modularity at
   different levels. To place these in theoretical context, we briefly
   review theories about the origins and evolutionary consequences of
   modularity. Finally, we show how mismatches between concepts, metrics
   and methods can produce theoretical confusion, and how potentially
   illogical interpretations can be made sensible by a better match between
   definitions, metrics, and methods.},

Title = {All type II classic MADS-box genes in the lycophyte Selaginella
   moellendorffii are broadly yet discretely expressed in vegetative and

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {The MADS-box genes constitute a large transcription factor family that
   appear to have evolved by duplication and diversification of function.
   Two types of MADS-box genes are distinguished throughout eukaryotes,
   types I and II. Type II classic MADS-box genes, also known as MIKC-type,
   are key developmental regulators in flowering plants and are
   particularly well-studied for their role in floral organ specification.
   However, very little is known about the role that these genes might play
   outside of the flowering plants. We investigated the evolution of type
   II classic MADS-box genes across land plants by performing a maximum
   likelihood analysis with a particular focus on lycophytes. Here, we
   present the expression patterns of all three type II classic MADS-box
   homologs throughout plant development in the lycophyte Selaginella
   moellendorffii: SmMADS1, SmMADS3, and SmMADS6. We used scanning electron
   microscopy and histological analyses to define stages of sporangia
   development in S. moellendorffii. We performed phylogenetic analyses of
   this gene lineage across land plants and found that lycophyte sequences
   appeared before the multiple duplication events that gave rise to the
   major MADS-box gene lineages in seed plants. Our expression analyses by
   in situ hybridization show that all type II classic MADS-box genes in S.
   moellendorffii have broad but distinct patterns of expression in
   vegetative and reproductive tissues, where SmMADS1 and SmMADS6 only
   differ during late sporangia development. The broad expression during S.
   moellendorffii development suggests that MADS-box genes have undergone
   neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization after duplication events
   in seed plants.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {256-266},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Established model systems in the flowering plants have greatly advanced
   our understanding of plant developmental biology, facilitating in turn
   its investigation across diverse land plants. The reliance on a limited
   number of model organisms, however, constitutes a barrier for future
   progress in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). In
   particular, a more thorough understanding of seed plant character
   evolution and of its genetic and developmental basis has been hampered
   in part by a lack of gymnosperm model systems, since most are trees with
   decades-long generation times. Guided by the premise that future model
   organisms should be selected based on their character diversity, rather
   than simply phylogenetic ``position,{''} we highlight biological
   questions of potential interest that can be addressed via comparative
   studies in Ephedra (Gnetales). In addition to having relatively small
   genomes and shorter generation times in comparison to most other
   gymnosperms, Ephedra are amenable to investigations on the evolution of
   the key reproductive seed plant innovations of pollination and seed
   dispersal, as well as on polyploidy, and adaptation to extreme
   environments.},

Title = {Testing the niche variation hypothesis in pinnipedsPalabras clave},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {497-506},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Individual trophic specialisation (ITS) has many important consequences
   for ecological and evolutionary processes. An old hypothesis
   highlighting the relevance of ITS is the niche variation hypothesis
   (NVH), which proposes that populations composed of trophically
   specialised individuals have a wider population niche than populations
   composed of more generalist individuals. Pinnipeds are a good model to
   test the NVH because they are mostly generalist species, living in dense
   colonies, and exhibiting variation in trophic niche width among
   populations. We tested the NVH in pinnipeds using longitudinal isotopic
   data: published delta C-13 and delta N-15 data obtained from sequential
   sections of whiskers (vibrissae) from individuals belonging to 14
   populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   evaluating the NVH by using longitudinal isotopic data. We compiled
   studies that published raw data on delta C-13 and delta N-15 for
   pinniped whisker segments to estimate the within-individual and the
   between-individuals components of variance, the total niche width (TNW),
   and ITS. One-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 or delta N-15) and
   multi-dimensional (i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses were used.
   Also, we tested whether an evolutionary component would affect the
   degree of ITS among pinniped species with different levels of shared
   ancestry. Our results indicate that, in line with the NVH, pinniped
   populations composed of more specialised individuals tend to show wider
   trophic niches. When analysing each sex separately, the hypothesis is
   supported for females but not for males. We believe that physiological
   and behavioural differences between sexes may explain this result. In
   females, high TNW is mainly related to greater differentiation among
   individuals, while in males, it is mainly related to high diversity of
   resources consumed by all individuals.},

Title = {A review of the social behaviour of the giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis:
   a misunderstood but socially complex species},

Abstract = {Until around 2000, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis were believed to have
   no social structure. Despite a resurgence of interest in giraffe
   behaviour in around 2010, most studies are of isolated populations,
   making it difficult to draw general conclusions. Although it is now well
   established that giraffe social organisation is non-random, there is
   little consensus as to what influences preferred and avoided
   associations or the underpinning mechanisms. We test two hypotheses:
   first, giraffe have a complex cooperative social system, exhibited by 1)
   stable groups of females, 2) offspring that stay in their natal group
   for part or all of their lives, 3) support by non-mothers in rearing
   young, and 4) non-reproductive females in the group; and second, giraffe
   form matrilineal societies, evidenced by 1) male dispersal, 2) female
   philopatry, 3) assistance in raising or protecting offspring, and 4)
   individual benefits gained from social foraging. We reviewed 404 papers
   on giraffe behaviour and social organisation; captive studies were
   included where they supplemented information from free-living
   populations. We show that giraffe exhibit many of the features typical
   of mammals with complex cooperative social systems and matrilineal
   societies. However, the social complexity hypothesis posits that such
   species also require complex communication systems to regulate
   interactions and relations among group members; giraffe communication
   systems are poorly understood. Quantifying the fitness and survival
   benefits of the giraffe's social organisation is necessary to ensure its
   long-term survival. Giraffe numbers have declined by 40\% since 1985,
   they have been declared extinct in seven (possibly nine) countries and
   are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature. We identify research areas that will advance our understanding
   of giraffe behaviour and conservation requirements.},

Title = {Heterothermy, body size, and locomotion as ecological predictors of
   migration in mammals},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Migration is ubiquitous among animals and has evolved repeatedly and
   independently. Comparative studies of the evolutionary origins of
   migration in birds are widespread, but are lacking in mammals. Mammalian
   species have greater variation in functional traits that may be relevant
   for migration. Interspecific variation in migration behaviour is often
   attributed to mode of locomotion (i.e. running, swimming, and flying)
   and body size, but traits associated with the evolutionary precursor
   hypothesis, including geographic distribution, habitat, and diet, could
   also be important predictors of migration in mammals. Furthermore,
   mammals vary in thermoregulatory strategies and include many
   heterothermic species, providing an alternative strategy to avoid
   seasonal resource depletion. We tested the evolutionary precursor
   hypothesis for the evolution of migration in mammals and tested
   predictions linking migration to locomotion, body size, geographic
   distribution, habitat, diet, and thermoregulation. We compiled a dataset
   of 722 species from 27 mammalian orders and conducted a series of
   analyses using phylogenetically informed models. Swimming and flying
   mammals were more likely to migrate than running mammals, and larger
   species were more likely to migrate than smaller ones. However,
   heterothermy was common among small running mammals that were unlikely
   to migrate. High-latitude swimming and flying mammals were more likely
   to migrate than high-latitude running mammals (where heterothermy was
   common), and most migratory running mammals were herbivorous. Running
   mammals and frugivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope (greater
   capacity for heterothermy) were less likely to migrate, while
   insectivorous bats with high thermoregulatory scope were more likely to
   migrate. Our results indicate a broad range of factors that influence
   migration, depending on locomotion, body size, and thermoregulation. Our
   analysis of migration in mammals provided insight into some of the
   general rules of migration, and we highlight opportunities for future
   investigations of exceptions to these rules, ultimately leading to a
   comprehensive understanding of the evolution of migration.},

Title = {Competitive overlap between martens Martes americana and Martes caurina
   and fishers Pekania pennanti: a rangewide perspective and synthesis},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Competition is a major determinant of where species occur and how
   species interact. Among carnivorans, interspecific competition is
   particularly apparent, as many of these species have evolved to be
   efficient killers. Theoretically, phylogenetically related carnivorans
   that occupy seasonal habitats, share common resources, and differ in
   body size by a factor of 2.5-10x should exhibit the most interference
   competition. Fishers Pekania pennanti and martens Martes americana and
   Martes caurina are members of the subfamily Guloninae (Mustelidae,
   Carnivora) that occupy forests throughout northern North America. These
   taxa occur sympatrically throughout much of their range, utilise similar
   habitats, and consume similar prey; fishers and martens also differ in
   body size by a factor 2-5x. Consequently, these two taxa appear to be
   locked in particularly strong interspecific competition and should
   attempt to limit competitive overlap. We review the current knowledge of
   this dyadic interaction in the framework of ecological niches and niche
   partitioning. In particular, we explore the three critical niche axes of
   diet, space, and time. We found that, in contrast to the traditional
   view of them being highly specialised, both martens and fishers are
   dietary generalists; however, they also appear to be specialists in
   complexity, at least in space and habitats. Collectively, martens and
   fishers exhibit high degrees of diet and habitat niche overlap across
   their ranges, and this overlap is likely to have the greatest fitness
   consequences for the smaller and subordinate martens. Nevertheless,
   fine-scale habitat and prey partitioning, and especially partitioning
   along snow clines, seem to be the mechanisms by which these two taxa can
   coexist. We predict that rapid ecological change - especially from
   increasingly homogenised forests and prey communities, as well as from
   declining snow cover and snowpack due to climate warming - is likely to
   destabilise marten-fisher coexistence. As the climate continues to
   change, fishers and martens are likely to experience distributional and
   numerical shifts and increased isolation at their southern range
   boundaries, and vulnerable populations - especially of martens - will be
   driven to local extirpation.},

Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {During the last century, the practice of fur farming in Europe led to
   the introduction of two mammal species from opposite ends of the world.
   With their subsequent unintentional escape from captivity or intentional
   releases, the process of slow expansion and establishment in Europe
   began. The raccoon Procyon lotor and the raccoon dog Nyctereutes
   procyonoides are included on the European Union's list of invasive alien
   species.
   We characterised the current climatic niches of the two species in their
   native ranges in North America and Asia, and compared them with their
   non-native-range niches in Europe, where we also projected climatic
   suitability. The aim was to locate suitable habitats beyond their
   current ranges and assess where a range expansion can be expected.
   Niche comparison and the projection of climatic suitability in Europe
   were based on eight bioclimatic variables and presence records from the
   Global Biodiversity Information Facility database. For niche modelling,
   we applied the maximum entropy approach (Maxent) and used the
   native-range data for training.
   Minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio06) was identified as the
   most important bioclimatic variable in the habitat suitability models
   for both species. Different tolerance levels regarding this variable
   might explain small differences between the species' projected ranges,
   especially in the north and east of Europe. The high niche unfilling for
   both species in Europe suggests a potential for expansion beyond their
   present ranges.
   With only little understanding of their ecological impacts in their new
   ranges, including the potential risk of Nyctereutes procyonoides as
   SARS-CoV-2 reservoir hosts, further research and management is required
   at various spatial scales in Europe.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak is having an unprecedented effect on human
   society, but how is it affecting the mammals that people live with?
   Mammals that were part of tourism experiences are of concern, because
   they impact on people's health and livelihoods and, since many of them
   are now dependent on people, we urge consideration of the status of
   these mammals as a result of the pandemic.
   We provide a systematic review of the impacts the COVID-19 outbreak has
   had on mammals in tourism venues. We examine reports of diverse species
   in various settings responding to changes in their environments that are
   occurring because of the pandemic.
   We searched the scholarly literature, preprints, and online news sources
   using combinations of the search terms `tourism', `animals', `wildlife',
   `coronavirus', and `COVID-19'. We searched Web of Science, SCOPUS,
   EBSCOHost, JSTOR, bioRxiv, OSFPREPRINTS, GDELT, Google News, and
   National Public Radio, and analysed a total of 39 news articles, one
   peer-reviewed article, and six preprints.
   In total, we identified 92 distinct animal reports representing 48
   mammal species. We used an existing tourism classification schema to
   categorise each article based on the situation reported, with the new
   addition of one context. We classified 92 separate animal reports in 46
   articles into four (of six possible) contexts: mammals as attractions (n
   = 40 animal reports), mammals as commodities (n = 33), mammals as
   threats (n = 2), and unusual sightings of mammals (n = 17). Shortage of
   food, in danger of losing home, having an enriched/relaxed environment,
   spatial expansion, disease transmission, and poaching are the major
   impacts or events reported in these contexts.
   We suggest changes for each context with respect to how people interface
   with mammals, with the goal of improving the lives of mammals and the
   people dependent on them.},

Title = {Drivers of European bat population change: a review reveals evidence
   gaps},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {353-368},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bat populations are thought to have suffered significant declines in the
   past century throughout Europe. Fortunately, there are some signs of
   recovery; for instance, of the 11 species monitored in the UK,
   population trends of five are increasing. The drivers of past losses and
   recent trends are unclear; identifying them will enable targeted
   conservation strategies to support further recovery.
   We review the evidence linking proposed drivers to impacts on bat
   populations in Europe, using the results of a previous cross-taxa
   semi-quantitative assessment as a framework. Broadly, the drivers
   reviewed relate to land-use practices, climate change, pollution,
   development and infrastructure, and human disturbance. We highlight
   where evidence gaps or conflicts present barriers to successful
   conservation and review emerging opportunities to address these gaps.
   We find that the relative importance or impacts of the potential drivers
   of bat population change are not well understood or quantified, with
   conflicting evidence in many cases. To close key gaps in the evidence
   for responses of bat populations to environmental change, future studies
   should focus on the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, offshore
   wind turbines, and water pollution, as well as on mitigation measures
   and the synergistic effects of putative drivers.
   To increase available evidence of drivers of bat population change, we
   propose utilising advances in monitoring tools and statistical methods,
   together with robust quantitative assessment of conservation
   interventions to mitigate threats and enable the effective conservation
   of these protected species.},

Abstract = {Covariation among discrete phenotypes can arise due to selection for
   shared functions, and/or shared genetic and developmental underpinnings.
   The consequences of such phenotypic integration are far-reaching and can
   act to either facilitate or limit morphological variation. The
   vertebrate brain is known to act as an ``organizer{''} of craniofacial
   development, secreting morphogens that can affect the shape of the
   growing neurocranium, consistent with roles for pleiotropy in
   brain-neurocranium covariation. Here, we test this hypothesis in cichlid
   fishes by first examining the degree of shape integration between the
   brain and the neurocranium using three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics in an F-5 hybrid population, and then genetically mapping
   trait covariation using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We
   observe shape associations between the brain and the neurocranium, a
   pattern that holds even when we assess associations between the brain
   and constituent parts of the neurocranium: the rostrum and braincase. We
   also recover robust genetic signals for both hard- and soft-tissue
   traits and identify a genomic region where QTL for the brain and
   braincase overlap, implicating a role for pleiotropy in patterning trait
   covariation. Fine mapping of the overlapping genomic region identifies a
   candidate gene, notch1a, which is known to be involved in patterning
   skeletal and neural tissues during development. Taken together, these
   data offer a genetic hypothesis for brain-neurocranium covariation, as
   well as a potential mechanism by which behavioral shifts may
   simultaneously drive rapid change in neuroanatomy and craniofacial
   morphology.},

Title = {Evolution of the therian face through complete loss of the premaxilla},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {103-118},

Abstract = {The anatomical framework of the jawbones is highly conserved among most
   of the Osteichthyes, including the tetrapods. However, our recent study
   suggested that the premaxilla, the rostralmost upper jaw bone, was
   rearranged during the evolution of therian mammals, being replaced by
   the septomaxilla at least in the lateral part. In the present study, to
   understand more about the process of evolution from the ancestral upper
   jaw to the therian face, we re-examined the development of the therian
   premaxilla (incisive bone). By comparing mouse, bat, goat, and cattle
   fetuses, we confirmed that the therian premaxilla has dual developmental
   origins, the lateral body and the palatine process. This dual
   development is widely conserved among the therian mammals.
   Cell-lineage-tracing experiments using Dlx1-CreER(T2) mice revealed that
   the palatine process arises in the ventral part of the premandibular
   domain, where the nasopalatine nerve distributes, whereas the lateral
   body develops from the maxillary prominence in the domain of the
   maxillary nerve. Through comparative analysis using various tetrapods,
   we concluded that the palatine process should not be considered part of
   the ancestral premaxilla. It rather corresponds to the anterior region
   of the vomerine bone of nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, the present
   findings indicate that the true premaxilla was completely lost during
   the evolution of the therian mammals, resulting in the establishment of
   the unique therian face as an evolutionary novelty. Reconsideration of
   the homological framework of the cranial skeleton based on the
   topographical relationships of the ossification center during embryonic
   development is warranted.},

Title = {Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican
   cavefish},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with
   various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most
   organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship
   between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in
   our understanding of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus,
   consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at
   least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that
   inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application
   of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping
   have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of
   complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with
   surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye
   degeneration, insomnia, albinism, and enhanced mechanosensory function.
   The interfertility of different populations from the same species
   provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between
   evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and
   morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships
   between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to
   test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed
   differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex
   between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship
   between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for
   locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex, and
   morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body
   length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between
   increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were
   few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and
   morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie
   the evolution of the measured behavioral and morphological traits. Taken
   together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genetic
   underpinnings of naturally occurring variation in morphological and
   behavioral traits.},

Title = {Coyote diet in North America: geographic and ecological patterns during
   range expansion},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Coyotes Canis latrans have expanded their geographic range by 40\% in
   the last 120 years, raising questions about their ecological impacts in
   the newly colonised areas. Despite a wealth of local knowledge on coyote
   diet in North America, we have little information about how and why diet
   might vary throughout the species' range. We conducted the first
   rangewide meta-analysis of coyote diet by investigating how ecoregion,
   coyote mass, environmental conditions, presence of top predators and
   alternative food items are related to coyote dietary diversity, as well
   as consumption of small mammals, lagomorphs, vegetation and ungulates.
   Using data from 93 studies, we used generalised linear mixed models to
   determine which variables best explained coyote dietary patterns.
   Coyotes were generally more carnivorous in temperate forests than in
   other ecoregions, primarily due to greater ungulate consumption. Dietary
   diversity was most influenced via a negative effect of mammal
   consumption; coyote diet was more diverse in the spring and where human
   footprint was greater. There was minor variation in small mammal
   consumption, but lagomorph consumption was greater in spring and winter
   and when coyotes were larger. Vegetation consumption was greatest in
   summer and autumn. Ungulate consumption was positively related to coyote
   mass, snow cover and the presence of grey wolves Canis lupus. Both
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors were related to coyote diet. Larger
   coyotes ate larger foods, which parallels the relationship between mass
   and prey size across the carnivore guild. Wolves and humans have
   opposing effects on coyote diet. Coyotes seem to prioritise eating wild
   mammals, though more work is needed to quantify scavenging.
   Collectively, our findings emphasise the need for continued local or
   regional studies to understand the highly variable ecological effects of
   coyotes within the diverse ecosystems they currently inhabit and are
   poised to inhabit.},

Title = {Convergent evolution of increased urine-concentrating ability in desert
   mammals},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {482-491},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One of the most celebrated textbook examples of physiological
   adaptations to desert environments is the unique ability that desert
   mammals have to produce hyperosmotic urine. Commonly perceived as an
   adaptation mainly observed in small rodents, the extent to which
   urine-concentrating ability has evolved independently in distinct
   mammalian lineages has not previously been assessed using modern
   phylogenetic approaches.
   We review urine-concentrating ability data from the literature in 121
   mammalian species with geographic ranges encompassing varying climatic
   conditions. We explicitly test the general hypothesis that
   desert-dwelling mammals have evolved greater ability to concentrate
   urine than non-desert species, controlling for body mass, phylogenetic
   affinity and other covariates.
   Ancestral state reconstruction across our dataset's phylogeny shows that
   the ability to produce hyperosmotic urine, measured as maximum urine
   osmolality, has evolved convergently in mammalian species with
   geographic ranges characterised by low mean annual aridity index.
   Phylogenetic generalised least-squares (PGLS) models show that the mean
   annual aridity index of a species' geographic range largely predicts its
   urine-concentrating ability, even when accounting for body mass
   differences, phylogenetic correlations, the specific condition under
   which urine osmolality was measured, the method used to measure urine
   osmolality, and the species' diet.
   In contrast, we find much weaker correlations between mass-adjusted
   basal metabolic rate and environmental variables when analysing 84 of
   the species included in the urine osmolality analysis.
   Taken together, our results not only show that desert mammals
   effectively concentrate more urine than non-desert mammals, but further
   suggest that aridity is likely to have been one of the main selective
   pressures leading to increasing maximum urine-concentrating ability and
   driving its repeated evolution in different desert mammalian lineages.},

Title = {Latitude, life history and sexual size dimorphism correlate with
   reproductive seasonality in rodents},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-271},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Rodents show an immense variation in reproductive seasonality,
   spanning the whole spectrum from strictly seasonal to continuous
   reproduction throughout the year. However, the factors causing this
   variation have so far mostly been investigated in single-species studies
   that could not address phylogenetic constraints.
   2. By applying both a categorical description and a quantitative
   measure, the present study characterises the degree of reproductive
   seasonality in the wild of 272 rodent species.
   3. Using a comparative approach, the relationships of 12 variables,
   comprising five life-history variables, three abiotic variables, two
   niche variables and two allometric variables, with reproductive
   seasonality in rodents, were tested.
   4. The majority of rodents reproduced non-seasonally and had
   particularly high intraspecific variation in reproductive seasonality
   compared to other mammalian groups. Their opportunistic breeding
   strategies, their large geographic ranges with wide latitude and
   elevation ranges, and their ability to live in human-made environments
   may be related to this broad intraspecific variation of birth season
   length in rodents.
   5. The most important variables associated with rodent reproductive
   seasonality were mid-latitude of the species' geographical range,
   temperature, litters per year, weaning age, age at sexual maturity and
   sexual size dimorphism. Birth seasons become shorter with increasing
   latitude and colder temperatures, corresponding to the decreasing length
   of the favourable season. Species with more pronounced birth seasonality
   have fewer litters, which are weaned earlier and reach sexual maturity
   later, corresponding to the shorter period of optimal environmental
   conditions for reproduction. Sexual size dimorphism was weakly
   associated with birth seasonality, with more seasonal species having a
   higher degree of male-biased sexual dimorphism, potentially because
   male-male competition and female monopolisation are more likely to
   evolve in species with short mating seasons.
   6. In conclusion, habitat seasonality and life-history adaptations are
   most strongly associated with reproductive seasonality in rodents, which
   has important implications for zoo husbandry and for the effects of
   climate change on rodents.},

   fossil embryos undergoing discoidal cleavage. However, our specimens
   contain fewer cells and thus probably represent developmental precursors
   of the Weng'an counterparts. Additionally, new material shows several
   anatomical features that are inconsistent with an embryo interpretation,
   including (1) an unusually large volume of ``blastomeres,{''} (2) a
   putative nucleus preserved within the large ``yolk cell,{''} and (3)
   completely separated cells. Collectively, the Zhenba embryo-like
   specimens permit a reconstruction of the consecutive developmental
   sequence from single-celled individuals to the three-celled individuals,
   leading us to interpret the newly found specimens as products of
   abnormal development of Ediacaran embryo-like organisms whose affinity
   remains unresolved.},

Abstract = {The developmental process establishes the foundation upon which natural
   selection may act. In that same sense, it is inundated with numerous
   constraints that work to limit the directions in which a phenotype may
   respond to selective pressures. Extreme phenotypes have been used in the
   past to identify tradeoffs and constraints and may aid in recognizing
   how alterations to the Bauplane can influence the trajectories of
   lineages. The Bramidae, a family of Scombriformes consisting of 20
   extant species, are unique in that five species greatly deviate from the
   stout, ovaloid bodies that typify the bramids. The Ptericlinae, or
   fanfishes, are instead characterized by relatively elongated body plans
   and extreme modifications to their medial fins. Here, we explore the
   development of Bramidae morphologies and examine them through a
   phylogenetic lens to investigate the concepts of developmental and
   evolutionary constraints. Contrary to our predictions that the fanfishes
   had been constrained by inherited properties of an ancestral state, we
   find that the fanfishes exhibit both increased rates of trait evolution
   and differ substantially from the other bramids in their developmental
   trajectories. Conversely, the remaining bramid genera differ little,
   both among one another and in comparison, to the sister family
   Caristiidae. In all, our data suggest that the fanfishes have broken
   constraints, thereby allowing them to mitigate trade-offs on distinctive
   aspects of morphology.},

Title = {A fundamental developmental transition in Physcomitrium patens is

Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {123-136},

Abstract = {One of the most defining moments in history was the colonization of land
   by plants approximately 470 million years ago. The transition from water
   to land was accompanied by significant changes in the plant body plan,
   from those than resembled filamentous representatives of the
   charophytes, the sister group to land plants, to those that were
   morphologically complex and capable of colonizing harsher habitats. The
   moss Physcomitrium patens (also known as Physcomitrella patens) is an
   extant representative of the bryophytes, the earliest land plant
   lineage. The protonema of P. patens emerges from spores from a
   chloronemal initial cell, which can divide to self-renew to produce
   filaments of chloronemal cells. A chloronemal initial cell can
   differentiate into a caulonemal initial cell, which can divide and
   self-renew to produce filaments of caulonemal cells, which branch
   extensively and give rise to three-dimensional shoots. The process by
   which a chloronemal initial cell differentiates into a caulonemal
   initial cell is tightly regulated by auxin-induced remodeling of the
   actin cytoskeleton. Studies have revealed that the genetic mechanisms
   underpinning this transition also regulate tip growth and
   differentiation in diverse plant taxa. This review summarizes the known
   cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the chloronema to
   caulonema transition in P. patens.},

Title = {Evolutionary modification of gastrulation in Parvulastra exigua, an
   asterinid seastar with holobenthic lecithotrophic development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {63-71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Gastrulation is a fundamental morphogenetic process in development. In
   echinoderms with ancestral-type development through feeding larvae,
   gastrulation involves radially symmetrical invagination of cells around
   the blastopore. Gastrulation in the seastar Parvulastra exigua, a
   species with non-feeding larvae deviates from this pattern.
   Microinjection of cells with fluorescent lineage tracer dye revealed
   that early blastomeres contribute unequally to ectoderm and endoderm. In
   embryos injected at the two-cell stage, asymmetry was evident in the
   fluorescence at the top of the archenteron and animal pole ectoderm.
   Archenteron elongation is driven by asymmetrical involution of cells
   with more cells crossing the blastopore on one side. Lineages of cells
   injected at the four-cell stage also differed in allocation to endoderm
   and ectoderm. In embryos injected at the eight-cell stage ectodermal and
   endodermal fates were evident reflecting the animal and vegetal fates
   determined by third cleavage as typical of echinoderms. Modification of
   gastrulation associated with evolution of development in P. exigua shows
   that this foundational morphogenetic process can be altered despite its
   importance for subsequent development. However, observations of slight
   asymmetry in the lineage fates of blastomeres in asterinids with
   planktotrophic development indicates that gastrulation by asymmetrical
   involution in P. exigua may be a hypertrophic elaboration of a
   pre-existing state in ancestral-type development. As for echinoids with
   lecithotrophic development, involution as a mechanism to contribute to
   archenteron elongation may be associated with the impact of extensive
   maternal nutritive reserves on the mechanics of cell movement and a
   novel innovation to facilitate early development of the adult rudiment.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and the conversion of natural environments to anthropogenic
   land uses are among the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide.
   The remaining habitats are inserted in highly modified landscapes,
   presenting contrasting patch and landscape features. Understanding
   species' responses to these anthropogenic land-use changes is essential
   for informing conservation planning. We evaluate which spatial
   predictors (measured at the patch and landscape scales) and species'
   life-history traits best predict the occurrence of medium-sized and
   large mammals in forest fragments of the threatened Atlantic Forest of
   South America. We gathered occurrence data for 36 medium-sized and large
   mammal species recorded by camera traps, distributed over 220 forest
   fragments spanning the entire Atlantic Forest biome. Species were
   classified according to their characteristics as follows: `hunted
   forest-dependent', `non-hunted forest-dependent', and `generalist'
   species. Further, each species' occurrence was related to spatial
   predictors and life-history trait variables. We revealed a severe
   defaunation of forest mammals occurring in most forest fragments in the
   Atlantic Forest. Landscapes containing large forest patches, low road
   density, and high human population density harboured high numbers of
   mammal species, including those exhibiting greater body mass.
   Nevertheless, mammal groups diverge in their sensitivity to landscape
   changes. Hunted forest-dependent species mainly occurred in landscapes
   with lower edge density and numbers of patches and with less
   anthropogenic disturbance, while non-hunted forest-dependent species
   mainly occupied large forest fragments. Finally, generalist species also
   occurred in landscapes with low edge density and number of patches, but
   were more prevalent in landscapes with higher human population density.
   We stress the importance of maintaining large forest fragments,
   considering the effects of landscape configuration on conservation
   strategies, and reducing anthropogenic disturbances to ensure a greater
   persistence of mammal species in the Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Typically, males of polygamous mammals are responsible for population
   connectivity and gene flow via dispersal, whereas females, showing
   stronger philopatry, strengthen local population stability and growth.
   These expectations can be disrupted by human disturbances; however, this
   possibility has been poorly examined in wide-ranging mammals that are
   important targets for conservation. By reviewing philopatry and
   dispersal in felids, we aimed to evaluate: 1) whether the sex-related
   patterns of philopatry and dispersal predicted for polygamous mammals
   are prevalent in felids, 2) possible major causes underlying each of
   these behaviours, and 3) if, and to what extent, anthropogenic
   disturbances can alter patterns of philopatry and dispersal in this
   animal lineage. We synthesised the available literature (n = 55 papers)
   comprising 12 species. Puma concolor was the most-studied species,
   followed by other large species. Both philopatry and dispersal were
   heterogeneously defined, depending on the study aim and the method
   employed (telemetry, camera trapping or molecular tools). Most species
   followed the predicted philopatric and dispersal patterns, and most
   study areas (76\%) were under some type of anthropogenic disturbance
   drivers. Philopatry was linked to females' higher dependency on the
   quality and availability of resources, and to their social dynamics,
   higher reproductive success, inclusive fitness and demographic aspects
   of population. Dispersal was frequently linked to competition for mates
   and resources, and inbreeding avoidance. However, some plasticity was
   observed in both philopatry and dispersal, especially under the presence
   of anthropogenic drivers. For example, hunting can create open
   territories, increasing the number of philopatric females and
   opportunistic philopatric males. Habitat fragmentation can increase
   population isolation and male dispersal distance, and the presence of
   anthropogenic or natural barriers can result in unsuccessful dispersal
   attempts. We postulate that human activities affect long-term population
   persistence in the Felidae, via disruption of sex-related patterns of
   spatial dynamics.},

Title = {Wild ungulate responses to anthropogenic land use: a comparative
   Pantropical analysis},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Escalating human development has severely threatened natural ecosystems,
   especially in the Tropics, resulting in the wholesale replacement and
   fragmentation of native habitats and their biotas. As a result, wild
   vertebrates have often become isolated in natural vegetation patches
   surrounded by different anthropogenic land cover (ALC) types of variable
   habitat quality. In many regions, ALC is the dominant form of
   human-modified habitat available, but its importance to wildlife remains
   poorly understood.
   We present the first Pantropical comparative analysis of the responses
   of all wild hoofed mammal populations (terrestrial ungulates:
   Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Proboscidea) to six major ALC types
   (exotic pastures, annual croplands, abandoned croplands, perennial
   croplands, tree plantations, and agroforestry).
   Specifically, we evaluate whether life-history trait, threat status, and
   structural landscape contrast can explain ungulate habitat use in these
   ALC types. We also investigate which land uses are most likely to
   contribute to the persistence of Tropical cervids, bovids, tapirs,
   suids, and tayassuids.
   We show that habitat breadth and body mass are key positive and negative
   life-history predictors of wild ungulate responses to ALC, respectively.
   Additionally, our results indicate that perennial and annual croplands
   are the most detrimental to wild ungulates, whereas agroforestry exerts
   a relatively benign effect. ALC is more detrimental to Neotropical
   ungulates than to their ecological analogues in the Palaeotropics.
   We emphasise the pervasive effects of large-scale mechanised cropland,
   and the often positive role of agroforestry systems as supplementary
   habitats in sustaining wild ungulate assemblages. Large tracts of
   natural habitat under varying degrees of connectivity can enhance the
   persistence of viable Tropical ungulate populations.},

Title = {Thyroid hormone shapes craniofacial bones during postembryonic zebrafish
   development},

Pages = {61-76},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Changing the shape of craniofacial bones can profoundly alter ecological
   function, and understanding how developmental conditions sculpt skeletal
   phenotypes can provide insight into evolutionary adaptations. Thyroid
   hormone (TH) stimulates metamorphosis and regulates skeletal
   morphogenesis across vertebrates. To assess the roles of this hormone in
   sculpting the craniofacial skeleton of a non-metamorphic vertebrate, we
   tested zebrafish for developmental periods of TH-induced craniofacial
   shape change. We analyzed shapes of specific bones that function in prey
   detection, capture and processing. We quantified these elements from
   late-larval through adult stages under three developmental TH profiles.
   Under wild-type conditions, each bone progressively grows allometrically
   into a mature morphology over the course of postembryonic development.
   In three of the four bones, TH was required to sculpt an adult shape:
   hypothyroidism inhibited aspects of shape change, and allowed some
   components of immature shape to be retained into adulthood. Excess
   developmental TH stimulated aspects of precocious shape change leading
   to abnormal morphologies in some bones. Skeletal features with
   functional importance showed high sensitivities to TH, including the
   transformator process of the tripus, the mandibular symphysis of the
   lower jaw, the scutiform lamina of the hyomandibula, and the anterior
   arm of the pharyngeal jaw. In all, we found that TH is necessary for
   shaping mature morphology of several essential skeletal elements; this
   requirement is particularly pronounced during larval development.
   Altered TH titer leads to abnormal morphologies with likely functional
   consequences, highlighting the potential of TH and downstream pathways
   as targets for evolutionary change.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Deciphering the genetic basis of vertebrate craniofacial variation is a
   longstanding biological problem with broad implications in evolution,
   development, and human pathology. One of the most stunning examples of
   craniofacial diversification is the adaptive radiation of birds, in
   which the beak serves essential roles in virtually every aspect of their
   life histories. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) provides an
   exceptional opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings of
   craniofacial variation because of its unique balance of experimental
   accessibility and extraordinary phenotypic diversity within a single
   species. We used traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify
   craniofacial variation in an F-2 laboratory cross derived from the
   straight-beaked Pomeranian Pouter and curved-beak Scandaroon pigeon
   breeds. Using a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus
   scans and multi-locus modeling, we identified a set of genetic loci
   associated with complex shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton,
   including beak shape, braincase shape, and mandible shape. Some of these
   loci control coordinated changes between different structures, while
   others explain variation in the size and shape of specific skull and jaw
   regions. We find that in domestic pigeons, a complex blend of both
   independent and coupled genetic effects underlie three-dimensional
   craniofacial morphology.},

Title = {Symmetry in graptolite zooids and tubaria (Pterobranchia, Hemichordata)},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {513-523},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Extant and fossil pterobranchs show distinct symmetry conditions of the
   individual zooids and their tubaria that are not necessarily comparable.
   The strict bilateral symmetry in the zooids of extant Cephalodiscida is
   modified to a considerable anatomical asymmetry in extant
   Rhabdopleurida. This type of left-right asymmetry can be recognized as
   antisymmetry, as dextral and sinistral developments are equally common.
   Antisymmetry is also recognized in the rhabdopleurid tubaria and in the
   proximal development and branching of planktic graptoloids. The
   antisymmetry of the graptoloid tubarium is modified during the
   Tremadocian time interval to a fixed or directional asymmetry. From the
   latest Tremadocian or earliest Floian onwards, proximal development in
   the Graptoloidea is invariably dextral and very few examples of a
   sinistral development have been found. The transition from antisymmetry
   to directional asymmetry can only be recognized in the graptolite
   tubaria, as the anatomy of the zooids is unknown from the fossil record.
   Directional asymmetry is not recognized in extant Pterobranchia.},

Title = {Limitations of acoustic monitoring at wind turbines to evaluate fatality
   risk of bats},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {559-570},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Wind turbines (WTs) frequently kill bats worldwide. During environmental
   impact assessments, consultant ecologists often use automated ultrasonic
   detectors (AUDs) to estimate the activity and identity of bats in the
   zone of highest mortality risk at WTs in order to formulate mitigation
   schemes, such as increased curtailment speeds to prevent casualties.
   While acknowledging the potential of acoustic monitoring, we evaluate
   the limitations of AUDs for monitoring bats at WTs and highlight
   directions for future research. We show that geometric attenuation and
   atmospheric attenuation of ultrasonic echolocation calls, in conjunction
   with limited sensitivity of ultrasonic microphones, severely constrain
   detection distances of bats at WTs. Taking into account the acoustic
   shadow produced by the nacelle, AUDs cover only approximately 23\% of
   the risk zone for a bat calling at 20 kHz and 4\% for a bat calling at
   40 kHz, assuming a 60 m blade length. This percentage will further
   decrease with increasing blade lengths in modern WTs. Additionally, the
   directionality of echolocation calls and the dynamic flight behaviour of
   bats constrain the detectability of bats. If a call can be detected, the
   low interspecific and high intraspecific variation of echolocation call
   characteristics may impair species identification, limiting the power to
   predict population-level effects of fatalities. We conclude that
   technical, physical, and biological factors severely constrain acoustic
   monitoring in its current form. We suggest the use of several AUDs,
   installed at complementary sites at WTs, and the testing of other
   techniques, such as radar, cameras, and thermal imaging, to inform
   stakeholders on the mortality risk of bats at WTs.},

Title = {A synthesis of life-history traits, functional traits, and consequences
   of anthropogenic pressures on Madagascar's threatened carnivorans,
   EupleridaeMots cles},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {402-419},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Madagascar's native carnivorans are an endemic monophyletic group of
   eight extant species belonging to the family Eupleridae. The
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently
   classifies seven of the species as threatened (Vulnerable or
   Endangered), as their populations are in decline due to intensifying
   anthropogenic pressures. However, little is known about these species'
   ecology and population trends, precluding forecasts of extinction risk.
   Life-history and functional traits govern species' responses to
   environmental pressure and can be predictive of extinction risk.
   Incorporating relevant trait information can vastly improve risk
   assessments. Yet, information on the life-history and functional traits
   of the Eupleridae has never been compiled into a single framework.
   2. Our aims were to: 1) synthesise the current state of knowledge of the
   life-history and functional traits of euplerid species, 2) review
   empirical evidence of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on species,
   and 3) identify knowledge gaps and future research needs.
   3. We searched the published literature to compile life-history and
   functional trait information and known effects of anthropogenic
   pressures for Eupleridae.
   4. Our review indicates that Madagascar's carnivorans have high-risk
   life-history and functional traits that increase their vulnerability to
   anthropogenic pressures. Publications reported negative effects on
   euplerids from habitat degradation and fragmentation, logging,
   non-native carnivorans, disease, and hunting and retaliatory killings.
   However, our synthesis revealed significant knowledge gaps, especially
   in species' life-history traits and in the spatial variability in most
   traits. For most species, we currently do not have the robust data
   needed to assess trait-based risk dynamics.
   5. The culmination of reported traits, negative influence of ongoing
   anthropogenic pressures, and lack of robust metrics (e.g. population
   trends and trait variability) indicate that euplerids are at high risk,
   yet may reach the cusp of extinction without notice due to significant
   gaps in knowledge. Future research should prioritise filling gaps in
   knowledge of influential traits, evaluating anthropogenic pressures, and
   integrating trait information to improve risk assessments and extinction
   forecasts.},

Title = {Middle-out ecology: small carnivores as sentinels of global change},

Abstract = {Species that respond to ecosystem change in a timely, measurable, and
   interpretable way can be used as sentinels of global change. Contrary to
   a pervasive view, we suggest that, among Carnivora, small carnivores are
   more appropriate sentinels than large carnivores. This reasoning is
   built around six key points: that, compared to large carnivores, small
   carnivores 1) are more species-rich and diverse, providing more
   potential sentinels in many systems; 2) occupy a wider range of
   ecological niches, exhibiting a greater variety of sensitivities to
   change; 3) hold an intermediate trophic position that is more directly
   affected by changes at the producer, primary consumer, and tertiary
   consumer levels; 4) have shorter life spans and higher reproductive
   rates, exhibiting more rapid responses to change; 5) have smaller home
   ranges and are more abundant, making it easier to investigate fine-scale
   management interventions; 6) are easier to monitor, manage, and
   manipulate. Therefore, we advocate for incorporating a middle-out
   approach, in addition to the established top-down and bottom-up
   approaches, to assessing the responses of ecosystems to global change.},

Title = {Adverse effects of Diptera flies on northern ungulates: Rangifer, Alces,
   and Bison},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-437},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Flies (Diptera) damage ungulates far beyond the injury of their bite
   wounds: they are vectors of diseases and cause ungulates to lose
   foraging opportunities due to avoidance behaviour. We can use the
   behavioural and physiological responses of bison Bison spp.
   (Artiodactyla: Bovidae), caribou/reindeer Rangifer tarandus
   (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), and moose/elk Alces alces (Artiodactyla:
   Cervidae) to assess the impacts of flies on these ungulates. Ungulates
   rely on morphological and physiological resistance to flies at low
   intensities of exposure. However, as fly exposure increases, ungulates
   begin to react with behavioural avoidance in addition to increasing
   their physiological response. Rangifer tarandus are highly sensitive to
   flies and respond quickly to their presence by avoidance behaviours that
   incur fitness costs through reduced body mass. Alces alces are less
   reactive to fly exposure, enduring the presence of flies and maintaining
   a low loss of fitness, sometimes dying from the cumulative effects of
   exposure. Bison spp. may use a facultative strategy that depends upon
   the prevalence of flies and associated diseases in their environment.
   Among these strategies, variables such as the type of fly bite, presence
   and degree of infection, and heritability of resistance affect
   individual host survival. Relationships between flies and ungulates can
   integrate multiple scales of organisation in the ecosystem to reflect
   system stability. Climate change is predicted to alter the species
   composition and seasonal phenology of flies and the associated effects
   of wounding and vector-borne disease on ungulate populations that are
   central to the functions of Arctic and temperate ecosystems in the
   Northern Hemisphere.},

Title = {When carnivores collide: a review of studies exploring the competitive
   interactions between bobcats Lynx rufus and coyotes Canis latrans},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Bobcats Lynx rufus and coyotes Canis latrans are two widespread
   mesopredators with a complex history of sympatry. The competitive
   interactions between these species are of interest to biologists due to
   the furbearer status of bobcats, the recent range expansion of coyotes,
   and the recolonisation of several parts of North America by bobcats
   following their extirpation. Although studies exploring the dynamics and
   competition between bobcats and coyotes span decades, there is a lack of
   understanding regarding what factors influence exploitative or
   interference competition, and what methodologies are conducive to
   identifying these types of competition. We gathered a comprehensive list
   of research papers (n = 41) exploring bobcat-coyote competitive
   interactions in North America. From them, we collected the following:
   study site characteristics, number and types of research methods, number
   and types of metrics explored, history of sympatry of the two species at
   the study location, presence of apex predators, and documentation of
   interference and/or exploitative competition. Using generalised linear
   models, we determined that interference competition between bobcats and
   coyotes was observed primarily in open habitat. However, habitat
   heterogeneity, the number of research methods and metrics used, presence
   of an apex predator, and history of sympatry could not be used to
   predict the occurrence of interference competition. Studies that
   included diet overlap were less likely to observe interference
   competition than studies that used other metrics to infer competition.
   Competitive interactions between coyotes and bobcats are largely a
   function of prey availability. Our findings suggest that habitat type
   may be a surrogate for prey availability, which many researchers
   mention, but do not explicitly measure. Future studies investigating
   bobcat-coyote interactions should include the quantification of prey
   densities to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the system at
   large, and should avoid using solely diet or habitat overlap as metrics
   to assess competition.},

Abstract = {Since 2000, no reviews or analyses have been carried out on scientific
   studies regarding bat reproductive biology. Such reviews might
   contribute towards identifying information gaps and global research
   focus and trends.
   The objective of this work was to review and analyse scientific studies
   on different aspects of bat reproduction published in the last two
   decades (2000-2019), in order to provide perspective for future
   research.
   Using 19 key words, we searched for literature on the reproduction of
   bats published as book chapters and articles in scientific research
   journals globally. We analysed 36 chapters in 14 books and 276
   scientific articles, from 41 countries, identifying publishing trends
   throughout the years, preferred journals, countries in which studies
   have been carried out, and most-studied species and topics.
   The number of studies increased over the last decade, resulting from the
   consolidation of research lines in countries such as Brazil, India,
   Mexico, and USA. The studies covered 125 species, of which Scotophilus
   heathi and Cynopterus sphinx were the most recurrent, each appearing in
   23 studies (7.4\%, n = 312). The most common subject was anatomy (61
   studies, 20\%, n = 312), and the rarest was assisted reproduction
   techniques (11 studies, 3.5\%, n = 312).
   In the last decade, there has been a trend to increase the study of male
   anatomy. The application of new techniques for the study of reproduction
   contributed to more complex studies that favour the understanding of the
   reproductive process. There is an evident lack of reproductive studies
   for most species, and there is an information gap regarding research in
   prenatal development and assisted reproduction techniques. These two
   topics are greatly significant for future research, because of their
   direct usefulness for species conservation.},

Title = {Creating morphological diversity in reptilian temporal skull region: A
   review of potential developmental mechanisms},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {15-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Reptilian skull morphology is highly diverse and broadly categorized
   into three categories based on the number and position of the temporal
   fenestrations: anapsid, synapsid, and diapsid. According to recent
   phylogenetic analysis, temporal fenestrations evolved twice
   independently in amniotes, once in Synapsida and once in Diapsida.
   Although functional aspects underlying the evolution of tetrapod
   temporal fenestrations have been well investigated, few studies have
   investigated the developmental mechanisms responsible for differences in
   the pattern of temporal skull region. To determine what these mechanisms
   might be, we first examined how the five temporal bones develop by
   comparing embryonic cranial osteogenesis between representative extant
   reptilian species. The pattern of temporal skull region may depend on
   differences in temporal bone growth rate and growth direction during
   ontogeny. Next, we compared the histogenesis patterns and the expression
   of two key osteogenic genes, Runx2 and Msx2, in the temporal region of
   the representative reptilian embryos. Our comparative analyses suggest
   that the embryonic histological condition of the domain where temporal
   fenestrations would form predicts temporal skull morphology in adults
   and regulatory modifications of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in osteogenic
   mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating
   morphological diversity in the temporal skull region of reptiles.},

Title = {Comparative ontogenetic and transcriptomic analyses shed light on color

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {158-170},

Abstract = {Stripe patterns are a striking example for a repeatedly evolved color
   pattern. In the African adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes, stripes
   evolved several times independently. Previously, it has been suggested
   that regulatory evolution of a single gene, agouti-related-peptide 2
   (agrp2), explains the evolutionary lability of this trait. Here, using a
   comparative transcriptomic approach, we performed comparisons between
   (adult) striped and nonstriped cichlid fishes of representatives of Lake
   Victoria and the two major clades of Lake Malawi (mbuna and non-mbuna
   lineage). We identify agrp2 to be differentially expressed across all
   pairwise comparisons, reaffirming its association with stripe pattern
   divergence. We therefore also provide evidence that agrp2 is associated
   with the loss of the nonstereotypic oblique stripe of Mylochromis mola.
   Complementary ontogenetic data give insights into the development of
   stripe patterns as well as vertical bar patterns that both develop
   postembryonically. Lastly, using the Lake Victoria species pair
   Haplochromis sauvagei and Pundamilia nyererei, we investigated the
   differences between melanic and non-melanic regions to identify
   additional genes that contribute to the formation of stripes. Expression
   differences-that most importantly also do not include agrp2-are
   surprisingly small. This suggests, at least in this species pair, that
   the stripe phenotype might be caused by a combination of more subtle
   transcriptomic differences or cellular changes without transcriptional
   correlates. In summary, our comprehensive analysis highlights the
   ontogenetic and adult transcriptomic differences between cichlids with
   different color patterns and serves as a basis for further investigation
   of the mechanistic underpinnings of their diversification.},

Abstract = {Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode model for the developmental
   genetics of morphological polyphenism, especially at the level of
   individual cells. Morphological polyphenism in this species includes an
   evolutionary novelty, moveable teeth, which have enabled predatory
   feeding in this species and others in its family (Diplogastridae). From
   transmission electron micrographs of serial thin sections through an
   adult hermaphrodite of P. pacificus, we three-dimensionally
   reconstructed all epithelial and myoepithelial cells and syncytia,
   corresponding to 74 nuclei, of its face, mouth, and pharynx. We found
   that the epithelia that produce the predatory morphology of P. pacificus
   are identical to Caenorhabditis elegans in the number of cell classes
   and nuclei. However, differences in cell form, spatial relationships,
   and nucleus position correlate with gross morphological differences from
   C. elegans and outgroups. Moreover, we identified fine-structural
   features, especially in the anteriormost pharyngeal muscles, that
   underlie the conspicuous, left-right asymmetry that characterizes the P.
   pacificus feeding apparatus. Our reconstruction provides an anatomical
   map for studying the genetics of polyphenism, feeding behavior, and the
   development of novel form in a satellite model to C. elegans.},

Title = {Selection on genes associated with the evolution of divergent life
   histories: Gamete recognition or something else?},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {423-438},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Gamete compatibility, and fertilization success, is mediated by
   gamete-recognition genes (GRGs) that are expected to show genetic
   evidence of a response to sexual selection associated with mating system
   traits. Changes in the strength of sexual selection can arise from the
   resolution of sperm competition among males, sexual conflicts of
   interest between males and females, or other mechanisms of sexual
   selection. To assess these expectations, we compared patterns of
   episodic diversifying selection among genes expressed in the gonads of
   Cryptasterina pentagona and C. hystera, which recently speciated and
   have evolved different mating systems (gonochoric or hermaphroditic),
   modes of fertilization (outcrossing or selfing), and dispersal
   (planktonic larvae or internal brooding). Cryptasterina spp. inhabit the
   upper intertidal of the coast of Queensland and coral islands of the
   Great Barrier Reef. We found some evidence for positive selection on a
   GRG in the outcrossing C. pentagona, and we found evidence of loss of
   gene function in a GRG of the self-fertilizing C. hystera. The
   modification or loss of gene functionality may be evidence of relaxed
   selection on some aspects of gamete interaction in C. hystera. In
   addition to these genes involved in gamete interactions, we also found
   genes under selection linked to abiotic stress, chromosomal regulation,
   polyspermy, and egg-laying. We interpret those results as possible
   evidence that Cryptasterina spp. with different mating systems may have
   been adapting in divergent ways to oxidative stress or other factors
   associated with reproduction in the physiologically challenging
   environment of the high intertidal. Research Highlights Recent
   speciation between two sea stars was unlikely the result of selection on
   gamete-recognition genes annotated in this study. Instead, our results
   point to selection on genes linked to the intertidal environment and
   reproduction.},

Title = {Evolutionary rescue via transgenerational plasticity: Evidence and

Volume = {23},
Number = {4, SI},

Abstract = {When a population experiences severe stress from a changing environment,
   evolution by natural selection can prevent its extinction, a process
   dubbed ``evolutionary rescue.{''} However, evolution may be unable to
   track the sort of rapid environmental change being experienced by many
   modern-day populations. A potential solution is for organisms to respond
   to environmental change through phenotypic plasticity, which can buffer
   populations against change and thereby buy time for evolutionary rescue.
   In this review, we examine whether this process extends to situations in
   which the environmentally induced response is passed to offspring. As we
   describe, theoretical and empirical studies suggest that such
   ``transgenerational plasticity{''} can increase population persistence.
   We discuss the implications of this process for conservation biology,
   outline potential limitations, and describe some applications.
   Generally, transgenerational plasticity may be effective at buying time
   for evolutionary rescue to occur.},

Title = {The role of heterotopy and heterochrony during morphological
   diversification of otocephalan epibranchial organs},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {79-91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Epibranchial organs (EBOs), found in at least five of the eight
   otomorphan families, are used to aggregate small prey inside the
   buccopharyngeal cavity and range in morphological complexity from a
   singular, small slit on the pharyngeal roof to several, elongated soft
   tissue tubes. Despite broad phylogenetic representation, little is known
   about the origin, development, or evolution of EBOs. We hypothesize that
   both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of
   EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a
   foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy,
   a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can
   have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received
   relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental
   mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan
   fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa
   mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus
   (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys
   molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described.
   Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we
   illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are
   responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan
   EBOs. Importantly, we also identify conserved developmental patterns
   that further our understanding of how EBOs may have first originated and
   evolved across actinopterygian fishes.},

Title = {Rivers as a potential dispersing agent of the invasive tree Acacia
   dealbata},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Background The silver wattle Acacia dealbata is a fast-growing tree from
   Australia that has become naturalised in different regions of the world,
   attaining invasive status in most of them. In Chile, A. dealbata reaches
   large abundances along banks and floodplains of invaded fluvial systems,
   suggesting that rivers may act as a vector for seed dispersal. As
   hydrochory has not been documented previously in this species, the aim
   of this study is to evaluate the potential for water dispersal of seeds
   of this invasive tree along rivers. Methods Seed samples from rivers
   were collected at three sites along two A. dealbata-invaded rivers
   within the Cachapoal basin, central Chile. Number of seeds collected was
   contrasted versus hydraulic and local conditions with RDA. Seed buoyancy
   and sedimentation velocity were determined and compared between sites
   with an ANCOVA. Finally, the probability of seed germination after long
   periods of immersion in water was assessed, simulating transport
   conditions in the flow. Germination results were tested with a GLM.
   Results Results indicate that increasing abundance of A. dealbata seeds
   in the flow is related to the level of turbulence of the flow. Seeds
   display high floatability but their sedimentation velocity is high when
   they do sink. Finally, silver wattle seeds can germinate after long
   periods (many weeks) of immersion in water; however, their probability
   of germination depends to a large extent on whether seeds are scarified
   or not. Conclusions Based on the evidence collected, we suggest that the
   seeds of A. dealbata have the necessary traits to be dispersed by
   rivers, this being the first research testing this hypothesis. The
   success of hydrochory of A. dealbata would depend on river flow
   turbulence, and whether there are natural mechanisms for scarifying the
   seeds either before or during transport. The proposed methodology can be
   used to assess river hydrochory for any tree species.},

Title = {Effects of the egg incubation environment on turtle carapace development},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-169},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Developing organisms are often exposed to fluctuating environments that
   destabilize tissue-scale processes and induce abnormal phenotypes. This
   might be common in species that lay eggs in the external environment and
   with little parental care, such as many reptiles. In turtles,
   morphological development has provided striking examples of abnormal
   phenotypic patterns, though the influence of the environment remains
   unclear. To this end, we compared fluctuating asymmetry, as a proxy for
   developmental instability, in turtle hatchlings incubated in controlled
   laboratory and unstable natural conditions. Wild and laboratory
   hatchlings featured similar proportions of supernumerary scales (scutes)
   on the dorsal shell (carapace). Such abnormal scutes likely elevated
   shape asymmetry, which was highest in natural nests. Moreover, we tested
   the hypothesis that hot and dry environments cause abnormal scute
   formation by subjecting eggs to a range of hydric and thermal laboratory
   incubation regimes. Shape asymmetry was similar in hatchlings incubated
   at five constant temperatures (26-30 degrees C). A hot (30 degrees C)
   and severely Dry substrate yielded smaller hatchlings but scutes were
   not overtly affected. Our study suggests that changing nest environments
   contribute to fluctuating asymmetry in egg-laying reptiles, while
   clarifying the conditions at which turtle shell development remains
   buffered from the external environment.},

Title = {Productivity correlates positively with mammalian diversity
   independently of the species' feeding guild, body mass, or the vertical
   strata explored by the species},

Abstract = {Mammals can influence ecosystem functioning through essential ecological
   processes. In patchy landscapes, mammalian diversity can be correlated
   with ecosystem productivity through its effect on resource availability.
   However, mammals comprise species with contrasting habitat use and
   requirements, and it is unknown whether the diversity-productivity
   relationship changes as a function of the mammal species' traits. We use
   meta-analytical techniques to quantify the effect and assess whether
   mammal species richness and abundance correlates positively with
   productivity. Further, we assess whether the diversity-productivity
   relationship is influenced by the species' body mass (<1 kg: small, and
   >1 kg: large, and mixed small and large), the vertical strata explored
   by the species (terrestrial, arboreal, and mixed terrestrial and
   arboreal species), and the species' feeding guild (herbivore, omnivore,
   insectivore, and mixed feeding guilds). In total, 53 studies fitted the
   eligibility criteria worldwide, comprising 285 different effect sizes
   representing the magnitude of the mammal diversity-productivity
   relationship in six biogeographical realms. Ecosystem productivity was
   quantified with various surrogate variables, such as soil nutrients,
   annual rainfall, above-ground production, evapotranspiration, net
   primary production, plant cover, and elevation. The relationships
   between productivity measures and both mammal species richness and
   abundance were significant and positive. Mammal diversity correlated
   positively with ecosystem productivity, for mammal species differing in
   body mass, the vertical strata explored by species (except arboreal
   mammals), and feeding guilds (except insectivorous mammals). Overall,
   this result supports the view that diversity in the entire mammal
   community is positively related to increasing productivity. Sites with
   greater ecosystem productivity are usually associated with more
   resources and higher ecosystem carrying capacity, which provide greater
   resilience to human disturbance than less productive sites. Thus,
   quantifying productivity can help researchers to identify critical areas
   for restoration and to propose effective guidelines for mammal
   conservation.},

Title = {Limitations and gaps in global bat wing morphology trait data},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Species' life-history traits have a wide variety of applications in
   ecological and conservation research, particularly when assessing
   threats. The development and growth of global species' trait databases
   are critical for improving trait-based analyses; however, it is vital to
   understand the gaps and biases in the available data. We reviewed bat
   wing morphology data, specifically mass, wingspan, wing area, wing
   loading, and aspect ratio, to identify issues with data reporting and
   ambiguity. Additionally, we aimed to assess taxonomic and geographic
   biases in trait data coverage. We found that most studies used similar
   field methodology, but that data reporting and quality were
   inconsistent/poor. Additionally, we noted several issues regarding
   semantic ambiguity in trait definitions, specifically around what
   constitutes wing area. Globally, we found that bat wing morphology trait
   coverage was low. Only six bat families had >= 40\% trait coverage, and,
   of those, none consisted of more than 11 species in total. We found
   similar biases in trait coverage across International Union for
   Conservation of Nature Red List categories, with threatened species
   having lower coverage. Geographically, North America, Europe, and the
   Indomalayan regions exhibited higher overall trait coverage, while both
   the Afrotropical and Neotropical ecoregions showed poor trait coverage.
   The underlying biases and gaps in bat wing morphology data have
   implications for researchers conducting global trait-based assessments.
   Implementing imputation techniques may address missing data, but only
   for smaller regional subsets with substantial trait coverage. Due to
   generally low overall trait coverage, increasing species' representation
   in the database should be prioritised. We suggest adopting an Ecological
   Trait Standard Vocabulary to reduce semantic ambiguity in bat wing
   morphology traits, to improve data compilation and clarity.
   Additionally, we advocate that researchers adopt an Open Science
   approach to facilitate the growth of a bat wing morphology trait
   database.},

Title = {16S rRNA gene sequences of Candidatus Methylumidiphilus
   (Methylococcales), a putative methanotrophic genus in lakes and ponds},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {25-30},
Abstract = {A putative novel methanotrophic genus, Candidatus Methylumidiphilus
   (Methylococcales), was recently shown to be ubiquitous and one of the
   most abundant methanotrophic genera in water columns of
   oxygen-stratified lakes and ponds in boreal and subarctic areas.
   However, it has probably escaped detection in many previous studies that
   used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing due to insufficient database
   coverage, as previously analysed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
   affiliated with Ca. Methylumidiphilus do not contain 16S rRNA genes.
   Therefore, we screened MAGs affiliated with the genus for their 16S rRNA
   gene sequences in a recently published lake and pond MAG data set. Among
   66 MAGs classified as Ca. Methylumidiphilus (with completeness over 40\%
   and contamination less than 5 \%) originating from lakes in Finland,
   Sweden and Switzerland as well as from ponds in Canada, we found 5 MAGs,
   each containing one 1532 bp sequence spanning the V1-V9 regions of the
   16S rRNA gene. After removal of sequence redundancy, this resulted in 2
   unique 16S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences represented 2 different
   putative species: Ca. Methylumidiphilus alinenensis (GenBank accession
   OK236221) and another unnamed species of Ca. Methylumidiphilus (GenBank
   accession OK236220). We suggest that including these 2 sequences in
   reference databases will enhance 16S rRNA gene-based detection of
   members of this genus from environmental samples.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {19-24},
Abstract = {The pteropod (pelagic snail) Limacina helicina antarctica is a dominant
   grazer along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and plays an
   important role in regional food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling.
   For the first time, we examined the gut microbiome and feeding ecology
   of L. h. antarctica based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences of gut
   contents in the WAP during austral summer. Eukaryotic gut contents of L.
   h. antarctica indicate that this species predominantly feeds on diatoms
   and dinoflagellates, supplementing its diet with ciliates and
   foraminifera. Mollicutes bacteria were a consistent component of the gut
   microbiome. Determining the gut microbiome and feeding ecology of L. h.
   antarctica aids in identifying the underlying mechanisms controlling
   pteropod abundance and distribution in a region of rapid environmental
   change.},

Title = {Uncovering cryptochrome/photolyase gene diversity in aquatic microbiomes
   exposed to diverse UV-B regimes},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {141-154},
Abstract = {During evolution, microorganisms exposed to high amounts of UV-B
   irradiation developed fine-tuned photo-enzymes called `photolyases' to
   cope with DNA damage caused by UV-B. These photoreceptors, belonging to
   the cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF), have been well characterized
   at the genomic and proteomic level in bacteria isolated from a wide
   range of environments. In this work, we go further towards studying the
   abundance of CPF in aquatic microbial communities from different
   geographic regions across the globe. Metagenomics data combined with
   geo-referenced solar irradiation measurements indicated that the higher
   the UVB level in the microbiome's environment, the higher the abundance
   of CPF genes and lower the microbial diversity. A connection between CPF
   abundance and radiation intensity/photoperiod was found. Likewise,
   cryptochrome-like genes were found to be abundant in most exposed
   microbiomes, indicating a complementary role to standard photolyases. We
   observed that CPFs are more likely to be present in dominant taxa of the
   highly irradiated microbiomes, suggesting an evolutionary force for
   survival and dominance under extreme solar exposure. This work reports 3
   novel CPF clades, proving the potential of global metagenomic analyses
   in detecting novel proteins.},

Title = {P-limitation drives changes in DOM production by aquatic bacteria},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {35-46},
Abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria are key biogeochemical regulators in freshwater
   systems. Through both decomposition and production of organic matter,
   bacteria link multiple biogeochemical cycles together. While there has
   been a significant amount of work done on understanding the role of
   microbes in the aquatic carbon cycle, important linkages with other
   biogeochemical cycles will require more information about how organic
   matter transformations impact other nutrients, such as phosphorus. In
   this study, we conducted a culture-based laboratory experiment to
   examine the production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by
   heterotrophic bacteria under varied nutrient conditions. In addition to
   quantifying the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), we also
   measured the production of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and
   characterized the microbially produced organic matter using optical
   properties. Results demonstrated that measurable amounts of DOC and DOP
   were produced by heterotrophic bacteria under nutrient regimes ranging
   from carbon-limitation to strong phosphorus-limitation. Additionally,
   optical characterization of DOM revealed that the organic matter
   produced by bacteria grown under high phosphorus conditions was highly
   aromatic with similar optical properties to terrestrially derived
   organic matter. Overall, these findings suggest that heterotrophic
   bacteria can be important producers of organic matter in freshwaters and
   that continued trends of increased nutrient concentrations
   (eutrophication) may fundamentally change the composition of microbially
   produced organic matter in freshwater systems.},

Title = {A comprehensive overview of the genetic diversity in Thylamys elegans
   (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae): establishing the phylogeographic
   determinants},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},

Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Background For the genus Thylamys, the rivers have been reported as
   barriers to dispersal, limiting current and historical distribution of
   its lineages. We hypothesized that the Maipo river has affected the
   genetic structure of northern and southern lineages of Thylamys elegans,
   recovering a phylogenetic relationships with reciprocally monophyletic
   sister groups on opposite river banks. We evaluated the role of other
   rivers in the Mediterranean zone of Chile as historical and recent
   modulators of the biogeographic processes of this species. Methods We
   applied a phylogeographic approach, using the cytochrome-b mitochondrial
   gene for 93 individuals of T. elegans, from 37 localities in a
   latitudinal gradient between 21 degrees 25' and 3556'S, encompassing a
   geographic area between the Atacama Desert and most of the Mediterranean
   Chilean zone. Results The phylogenetics results recovered six lineages
   within T. elegans: Thylamys elegans elegans, Thylamys elegans
   coquimbensis, the Loa lineage and three other lineages not described
   previously (Aconcagua, South 1 and South 2). We suggest that following
   rivers play a role like primary barrier: the Maipo river in the genetic
   differentiation of northern and southern ancestral lineages, and the
   Mataquito river and its tributary Teno river for the South 1 and South 2
   lineages. On the other hand, the Quilimari river preserve the genetic
   divergence in T. e. coquimbensis and Aconcagua lineage and the Aconcagua
   river in Aconcagua lineage and T. e. elegans acting like secondary
   barriers. Conclusions We concluded that the genetic diversity and
   biogeographic history of T. elegans was shaped by mountain glaciers,
   changes in river water levels during the Pleistocene glaciations and
   hyperaridity, promoting the differentiation and persistance of the T.

Title = {Extracellular enzyme activity of model cold-adapted bacteria and Arctic
   sea-ice microbial communities under subzero hypersaline conditions},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {99-111},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Bacterially produced extracellular enzymes (EEs) play an important role
   in the cycling of organic matter in the marine environment, breaking
   down large compounds to those small enough to be transported across the
   cell membrane. EEs may play an especially important role within the
   brines of sea ice, as freezing concentrates both bacteria and organic
   materials into brine pockets, leading to higher encounter rates between
   EEs and their substrates. However, whether EEs are able to perform under
   the extreme conditions of sea-ice brines, particularly during winter, is
   unknown. Here, we characterized EE activity (EEA) of leucine
   aminopeptidase produced by the psychrophilic bacterium Colwellia
   psychrerythraea strain 34H and the cold-tolerant Psychrobacter strain
   7E, under analogue sea-ice conditions using a standard
   fluorescence-based activity assay. EEs produced by the psychrophile were
   active at the most extreme conditions tested, i.e. temperature of -8
   degrees C and salt concentration of 120 ppt, with activity enhanced if
   the EEs concerned were produced under subzero hypersaline conditions.
   EEs produced by the Psychrobacter strain were less cold- and
   salt-active. When high-latitude Arctic samples of sea-ice brine,
   under-ice water, and the sea-surface microlayer were analyzed using the
   same assay after a freeze-thaw cycle, EEA was highest in the sea-ice
   samples, with activity at -10 degrees C and salinity of 142 ppt.
   Overall, these results indicate that EEA can contribute to the
   degradation of organic material in sea ice through winter, likely
   sustaining microbial communities in brine pores in the process and
   altering the nature of organic material released at spring melt.},

Title = {Fungal communities of submerged fine detritus from temperate peatland
   and stream habitats},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {191-207},
Abstract = {Fungi are essential in aquatic ecosystems, transforming organic matter
   into energy sources that support higher trophic levels. However,
   researchers do not yet know the extent of fungal diversity and species
   distribution within these important ecosystems. Therefore, we examined
   the detrital fungal communities from contrasting aquatic habitats
   (temperate peatlands and streams) to provide an in-depth inventory and
   greater understanding of how these communities differ. Fine submerged
   detritus or substrate on or beneath the stream bed were collected from 6
   sites. Fungal cultures were isolated from samples collected in May,
   July/August, and November from 2 sites in 2014 and 4 sites in 2016.
   Culture-independent analyses were conducted on 42 environmental samples
   collected in November 2016. Results indicated that peatland and stream
   fungal communities were taxonomically diverse, phylogenetically
   distinct, and harbored many unknown taxa from the kingdom Fungi.
   Specifically, stream habitats were more species-rich, in both number of
   species and phylogenetic diversity, compared to peatland habitats. In
   addition, fungal species and phylogenetic distribution within most major
   fungal classes were distinct between peatland and stream fungal
   communities. In light of global climate change, habitat loss, and water
   pollution, it has become increasingly important to examine these
   understudied and essential fungal communities within these ecosystems.},

Title = {The impact of protected areas on poverty: evidence from Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate the causal relationship between protected
   areas and poverty in Chile from 1982 to 2002. Chile is part of the
   coalition of countries committed to protecting 30\% of the planet by
   2030; a decision that implies increasing the number of protected areas
   in the country. As a result of this decision, grows the national debate
   about the potential impacts of protected areas on the economy and
   society. By estimating the causal effect of protected areas on poverty,
   we aim to contribute to this debate in Chile. We use panel data and a
   quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect. We find that
   establishing a protected area covering at least 17\% of a unit's
   terrestrial area causes a reduction of 0.216 standard deviations in the
   poverty index. This result is not sensitive to arbitrary implementation
   choices. Additionally, we show that the effect is driven by the
   Patagonia region, the part of Chile with the largest amount of new
   protected areas during the time frame of this study. Besides showing the
   benefits of protected areas to society, we hope the findings presented
   here might also be used to attract new investments and financial support
   to protected areas currently underfunded in Chile.},

Title = {Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a
   Patagonian channel used intensely by aquaculture: the influence of a
   geomorphological constriction},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},

Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food
   production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms
   through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly
   understood. A better understanding of the relationship between
   zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in
   Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability
   of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the
   Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of
   two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a
   geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture
   farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12
   h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background
   of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial
   dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities
   and in water column variables were identified between the two sections
   of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we
   found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species
   richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between
   sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward
   asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified
   in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time
   periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition
   were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time
   scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the
   asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier
   favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic
   variables between the two sections of the channel.},

Title = {Comparative transcriptomics of a monocotyledonous geophyte reveals
   shared molecular mechanisms of underground storage organ formation},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {23},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many species from across the vascular plant tree-of-life have modified
   standard plant tissues into tubers, bulbs, corms, and other underground
   storage organs (USOs), unique innovations which allow these plants to
   retreat underground. Our ability to understand the developmental and
   evolutionary forces that shape these morphologies is limited by a lack
   of studies on certain USOs and plant clades. We take a comparative
   transcriptomics approach to characterizing the molecular mechanisms of
   tuberous root formation in Bomarea multiflora (Alstroemeriaceae) and
   compare these mechanisms to those identified in other USOs across
   diverse plant lineages; B. multiflora fills a key gap in our
   understanding of USO molecular development as the first monocot with
   tuberous roots to be the focus of this kind of research. We sequenced
   transcriptomes from the growing tip of four tissue types (aerial shoot,
   rhizome, fibrous root, and root tuber) of three individuals of B.
   multiflora. We identified differentially expressed isoforms between
   tuberous and non-tuberous roots and tested the expression of a priori
   candidate genes implicated in underground storage in other taxa. We
   identify 271 genes that are differentially expressed in root tubers
   versus non-tuberous roots, including genes implicated in cell wall
   modification, defense response, and starch biosynthesis. We also
   identify a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, which has been
   implicated in tuberization signalling in other taxa and, through
   gene-tree analysis, place this copy in a phylogenetic context. These
   findings suggest that some similar molecular processes underlie the
   formation of USOs across flowering plants despite the long evolutionary
   distances among taxa and non-homologous morphologies (e.g., bulbs vs.
   tubers). (Plant development, tuberous roots, comparative
   transcriptomics, geophytes).},

Title = {Phytosociological study of fringe communities of Sardinia (Italy)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-139},
Abstract = {Question: This study represents the first contribution to the
   description and ecological characterization of fringe communities of
   Sardinia (Italy), and aimed: 1) to describe Sardinian fringe communities
   from a floristic vegetational point ; 2) to provide a syntaxonomic
   scheme, confirming or not the applicability of the most recent
   framework, proposed at the European scale, also in a Mediterranean
   insular context (Sardinia); 3) to verify if there is a correspondence
   among fringe communities and potential natural vegetation in the study
   area. Study area: Sardinia, the second largest island of the
   Mediterranean basin (Italy). Methods: 65 phytosociological plots
   realized using the Braun-Blanquet approach; for each of them,
   bioclimatic indices were derived from the available Bioclimatic map of
   Sardinia; Raunki??r life-forms were considered as species functional
   traits. Furthermore, by using Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs) we
   calculated for each relev?? an abundance-weighted mean indicator value.
   Main vegetation types were identified through a Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis (HCA) and NMDS ordination. A permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance was used to test the overall significance in EIVs
   distribution differences among the clusters obtained from HCA. Results:
   we found a total amount of 139 vascular plant species. Hierarchical
   clustering detected the presence of seven interpretable clusters, well
   differentiated in terms of floristic composition, geographic
   distribution, bioclimatic characters and EIVs, and in terms of their
   inclusion in different vegetation series. Conclusions: we describe 5 new
   associations, four of them included in the new alliance Digitalido
   purpureae-Pteridion aquilini (Melampyro-Holcetalia mollis order,
   Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinei class), clearly differentiated with
   respect to other alliances described from both the eastern and the
   western side of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another new association was referred
   to the Epilobietea angustifolii class (Galio-Alliarietalia order).},

Title = {The social system of the lava lizard, Microlophus atacamensis: the
   interplay between social structure and social organization},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background Animal social systems can be described through four main
   components: social structure, social organization, mating system, and
   care system. Social structure describes the relationships between
   individuals in a population, while social organization describes the
   group composition, size, and spatiotemporal variation of a population.
   We use the frameworks of social structure and social organization to
   study the social system of Microlophus atacamensis, a lizard found in
   the rocky intertidal zone along the Chilean coast. The area M.
   atacamensis inhabits poses specific challenges stemming from their use
   of two distinct habitat types in the intertidal zone: they forage in the
   cool areas near the water's edge and use large rocks in more inland
   areas for basking and refuge. Methods Our assessment of their social
   system focused on two separate populations: one to characterize social
   structure by means of focal observations and social network analysis,
   and a second to assess social organization via home range and core area
   analyses. Further, we examined the social system in two habitat types
   that comprise the intertidal zone: cobble fields and interspersed large
   rocks. Results Social network analysis revealed an interconnected
   network with a few highly central individuals. Body size influenced the
   outcomes of aggressive interactions, with interactions being more common
   in cobble fields where males had more associates and more repeated
   interactions than females. Spatial analyses revealed that the social
   organization of M. atacamensis is characterized by (1) high home range
   overlap, specifically in the cobble fields and (2) relatively exclusive
   core areas dispersed across both habitat types. Conclusion A social
   system is composed of both cooperative and competitive behaviors. While
   our study focused on competitive interactions, the extent and influence
   of cooperative behaviors is still unclear and merits future research. We
   suggest that M. atacamensis has a variable social system in which
   territoriality on large rocks affects access to stationary resources in
   that habitat (e.g., basking sites and refuges), while competition in the
   cobble fields could lay the foundation for a system of dominance
   relationships controlling access to variable food resources in cobble
   field areas of the intertidal zone.},

   bloom-forming diatoms},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on riverine
   phytoplankton dynamics is challenging, particularly as anthropogenic
   stressors such as eutrophication, invasive species, and climate change
   alter these relationships. We examined a 14 yr (January 2005 to December
   2018) dataset of phytoplankton and water quality variables, along with
   zooplankton and nutrient concentrations, from the Columbia River (the
   largest river in the US Pacific Northwest) to identify seasonal and
   interannual patterns of phytoplankton assemblage structure and their
   environmental associations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling,
   cluster, and indicator species analyses revealed: (1) a
   diatom/flagellate cluster in spring/summer, associated with chlorophyll
   a, discharge, ciliates, and Sarcodina; (2) a cyanobacteria/chlorophyte
   cluster in late summer/early fall, associated with higher water
   temperatures, increased clarity, the invasive copepod Pseudodiaptomus
   forbesi, and veligers of the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea; and
   (3) a mixed-taxa winter cluster of minimal abundance and biomass.
   Nutrients were not strongly associated with the observed structural
   patterns. Phytoplankton bloom duration varied interannually, between
   years with short springtime blooms vs. years when blooms extended across
   multiple months. Springtime blooms of the diatom Asterionella formosa
   decreased in recent years, giving way to blooms of a mixed diatom
   assemblage. Further, high temperature, low discharge, and more invasive
   zooplankton were associated with cyanobacterial blooms, suggesting that
   increased temperature and reduced river flows predicted due to climate
   change in the Pacific Northwest may lead to further impacts on the late
   summer/early fall Columbia River plankton community.},

Title = {Composition and temporal dynamics of sand-dwelling dinoflagellate
   communities from three Mediterranean beaches},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {85-98},
Abstract = {Compared to plankton, benthic communities are thought to be
   heterogeneous among sites and more stable through time; however, benthic
   protists in general, and sand-dwelling dinoflagellates in particular,
   have been scarcely studied, and their diversity remains mostly unknown.
   To test those claims, we studied the diversity, structure and temporal
   dynamics of benthic dinoflagellate communities in sandy sediments
   obtained from 3 NW Mediterranean Sea coastal locations during temperate
   spring and warm summer months. After separating protist cells from the
   substrate using the seawater-ice method, high-throughput amplicon
   sequencing of the V4 18S rRNA gene region followed by the analysis of
   amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) showed similar richness,
   alpha-diversity, and community composition among sand-dwelling
   dinoflagellates at the 3 locations. Dinoflagellates affiliating with the
   Thoracosphaeraceae or Gymnodiniales sensu stricto were highly
   represented. In contrast, other well-known dinoflagellate taxa, such as
   Gonyaulacales or Dinophysales, were poorly represented or absent.
   Dinoflagellate communities showed significant differences between the 2
   studied seasons, mainly driven by water temperature. Samples from
   temperate months had higher diversity and were more dissimilar, while
   samples from warmer months showed lower diversity and higher similarity.
   Some species were always present in the community, others only appeared
   sporadically, and some others showed clear differences between seasons.
   Our results suggest that large-scale changes (pointing to seasonality)
   prevail over spatial heterogeneity in shaping community composition. The
   3 studied locations had a similar dinoflagellate community composed of
   sand-dwelling taxa, with many representatives of undescribed species,
   highlighting the need to further study the diversity of the benthic
   compartment.},

Title = {Six new variants of the Terminalia cloud forest in the Dhofar Mountains
   of Oman},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {313-327},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: The Terminalia cloud forest is endemic to a 200 km
   stretch of coastal mountains in southern Arabia. This research aims to
   describe patterns of variation in the species composition of the
   Terminalia forest in Dhofar, Oman and examine causal environmental
   factors. Study area: The Jabal Qamar mountain range, Dhofar, Oman.
   Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis
   were used to identify and describe variants of the Terminalia forest.
   Topoclimatic factors, vegetation characteristics and disturbance factors
   were compared between the variants using ordination and ANOVA or
   Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Six new variants of the Terminalia forest
   are described. These are the Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia
   shrubland variant, Cadia purpurea-Olea europaea forest variant, Euclea
   racemosa-Jasminum grandiflorum shrubland variant, Gymnosporia
   dhofarensis-Ficus sycomorus woodland variant, Jatropha
   dhofarica-Zygocarpum dhofarense sparse woodland variant and the Premna
   resinosa-Hybanthus durus forest variant. A seventh variant was
   identified, which was previously described by Kurschner et al. (2004);
   the broad-leaved Blepharispermum hirtum shrubland. The species
   composition and environmental conditions indicate that two variants are
   the result of anthropogenic disturbance, whilst the other variants are
   well separated along fog density and topographic position gradients.
   Conclusions: Distinct variants of the Terminalia forest in Jabal Qamar
   result from spatial variability in environmental conditions associated
   with the complex topography, monsoon fog distributions, and
   anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study could assist
   practitioners to rapidly identify and prioritise these variants for
   conservation.},

Title = {Non-random patterns of chytrid infections on phytoplankton host cells:
   mathematical and chemical ecology approaches},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Host-parasite interactions between phytoplankton and fungi (chytrids)
   are key processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, individual-level
   heterogeneity in these interactions remains unexplored, although its
   importance in predicting the spread of diseases has been demonstrated in
   epidemiology. In this study, we experimentally tested whether
   individual-level heterogeneity could be a good indicator of
   phytoplankton-chytrid interactions, using a freshwater green alga
   Staurastrum sp., the diatoms Ulnaria sp. and Fragilaria crotonensis, and
   chytrid fungi. The number of attached fungi per host cell showed a
   non-random clumped parasite distribution on Ulnaria sp. and F.
   crotonensis, but a random Poisson distribution on Staurastrum sp. To
   explore the potential mechanisms of these patterns, we developed a
   mathematical model describing sequential encounters between chytrid
   zoospores and host cells. The statistical fits of the model explained
   the parasite distributions for Ulnaria sp. and F. crotonensis well,
   indicating that the clumped parasite distributions may result from an
   infection rate, increasing with the number of infections that already
   occurred on each host cell. Simultaneous analysis of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) from uninfected and infected host populations revealed
   that, among 13 VOCs detected, 6 components characterized the differences
   in VOC compositions between species and infection status. In particular,
   the level of beta-ionone, potentially acting against fungal activities,
   was significantly reduced in the presence of chytrid infection of
   Staurastrum sp. These VOCs are targets for future studies, which
   potentially act as chemical signals influencing chytrid zoospores'
   behaviors. The combination of mathematical and chemical analyses
   represents a promising approach to better understand the
   individual-level processes of phytoplankton-chytrid interactions.},

Pages = {137-154},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {DELLA proteins are master growth regulators that repress responses to a
   group of plant growth hormones called gibberellins (GAs). Manipulation
   of DELLA function and signaling was instrumental in the development of
   high-yielding crop varieties that saved millions from starvation during
   the ``Green Revolution.{''} Despite decades of extensive research, it is
   still unclear how DELLA function and signaling mechanisms evolved within
   the land plant lineage. Here, we review current knowledge on DELLA
   protein function with reference to structure, posttranslational
   modifications, downstream transcriptional targets, and protein-protein
   interactions. Furthermore, we discuss older and recent findings
   regarding the evolution of DELLA signaling within the land plant
   lineage, with an emphasis on bryophytes, and identify future avenues of
   research that would enable us to shed more light on the evolution of
   DELLA signaling. Unraveling how DELLA function and signaling mechanisms
   have evolved could enable us to engineer better crops in an attempt to
   contribute to mitigating the effects of global warming and achieving
   global food security.},

Title = {A global review of the conservation threats and status of mustelids},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {410-424},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The family Mustelidae is the largest among the order Carnivora. While we
   know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of
   information about many mustelids. We first investigated the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
   species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook
   a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of
   identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which
   species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as ``the
   proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are
   impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon{''}. We analysed 1003
   published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication,
   geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and
   subthreats identified. The majority of species (62\%) were classified as
   Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found
   to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The
   species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72\% of
   studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few
   species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the
   tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting,
   fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by
   the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the
   proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The
   nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between
   species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus
   towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of
   threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate
   change must also be central to prevent declines.},

Title = {Using citizen science to understand and map habitat suitability for a
   synurbic mammal in an urban landscape: the hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urban environments are important for west European hedgehogs Erinaceus
   europaeus. The species has been recorded in 73\% of large urban areas
   throughout its geographic range. However, the environmental
   relationships determining hedgehog distribution within these landscapes
   are not well understood. Taking a city-wide perspective, this study
   identifies hedgehogs' habitat relationships with urban environmental
   characteristics and predicts habitat suitability in a major urban
   centre, Greater London, UK. We use a collated citizen science dataset of
   3012 hedgehog occurrence records from Greater London, and pseudoabsences
   inferred from other mammal taxa, to construct a multiscale generalised
   linear model identifying the influence of 10 variables representing
   urban greenspace, built infrastructure, and the presence of the European
   badger Meles meles (as a predator or competitor) on hedgehog
   distribution. We find a positive association of hedgehog presence with
   availability of gardens, parks, allotments, percentage of terraced
   housing, traffic, and intermediate impervious cover (roads and
   buildings, peaking at 31\%). High impervious cover, woodland, water,
   human densities (above 2262 people km(-2)), and badger presence were
   negatively related to hedgehog presence. Predicted habitat suitability
   was high across much of Greater London but declined towards the centre
   and in some locations around the outskirts of the study region. Our
   results emphasise the importance of public and private greenspaces for
   urban hedgehogs, and suggest that loss of garden, park, and allotment
   habitats and disturbance associated with high human densities may
   restrict hedgehog distribution. Despite the inherent complexity of urban
   environments, this study shows that citizen science is useful for
   developing an understanding of large-scale species-habitat relationships
   in diverse urban landscapes.},

Title = {Phytosociological study of arable weed communities across small scale
   agricultural landscape in Swaziland},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-38},
Abstract = {Aims: Using a multi-criteria evaluation comprised of fidelity, cluster,
   and additive partitioning analyses, this work described the composition
   and diversity of arable weed communities in five agro-ecological regions
   of Swaziland. Spatial scales at which diversity components (a, and y)
   were most relevant in describing weed vegetation were studied. Study
   area: Swaziland. Methods: The data set for analyses was obtained using
   both multi-stage systematic and random sampling of 117 small scale
   farmers' fields. The affinities of 40 weed species identified in the
   study to different zones were determined using phi coefficient of
   association, a statistically defined measure of fidelity. Agglomerative
   hierarchical cluster analysis was based on standardized species ranks
   from a consensus of phi, indicator value index, and relative abundance
   index. The Euclidean distance measure and Ward's method for group
   linkage were used to yield cluster solutions for each region. Species
   diversity was expressed as the proportional contribution to diversity at
   three scale levels, i.e. plot, field, and region, using the hierarchical
   additive partitioning approach. Results: Eighteen species were
   diagnostic to particular regions amongst which only two species appeared
   in two contiguous regions to which they were characteristic. The weed
   vegetation was characterised by three to four clusters with a group of
   taxa co-occurring in the same cluster across the five regions. A major
   part of weed diversity was mainly explained by beta-diversity at
   regional scale (35.0-67.8\%) than between fields (12.0-15.0\%) or
   sampling plots (0.1-2.8\%). Diversity within fields (alpha-diversity)
   was between 5.0 and 8.2\% in the five regions. Conclusion: The nested
   approach adopted where weed species were described and enumerated
   individually, in clusters, and, at different spatial scales could inform
   subsequent work towards diversification and scale of weed management

Abstract = {The associated species to Senecio glaucus in the newly reclaimed desert
   near to Wadi El-Assiuty of the Eastern Desert at Assiut Governorate,
   Egypt were investigated over two years (2018 and 2019). The allelopathic
   potential of S. glaucus against two crop plants (Triticum aestivum and
   Eruca sativa) was also evaluated. Floristically, 65 species within 59
   genera and 22 families were recorded (21 perennials and 44 annuals).
   Four families Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae captured
   about 54\% of this flora. Therophytes are the predominant life form
   followed by phanerophytes. Chorological analysis revealed that
   cosmopolitan and Saharo-Arabian elements constitute the main bulk of the
   total flora of the studied area. Cluster analysis yielded four distinct
   groups. Stands of group A characterized by the absence of S. glaucus and
   highest species diversity. Stands of group B, C and D included the
   associated species of S. glaucus and characterized by the dominance of
   cosmopolitans, grasses and salt tolerant species. The ordination
   techniques revealed the significant difference between group A and the
   others and showed the strong correlation between its flora with organic
   matter. The other three groups were highly correlated with coarse soil
   texture and total salts. Thirteen species were absent from stands of
   groups B, C and D in which S. glaucus was dominant. Phytochemical
   analysis of S. glaucus showed the prevalence of total phenolics and
   flavonoids in its shoots, while terpenoids were the highest in its
   flowers. All fractions of the plant components completely prevented
   germination of E. sativa seeds but exerted different magnitude of
   inhibition on germination of T. aestivum caryopses (especially with
   MeOH, capitula and shoot extracts). Estimation of phytotoxicity revealed
   that aqueous, ethyl acetate and capitula extracts significantly
   inhibited the germination of wheat caryopses and reduced the elongation
   rates of hypocotyl and epicotyl, and hence the whole length of
   seedlings.},

Title = {Vegetation diversity in East African wetlands: Cocktail algorithms
   supported by a vegetation-plot database},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {199-219},
Abstract = {Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems for biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem service provisioning, yet threatened by
   degradation and conversion into croplands. Conservation and land use
   management require data on vegetation structure and dynamics. The
   presented work is a response to a lacking consistent classification of
   East African wetland vegetation. Location: Namulonge valley in Uganda
   and Kilombero floodplain in Tanzania. Methods: We sampled 431 4
   m(2)-plots along land use intensity and flooding duration gradients. A
   floristic classification using the cocktail method was performed in a
   two-step approach. We developed definitions for vegetation units, using
   plot observations from the study sites in a first step and revised them
   in a second step by adding data from a vegetation-plot database and
   complied the definitions to an expert system for classification.
   Resulting vegetation units were analyzed regarding their life form
   composition, for which we implemented a classification based on life
   span and growth form. Following a literature review, the identified
   vegetation units were assigned either to existing phytosociological
   associations or proposals. Results: We recognize eight units of marsh
   and reed vegetation (class Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea) and five units of
   weed and pioneer vegetation under semi-aquatic conditions (class
   Oryzetea sativae). Five of these associations were previously described
   in the bibliographic references. The remaining eight are newly described
   in this work. The associations contrast in their life form composition
   with the five Oryzetea sativae associations dominated by obligate
   annuals and the Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea associations dominated by
   either reed plants or lacking a dominating life form. Conclusions: The
   developed expert system enables a comparison of wetland vegetation in
   the East African region and will support vegetation science and informed
   decision making about land use management and conservation. The two-step
   approach of revising a classification developed for single wetlands with
   a database is promising for data-scarce regions.},

Title = {Influence of altitude and longitude on vegetation in the Dzungarian Gobi
   and the south-western Mongolian Altai},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {339-369},
Abstract = {Central Asia hosts grassland and desert regions that are globally
   important to nature conservation and local livelihoods. Several major
   vegetation surveys have been published on the region, with the majority
   focussing on areas within central Mongolia and north-eastern China. Much
   less information is available on plant community composition on the
   Dzungarian Basin, which forms a transitional zone between Central and
   Middle Asia in terms of flora. The Altai Mountains extend along the
   northern and eastern boundaries of the basin and introduce further
   environmental heterogeneity.
   For the present study, we assess horizontal and vertical gradients in
   plant community composition in both the Chinese and Mongolian parts of
   the Dzungarian Basin and the adjacent Altai Mountains. We show that
   steep environmental gradients trigger notable differences in plant
   community composition over relatively short distances. The study is
   based on data collected over three different sampling periods in the
   Mongolian part: In 2003, we sampled 208 plots; in 2010, 152 plots; and
   during the vegetation periods of 2012-2014, 280 plots. On the Chinese
   side, 58 samples were taken in 2013. Sample sites were deliberately
   chosen to represent relevant vegetation types, ranging from those of the
   high mountains to the lower oases. We collected biomass and mixed
   topsoil samples for soil analysis and compiled additional environmental
   data. A vegetation map was then prepared based on the supervised
   classification of remote sensing imagery.
   Our results reveal that four different main vegetation types
   (forest-steppe, steppe, desert and oasis) encompass twenty-one plant
   communities, with each type showing a clear altitudinal distribution,
   except for that at oases. Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed the
   expected close correlation between altitude and species composition and
   productivity, but it also highlighted significant differences between
   the vegetation of neighbouring mountain ranges in the Chinese and
   Mongolian Altai.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most severe threats for ecosystems
   worldwide. Lakes can be studied as indicators of climate change. The
   prokaryotic compartment of lakes is affected by climate change, and the
   metabolic processes of prokaryotes could both attenuate or exacerbate
   the negative impacts of climate change on the ecosystem. However, in
   contrast to studies on the impact of global warming on eukaryotes,
   prokaryotes have been rarely studied in the context of climate change.
   In our study, we tested the impact of short-term temperature increases
   on taxonomic and physiological bacterial diversity and their
   relationships. We conducted an experiment with different temperature
   treatments using mesocosms filled with lake water from the same water
   reservoir. We monitored physicochemical parameters for 2 wk and examined
   taxonomic diversity using Illumina next-generation sequencing and
   metabolic diversity using 31 carbon sources by the Biolog EcoPlate (R)
   method. We showed that a continuous increase in water temperature for 14
   d significantly affected the taxonomic structure of bacteria that
   inhabit lake water. Even when the water temperature was within the
   temperate zone of 26 to 29 degrees C, a slight increase in biodiversity
   in the first few days was observed, and after 14 d, the change in
   temperature drastically decreased biodiversity. In the case of
   physiological diversity, the differences were relatively small.
   Similarly, we did not find a statistically significant correlation
   between the taxonomic and physiological diversity of lake bacteria in
   the context of climate change. This may indicate redundancy of aquatic
   bacteria communities.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {185-203},
Abstract = {Microbial communities in the marine environment drive biogeochemical and
   nutrient cycles. However, microbial composition and therefore their role
   in ecosystems is likely to be strongly influenced by the environment.
   Here, we examined Macquarie Harbour, a highly stratified system on the
   west coast of Tasmania, Australia, to determine environmental factors
   driving microbial diversity. Water was sampled along spatial and
   environmental gradients to examine the structure and composition of the
   microbial communities, using high-throughput sequencing. The spatial
   distribution of the communities was found to be homogenous throughout
   the harbour's surface, although it differed from riverine and oceanic
   samples. In contrast, the distribution and composition of microbial
   communities varied with depth-related changes in salinity and oxygen.
   Prokaryotes associated with riverine and brackish waters dominated the
   oxic surface waters. Phytoplankton metabolite-related bacteria and
   nitrite oxidizers were abundant at the halocline, whereas microbes
   linked to the consumption of organic matter, nitrogen and sulphur
   metabolization inhabited the hypoxic bottom waters and may be acting as
   major players in oxygen consumption throughout the harbour's water
   column. This study provides valuable insights into microbial community
   ecology in a semi-enclosed and highly stratified environment and will
   improve our knowledge on how bacterial and archaeal distribution may be
   influenced by a changing environment.},

   analysis},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {69-84},
Abstract = {Bacterial biofilms play an important role in marine biofouling. The
   formation of a biofilm starts when marine bacterial cells transition
   from a planktonic to an attached slate. However, the molecular
   mechanisms involved in this transition are poorly understood. Here, 51
   strains of marine bacteria were isolated from natural biofilms growing
   on submerged artificial surfaces (glass slides, epoxy panels, and bridge
   pillars) and evaluated for their biofilm-forming capacity. Eleven
   strains formed relatively strong biofilms and 16S rRNA gene sequence
   analysis indicated that they belonged to the genera Leisingera,
   Roseobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, Tenacibaculum, Vibrio,
   Chryseobacterium, Aquimarina, and Acinetobacter. Strain
   Pseudoalteromonas sp. W-7 showed efficient and rapid attachment and was
   therefore chosen for further study. An iTRAQ-based comparative proteomic
   analysis of planktonic and attached strain W-7 cells was carried out. A
   total of 3468 proteins were identified, of which 163 showed significant
   differential expression (120 down-regulated and 43 up-regulated in
   attached cells relative to planktonic cells). KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia
   of genes and genomes) analysis indicated that pyruvate metabolism,
   carbon fixation, and carbon metabolism were significantly affected in
   attached cells. Upregulated proteins such as UTP-glucose-1-phosphate
   uridylyltransferase, acetyltransferase component of pyruvate
   dehydrogenase complex, OmpA-like protein, and acetyl-coenzyme A
   synthetase may be important during initial adhesion. Our findings
   provide a deeper understanding of the planktonic to sessile transition
   of marine fouling bacteria.},

Title = {Distinct processes structure bacterioplankton and protist communities
   across an oceanic front},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {19-34},
Abstract = {Bacterioplankton and protists fulfil key roles in marine ecosystems.
   Understanding the abundance and distribution of these organisms through
   space and time is a central focus of biological oceanographers. The role
   of oceanographic features, in addition to environmental conditions, in
   structuring bacterioplankton and protist communities has been
   increasingly recognised. We investigated patterns in bacterioplankton
   and protist diversity and community structure across the Southland Front
   system, a compaction of the subtropical front zone, to the east of New
   Zealand's South Island. We collected 24 seawater samples across a
   similar to 65 km transect and characterised bacterioplankton and protist
   community composition using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and
   18S rRNA genes, respectively. We identified frontal waters as a
   bacterioplankton diversity hotspot relative to neighbouring subtropical
   and subantarctic waters, but did not find evidence of this effect in
   protists. Bacterioplankton showed pronounced spatial structuring across
   the front, with communities closely tracking water type through the
   region. Protist communities also tracked water type through the region,
   though this effect was substantially less pronounced. We used an
   ecological null model approach to demonstrate that protist communities
   are primarily assembled through stochastic processes, whilst
   bacterioplankton are primarily assembled through deterministic processes
   across the Southland Front system. We suggest that this divergence
   emerges from fundamental differences in the characteristics of
   bacterioplankton and protist communities. Our findings add to a growing
   body of literature highlighting the importance of oceanographic features
   in shaping bacterioplankton and protist communities, promoting the
   necessity for such features to be considered more explicitly in the
   future.},

Title = {Scree vegetation in the northern Apennines (N-Italy)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-94},
Abstract = {Aims: This paper presents the results of phytosociological research on
   scree vegetation in the northern Apennines with the aim of comparing
   vegetation types classified in different syntaxa. The specific
   objectives were: 1) to identify, classify and describe the vegetation
   units of scree communities; 2) to pinpoint the main ecological gradients
   underlying different vegetation units; and 3) to identify a possible
   hierarchy of predictor variables explaining floristic differences
   between vegetation types. Study area: The study area lies on the
   northern border of the Italian Peninsula, between 44 degrees and 44
   degrees 45' N and 9 degrees 20' and 10 degrees 45' E, characterized by a
   large variety of scree habitats and representing both a centre of
   endemism and a phytogeographic transition zone between the Alps and
   Apennines. Methods: The study was based on a dataset including 364
   releves taken according to the Braun-Blanquet method, which were then
   classified following an unsupervised numerical procedure. Species
   fidelity was used to define the diagnostic species of the associations.
   PCA and RDA ordinations were employed to perform ecological analyses
   using both Ellenberg Indicator Values as indirect variables and directly
   measured or calculated variables. Results: A total of 15 plant
   associations were identified, belonging to 6 alliances and 4 different
   orders (Thlaspietalia rotundifolii, Arabido alpinae-Petasitetalia
   paradoxi, Achnatheretalia calamagrostis and Androsacetalia alpinae)
   within the class Thlaspietea rotundifolii. All associations were
   described according to their floristic composition, structure,
   syntaxonomy, habitat and distribution. Conclusions: Nine scree
   associations and two alliances - endemic to the study area - are
   described here for the first time. The syntaxonomic scheme followed is
   in accordance with that proposed in the EuroVegChecklist, with a few
   important exceptions. The largest variation in vegetation types was
   found along complex environmental gradients and the most important
   factors driving the difference between the four orders were gravel size,
   elevation and the geological substrate.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {151-166},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mesoscale eddies in oxygen minimum zones profoundly affect the structure
   and productivity of marine planktonic communities and alter key
   biogeochemical cycles. The influence of a mesoscale cyclonic eddy on the
   spatial distribution of bacterioplankton was investigated in a
   semi-enclosed, oxygen-depleted basin in the Gulf of California, Mexico.
   Most of the bacterial taxa showed a strong vertical distribution from
   oxygen-rich surface waters to anoxic bottom waters, but also a
   horizontal distribution pattern in the upper ocean associated with the
   eddy presence. Synechococcocales, Flavobacteriales, SAR86, and
   Actinomarinales were abundant in the euphotic zone within the Gulf of
   California water mass, whereas SAR324, SAR406, SAR202, SUP05,
   Arctic97B-4, and Thioglobaceae dominated the bottom layer of this basin
   within the Subtropical Subsurface water mass. In contrast, bacterial
   taxa with a preference for mesopelagic waters (Thiomicrospirales,
   SAR324, SAR202, HOC36, UBA10353 marine group, and Nitrospinales)
   dominated surface waters of the eddy center where common surface taxa
   (Synechococcus, SAR86, and Actinomarinales) were scarce. These changes
   in community composition led to a distinct diversity of bacterioplankton
   between the center and edges of the eddy within the euphotic zone. These
   results show the strong role of oxygen and water masses in controlling
   the vertical distribution of bacterioplankton, whereas the eddy more
   strongly modifies the bacterial assemblage in the upper ocean.},

Title = {A phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) is present and
   expressed in Micromonas pusilla and other marine algae},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {29-46},
Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) limits primary production in regions of the surface
   ocean, and many plankton species exhibit specific physiological
   responses to P deficiency. The metabolic response of Micromonas pusilla,
   an ecologically relevant marine photoautotroph, to P deficiency was
   investigated using metabolomics and comparative genomics. The
   concentrations of some intracellular metabolites were elevated in the
   P-deficient cells (e.g. xanthine, inosine), and genes involved in the
   associated metabolic pathways shared a predicted conserved amino acid
   motif in the non-coding regions of each gene. The presence of the
   conserved motif suggests that these genes may be co-regulated, and the
   motif may constitute a regulatory element for binding a transcription
   factor, specifically that of Psr1 (phosphate starvation response). A
   putative phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) was identified
   in M. pusilla with homology to well characterized psr1/phr1 genes in
   algae and plants, respectively. This gene appears to be present and
   expressed in other marine algal taxa (e.g. EmiBanta huxleyi) in field
   sites that are chronically P limited. Results from the present study
   have implications for understanding phytoplankton taxon-specific roles
   in mediating P cycling in the ocean.},

   although the total relative abundance of N-cycling taxa is comparatively
   lower close to estuary inputs (Hobsons Bay {[}HB]), the capacity for
   this community to perform diverse N-cycling processes is comparatively
   higher than in sediments isolated from inputs (Central PPB {[}CPPB]). In
   HB, seasonal structuring of the sediment microbial community occurred
   between spring and summer, co-occurring with decreases in the activity
   profiles of anammox bacteria and organic carbon content. No changes were
   detected in the activity profiles of nitrifiers or the community-based
   pathway denitrification. Although no seasonal structuring of the
   sediment microbial community occurred in CPPB, the activity profiles of
   key N-cycling genes displayed comparatively higher within-site
   variability. These results show that despite N-cycling taxa representing
   a smaller fraction of the total community composition in estuary
   impacted sediments (HB) these microbial communities consistently engage
   in N-cycling processes and that seasonal instability in the composition
   of this community is not reflective of changes in its capacity to cycle
   N through coupled nitrification-denitrification but potentially via
   changes within the anammox community.},

   grassland ecosystem of South Africa},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {263-274},
Abstract = {The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is
   influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate,
   topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire
   and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant
   communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and
   determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial
   distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was
   firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and
   refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE
   programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the
   most important environmental variables influencing the spatial
   distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data
   were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid
   databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the
   remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020
   was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in
   nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis
   showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be
   significant at a 95\% confidence level and positively correlated with
   the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but
   negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710,
   p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly
   positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r <
   0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well
   as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance
   in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies
   for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and
   also to monitor vegetation change over time.},

Title = {Contribution of large bacteria to bacterial biomass in a deep freshwater
   lake (Lake Biwa, Japan)},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {131-139},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of bacterial cell volume in microbial ecology in
   aquatic environments, literature regarding the effects of seasonal and
   spatial variations on bacterial cell volume remains scarce. We used
   transmission electron microscopy to examine seasonal and spatial
   variations in bacterial cell size for 18 mo in 2 layers (epilimnion 0.5
   m and hypolimnion 60 m) of Lake Biwa, Japan, a large and deep freshwater
   lake. During the stratified period, we found that the bacterial cell
   volume in the hypolimnion ranged from 0.017 to 0.12 mu m(3) (median),
   whereas that in the epilimnion was less variable (0.016 to 0.033 mu
   m(3), median) and much lower than that in the hypolimnion. Additionally,
   in the hypolimnion, cell volume during the stratified period was greater
   than that during the mixing period (up to 5.7-fold). These differences
   in cell volume resulted in comparable bacterial biomass in the
   hypolimnion and epilimnion, despite the fact that there was lower
   bacterial abundance in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion. We also
   found that the biomass of larger bacteria, which are not likely to be
   grazed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, increased in the hypolimnion
   during the stratified period. Our data suggest that estimation of carbon
   flux (e.g. bacterial productivity) needs to be interpreted cautiously
   when cell volume is used as a constant parametric value. In deep
   freshwater lakes, a difference in cell volume with seasonal and spatial
   variation may largely affect estimations.},

Title = {Nitrate availability modulates induced defenses in Phaeocystis globosa
   against protozoan grazers},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {123-133},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Colony formation by Phaecoystis has been widely considered an induced
   defense mechanism against various grazers and contributes to the
   occurrence of algal blooms in nitrate-enriched waters. However, the
   effects of nitrate availability on these induced defenses against
   protozoan grazers remain unclear. Four P. globosa strains isolated from
   4 off-coast areas of the South China Sea were exposed to grazing cues
   associated with the ciliate Euplotes vannus and the heterotrophic
   dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina under nitrate-sufficient and
   nitrate-deficient conditions to evaluate whether nitrate availability
   modulates the expression and costs of induced defenses. Except for one
   strain exposed to ciliate cues under nitrate-deficient conditions, all
   strains expressed defensive responses to grazing cues. Colony numbers
   consistently increased in the presence of grazing cues regardless of
   nitrate availability, although the amplitude of the increase was greater
   under nitrate-deficient conditions. Negative linear relationships were
   observed between colony numbers and population growth rates for 2
   strains under nitrate-deficient conditions, suggesting increased
   energetic costs of defenses. The other 2 strains that did not exhibit
   negative relationships between colony numbers and growth nevertheless
   exhibited decreased cellular particulate organic carbon, particulate
   organic nitrogen, and chlorophyll a content in addition to smaller
   cellular diameters, suggesting that P. globosa can save energetic costs
   by adjusting physiological processes and cell sizes. These results
   suggest that nitrate availability strongly modulates the expression of
   induced grazing defenses and substantially influences the partitioning
   of cells into colonial or solitary forms in Phaeocystis, thereby also
   modulating their ecological roles in local food webs.},

Title = {Bacterioplankton composition as an indicator of environmental status:
   proof of principle using indicator value analysis of estuarine
   communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Increasing awareness of environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic
   activities highlights the need to determine indicators of environmental
   status that can be routinely assessed at large spatial and temporal
   scales. Microbial communities comprise the greatest share of biological
   diversity on Earth and can rapidly reflect recent environmental changes
   while providing a record of past events. However, they have rarely been
   targeted in the search for ecological indicators of habitat types,
   environmental conditions, or environmental changes. Here, as a proof of
   principle, we analysed the bacterioplankton community composition of 4
   estuaries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, and looked for
   indicators of groups of samples defined using partition techniques,
   according to primary physicochemical variables typically monitored to
   infer water quality. Indicator value analysis (IndVal) was conducted to
   identify indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs; analogous to
   species in other fields of ecology) in each group. These
   bacterioplankton-based indicators exhibited a high capacity to predict
   the group membership of the samples within each estuary and to correctly
   assign the samples to the appropriate estuary in a combined data set,
   employing different machine learning techniques. The indicators were
   composed of OTUs belonging to several bacterial phyla, which responded
   significantly and differentially to the environmental variables used to
   define the groups of samples. Moreover, the predictive values of these
   bacterial indicators were generally higher than those of other
   biological assemblages commonly used for environmental monitoring.
   Therefore, this approach appears to be a promising tool to complement
   existing strategies for monitoring and conservation of aquatic systems
   worldwide.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal variation of microphytobenthos biomass, diversity and
   assemblage structure in the Loire Estuary, France},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {61-77},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diatom-dominated microphytobenthos (MPB) communities of 4 intertidal
   mudflats along the meso- and polyhaline reaches of the Loire Estuary,
   France, were investigated during a year cycle. They were analysed in
   terms of biomass, diversity, species composition and growth form
   distribution. The assemblages of the 2 upstream sites were characterised
   by high biomass and lower diversities and were mostly dominated by
   epipelon. The 2 downstream, most haline sites had lower biomass and
   higher diversities and were dominated by both epipelon and
   tychoplankton. Diversity did not exhibit a clear seasonal signal in the
   upstream mudflats, but it was higher during the first half of the study
   in the downstream sites. The coexistence of 2 growth forms seems to
   increase diversity of the mudflat assemblages. Species distribution was
   mainly linked to changes in sediment texture and salinity, both with a
   marked seasonal variability. MPB biomass was inversely related to MPB
   diversity and positively related to both mud content and the epipelon.
   MPB diversity was not, however, significantly correlated with mud
   content. Slight changes in sediment texture, even if causing variations
   in assemblage composition, did not change overall diversity. The
   existence of an important and even dominant tychoplanktonic fraction
   could be considered a distinctive feature of these benthic environments
   in the Loire, as well as in other macrotidal estuaries.},

Title = {Microbial ecology of coral-dominated reefs in the Federated States of
   Micronesia},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {115-136},
Abstract = {Microorganisms are central to the functioning of coral reef ecosystems,
   but their dynamics are unstudied on most reefs. We examined the
   microbial ecology of shallow reefs within the Federated States of
   Micronesia. We surveyed 20 reefs surrounding 7 islands and atolls (Yap,
   Woleai, Olimarao, Kosrae, Kapingamarangi, Nukuoro, and Pohnpei),
   spanning 875 053 km(2). On the reefs, we found consistently higher coral
   coverage (mean +/- SD = 36.9 +/- 22.2\%; max 77 \%) compared to
   macroalgae coverage (15.2 +/- 15.5 \%; max 58 \%), and low abundances of
   fish. Reef waters had low inorganic nutrient concentrations and were
   dominated by Synechococcus, Prochiorococcus, and SAR11 bacteria. The
   richness of bacterial and archaeal communities was significantly related
   to interactions between island/atoll and depth. High coral coverage on
   reefs was linked to higher relative abundances of Flavobacteriaceae,
   Leisingera, Owenweeksia, Vibrio, and the OM27 clade, as well as other
   heterotrophic bacterial groups, consistent with communities residing in
   waters near corals and within coral mucus. Microbial community structure
   at reef depth was significantly correlated with geographic distance,
   suggesting that island biogeography influences reef microbial
   communities. Reefs at Kosrae Island, which hosted the highest coral
   abundance and diversity, were unique compared to other locations;
   seawater from Kosrae reefs had the lowest organic carbon (59.8-67.9 mu
   M), highest organic nitrogen (4.5-5.3 mu M), and harbored consistent
   microbial communities (>85\% similar), which were dominated by
   heterotrophic cells. This study suggests that the reef-water microbial
   ecology on Micronesian reefs is influenced by the density and diversity
   of corals as well as other biogeographical features.},

Title = {Syntaxonomy and ecology of mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan
   (Middle Asia)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Aims: In this paper we propose the first syntaxonomic classification for
   the mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan with some remarks on
   their environmental variability. Methods: Altogether 120 relev??s were
   sam-pled using the standard, seven-degree cover-abundance scale of
   Braun-Blanquet, in 2015???2021. They were clas-sified by the modified
   TWINSPAN method using the four step interval scale with cutoff levels of
   0\%, 2\%, 5\% and 10\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster
   heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi
   coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) was used to determine the rela-tionship between the sampled plots,
   vegetation units and major gradients in species composition. Results:
   Plant communities known so far as ??hiblyak and including xeric and
   mesophilic shrublands seral or marginal to broad-leaved forests in the
   nemoral zone of the Irano-Turanian region are described herein.
   Numerical analyses of vegetation data allowed distinguishing five
   associations representing the Ranunculo tenuilobi-Cotoneasteri-on
   hissarici alliance. The new associations include: Eremuro
   comosi-Rhuidetum coriariae, Calophacetum gran-diflorae, Fraxinetum
   raibocarpae, Pruno sogdianae-Crataegetum turkestanicae, Aflatunio
   ulmifoliae-Caraga-netum turkestanicae. For the latter association, two
   habitat variants (with Ferula clematidifolia and Malus sieversii) are
   proposed. The main factors determining the species composition of the
   studied vegetation include: elevation, mean annual temperature and sum
   of annual precipitation. Conclusions: The research results herein
   presented fill the gap in knowledge about the shrubland vegetation of
   Tajikistan. Studies in neighbouring coun-tries and a focus on subalpine
   scrubs in dry habitats are needed to complete the classification of
   shrubland vegetation of Middle Asia.},

Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Background: A team of 3 scientometrists led by John Ioannidis published
   in 2020 an extensive and updated database (ca. 6.9 million researchers
   in 22 disciplines and 176 sub-disciplines), ordering them according to a
   composite bibliometric index that measures their whole trajectory
   (career-long) impact and their annual impact at year 2019. They reported
   the top 100,000 scientists (1.45\% across all disciplinary fields) or
   the top 2\% of each subfield discipline, thus publishing the ranking of
   ca. 150,000 researchers worldwide.
   Methods and findings: We filtered that information for the disciplinary
   and sub-disciplinary areas corresponding to Ecology and identified a
   total of 14 ecologists with residence in Chile that appear in either of
   those two worldwide rankings. We report their measured productivity as
   both whole trajectory (career-long) and as annual impact at year 2019.
   We attribute their high registered productivity to their training at the
   doctoral level in prestigious foreign universities, their academic
   positions in internationally recognized Chilean universities, and their
   participation in state-funded research centers of scientific excellence.
   Exceptions to the rule are presented.
   Conclusions: The 14 ecologists identified with the scientometric
   algorithm proposed by Ioannidis and coworkers include, but are not
   restricted, to the most cited ecologists in Chile. We put forth possible
   reasons for some puzzling omissions from these rankings.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},

Pages = {63-68},
Abstract = {We analysed prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities across the seawater
   pretreatment system of Penneshaw (Kangaroo Island, South Australia)
   desalination plant, using 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing. The richness
   of operational taxonomic units increased downstream of the pre-treatment
   system (reverse osmosis feedwater) compared to raw seawater for Archaea,
   while it decreased for bacteria and protists. Overall, the reverse
   osmosis feedwater was found to be enriched in ammonia-oxidising bacteria
   and Archaea compared to raw seawater, and also contained greater
   proportions of taxa typically observed in aquatic biofilms and/or within
   other water treatment systems. Although the microbial load was reduced
   by the pre-treatment system, the increase in proportion of
   biofilm-associated microbes suggests the presence of active microbial
   communities within multimedia filters and other parts of the
   pre-treatment system that might increase biofouling risks.},

Title = {Prokaryotic community composition and structure during Phaeocystis
   globosa blooms in the Beibu Gulf, China},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {137-151},
Abstract = {Phaeocystis globosa blooms have become one of the major ecological
   issues in the Beibu Gulf, China, in recent years, resulting in a series
   of negative impacts on local fisheries and industry. While prokaryotes
   play key roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow during algal blooms,
   information regarding the response of the prokaryotic community during
   Phaeocystis blooms remains scarce. Thus, a comprehensive field study
   covering the onset and senescent phase of P. globosa blooms was
   conducted in the area from December 2016 to February 2017. The community
   composition was revealed with high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA
   gene. A total of 7426 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (97 \%
   similarity) were identified from 3 132 328 effective tags, with
   Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia,
   Euryarchaeota, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being the predominant
   taxa. The composition and structure of particle-attached (PA) and
   free-living (FL) prokaryotic communities were significantly different:
   the PA fraction was more diverse and unstable temporally compared to the
   FL fraction. Variations in the composition and structure of the
   prokaryotic community were closely associated with major environmental
   variables, particularly dissolved oxygen (DO), NH4+, PO43-, and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The presence of P. globosa may result in
   differences in the prokaryotic community; members of Rhodobacteraceae,
   Alteromonadales, Porticoccaceae, Vibrio, Flavobacteriales, and
   Verrucomicrobiae were the key taxa in the prokaryotic communities during
   the outbreak and senescent phases of P. globosa blooms. This study
   provides primary information on the response of prokaryotic communities
   during P. globosa blooms and will facilitate further study on
   biogeochemical processes of algal-derived organic matter in the tropical
   gulf.},

Title = {A study of composition and diversity variation of avifauna along with

Abstract = {Background Agroforestry is an integrated land-use system that plays a
   great role in the conservation of landscape biodiversity. The study
   aimed to assess the composition and diversity of avian species along
   with different habitat types of agroforestry in Kibet Town, Southern
   Ethiopia. Methods Four habitat types of agroforestry system which are
   home gardens, live fences, parkland, and eucalyptus woodlot were
   identified. Line transects were used for bird surveys. The Shannon
   diversity index (H `) and species evenness index (E) were used to
   compare diversity among habitat types. A similarity percentages (SIMPER)
   test was carried out to identify the main species and feeding guild that
   typified each habitat type. The overall significance was assessed with
   the ANOSIM test using PAST (version 4.03). Results A total of 50 bird
   species belonging to 28 families and 10 orders were recorded. Order
   Passeriformes (67.3\%) had the highest number of species. Bird community
   composition differed among habitat types. The dissimilarity was mainly
   due to White-browed robin-chat (Cossypha heuglini), Streaky seed-eater
   (Serinus striolatus), Village Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), African
   Paradise-Flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis), and Black-Headed Paradise
   Flycatcher (T. rufiventer). The finding also revealed that insectivore
   was the dominant feeding guild. Conclusions The present study shows
   evidence that more insectivore bird species use different types of
   agroforestry as habitat and foraging sites. So, any concerned bodies who
   have engaged in avian conservation should give special consideration to
   this modified landscape.},

Abstract = {In this work, we focused on the functional characterization of
   unicellular eukaryotic assemblages that had previously been
   taxonomically characterized by 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a
   eutrophic coastal site with marked plankton blooms. Biological traits of
   different functional groups were assigned to the retrieved operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). The traits included size, trophic strategy, the
   presence of spines, mucilage production, colony formation, motility,
   spore formation, and potential harmfulness. Functional diversity indices
   were calculated and compared to analogous taxonomic diversity indices,
   indicating a strong positive coupling of richness and dominance and a
   negative coupling of evenness, even at a low taxonomic resolution (at
   the family/genus/species level). Biological trait trade-offs and
   co-occurrences of specific traits were evident during the succession of
   plankton blooms. The trophic strategy dominating in the assemblages
   frequently alternated between autotrophy, mixotrophy, and a few recorded
   cases of parasitism. Given that there was no indication of nutrient
   limitation, we suggest that biotic pressures force marine eukaryotes to
   exploit narrow niches by adopting specific strategies/traits that favour
   their survival. These traits act by increasing resource acquisition
   potential and via predator avoidance. This leads to a unique succession
   of blooms in the system, characterized by adaptations of the bloom taxa
   that are a direct response to the preceding assemblage.},

Title = {Substrate diversity affects carbon utilization rate and threshold
   concentration for uptake by natural bacterioplankton communities},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {95-108},
Abstract = {Y Persistence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environments
   may in part be explained by high diversity and low concentrations of
   carbon substrates. However, changes in dissolved substrate quality can
   modify aquatic bacterial community composition and rate of carbon
   uptake. The aim of this study was to test if the presence of multiple
   simple substrates affects the turnover of organic carbon. Natural
   bacterial communities were grown in continuous cultures supplied with
   either individual carbon substrates-salicylic acid (SA), tryptophan
   (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr)-or a combination of the 3 substrates.
   Concentrations were tracked using fluorescence spectroscopy, and
   steady-state concentrations of a few nanomolar were reached. Bacterial
   growth efficiency was dependent on which carbon sources were present and
   reached an intermediate level in the combined treatment. The bacterial
   community maintained steady-state concentrations of Trp that were lower
   in the combined treatment than in the individual substrate treatment. In
   addition, steady-state concentrations were reached faster during growth
   on combined carbon substrates, although the maximum utilization rate of
   each individual compound was lower. However, the steady-state
   concentration of total carbon (sum of carbon content of SA, Trp and Tyr)
   was higher in the combined culture than in the individual substrate
   treatments, and seemed to be determined by the carbon substate for which
   the bacteria had the lowest affinity. The results from this study
   indicate that persistence of dissolved organic carbon can in part be
   explained by vast substrate diversity, which raises the threshold
   concentration for utilization by natural bacterial communities.},

Title = {A systematic map of demographic data from elephant populations
   throughout Africa: implications for poaching and population analyses},

Abstract = {The crisis facing Africa's elephant populations is a notorious example
   of ongoing wildlife declines caused by illegal harvesting. Targeted
   conservation interventions require detailed knowledge about changes in
   population sizes and the effect of illegal activities. However,
   accurately quantifying poaching intensity is a difficult task: commonly
   calculated from ranger-based carcass-encounter data, the proportion of
   illegally killed elephants (PIKE) is a function of poaching and
   background mortality. Hence, at constant poaching intensity, PIKE
   decreases with increasing natural mortality and also with hunting,
   management interventions, and other anthropogenically induced deaths.
   Natural mortality is often more difficult to quantify with accuracy than
   mortality due to illegal killing, as elephants that die naturally are
   more likely to be missed than those taken by poachers. In recent
   analyses, constant background mortality rates were assumed. Yet, for
   example climate-driven fluctuations in natural mortality, if not
   quantified and accounted for, may lead to biased estimates of poaching
   intensity. Varying background mortality rates can be accounted for in
   the analysis of PIKE, but this requires near-complete counts of natural
   and management-related deaths and hunting records. Carefully developed
   population models, which simulate population dynamics and demographic
   changes while accounting for variation in environmental conditions and
   management strategies, are alternatives. However, successful calibration
   of such models requires integrating comprehensive demographic data. We
   systematically review the scientific and `grey' literature on African
   elephant demography with the objective of facilitating poaching and
   population analysis possibilities through an inventory of information
   relevant to demography. Our screening of 10900 publications resulted in
   the review of relevant information provided by 431 studies from 420
   study sites throughout Africa. From these, we extracted demographic data
   collected between 1900 and 2017, and collated them in the newly created
   African Elephant Demographic Database (AEDD;
   10.6084/m9.figshare.19387085). We found 37 natural mortality estimates
   from five different study sites. Other mortality data, demographic
   rates, and age- and sex-structured population data were substantially
   more abundant, both temporally and spatially. This new collection of
   demographic rates, age- and sex-structured population data, and
   cause-partitioned mortality estimates identifies spatial and temporal
   data gaps and provides prior information needed for African elephant
   population models. Closing these data gaps and subsequent analyses of
   realistic population models may aid elephant conservation via improved
   policies, legislation, and protection.},

Title = {Dietary affinities, resource overlap and core structure in Atlantic
   Forest phyllostomid bat communities},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {177-191},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Phyllostomidae is arguably the most diverse family-level clade of
   mammals. Associated with this high diversity is considerable
   heterogeneity in resource utilisation among species and across locales
   of the Neotropics. Despite heterogeneity, few attempts have been made to
   synthesise dietary patterns even for smaller regions within the
   Neotropics. Atlantic Forest is a large dynamic ecoregion in the southern
   Neotropics that is distinct from other Tropical forests because of its
   extensive latitudinal extent, elevated climatic heterogeneity,
   biodiversity and long history of anthropogenic modification. I obtained
   data on dietary affinities of 34 species of bats from 35 different sites
   spanning the entire Atlantic Forest. In Atlantic Forest, as in other
   places in the Neotropics, phyllostomids consumed arthropods,
   vertebrates, fruits, nectar and blood. Frugivores consumed and dispersed
   the fruits of 99 different species of plants and nectarivores pollinated
   an additional nine others. Dietary overlap was modest, yet significantly
   greater than expected based on a null model. The main axis of variation
   in diet separated species that primarily consumed animal material from
   those that primarily consumed plant material and this axis was
   significantly related to phylogenetic affinities of species. Unlike in
   other places in the Neotropics, frugivorous bats did not exhibit a core
   structure related to genus-to-genus matching of bat genera with plant
   genera. Generality of diets of frugivorous bats, further indicated by
   non-randomly high dietary overlap, is likely to degrade core structure

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {167-181},
Abstract = {Daily oscillations in photosynthetically active radiation strongly
   influence the timing of metabolic processes in picocyanobacteria, but it
   is less clear how the light-dark cycle affects the activities of their
   consumers. We investigated the relationship between marine
   picocyanobacteria and nanoplanktonic consumers throughout the diel cycle
   to determine whether heterotrophic and mixotrophic protists (algae with
   phagotrophic ability) display significant periodicity in grazing
   pressure. Carbon biomass of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus was
   estimated continuously from abundances and cell size measurements made
   by flow cytometry. Picocyanobacterial dynamics were then compared to
   nanoplankton abundances and ingestion of fluorescently labeled bacteria
   measured every 4 h during a 4 d survey in the North Pacific Subtropical
   Gyre. Grazing of the labeled bacteria by heterotrophic nanoplankton was
   significantly greater at night than during the day. The grazing activity
   of mixotrophic nanoplankton showed no diel periodicity, suggesting that
   they may feed continuously, albeit at lower rates than heterotrophic
   nanoplankton, to alleviate nutrient limitation in this oligotrophic
   environment. Diel changes in Prochlorococcus biomass indicated that they
   could support substantial growth of nanoplankton if those grazers are
   the main source of picocyanobacterial mortality, and that grazers may
   contribute to temporally stable abundances of picocyanobacteria.},

Title = {Assessment of viral assemblages in different types of wetland water in
   northeast China using RAPD-PCR},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {183-196},
Abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant and ubiquitous biological entities in
   various ecosystems, yet few investigations of viral communities in
   wetlands have been performed. To address this data gap, water samples
   from 6 wetlands were randomly collected across northeast China; viruses
   in the water were concentrated by sequential tangential flow filtration,
   and viral communities were assessed through randomly amplified
   polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) with 4 decamer oligonucleotide primers.
   Principal coordinate analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis of
   the DNA fingerprints showed that viral community compositions differed
   among the water samples: communities in the 2 coastal wetlands were more
   similar to each other than to those in the 4 freshwater wetlands. The
   Shannon-Weaver index (H) and evenness index (E) of the RAPD-PCR
   fingerprint also differed among the 6 wetlands. Mantel test revealed
   that the changes in viral communities in wetland water were most closely
   related to the water NH4+-N and inorganic C content, followed by total
   K, P, C and NO3--N. DNA sequence analysis of the excised bands revealed
   that viruses accounted for similar to 40\% of all sequences. Among the
   hit viral homologs, the majority belonged to the Microviridae. Moreover,
   variance partitioning analysis showed that the viral community
   contributed 24.58\% while environmental factors explained 30.56\% of the
   bacterial community variation, indicating that the bacterial community
   composition was strongly affected by both viral community and water
   variables. This work provides an initial outline of the viral
   communities from different types of wetlands in northeast China and
   improves our understanding of the viral diversity in these ecosystems.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of corolla tube development across three closely

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {244-255},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Fusion of petals to form a corolla tube is considered a key innovation
   contributing to the diversification of many flowering plant lineages.
   Corolla tube length often varies dramatically among species and is a
   major determinant of pollinator preference. However, our understanding
   of the developmental dynamics underlying corolla tube length variation
   is very limited. Here we examined corolla tube growth in the Mimulus
   lewisii species complex, an emerging model system for studying the
   developmental genetics and evo-devo of pollinator-associated floral
   traits. We compared developmental and cellular processes associated with
   corolla tube length variation among the bee-pollinated M. lewisii, the
   hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus verbenaceus, and the self-pollinated
   Mimulus parishii. We found that in all three species, cell size is
   non-uniformly distributed along the mature tube, with the longest cells
   just distal to the stamen insertion site. Differences in corolla tube
   length among the three species are not associated with processes of
   organogenesis or early development but are associated with variation in
   multiple processes occurring later in development, including the
   location and duration of cell division and cell elongation. The tube
   growth curves of the small-flowered M. parishii and large-flowered M.
   lewisii are essentially indistinguishable, except that M. parishii tubes
   stop growing earlier at a smaller size, suggesting a critical role of
   heterochrony in the shift from outcrossing to selfing. These results not
   only highlight the developmental process associated with corolla tube
   variation among species but also provide a baseline reference for future
   developmental genetic analyses of mutants or transgenic plants with
   altered corolla tube morphology in this emerging model system.},

Title = {Was Chagas disease responsible for Darwin's illness? The overlooked
   eco-epidemiological context in Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {The source of Darwin's illness has been a contentious issue in the
   literature for almost 70 years. Different causal factors have been
   invoked to account for his symptoms, including Chagas disease. The
   Chagas hypothesis is based upon Darwin's diary, in which he narrates his
   experience with kissing bugs, the main vector of the protozoan
   Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. In this
   contribution, we examine the consistency of the ``Chagas disease
   hypothesis{''} in the light of current ecological and epidemiological
   knowledge of the disease in Chile. According to his diary and letters,
   during his overland trips, Darwin slept in rural houses and outdoors for
   128 days in a ``hyperendemic{''} area for Chagas disease, more than
   exposing him to kissing bugs. This observation conveys a likely
   additional source of infection than previously considered, which might
   reinforce the idea that Chagas disease contributed to Darwin's manifest
   physical deterioration.},

Title = {Historical account and current ecological knowledge of the southernmost
   lizard in the world, Liolaemus magellanicus (Squamata: Liolaemidae)},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Background The systematics of Liolaemus magellanicus has been relatively
   well researched, but despite its recognition as the southernmost lizard
   in the world, scant attention has been paid to the discovery,
   distribution, biogeography, and ecology of this lizard at the southern
   tip of South America. I hereby research such aspects and collate the
   most relevant information reported in the primary literature. Methods
   and Results I conducted a selective review of the history of discovery,
   distributional records, biogeography, and ecological features of L.
   magellanicus, as recorded in mainstream journals and landmark monographs
   and books. I specifically omitted the work on the systematics of the
   species and genus because its complexity warrants separate treatment. I
   found scattered references to this lizard starting with the chronicles
   of several overseas expeditions (British, French, and Swedish), with
   Darwin, Jacquinot and Guichenot, and Anderson and Ohlin acting as
   informers; and culminating with Skottsberg, a traveler, and Bridges, an
   early settler in Tierra del Fuego Island. Modern treatment of this
   species started with Hellmich in the 1930s and Donoso-Barros in the
   1960s in Chile, and with Cei in Argentina in the 1960s and has continued
   chiefly in the latter country until today. Discussion I propose this
   species as a model ectothermic vertebrate that may serve to test
   hypotheses about: (a) Resource allocation strategies to deal with a
   harsh environment that affords limited opportunities for foraging and
   reproductive activities of a lizard. (b) Behavioral strategies for
   dealing with thermoregulation, food, and mate acquisition, and care -if
   any-of offspring. (c) Its place within the rather impoverished food web
   of which this species forms part of. This relatively new species, which
   persisted in glacial refuges before being cut off into two
   subpopulations-one mainlander, another islander-also offers fertile
   ground for testing population genetic, evolutionary, and phylogeographic
   hypotheses. I think that biogeographers, systematists, evolutionists,
   physiologists, and ecologists should take advantage of this uniquely
   positioned species in the southernmost margin of the world.},

Title = {Effects of landscape configuration on the occurrence and abundance of an
   arboreal marsupial from the Valdivian rainforest},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background Habitat fragmentation and degradation processes affect
   biodiversity by reducing habitat quantity and quality, with differential
   effects on the resident species. However, their consequences are not
   always noticeable as some ecological processes affected involve
   idiosyncratic responses among different animal groups. The Valdivian
   temperate rainforests of southern Chile are experiencing a rapid
   fragmentation and degradation process despite being a biodiversity
   hotspot. Deforestation is one of the main threats to these forests.
   There inhabits the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, an iconic
   species from the Valdivian rainforest, it is the only extant
   representative of the ancient Microbiotheria order, and it is currently
   threatened by habitat loss. Here we tested the effects of habitat
   configuration on D. gliroides occurrence and abundance along 12
   landscapes of southern Chile with different disturbance levels. Methods
   We estimated D. gliroides occurrence and abundance using camera traps
   and related those metrics with landscape configuration indices obtained
   from FRAGSTATS (i.e., forest \%, connectivity, patch number, contiguity,
   and distance to the nearest patch) using Bayesian linear mixed models.
   Results We found that D. gliroides occurrence was not influenced by
   landscape configuration, while its abundance was positively influenced
   by forest contiguity. Conclusions Although this arboreal marsupial is
   present in disturbed forests, its restricted movement capabilities and
   high dependency on the forest three-dimensional structure may affect its
   long-term persistence. We urge to rethink native forest conservation and
   management policies to improve habitat connectivity with possible
   positive consequences for native fauna.},

Title = {Key drivers of microbial abundance, activity, and diversity in karst
   spring waters across an altitudinal gradient in Slovenia},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {99-114},
Abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, the biomass, activity and composition of
   microorganisms are determined to a large extent by local and regional
   environmental conditions. While karst aquifers are an important source
   for drinking water, the ecology of microbial communities in karst waters
   has hardly been studied. This study examined the regional variations and
   seasonal dynamics of microbial communities in pristine karst spring
   waters of Slovenia (Central Europe). Fifteen springs distributed across
   5 eco-regions exhibiting a strong altitudinal gradient were sampled 4
   times a year. Evaluation of the microbial communities included
   quantification of prokaryotic biomass via total cell counts and
   microbial activity estimated via measurements of electron transport
   system activity. The taxonomic structure of the bacterial communities
   was analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   fingerprinting. Biological measures were complemented by a set of
   physico-chemical parameters, including dissolved organic carbon,
   nutrients, major ions, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and
   dissolved oxygen. Bacterial community structure differed significantly
   with seasons and eco-regions, with the latter causing greater variation.
   While the overall power of the environmental variable tested was a
   moderate factor (15 \%) in explaining the variability in microbial
   community structure, catchment altitude was a key determinant.
   Prokaryotic cell density and microbial activity in spring water
   decreased with an increase in catchment altitude and were significantly
   positively correlated. For a better understanding of karst ecosystems
   and the ecosystem service of water purification, future investigation
   should address karst microbial communities at a higher phylogenetic and
   functional resolution.},

Title = {Microalgal characterization during a mucilaginous bloom on deep
   gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo MPA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in frequency, but despite an
   extreme increase in research on this topic, general knowledge on HABs is
   still scarce. Mucilaginous algal blooms, in particular, are ever more
   present and can heavily affect marine ecosystems. Gorgonians appear
   significantly affected, as their branches are easily entangled (pelagic
   aggregates) and overgrown (benthic aggregates) by mucilage. Moreover,
   their proximity to the bottom makes them susceptible to benthic anoxia.
   In the present study, we investigated the mucilaginous bloom that
   affected the gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo Marine
   Protected Area (MPA) (NE coast of Sardinia) in summer 2020. We focused
   mainly on the characterization of dominant benthic microalgae,
   identifying those responsible for the bloom. Sampling was performed
   considering the colonies of Paramuricea clavata present on hard
   substrata along 2 transects near the Secca del Papa, in the B Zone of
   the MPA. The characterization of the microalgal community and the count
   of the most abundant species (>10 cells ml-1) were carried out using the
   Utermohl sedimentation method. The community was mainly composed of
   diatoms (Bacillariophyta) belonging to the genera Pseudo-nitzschia,
   Nitzschia and Cylindrotheca. C. closterium appeared to be the most
   abundant species. These results confirm the importance of diatoms during
   Tyrrhenian mucilaginous blooms, which could be particularly harmful to
   gorgonians.},

Title = {The microbiology of isoprene cycling in aquatic ecosystems},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {79-98},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is emitted in vast quantities (>500 Tg
   C yr(-1)). Most isoprene is emitted by trees, but there is still
   incomplete understanding of the diversity of isoprene sources. The
   reactivity of isoprene in the atmosphere has potential implications for
   both global warming and global cooling, with human health implications
   also arising from isoprene-induced ozone formation in urban areas.
   Isoprene emissions from terrestrial environments have been studied for
   many years, but our understanding of aquatic isoprene emissions is less
   complete. Several abundant phytoplankton taxa produced isoprene in the
   laboratory, and the relationship between chlorophyll a and isoprene
   production has been used to estimate emissions from marine environments.
   The aims of this review are to highlight the role of aquatic
   environments in the biological cycling of isoprene and to stimulate
   further study of isoprene metabolism in marine and freshwater
   environments. From a microbial ecology perspective, the isoprene
   metabolic gene cluster, first identified in Rhodococcus sp. AD45
   (isoGHIJABCDEF) and subsequently found in every genome-sequenced
   isoprene-degrader, provides the ideal basis for molecular studies on the
   distribution and diversity of isoprene-degrading communities. Further
   investigations of isoprene-emitting microbes, such as the influence of
   environmental factors and geographical location, must also be considered
   when attempting to constrain estimates of the flux of isoprene in
   aquatic ecosystems. We also report isoprene emission by the
   scleractinian coral Acropora horrida and the degradation of isoprene by
   the same coral holobiont, which highlights the importance of better
   understanding the cycling of isoprene in marine environments.},

Title = {Effects of nutrient enrichments on oligotrophic phytoplankton
   communities: a mesocosm experiment near Hawai'i, USA},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {167-183},
Abstract = {A large-volume mesocosm-based nutrient perturbation experiment was
   conducted off the island of Hawai'i, USA, to investigate the response of
   surface ocean phytoplankton communities to the addition of
   macronutrients, trace metals, and vitamins and to assess the feasibility
   of using mesocosms in the open ocean. Three free-drifting mesocosms
   (similar to 60 m(3)) were deployed: one mesocosm served as a control (no
   nutrient amendments); a second (termed +P) was amended with nitrate (N),
   silicate (Si), phosphate (P), and a trace metal + vitamin mixture; and a
   third (termed-P) was amended with N, Si, and a trace metal + vitamin
   mixture but no P. These mesocosms were unreplicated due to logistical
   constraints and hence differences between treatments are qualitative.
   After 6 d, the largest response of the phytoplankton community was
   observed in the +P mesocosm, where chlorophyll a and C-14-based primary
   production were 2-3x greater than in the -P mesocosm and 4-6x greater
   than in the control. Comparison between mesocosm and `microcosm'
   incubations (20 l) revealed differences in the magnitude and timing of
   production and marked differences in community structure with a reduced
   response of diatoms in microcosm treatments. Notably, we also observed
   pronounced declines in Prochlorococcus populations in all treatments,
   although these were greater in microcosms (up to 99\%). Overall, this
   study confirmed the feasibility of deploying free-drifting mesocosms in
   the open ocean as a potentially powerful tool to investigate ecological
   impacts of nutrient perturbations and constitutes a valuable first step
   towards scaling plankton manipulation experiments.},

Title = {Swimming behavior of cryptophyte prey affects prey preference of the
   ambush-feeding ciliate Mesodinium rubrum},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {169-184},
Abstract = {The mixotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum is an ambush feeder relying on
   cryptophyte prey motility for prey encounter and perception; therefore,
   cryptophyte species-specific swimming behaviors affect M. rubrurn's prey
   preference. Here, a high-speed microscale imaging system was used to
   quantify the swimming behaviors of 3 cryptophyte species (Teleaulax
   amphioxeia, Storeatula major, and Guillardia theta) and to conduct
   quantitative microvideography of M. rubrum-T amphioxeia predator-prey
   interaction. T. amphioxeia, a preferred prey of M. rubrum, swam at
   path-averaged speeds of 155 +/- 73 mu m s(-1) along rather straight
   paths. In contrast, S. major regularly tumbled slowly downward or upward
   at 64 +/- 16 mu m s(-1), while G. theta moved slowly in looped/curved
   trajectories at 57 +/- 15 mu m s(-1); neither supports M. rubrum growth.
   Only while motionlessly sinking passively did M. rubrum detect and
   initiate an attack on swimming T. amphioxeia at reaction distances of
   8.2 +/- 8.2 mu m. It seemed that M. rubrum needed to use oral tentacles
   to initially poke T. amphioxeia's ventral posterior part and
   subsequently poke the prey multiple times in a short duration to
   compromise the prey's escape ability, presumably by discharging
   extrusomes into the prey. T amphioxeia also responded to nearby
   predators by switching to tumbling similar to S. major in normal
   swimming, suggesting an effective anti-predator defense behavior that
   prevents M. rubrum from accurately poking the prey's ventral posterior
   part. T. amphioxeia swimming at significantly higher speeds leads to
   sufficiently high prey encounters and hydrodynamic signals for M.
   rubrum, thereby partially explaining M. rubrum's ability to select T.

Title = {COVID-19, media coverage of bats and related Web searches: a turning

Abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, is genomically
   similar to a SARS-like beta-coronavirus found in Asian rhinolophid bats.
   This evolutionary relationship impressed the global media, which then
   emphasised bats as key actors in the spillover that resulted in the
   pandemic. In this study, we highlight changes in the traditional and new
   media coverage of bats and in Internet search volumes that occurred
   since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We analysed Google
   and Wikipedia searches for bats and coronaviruses in 21 countries and
   eight languages, as well as television broadcasts in the USA, some of
   which have global coverage, between January 2016 and December 2020. In
   January 2020, the amount of television news about bats boomed, and news
   associated with the term `bat' shifted to COVID-19-related topics. A
   nearly identical pattern was observed in Google searches during 2020 at
   the global scale. The daily time series of television coverage and
   Internet search volumes on bats and coronavirus in the USA covaried in
   the first quarter of 2020, in line with the existence of a media bubble.
   Time-series analysis revealed that both the Google Trends index and
   visits to Wikipedia pages about bats boomed in early 2020, despite the
   fact that this time of year is usually characterised by low search
   volumes. Media coverage emphasised, correctly or not, the role of bats
   in the COVID-19 pandemic and amplified public interest in bats
   worldwide. The public image of these mammals, in many cases threatened
   and important ecosystem service providers, was seriously compromised. We
   therefore recommend that policymakers and journalists prioritise
   scientifically accurate communication campaigns about bats, which would
   help counteract the surge in bat persecution, and leverage interest
   towards positive human-bat interactions.},

Title = {The missing human baculum: a victim of conspecific aggression and

Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Unlike most primates and all other great apes, humans Homo sapiens do
   not possess a baculum (penile bone). I discuss the shortcomings of
   previous hypotheses to explain the loss of the baculum, argue that they
   fail to explain it fully, and show that the evolutionary history of this
   loss remains enigmatic. I also propose a new hypothesis: that
   conspecific aggression, in combination with the development of
   self-awareness, may have played a role in the loss. If the presence of a
   baculum exacerbated the prevalence and severity of penile injuries
   resulting from blunt trauma to a flaccid penis, increasing ability to
   foresee the consequences of their actions would also enable hominins to
   realise that these injuries are a useful tool in male-male competition.
   This behavioural innovation, planned conspecific aggression with the
   goal of temporary exclusion of competitors from the breeding pool, would
   create an environment in which a genetic mutation for a penis without a
   baculum (or with an unossified baculum) would strongly increase the
   fitness of the mutant phenotype. Along with the hominin propensity for
   social learning and cultural transmission, this hypothetical scenario
   may explain why this phenotype became fixed in all human populations.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {95-109},
Abstract = {Aim: Forest-steppe complexes in the peri-Carpathian region harbour
   specific vegetation dominated by tall herbs. Our aim was to provide new
   phytosociological data on this vegetation type from the Ukraine and
   adjacent parts of Romania, compare it with previously published data,
   discuss its position in broad ecological and biogeographical context and
   suggest its syntaxonomic treatment respecting both its physiognomy and
   species composition. Study area: Western Ukraine and Romania. Methods:
   We assembled a dataset of 711 relev??s of thermophilous herb-rich
   vegetation (Trifolio-Geranietea) from the study area and adjacent
   regions of Eastern Poland and Slovakia using own field research,
   literature survey and large databases. Using intersection of three
   different classification algorithms (beta-flexible, modified TWINSPAN
   and K-means clustering) we identified a consensus delimitation of the
   vegetation type. NMDS ordination, analysis of diagnostic, constant and
   dominant species, and Didukh indicator values were used to characterize
   its species composition and habitat conditions. Results: Altogether 58
   relev??s from Western Ukraine and Romania were classified to a tall herb
   -dominated vegetation type that we identified with the association
   Trollio-Clematidetum recti T??uber et Weber 1976 described from Romania.
   We assigned it to the alliance Geranion sanguinei. It differs from other
   communities of this alliance in its preference for shady slopes, greater
   stand height and considerable representation of mesophilous and montane
   species. It is confined to calcareous bedrock with high soil pH and high
   mineral richness. Conclusions: We suggest that the studied tall
   herb-dominated vegetation is a specific steppe type, confined to
   relatively moist and nutrient rich sites in the peri-Carpathian area.
   Analogous vegetation occurs in the Alps, Balkans, hemiboreal Europe,
   South Urals and Western Siberia. Its species composition and
   biogeographical relationships provide further support for the hypothesis
   that steppe meadows of Central Europe, including tall herb-dominated
   stands, are linked to the Pleistocene and early-Holocene forest-steppe
   of temperate Eurasia.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {197-210},
Abstract = {Organisms living in the sea are exposed to fouling by other organisms.
   Many benthic marine invertebrates, including sponges and bryozoans,
   contain natural products with antimicrobial properties, since microbes
   usually constitute the first stages of fouling. Extracts from 4
   Antarctic sponges (Myxilla (Myxilla) mollis, Mycale tylotornota,
   Rossella nuda, and Anoxycalyx (Scolymastra) joubini) and 2 bryozoan
   species (Cornucopina pectogemma and Nematoflustra flagellata) were
   tested separately for antifouling properties in field experiments. The
   different crude extracts from these invertebrates were incorporated into
   a substratum gel at natural concentrations for an ecological approach.
   Treatments were tested by submerging plates covered by these substratum
   gels under water in situ during 1 lunar cycle (28 d) at Deception Island
   (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Remarkably, the butanolic extracts
   of M. tylotornota and C. pectogemma showed complete growth inhibition of
   microscopic eukaryotic organisms, one of the succession stages involved
   in biofouling. Our results suggest that different chemical strategies
   may exist to avoid fouling, although the role of chemical defenses is
   often species-specific. Thus, the high specificity of the microbial
   community attached to the coated plates seems to be modulated by the
   chemical cues of the crude extracts of the invertebrates tested.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mammals almost always have seven cervical vertebrae. The strong
   evolutionary constraint on changes in this number has been broken in
   sloths and manatees. We have proposed that the extremely low activity
   and metabolic rates of these species relax the stabilizing selection
   against changes in the cervical count. Our hypothesis is that strong
   stabilizing selection in other mammals is largely indirect and due to
   associated pleiotropic effects, including juvenile cancers. Additional
   direct selection can occur due to biomechanical problems (thoracic
   outlet syndrome). Low metabolic and activity rates are thought to
   diminish these direct and indirect effects. To test this hypothesis
   within the primates, we have compared the number of cervical vertebrae
   of three lorisid species with particularly low activity and metabolic
   rates with those of more active primate species, including with their
   phylogenetically closest active relatives, the galagids (bushbabies). In
   support of our hypothesis, we found that 37.6\% of the lorisid specimens
   had an abnormal cervical count, which is a higher percentage than in the
   other nine primate families, in which the incidence varied from zero to
   2.2\%. We conclude that our data support the importance of internal
   selection in constraining evolvability and of a relaxed stabilizing
   selection for increasing evolvability. Additionally, we discuss that
   there is no support for a role of the muscularized diaphragm in the
   evolutionary constraint.},

Title = {Recombination facilitates genetic assimilation of new traits in gene
   regulatory networks},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {459-473},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A new phenotypic variant may appear first in organisms through
   plasticity, that is, as a response to an environmental signal or other
   nongenetic perturbation. If such trait is beneficial, selection may
   increase the frequency of alleles that enable and facilitate its
   development. Thus, genes may take control of such traits, decreasing
   dependence on nongenetic disturbances, in a process called genetic
   assimilation. Despite an increasing amount of empirical studies
   supporting genetic assimilation, its significance is still
   controversial. Whether genetic assimilation is widespread depends, to a
   great extent, on how easily mutation and recombination reduce the
   trait's dependence on nongenetic perturbations. Previous research
   suggests that this is the case for mutations. Here we use simulations of
   gene regulatory network dynamics to address this issue with respect to
   recombination. We find that recombinant offspring of parents that
   produce a new phenotype through plasticity are more likely to produce
   the same phenotype without requiring any perturbation. They are also
   prone to preserve the ability to produce that phenotype after genetic
   and nongenetic perturbations. Our work also suggests that ancestral
   plasticity can play an important role for setting the course that
   evolution takes. In sum, our results indicate that the manner in which
   phenotypic variation maps unto genetic variation facilitates evolution
   through genetic assimilation in gene regulatory networks. Thus, we
   contend that the importance of this evolutionary mechanism should not be
   easily neglected.},

Abstract = {Organismal miniaturization is defined by a reduction in body size
   relative to a large ancestor. In vertebrate animals, miniaturization is
   achieved by suppressing the energetics of growth. However, this might
   interfere with reproductive strategies in egg-laying species with
   limited energy budgets for embryo growth and differentiation. In
   general, the extent to which miniaturization coincides with alterations
   in animal development remains obscure. To address the interplay among
   body size, life history, and ontogeny, miniaturization in chelydroid
   turtles was examined. The analyses corroborated that miniaturization in
   the Chelydroidea clade is underlain by a dampening of the ancestral
   growth trajectory. There were no associated shifts in the early sequence
   of developmental transformations, though the relative duration of
   organogenesis was shortened in miniaturized embryos. The size of eggs,
   hatchlings, and adults was positively correlated within Chelydroidea. A
   phylogenetically broader exploration revealed an alternative
   miniaturization mode wherein exceptionally large hatchlings grow
   minimally and thus attain diminutive adult sizes. Lastly, it is shown
   that miniaturized Chelydroidea turtles undergo accelerated ossification
   coupled with a similar to 10\% reduction in shell bones. As in other
   vertebrates, the effects of miniaturization were not systemic, possibly
   owing to opposing functional demands and tissue geometric constraints.
   This underscores the integrated and hierarchical nature of developmental
   systems.},

Title = {Are Latin American ecologists recognized at the world level? A global
   comparison},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Background: Ioannidis et al. (2020) reported a standardized estimate of
   scientific productivity obtained from a worldwide database of 6,880,389
   scientists who published at least 5 papers picked up by the Scopus
   database, and elaborated a ranking of ca. 120,000 scientists by both
   whole trajectory (career-long) impact and their current impact at year
   2019. The goal of our paper is to contextualize Latin American
   ecologists' contribution at the world level based on the four most
   scientifically productive countries in the region.
   Methods and findings: Ioannidis et al. (2020) proposed a composite index
   that is the sum of six scientometric indicators: (1) The number of
   allocites, (2) the h index, (3) a per capita corrected version of h, (4)
   the allocites received as single author, (5) those received as single +
   first author, and (6) those as single + first + last author. We selected
   data for ecologists from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico and
   comparatively analyzed their productivity according to the proposed
   index. We also compared these data with those obtained from a global
   sample of the top ecologists worldwide.
   Conclusions: Based on Ioannidis et al.'s proposition to evaluate
   scientific productivity we extract three lessons: (1) It does not pay to
   publish many papers; what counts is the number of allocites (i.e.,
   self-citations do not add up). (2) Either be single, first, or last
   author; it does not pay to be in the middle of an authorship line. (3)
   Even worse it is to be among many co-authors because the proposed index
   allocates credits on a per capita basis.},

Title = {The microbial world in a changing environment},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: In this article we would like to touch on the key role
   played by the microbiota in the maintenance of a sustainable environment
   in the entire planet. For obvious reasons, this article does not intend
   to review thoroughly this extremely complex topic, but rather to focus
   on the main threats that this natural scenario is presently facing.
   Methods: Recent literature survey.
   Results: Despite the relevance of microorganisms have in our planet, the
   effects of climate change on microbial communities have been scarcely
   and not systematically addressed in literature. Although the role of
   microorganisms in emissions of greenhouse gases has received some
   attention, there are several microbial processes that are affected by
   climate change with consequences that are presently under assessment.
   Among them, host-pathogen interactions, the microbiome of built
   environment, or relations among plants and beneficial microbes.
   Conclusions: Further research is required to advance in knowledge of the
   effect of climate change on microbial communities. One of the main
   targets should be a complete evaluation of the global microbial
   functional diversity and the design of new strategies to cope with
   limitations in methods to grow microorganisms in the laboratory. These
   efforts should contribute to raise a general public awareness on the
   major role played by the microbiota on the various Earth ecosystems.},

Title = {Burrowing constrains patterns of skull shape evolution in wrasses},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {73-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolution of behavioral and ecological specialization can have
   marked effects on the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution. Head-first
   burrowing has been shown to exert powerful selective pressures on the
   head and body shapes of many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. In
   wrasses, burrowing behaviors have evolved multiple times independently,
   and are commonly used in foraging and predator avoidance behaviors.
   While recent studies have examined the kinematics and body shape
   morphology associated with this behavior, no study to-date has examined
   the macroevolutionary implications of burrowing on patterns of
   phenotypic diversification in this clade. Here, we use three-dimensional
   geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to study
   the evolution of skull shape in fossorial wrasses and their relatives.
   We test for skull shape differences between burrowing and non burrowing
   wrasses and evaluate hypotheses of shape convergence among the burrowing
   wrasses. We also quantify rates of skull shape evolution between
   burrowing and non burrowing wrasses to test for whether burrowing
   constrains or accelerates rates of skull shape evolution in this clade.
   We find that while burrowing and non burrowing wrasses exhibit similar
   degrees of morphological disparity, for burrowing wrasses, it took
   nearly twice as long to amass this disparity. Furthermore, while the
   disparities between groups are evenly matched, we find that most
   burrowing species are confined to a particular region of shape space
   with most species exhibiting narrower heads than many non-burrowing
   species. These results suggest head-first burrowing constrains patterns
   of skull shape diversification in wrasses by potentially restricting the
   range of phenotypes that can perform this behavior.},

Title = {A detailed redescription of the mesoderm/neural crest cell boundary in

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The morphology of the mammalian chondrocranium appears to differ
   significantly from those of other amniotes, since the former possesses
   uniquely developed brain and cranial sensory organs. In particular, a
   question has long remained unanswered as to the developmental and
   evolutionary origins of a cartilaginous nodule called the ala
   hypochiasmatica. In this study, we investigated the embryonic origin of
   skeletal elements in the murine orbitotemporal region by combining
   genetic cell lineage analysis with detailed morphological observation.
   Our results showed that the mesodermal embryonic environment including
   the ala hypochiasmatica, which appeared as an isolated mesodermal
   distribution in the neural crest-derived prechordal region, is formed as
   a part of the mesoderm that continued from the chordal region during
   early chondrocranial development. The mesoderm/neural crest cell
   boundary in the head mesenchyme is modified through development,
   resulting in the secondary mesodermal expansion to invade into the
   prechordal region. We thus revealed that the ala hypochiasmatica
   develops as the frontier of the mesodermal sheet stretched along the
   cephalic flexure. These results suggest that the mammalian ala
   hypochiasmatica has evolved from a part of the mesodermal primary
   cranial wall in ancestral amniotes. In addition, the endoskeletal
   elements in the orbitotemporal region, such as the orbital cartilage,
   suprapterygoid articulation of the palatoquadrate, and trabecula, some
   of which were once believed to represent primitive traits of amniotes
   and to be lost in the mammalian lineage, have been confirmed to exist in
   the mammalian cranium. Consequently, the mammalian chondrocranium can
   now be explained in relation to the pan-amniote cranial configuration.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Biodiversity loss is one of the most serious global environmental
   problems caused by human activities. The intensification of agriculture
   and the increasing presence of monocultures is one of the main reasons
   for this. To study the long-term effects of maize monocultures compared
   to crop rotation systems on vegetation and biodiversity, two nearby
   sites in the small village of Metschach in Central Carinthia, Austria,
   were monitored for 30 years. These two test sites with intensively used
   arable land, divided into maize and crop rotation (14.5 ha in total)
   were taken out of production in 1989 as part of a nature conservation
   project. Changes in the composition and abundance of vascular plant
   species were recorded in 29 permanent plots. The monitoring showed that
   the previous use has long-lasting effects on species richness and
   ecological indicator values of the fallow land: The species numbers of
   the former maize field remained on average 10 species below those of the
   former crop rotation field over the entire study period. After 30 years,
   the plant communities in the former crop rotation revealed tendencies
   towards species-rich grassland communities, whereas in the former maize
   monoculture Elymus repens or tall herbaceous fringe communities remained
   dominant. Ecological indicator values showed predominantly higher
   moisture and nutrients values in the former maize cultivation over the
   entire study period. Overall, this study underlines the importance of
   monitoring to unravel long-term effects of different crop types on
   biodiversity. In particular, it highlights the need for additional
   monitoring programmes in comparable ecosystems, including in-situ
   measurement of temperature, moisture and nitrogen.},

Abstract = {The effects of ammonium on biofilm attached to submerged macrophytes
   remain unclear. We studied the microbial communities of epiphytic
   biofilms on the leaf surface of Hydrilla verticillata under increasing
   ammonium loadings using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and RT-PCR. The study
   showed that the microbial community structures were influenced by
   increased ammonium loadings. N-cycling bacteria including the nitrifier
   Nitrospira and the denitrifiers Rhodobacter, Hyphomicrobium, and
   Flavobacterium were found to be predominant. Copy numbers of N-cycling
   functional genes (including amoA, nxrA, narG, napA, nirK, nirS, qnorB,
   and nosZ) were stimulated by increased ammonium loadings, showing the
   high potential of attached biofilms in removing ammonium-N through
   coupled nitrification-denitrification. Our results indicated that
   submerged macrophytes facilitated the ammonium removal process not only
   by providing favorable surface niches for ammonium oxidizers,
   nitrifiers, and denitrifiers in the attached biofilms but also by
   mediating dissolved oxygen concentrations and alkalinity condition in
   the water.},

Title = {Novel method for measuring aquatic bacterial productivity using
   D-10-leucine based on protein synthesis rate},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {121-129},
Abstract = {The most widely used method for measuring bacterial production is
   tritium-labeled leucine (H-3-Leu). Although this method provides
   methodological simplicity and high sensitivity, the employment of
   radioactive isotopes is often restricted by regulations, particularly in
   field settings. In this study, we developed a non-radioactive method for
   measuring bacterial productivity based on the protein synthesis rate,
   using deuterium-labeled leucine ((CD3)(2)CDCD2CD(NH2)COOH; D-10-Leu);
   the proposed method was then compared and verified with the H-3-Leu
   method. The procedures of the proposed method are (1) incorporation of
   D-10-Leu by bacteria, (2) acid hydrolysis (HCl) to amino acids and (3)
   quantification of D-10-Leu (m/z 142.10) by liquid chromatography mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In the LC-MS/MS analysis, we detected a larger
   amount of D-9-Leu (m/z 141.10) and D-8-Leu (m/z 140.10) than that of
   D-10-Leu, suggesting that incorporated D-10-Leu was rapidly metabolized
   such as in deamination and aminotransferase reactions. The incorporation
   rates of D-10-Leu, D-10-Leu + D-9-Leu (D-10+D-9-Leu) and D-10-Leu +
   D-9-Leu + D-8-Leu (D-10+D-9+D-8-Leu) were significantly positively
   correlated to that of H-3-Leu, confirming the validity of the proposed
   method. Since D-7-Leu (m/z 139.10) could not be detected, the amount of
   exogenous leucine incorporated into protein can be accurately estimated
   through D-10+D-9+D-8-Leu measurement. The new compound-based
   quantification method using stable isotope-labeled leucine can be a
   powerful tool to estimate pure protein synthesis rate for measuring
   bacterial production.},

Title = {Effects of seawater viscosity and temperature on the movement of the
   marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {21-28},
Abstract = {It is important to understand how planktonic dinoflagellate movements
   may be affected by environmental conditions, including those potentially
   influenced by climate change. Because of their small size,
   dinoflagellates can be expected to be highly sensitive to changes in
   viscosity; however, there is currently little understanding of how these
   organisms and other algae may be regulated by seawater viscosity.
   Previous work that has addressed the effects of seawater viscosity on
   single-celled plankton considered unnaturally large viscosity changes
   from a bio-mechanical perspective, sometimes without considering
   temperature effects. We studied the swimming of the dinoflagellate
   Prorocentrum minimum, a common coastal species, when exposed to
   environmentally relevant temperature and viscosity changes. P. minimum
   showed an additive response to seawater viscosity and temperature: cold
   temperature and high viscosity both slowed swimming speeds. However,
   seawater temperature and viscosity did not affect the movement direction
   or linearity of swimming of the dinoflagellates. We argue that
   temperature-related changes in movement may be partially regulated by a
   mechanical response to viscosity, which increases at cold temperature.
   We also propose possible future directions for laboratory and modelling
   studies.},

Title = {Nutrient availability and organic matter quality shape bacterial
   community structure in a lake biofilm},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria play a key role in ecosystem processes, but
   little is known about the factors that shape bacterial community
   structure in aquatic biofilms, especially in lakes. We used molecular
   techniques (16S rRNA) to evaluate resource controls on biofilm bacterial
   community structure in an oligotrophic subalpine lake. We manipulated
   nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus; NP) and glucose (G) on inorganic
   (rock) and organic (wood) substrates under light and dark conditions
   (i.e. with and without autotrophy, respectively) in a full factorial
   design using nutrient diffusing substrates in situ for 20 d. Distinct
   patterns of separation in community structure between treatments with
   nutrients (NP, NP+G) and without nutrients (control, G-only) indicated
   that community structure was more strongly influenced by nutrients than
   organic matter irrespective of substrate type or light availability.
   Further separation in community structure between treatments with
   nutrients only (NP) and nutrients with glucose (NP+G) on both organic
   and inorganic substrates indicated that once nutrient limitation was
   alleviated, organic matter quality played an important role in shaping
   community structure. Differences in the relative abundance of 6 phyla, 3
   classes, and 19 genera among treatments revealed (1) contrasting
   taxa-specific resource requirements, (2) the influence of interspecific
   interactions on composition, and (3) the potential for individual taxa
   to participate in the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter. Our
   findings provide insight into the role that nutrients and organic matter
   quality play in shaping bacterial community structure, which is a
   critical step in bridging the knowledge gap between microbial
   composition and ecosystem function within aquatic environments.},

Title = {Disturbed virus-bacteria dynamics in Otsuchi Bay (Japan) after the
   mega-earthquake and tsunami in March 2011},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {31-41},
Abstract = {On 11 March 2011, a mega-earthquake followed by a huge tsunami hit a
   large area of the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan, and caused widespread
   disturbances in marine ecosystems; however, the impacts on
   virus-bacteria systems have not yet been elucidated. To investigate
   whether virus-bacteria interactions were affected by the earthquake and
   tsunami, we analyzed time series data of viral and bacterial abundances
   in Otsuchi Bay. Data were collected every 2 mo, from July 2011 to
   September 2015. Bacterial abundance exhibited a recurrent seasonal cycle
   with high abundance during the warm season. The seasonal trend of
   viruses generally followed that of the bacteria, yielding an average
   virus to bacteria ratio (VBR) of 10.8 +/- 3.6 (mean +/- SD; n = 432). A
   notable exception was found at the first 2 sampling times (July and
   September 2011) when the VBR was consistently low, with an average value
   of 5.9 +/- 1.2 (n = 32). The average VBR during these time periods was
   substantially lower than the VBR observed in the same season of
   subsequent years. An analysis of the subset of data collected in the
   warm season of 2011 and 2012 revealed that the viral abundance and VBR
   were negatively correlated with turbidity. These results support the
   hypothesis that viruses were scavenged by non-host particles from the
   resuspended sediments and damaged catchment. The earthquake and tsunami
   thus exerted a prolonged impact, over several months, on the
   virus-bacteria dynamics in Otsuchi Bay.},

Abstract = {We used 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding to investigate picoeukaryotic
   diversity and distribution at the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum
   (DCM) of 4 stations in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO). The
   results showed that picoeukaryotic communities were dominated by 5
   phyla: Dinoflagellata, Radiolaria, Chlorophyta, Ochrophyta and
   Ciliophora. The picoeukaryotic communities were classified into 3 groups
   matching their water mass origins and depth: (1) Group I was in the
   surface waters of the Bay of Bengal, which had low salinity, and was
   dominated by Radiolaria Group A, Spirotrichea and marine stramenopiles;
   (2) Group II was in the DCM within the intrusion of Arabian Sea high
   salinity water, in which Chloropicophyceae and Pelagophyceae were more
   abundant; and (3) Group III was located in the 0 degrees-5 degrees S
   surface water, which was enriched by Dinophyceae. In addition,
   Caecitellaceae paraparvulus was abundant at 4 degrees S, where weak
   vertical mixing occurred. This study provides the first baseline of
   picoeukaryotic diversity in the EEIO.},

Title = {Biogeography of reef water microbes from within-reef to global scales},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {81-94},
Abstract = {Seawater microorganisms play an important role in coral reef ecosystem
   functioning and can be influenced by biological, chemical, and physical
   features of reefs. As coral reefs continue to respond to environmental
   changes, the reef seawater microbiome has been proposed as a
   conservation tool for monitoring perturbations. However, the spatial
   variability of reef seawater microbial communities is not well studied,
   limiting our ability to make generalizable inferences across reefs. In
   order to better understand how microorganisms are distributed at
   multiple spatial scales, we examined seawater microbial communities in
   Florida Reef Tract and US Virgin Islands reef systems using a nested
   sampling design. On 3 reefs per reef system, we sampled seawater at
   regular spatial intervals close to the benthos. We assessed the
   microbial community composition of these waters using ribosomal RNA gene
   amplicon sequencing. Our analysis revealed that reef water microbial
   communities varied as a function of reef system and individual reefs,
   but communities did not differ within reefs and were not significantly
   influenced by benthic composition. For the reef system and inter-reef
   differences, abundant microbial taxa were found to be potentially useful
   indicators of environmental difference due to their high prevalence and
   variance. We further examined reef water microbial biogeography on a
   global scale using a secondary analysis of 5 studies, which revealed
   that microbial communities were more distinct with increasing geographic
   distance. These results suggest that biogeography is a distinguishing
   feature for reef water microbiomes, and that development of monitoring
   criteria may necessitate regionally specific sampling and analyses.},

Title = {Influence of increased nutrient supply on Microcystis aeruginosa at
   cellular and proteomic levels},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {47-58},
Abstract = {Various studies have observed that increased nutrient supply promotes
   the growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, but only a limited number of
   studies have investigated the influence of increased nutrient supply on
   bloom-forming cyanobacteria at the proteomic level. We investigated the
   cellular and proteomic responses of Microcystis aeruginosa to elevated
   nitrogen and phosphorus supply. Increased supply of both nutrients
   significantly promoted the growth of M. aeruginosa and the synthesis of
   chlorophyll a, protein, and microcystins. The release of microcystins
   and the synthesis of polysaccharides negatively correlated with the
   growth of M. aeruginosa under high nutrient levels. Overexpressed
   proteins related to photosynthesis, and amino acid synthesis, were
   responsible for the stimulatory effects of increased nutrient supply in
   M. aeruginosa. Increased nitrogen supply directly promoted
   cyanobacterial growth by inducing the overexpression of the cell
   division regulatory protein FtsZ. NtcA, that regulates gene
   transcription related to both nitrogen assimilation and microcystin
   synthesis, was overexpressed under the high nitrogen condition, which
   consequently induced overexpression of 2 microcystin synthetases (McyC
   and McyF) and promoted microcystin synthesis. Elevated nitrogen supply
   induced the overexpression of proteins involved in gas vesicle
   organization (GvpC and GvpW), which may increase the buoyancy of M.
   aeruginosa. Increased phosphorus level indirectly affected growth and
   the synthesis of cellular substances in M. aeruginosa through the
   mediation of differentially expressed proteins related to carbon and
   phosphorus metabolism. This study provides a comprehensive description
   of changes in the proteome of M. aeruginosa in response to an increased
   supply of 2 key nutrients.},

Title = {Tergal and pleural wing-related tissues in the German cockroach and

Abstract = {The acquisition of wings has facilitated the massive evolutionary
   success of pterygotes (winged insects), which now make up nearly
   three-quarters of described metazoans. However, our understanding of how
   this crucial structure has evolved remains quite elusive. Historically,
   two ideas have dominated in the wing origin debate, one placing the
   origin in the dorsal body wall (tergum) and the other in the lateral
   pleural plates and the branching structures associated with these
   plates. Through studying wing-related tissues in the wingless segments
   (such as wing serial homologs) of the beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we
   obtained several crucial pieces of evidence that support a third idea,
   the dual origin hypothesis, which proposes that wings evolved from a
   combination of tergal and pleural tissues. Here, we extended our
   analysis outside of the beetle lineage and sought to identify
   wing-related tissues from the wingless segments of the cockroach,
   Blattella germanica. Through detailed functional and expression analyses
   for a critical wing gene, vestigial (vg), along with re-evaluating the
   homeotic transformation of a wingless segment induced by an improved RNA
   interference protocol, we demonstrate that B. germanica possesses two
   distinct tissues in their wingless segments, one with tergal and one
   with pleural nature, that might be evolutionarily related to wings. This
   outcome appears to parallel the reports from other insects, which may
   further support a dual origin of insect wings. However, we also
   identified a vg-independent tissue that contributes to wing formation
   upon homeotic transformation, as well as vg-dependent tissues that do
   not appear to participate in wing formation, in B. germanica, indicating
   a more complex evolutionary history of the tissues that contributed to
   the emergence of insect wings.},

Title = {A cis-regulatory change underlying the motor neuron-specific loss of Ebf

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {72-85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many species in the tunicate family Molgulidae have independently lost
   their swimming larval form and instead develop as tailless, immotile
   larvae. These larvae do not develop structures that are essential for
   swimming such as the notochord, otolith, and tail muscles. However,
   little is known about neural development in these nonswimming larvae.
   Here, we studied the patterning of the Motor Ganglion (MG) of Molgula
   occulta, a nonswimming species. We found that spatial patterns of MG
   neuron regulators in this species are conserved, compared with species
   with swimming larvae, suggesting that the gene networks regulating their
   expression are intact despite the loss of swimming. However, expression
   of the key motor neuron regulatory gene Ebf (Collier/Olf/EBF) was
   reduced in the developing MG of M. occulta when compared with molgulid
   species with swimming larvae. This was corroborated by measuring
   allele-specific expression of Ebf in hybrid embryos from crosses of M.
   occulta with the swimming species M. oculata. Heterologous reporter
   construct assays in the model tunicate species Ciona robusta revealed a
   specific cis-regulatory sequence change that reduces expression of Ebf
   in the MG, but not in other cells. Taken together, these data suggest
   that MG neurons are still specified in M. occulta larvae, but their
   differentiation might be impaired due to reduction of Ebf expression
   levels.},

Abstract = {Background Ecological restoration is a process that helps the recovery
   of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed. The
   success of restoration actions depend on the understanding of the
   processes, mechanisms and factors that guide vegetation dynamics. The
   restoration of plant communities can be made by unassisted (passive
   restoration, where the community recover by itself) and assisted (active
   restoration) ecological succession. It is imperative to know the scope
   of both types of activities to guide future restoration actions by
   evaluating the properties and functioning of the intervened communities.
   Methods Variance analysis of the carbon (C) stocks, basal area, canopy
   area, Shannon-Weaver index values, specific richness and abundance of
   three Tamaulipan thornscrub communities (assisted natural succession
   area, unassisted natural succession area and control area) was
   performed. Furthermore, a similarity analysis between the sampling areas
   using the floristic composition (abundance) was performed. Results In
   total, 11 families, 17 genera and 20 species of vascular plants were
   registered. The richness of species and abundance ranked as follows per
   area: assisted ecological natural succession > control > unassisted
   ecological natural succession. The species composition between sampling
   areas showed a low number of common species between plant communities.
   Conclusions The values of species richness, diversity, abundance, basal
   area, and canopy area of the assisted natural succession vegetal
   community was statistical similar to the control plan community. The
   values of C stocks showed that assisted ecological succession could
   recover not only structure and composition attributes but also this key
   ecosystem property.},

   proposed: the `expansion-contraction model'. The `expansion-contraction
   model' is more appropriate for thermophilous and temperate species than
   for Arctic species. We hypothesise that the responses of cold-adapted
   species to the temperature fluctuations during glacial cycles cannot be
   explained by this model. In this review, we synthesise and describe, for
   the first time, the historical biogeography of various cold-adapted
   terrestrial mammalian taxa (small mammals, herbivores, and carnivores)
   in Eurasia during the last glaciation (especially during the Last
   Glacial Maximum), and identify mechanisms underlying their response to
   glacier pulsation and severe climate fluctuations. We formulate the
   paradigm for the biogeography of cold-adapted mammalian taxa in Europe,
   and identified three response models to glacial-interglacial cycles: 1)
   `extinction and genetic diminution' for Lasiopodomys gregalis,
   Dicrostonyx spp. and Lemmus lemmus, 2) `extinction and replacement' for
   Alopex lagopus, Gulo gulo and Rangifer tarandus, and 3) `contraction and
   gene transfer' for Lepus timidus and Martes zibellina. Knowledge of past
   biogeography is essential for understanding how cold-adapted taxa are
   responding to anthropogenic climate warming, and for on-going
   biodiversity and habitat conservation in the Anthropocene. There is no
   doubt that cold-adapted, Arctic species are suffering the most from
   global warming.},

Title = {Fox Vulpes vulpes population trends in Western Europe during and after

Abstract = {Over several decades, Western Europe experienced an outbreak of sylvatic
   rabies, eliminated through an EU programme involving large-scale red fox
   vaccination campaigns. While much work has been done on the dynamics of
   the virus and on the efficiency of vaccination campaigns, very little
   attention has been paid to the impact on the large-scale dynamics of the
   fox population. As Western Europe has now been free of rabies for about
   15-20 years, the aims of this review are to characterise the impact of
   rabies during the outbreak itself and to increase understanding of how
   fox populations evolved thereafter. The rabies-free populations in the
   UK are also integrated as a comparative control. Trends in fox
   populations are based on a review of available data, mainly hunting
   statistics and a few other methods. The benefits and biases of these
   methods are also discussed. During the rabies epizootic, fox populations
   experienced a significant decline and stabilised at lower densities than
   observed in the past. A demographic explosion followed the vaccination
   campaigns, and fox populations became larger than had been observed
   before the epizootic. Rabies vaccination was not the direct cause of
   this demographic explosion, as rabies-free areas experienced it also.
   The causes are more to be sought in environmental modifications induced
   by humans. This demographic explosion was followed by the emergence of
   urban fox populations throughout Europe. Moreover, the new higher
   densities favoured the outbreak of other diseases, though their impact
   was more limited. Around the 2000s, rural fox populations appeared to
   reach densities close to carrying capacity and populations stabilised.
   However, subsequently, with some exceptions, Western European fox
   populations seem to be experiencing a decline. The ecological
   consequences of these changes in fox population density may reach the
   many prey species and competitors of the red fox.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity inventories provide critical information on the ecology of
   natural ecosystems and inform conservation planning at local to regional
   scales. Based on a systematic review, we compiled data on over 1000
   mammal inventories conducted throughout the Neotropics - from Mexico to
   Argentina - to document the status of assemblage-wide field mammalogy in
   the world's most biodiverse Tropical realm. We analysed data using
   descriptive statistics and a confusion matrix to understand the
   prevalence of species' pseudo-absences, map overall patterns of survey
   density, and quantify any geographic sampling bias. Based on the 1028
   site-specific inventories published between 1983 and 2020, mean species
   richness of medium- to large-bodied mammals was 11.9 (+/- 8.8 standard
   deviation). Local inventories were distributed across elevational
   gradients, and overall sampling effort and survey techniques employed
   were extremely variable. The best-sampled regions were the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest and Mesoamerica, but we identified nine large
   assemblage-wide Wallacean shortfalls and a pseudo-absence rate of 11\%
   (+/- 4\% standard deviation); geographic sampling bias was largely
   related to human population density, regardless of the assemblages'
   intactness presumably found in the undersampled wilderness regions of
   the Neotropics. We document the 40-year legacy of mammal field surveys
   throughout the Neotropics, where several glaring knowledge shortfalls
   still persist. This calls for an audacious research agenda for future
   Neotropical mammal studies, which should target sampling in more remote
   areas, standardise sampling methodology, and provide high-resolution
   data that can be used to fill current knowledge shortfalls. To do so,
   Latin American countries and the wider international community will need
   to commit greater personnel and financial resources to understanding
   biodiversity patterns and processes related to the Tropical vertebrate
   fauna.},

Abstract = {In modern vertebrates, the craniofacial skeleton is complex, comprising
   cartilage and bone of the neurocranium, dermatocranium and
   splanchnocranium (and their derivatives), housing a range of sensory
   structures such as eyes, nasal and vestibulo-acoustic capsules, with the
   splanchnocranium including branchial arches, used in respiration and
   feeding. It is well understood that the skeleton derives from neural
   crest and mesoderm, while the sensory elements derive from ectodermal
   thickenings known as placodes. Recent research demonstrates that neural
   crest and placodes have an evolutionary history outside of vertebrates,
   while the vertebrate fossil record allows the sequence of the evolution
   of these various features to be understood. Stem-group vertebrates such
   as Metaspriggina walcotti (Burgess Shale, Middle Cambrian) possess eyes,
   paired nasal capsules and well-developed branchial arches, the latter
   derived from cranial neural crest in extant vertebrates, indicating that
   placodes and neural crest evolved over 500 million years ago. Since that
   time the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton has evolved, including
   different types of bone, of potential neural crest or mesodermal origin.
   One problematic part of the craniofacial skeleton concerns the evolution
   of the nasal organs, with evidence for both paired and unpaired nasal
   sacs being the primitive state for vertebrates.},

Title = {Evolution of lbx spinal cord expression and function},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {404-422},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ladybird homeobox (Lbx) transcription factors have crucial functions in
   muscle and nervous system development in many animals. Amniotes have two
   Lbx genes, but only Lbx1 is expressed in spinal cord. In contrast,
   teleosts have three lbx genes and we show here that zebrafish lbx1a,
   lbx1b, and lbx2 are expressed by distinct spinal cell types, and that
   lbx1a is expressed in dI4, dI5, and dI6 interneurons, as in amniotes.
   Our data examining lbx expression in Scyliorhinus canicula and Xenopus
   tropicalis suggest that the spinal interneuron expression of zebrafish
   lbx1a is ancestral, whereas lbx1b has acquired a new expression pattern
   in spinal cord progenitor cells. lbx2 spinal expression was probably
   acquired in the ray-finned lineage, as this gene is not expressed in the
   spinal cords of either amniotes or S. canicula. We also show that the
   spinal function of zebrafish lbx1a is conserved with mouse Lbx1. In
   zebrafish lbx1a mutants, there is a reduction in the number of
   inhibitory spinal interneurons and an increase in the number of
   excitatory spinal interneurons, similar to mouse Lbx1 mutants.
   Interestingly, the number of inhibitory spinal interneurons is also
   reduced in lbx1b mutants, although in this case the number of excitatory
   interneurons is not increased. lbx1a;lbx1b double mutants have a similar
   spinal interneuron phenotype to lbx1a single mutants. Taken together
   these data suggest that lbx1b and lbx1a may be required in succession
   for correct specification of dI4 and dI6 spinal interneurons, although
   only lbx1a is required for suppression of excitatory fates in these
   cells.},

Abstract = {The survival prospects of threatened species or populations can
   sometimes be improved by adaptive change. Such evolutionary rescue is
   particularly relevant when the threat comes from changing environments,
   or when long-term population persistence requires range expansion into
   new habitats. Conservation biologists are therefore often interested in
   whether or not populations or lineages show a disposition for adaptive
   evolution, that is, if they are evolvable. Here, we discuss four
   alternative perspectives that target different causes of evolvability
   and outline some of the key challenges those perspectives are designed
   to address. Standing genetic variation provides one familiar estimate of
   evolvability. Yet, the mere presence of genetic variation is often
   insufficient to predict if a population will adapt, or how it will
   adapt. The reason is that adaptive change not only depends on genetic
   variation, but also on the extent to which this genetic variation can be
   realized as adaptive phenotypic variation. This requires attention to
   developmental systems and how plasticity influences evolutionary
   potential. Finally, we discuss how a better understanding of the
   different factors that contribute to evolvability can be exploited in
   conservation practice.},

Title = {Signals of selection beyond bottlenecks between exotic populations of

Abstract = {Colonization of new environments can lead to population bottlenecks and
   rapid phenotypic evolution that could be due to neutral and selective
   processes. Exotic populations of the bull-headed dung beetle
   (Onthophagus taurus) have differentiated in opposite directions from
   native beetles in male horn-to-body size allometry and female fecundity.
   Here we test for genetic and transcriptional differences among two
   exotic and one native O. taurus populations after three generations in
   common garden conditions. We sequenced RNA from 24 individuals for each
   of the three populations including both sexes, and spanning four
   developmental stages for the two exotic, differentiated populations.
   Identifying 270,400 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we
   revealed a strong signal of genetic differentiation between the three
   populations, and evidence of recent bottlenecks within and an excess of
   outlier loci between exotic populations. Differences in gene expression
   between populations were greatest in prepupae and early adult life
   stages, stages during which differences in male horn development and
   female fecundity manifest. Finally, genes differentially expressed
   between exotic populations also had greater genetic differentiation and
   performed functions related to chitin biosynthesis and nutrient sensing,
   possibly underlying allometry and fecundity trait divergences. Our
   results suggest that beyond bottlenecks, recent introductions have led
   to genetic and transcriptional differences in genes correlated with
   observed phenotypic differences.},

Title = {Aligning terrestrial habitat typology of Lebanon with EUNIS habitat
   classification},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {233-244},
Abstract = {The absence of nationally accepted typology to classify and describe
   habitats has been an obstacle to the development of coordinated research
   in this field and to the implementation of conservation actions;
   therefore, a classification of the natural and semi-natural terrestrial
   habitat types existing in Lebanon is presented and adapted to the
   hierarchical structure of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS)
   habitat classification. The harmonisation with an international
   classification system is essential to facilitate communication and
   research throughout the Mediterranean Basin. A total of 1597 sites
   surveyed throughout Lebanon between 2013 and 2020 were classified and
   described based on the analysis of the physiognomic parameters and
   specific composition of their vegetation. The analysis yielded 190
   habitat types for Lebanon, including 12 coastal habitats (category N),
   35 related to inland surface waters (C), 6 wetland habitats (Q), 20
   grasslands (R), 54 scrublands and heaths habitats (S), 27 types of
   woodlands (T), 17 inland unvegetated habitats (U), and 19 vegetated
   man-made habitats (V). Sixty-one habitats characteristic of Lebanon, not
   previously included in the EUNIS classification, were described and
   proposed in this typology. Those habitats include shrublands (23),
   woodlands (18), coastal habitats (6), wetlands (1), grasslands (9),
   sparsely vegetated habitats (2) and man-made vegetation (2).},

Title = {Growth rate mediates hidden developmental plasticity of female yellow
   dung fly reproductive morphology in response to environmental stressors},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {3-15},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding how environmental variation influences even cryptic traits
   is important to clarify the roles of selection and developmental
   constraints in past evolutionary divergence and to predict future
   adaptation under environmental change. Female yellow dung flies
   (Scathophaga stercoraria) typically have three sperm storage
   compartments (3S), but occasionally four (4S). More spermathecae are
   thought to be a female adaptation facilitating sperm sorting after
   mating, but the phenotype is very rare in nature. We manipulated the
   flies' developmental environment by food restriction, pesticides, and
   hot temperatures to investigate the nature and extent of developmental
   plasticity of this trait, and whether spermatheca expression correlates
   with measures of performance and developmental stability, as would be
   expected if 4S expression is a developmental aberration. The
   spermathecal polymorphism of yellow dung fly females is heritable, but
   also highly developmentally plastic, varying strongly with rearing
   conditions. 4S expression is tightly linked to growth rate, and weakly
   positively correlated with fluctuating asymmetry of wings and legs,
   suggesting that the production of a fourth spermatheca could be a
   nonadaptive developmental aberration. However, spermathecal plasticity
   is opposite in the closely related and ecologically similar Scathophaga
   suilla, demonstrating that overexpression of spermathecae under
   developmental stress is not universal. At the same time, we found
   overall mortality costs as well as benefits of 4S pheno- and genotypes
   (also affecting male siblings), suggesting that a life history trade-off
   may potentially moderate 4S expression. We conclude that the release of
   cryptic genetic variation in spermatheca number in the face of strong
   environmental variation may expose hidden traits (here reproductive
   morphology) to natural selection (here under climate warming or food
   augmentation). Once exposed, hidden traits can potentially undergo rapid
   genetic assimilation, even in cases when trait changes are first
   triggered by random errors that destabilize developmental processes.},

Title = {Differences in regulation of planktonic and epilithic biofilm bacterial

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {47-60},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To clarify the governing factors of planktonic and epilithic bacterial
   production (BP) and to quantify their relative contributions to the
   carbon cycle, we investigated the seasonal variation and regulatory
   factors of planktonic and epilithic BP in the middle reaches of the
   Shinano River, Japan, ecosystem from February 2019 to May 2020. Sampling
   was conducted at 3 stations: upper stream riffle, upper stream pool, and
   lower stream riffle, where current velocity, water depth, and bed shear
   stress were distinct. Planktonic and biofilm BP ranged from 5.5 to 466
   mgC m(-3) d(-1) and 2.9 to 132 mgC m(-2) d(-1), respectively, showing
   clear seasonal variation. Biofilm BP was higher in the upper stream
   riffle than at the other stations, where no spatial variation in
   planktonic BP was observed. Generalized linear models suggest that BP
   was primarily regulated by water temperature. Additionally, planktonic
   BP was significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon,
   suggesting carbon limitation. Biofilm BP showed no evidence of resource
   limitation (nutrients and organic matter), but was significantly
   explained by current velocity and station. The results suggest that
   although seasonality is dominant in biofilm BP variation, spatial
   differences are significant within the seasonal variability. Moreover,
   current velocity and bottom shear stress related to local
   geomorphologies such as riffles and pools affect substrate supply rate
   and biofilm formation processes, regulating biofilm BP variation. This
   study demonstrated different regulatory factors of planktonic and
   biofilm BP in the middle reaches of a temperate river.},

Title = {Growth and phosphatase activities of Ostreopsis cf. ovata biofilms
   supplied with diverse dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) compounds},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {155-166},
Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly evident that the use of organic nutrients is
   widespread among many aquatic phototrophic organisms. Simultaneously,
   incidents of eutrophication of coastal waters are becoming more common
   due to rises in organic nutrient loads deriving from anthropogenic
   activities and natural terrestrial processes. In the northern Adriatic
   Sea, blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata are
   reported as a frequent phenomenon linked to particular environmental
   conditions, including increased organic nutrient loads. Ostreopsis
   blooms typically produce a mucilaginous biofilm that can cover all
   benthic substrata. In order to clarify the role of dissolved organic
   phosphorus (DOP) in the onset and maintenance of an O. cf. ovata bloom,
   we investigated the growth rates in the presence of a range of
   phosphomonoesters (PMEs) (D-fructose 1,6-disphosphate,
   beta-glycerophosphate, alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate, guanosine
   5'-monophosphate and phytic acid) and phosphodiesters (PDEs) (DNA and
   RNA). Levels of both phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) and phosphodiesterase
   (PDEase) activities were assessed in the O. cf. ovata biofilms. The
   results showed that O. cf. ovata growth is not inhibited in media
   containing a wide range of DOP and diverse ratios of PME:PDE compared to
   those containing inorganic phosphorus. Much of the hydrolytic activity
   was associated with bacteria and with extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPSs). Our findings suggest that the success of O. cf. ovata stems from
   the collective participation of all components of the biofilm (O. cf.
   ovata, EPSs and bacteria) that allows it to thrive in phosphorus-limited
   environments, but where the main source of phosphorus is organic.},

Title = {Phosphate diester utilization by marine diazotrophs Trichodesmium
   erythraeum and Crocosphaera watsonii},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {211-218},
Abstract = {In the phosphate-depleted oligotrophic ocean, microbes utilize various
   dissolved organic phosphorus (P) compounds as alternative P sources,
   using enzymes such as alkaline phos-phatases. However, knowledge of such
   P acquisition mechanisms is limited, especially in association with the
   physiology of nitrogen-fixing organisms, which play a substantial role
   in marine biogeochemical cycling. We show that nonaxenic clonal cultures
   of 2 oceanic diazotrophs, Trichodesmium erythraeum and Crocosphaera
   watsonii, have the ability to utilize phosphate diester as their sole P
   source, using a model artificial compound-bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate
   (bisNPP). Although both diazotroph cultures likely preferred phosphate
   monoester to diester, the expressed diesterase activity was
   theoretically sufficient to fulfill their P demands, and they showed
   significant growth in bisNPP-added media. Interestingly, a distinct
   difference in their growth trends was observed, with faster onset of
   growth by C. watsonii and delayed onset of growth by T. erythraeum. This
   indicates that the C. watsonii consortium can effectively and rapidly
   assimilate in situ diesters as alternative P sources in the field.
   Nonetheless, when considering the poor bisNPP utilization reported from
   other marine phytoplankton taxa, our results indicate that the
   utilization of particular diester compounds is a notable and
   advantageous strategy for both diazotroph consortia to alleviate P
   limitation in the oligotrophic ocean.},

Title = {Microbial diversity in marine sediments of two hydrocarbon reservoir

Abstract = {Microbes are the main drivers of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and
   other elements in marine sediments. The distribution of microorganisms,
   particularly at the centimeter scale, demonstrates the critical role of
   the local biogeochemical environment. The Atlantic Ocean has enormous
   hydrocarbon reserves, yet microbial diversity in hydrocarbon reservoir
   areas, a unique habitat for microorganisms, remains poorly studied. We
   investigated microbial diversity of sediments from the Gulf of Guinea
   and the Namibia Slope, 2 oil and gas reservoir areas of the eastern
   Atlantic Ocean. Microbial diversity was paired with geochemical analyses
   and provided valuable information in understanding and interpreting the
   bacterial and archaeal community structure. Environmental factors,
   especially dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and SO42-, drove the
   microbial community structure in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Methane
   oxidation may be coupled with the reduction of sulfate on the
   continental slope of the Gulf of Guinea, or with nitrate reduction on
   the Namibia Slope. The sediments there provide a suitable habitat for
   microbes. However, the composition of microbial communities varied among
   sites. The microbial diversity and richness in the Gulf of Guinea was
   high, which may correspond to the high concentration of metal ions. The
   metabolism of Gammaproteobacteria may respond to the concentration of
   SO42- and DIC. Asgardarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota could play an
   important role in carbon reactions, and the abundance and metabolism of
   Lokiarchaeota may be related to the concentration of metal ions. These
   findings revealed the microbial diversity and represented a baseline of
   the microbial communities and constriction in this critical area.},

Title = {The microbiome of the seagrass Halophila ovalis: community structuring
   from plant parts to regional scales},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {139-150},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Seagrass meadows are critical marine ecosystems. They are significant
   carbon sinks and play numerous important roles in coastal areas. They
   help to prevent shoreline erosion and serve as nursery grounds for many
   marine species. Like their terrestrial counterparts, seagrasses form
   symbiotic relationships with diverse communities of bacteria that help
   to promote and maintain host fitness. In this study, we sampled the
   seagrass Halophila ovalis throughout Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia
   to characterise the associated bacterial communities and distributions
   in this acknowledged seagrass biodiversity hotspot. Three different
   parts of the seagrass (leaves, roots and rhizomes) were collected, and a
   sediment sample was collected in close proximity to each host. We used
   high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to examine the bacterial
   communities associated with each plant part and location. Our analyses
   indicated that bacterial assemblages associated with H. ovalis were
   distinct among locations, and different plant parts harboured divergent
   bacterial communities. We uncovered a significant distance-decay
   relationship, suggesting that dispersal limitations could explain the
   observed bacterial community structuring. We further identified
   bacterial indicator amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were
   associated with degraded or healthy seagrass meadows. The identification
   of indicator ASVs that are indicative of anthropogenically stressed
   seagrass, or a declining environment, could be used to implement
   proactive seagrass conservation and management schemes. This study
   addresses a current scientific gap within the characterisation of
   seagrass microbiomes, specifically of those from Southeast Asia, a
   region of acute seagrass losses, and provides a solid foundation for
   future seagrass research in the region.},

Abstract = {Among the germination affecting factors, germination ecology (GME) and
   seed cleaning stage (SCS) are not well investigated. Hence, this study
   was initiated to evaluate the GME and SCS effect on the seed germination
   performance of two indigenous bamboo species. Pure and impure seed
   samples were taken from the cold room which is adjusted to 5 ??C. Then
   they were sown on prepared media under different conditions. Then the
   GP, MGT, and PV data were computed and then subjected to ANOVA. The
   ANOVA showed that the interaction effect of genotype, GME treatments,
   and SCS was very high (P ??? 0.0001) significant for all studied
   parameters. The germination pattern differences were also observed in
   SCS and GME treatments for both species. Signifi-cantly higher GP (59\%)
   and PV (8.4) were recorded in pure seeds sowed on paper at ambient
   temperature (T1) for O. abyssinica. On the same GME, Y. alpina gave the
   maximum GP (38\%) and PV (2.3) using pure seed. However, significantly
   higher MGT (9) was recorded on GME T1 and T2 using impure seed. Hence,
   pure seed sowed on paper at ambient temperature is advisable for in
   vitro germination test. However, GME having sand media at optimum
   temperature is recommended due to cost-effectiveness and is applicable
   at the community level for seedling production.},

Pages = {383-396},
Abstract = {The mountain ecosystem is a perfect podium to investigate the impact of
   climate change on overall community structure and species composition.
   The Potohar region in Pakistan was chosen to study changes in
   grass-species diversity and the distributional pattern along an
   altitudinal range of 1000 m (from 400 m to 1400 m). The major objectives
   of the study were to prepare grass-species listing and species
   composition, and patterns of their dominance and distribution at various
   habitats. Three sites separated by a distance of 50 km were selected at
   each altitude and three transect lines (each of 100 m) were laid at a
   distance of 500 m. Then five sub-transect lines were laid at distance of
   50 m on which five quadrats (1 x 1 m(2)) were laid systematically with a
   distance of 10 m between the successive quadrats. The diversity of the
   grass species is high and 114 species were recorded therein. Six
   grasses, Aristida adscensionis, Cynodon dactylon, Chrysopogon
   serrulatus, Cymbopogon jwarancusa, Dichanthium annulatum and Panicum
   orientale, are widely distributed at all altitudinal ranges. Species
   like A. adscensionis, Cenchrus ciliaris, C. jwarancusa, C. dactylon,
   Ochthochloa compressa, Panicum antidotale, Paspalum distichum and
   Phragmites karka dominate because of their high degree of tolerance to
   multiple stresses. These dominant grasses are highly palatable and
   support livestock and endemic wildlife species. The distributional range
   of other grasses is altitudinal-specific and is directly linked to the
   physiographic parameters and climate variables that influence species
   richness, dominance, community structure and species distributional
   pattern along altitudinal gradients. Over-harvesting for essential oil
   and other medicinal purposes are identified as major threats to species
   like Cymbopogon martini and Chrysopogon zizanioides. The findings of
   this study are useful in investigating the composition of grass species
   of the sub-mountainous rangelands and in developing conservation
   strategies for rare and endangered species in future studies.},

Abstract = {Xenarthrans (armadillos, anteaters, sloths, and their extinct relatives)
   are unique among mammals in displaying a distinctive specialization of
   the posterior trunk vertebrae-supernumerary vertebral xenarthrous
   articulations. This study seeks to understand how xenarthry develops
   through ontogeny and if it may be constrained to appear within
   pre-existing vertebral regions. Using three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics on the neural arches of vertebrae, we explore phenotypic,
   allometric, and disparity patterns of the different axial morphotypes
   during the ontogeny of nine-banded armadillos. Shape-based
   regionalization analyses showed that the adult thoracolumbar column is
   divided into three regions according to the presence or absence of ribs
   and the presence or absence of xenarthrous articulations. A three-region
   division was retrieved in almost all specimens through development,
   although younger stages (e.g., fetuses, neonates) have more region
   boundary variability. In size-based regionalization analyses,
   thoracolumbar vertebrae are separated into two regions: a
   prediaphragmatic, prexenarthrous region, and a postdiaphragmatic
   xenarthrous region. We show that posterior thoracic vertebrae grow at a
   slower rate, while anterior thoracics and lumbars grow at a faster rate
   relatively, with rates decreasing anteroposteriorly in the former and
   increasing anteroposteriorly in the latter. We propose that different
   proportions between vertebrae and vertebral regions might result from
   differences in growth pattern and timing of ossification.},

Title = {A quick evaluation of ecological restoration based on arthropod
   communities and trophic guilds in an urban ecological preserve in Mexico
   City},

Abstract = {Background Restoration practices usually emphasize on the structural
   part of the biodiversity; also, most studies have focused on plants and
   very few have been conducted on arthropods and its function after
   restoration. The Pedregal de San Angel Ecological Reserve (PSAER) is a
   protected area immersed in Mexico City and it has been drastically
   affected by different anthropogenic disturbances. The aim of this study
   was to compare the relative diversity, richness, and abundance of
   species level identification, but also the composition through an
   analysis of ordination of taxonomic (species, family, and order level)
   and functional (trophic guild) traits of arthropods in three sites
   subjected to ecological restoration within the PSAER. Restored sites
   were also compared to conserved and disturbed sites, to evaluate whether
   restoration efforts are effective at the reserve. Methods Arthropods
   were sampled using pan traps during September 2013 in 11 sites (three
   restored, four conserved and four disturbed) inside the PSAER. All
   sampled species were taxonomically identified at species of
   morphospecies (inside a family) and assigned to a trophic guild.
   Differences in diversity, richness and abundance were evaluated through
   effective number of species, comparisons of Chao's1 estimated richness
   and a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively. Both taxonomic
   and trophic guild composition were evaluated using a multivariate
   analysis and a post hoc test. Results We found some differences in
   richness, abundance, and diversity between sites, but not a clear
   pattern of differentiation between restored to disturbed sites. The NMDS
   showed differences at species and order level, and with trophic guilds,
   among site types. Families were not useful to differentiate types of
   sites. Regarding guilds, predators were more abundant in conserved
   sites, while phytophagous insects were more abundant in disturbed sites.
   Conclusions Species and order level were useful to identify differences
   in communities of arthropods in sites with different management. The
   trophic guild approach provides information about the functional state
   of the restored sites. Nevertheless, our quick evaluation shows that
   restoration efforts at PSAER have not been successful in differentiate
   restored to disturbed sites yet.},

Title = {Macrofauna community patterns in a Chiloe Island channel used intensely
   for aquaculture: the ecological status of its benthic environment},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Background It is known that aquaculture may produce negative
   environmental effects on marine ecosystems. Southern Chile is one of the
   most important salmon and mussel-producing areas in the world. Here we
   assess the ecological status of benthic communities near farming centers
   in Caucahue Channel, Chiloe, which has been used intensely for salmon
   and mussel production for 30 years. Methods The macrofauna, sediments
   and water column were characterized at distances of 5 to 100 m from
   three salmon and three mussel-producing centers. Information was also
   obtained from reference sites 500 to 3000 m from these aquaculture
   farms. The macrofauna and environmental conditions during winter were
   analyzed using uni- and multivariate analysis and the AZTI Marine Biotic
   Index (AMBI) as an indicator of benthic community condition. Results (i)
   There is a high degree of spatial dissimilarity in macrofauna and
   environmental variables among sampling sites and types of environments
   (far from or near farming centers) and between the northern and southern
   areas of the channel; (ii) sediment structure (mean grain size and
   percentage of total organic matter) correlated with the observed
   dissimilarities in macrofauna communities; and (iii) the level of
   perturbation according to AMBI was heterogeneous, with sites in the
   undisturbed/normal range to moderately disturbed/polluted. Conclusions
   We found a high spatial dissimilarity in benthic macrofauna and
   environmental variables among sampling sites, environmental types and
   between the northern and southern areas of the channel. AMBI and
   multivariate community-environment analysis are useful tools to define
   the level of perturbation of a geographic area at different spatial
   scales, using all the ecological information from each sample and
   replicates.},

Title = {Evaluation of the mycobiome of ballast water and implications for fungal
   pathogen distribution},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {149-160},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Marine transport has the potential to alter the geographic range of
   microorganisms through ballast water movement. Recent
   culture-independent studies investigated the bacteriome of ballast
   water, but no prior studies have examined the mycobiome. Here were
   examined 60 ballast and harbor samples from 4 major ports and 5 ocean
   samples using culture-independent techniques to determine (1) the
   composition of harbor and ballast water mycobiomes; (2) if ballast
   contained human and environmentally relevant fungal pathogens; and (3)
   the potential risk of introduction to coastal ecosystems. Results
   indicate that ballast water and harbor water contain a diverse mycobiome
   and that ballast water may contain fungal taxa that are relevant human
   and marine fish pathogens. Fungal genera were identified that contain
   known coral and coastal plant pathogen species; however, species-level
   identification of these potential pathogens could not be conclusively
   resolved. Ballast and harbor mycobiomes contained similar taxa,
   suggesting that environmental filtering may not inhibit the spread of
   fungal taxa between these ecosystems. This study highlights the
   potential risks of ballast movement and suggests further research of the
   ballast mycobiome is needed.},

Title = {Bacterial community dynamics during a harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma
   akashiwo},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {153-167},
Abstract = {Phytoplankton bloom events result in distinct changes in the composition
   and availability of nutrients as well as physical conditions within
   aquatic ecosystems, resulting in significant effects on bacterial
   communities. Using a metabarcoding approach, this study investigated the
   effect of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Heterosigma akashiwo in the
   Sundays Estuary, South Africa, on bacterial community structures in this
   estuarine ecosystem over an entire bloom event. The occurrence of
   bacterial lineages occurring in both the oxygen-rich surface water and
   hypoxic bottom waters in this study reflects the respiratory flexibility
   and potential for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism across a wide
   range of bacterial phylogenetic lineages. A close correlation between
   the bacterial community profiles and the physiological state of the
   bloom was observed, with Flavobacteria found in increased relative
   abundances during the H. akashiwo HAB. Flavobacteria are commonly
   reported in the literature associated with algal blooms, which is
   indicative of their central role in the degradation of algal-derived
   organic matter. Halieaceae were prevalent during the bloom, whilst
   Synechococcales, Cryomorphaceae and Sporichthyaceae were found to be
   positively correlated with the decay of the H. akashiwo bloom.
   Rhodobacteraceae correlated significantly with the H. akashiwo bloom;
   however, unlike the Rhodobacteraceae specific bloom-associated genera
   reported in literature (predominantly Roseobacter), up to 74 \% of the
   Rhodobacteraceae sequence reads in this study were assigned to the genus
   Litorimicrobium. The distinct bacterial community profiles recorded
   throughout the H. akashiwo HAB can be attributed to the influence of the
   bloom-forming species as well as under-representation of
   estuarine-occurring HABs in the literature.},

Title = {Microbial and nutrient dynamics in mangrove, reef, and seagrass waters
   over tidal and diurnal time scales},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {101-119},
Abstract = {In coral reefs and adjacent seagrass meadow and mangrove environments,
   short temporal scales (i.e. tidal, diurnal) may have important
   influences on ecosystem processes and community structure, but these
   scales are rarely investigated. This study examines how tidal and
   diurnal forcings influence pelagic microorganisms and nutrient dynamics
   in 3 important and adjacent coastal biomes: mangroves, coral reefs, and
   seagrass meadows. We sampled for microbial (Bacteria and Archaea)
   community composition, cell abundances and environmental parameters at 9
   coastal sites on St. John, US Virgin Islands that spanned 4 km in
   distance (4 coral reefs, 2 seagrass meadows and 3 mangrove locations
   within 2 larger bays). Eight samplings occurred over a 48 h period,
   capturing day and night microbial dynamics over 2 tidal cycles. The
   seagrass and reef biomes exhibited relatively consistent environmental
   conditions and microbial community structure but were dominated by
   shifts in picocyanobacterial abundances that were most likely attributed
   to diel dynamics. In contrast, mangrove ecosystems exhibited substantial
   daily shifts in environmental parameters, heterotrophic cell abundances
   and microbial community structure that were consistent with the tidal
   cycle. Differential abundance analysis of mangrove-associated
   microorganisms revealed enrichment of pelagic oligotrophic taxa during
   high tide and enrichment of putative sediment-associated microbes during
   low tide. Our study underpins the importance of tidal and diurnal time
   scales in structuring coastal microbial and nutrient dynamics, with diel
   and tidal cycles contributing to a highly dynamic microbial environment
   in mangroves, and time of day likely contributing to microbial dynamics
   in seagrass and reef biomes.},

   distribution along environmental gradients of Tulu Lafto Forest (here
   after called TLF) in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone of Oromia National
   Regional State, western Ethiopia. Seventy-five quadrats of 400 m(2) were
   systematically laid following altitudinal gradient. A complete list of
   trees, shrubs, lianas and herbs including vascular epiphytes were made
   from each quadrat. Environmental variables including soil samples were
   collected, recorded and analyzed for each quadrat. In the forest, 230
   plant species belonging to 188 genera and 79 families were identified.
   Out of these, 16 species are endemic to the flora of Ethiopia and
   Eritrea and 56 were new records for Wollega (WG) floristic region.
   Asteraceae and Fabaceae are the top species rich plant families. Cluster
   analysis and ordination methods identified 3 plant community types
   mainly influenced by topographic, edaphic and anthropogenic factors. TLF
   exhibited an intermediate Afromontane type suggesting the need to revise
   the existing vegetation classification in the country.},

Title = {Microbial communities (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes) in a temperate
   estuary during seasonal hypoxia},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {61-79},
Abstract = {Eutrophication and hypoxia markedly alter trophic dynamics and nutrient
   cycling in estuarine water columns, but little is known about the
   microbial communities that drive and interact with these changes. Here
   we studied microbial plankton (bacteria, archaea, protists and
   micro-metazoans) in a large temperate estuary where bottom hypoxia
   occurs every summer due to warmer temperatures, stratification, and
   oxidation of organic matter fueled by nutrient enrichment. We used
   high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes (V4 region) and
   quantified multiple abiotic and biotic factors in surface and bottom
   waters during the summer of 2019. The conditions associated with the
   intensification of hypoxia in bottom waters as the summer progressed
   were linked to significant changes in the diversity, community structure
   and potential functioning of microbial communities. Under maximum
   hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration: 0.9-3.1 mg 1(-1)), there were
   increased proportions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacterivorous
   and parasitic protists, and copepod nauplii. Sequence proportions of AOA
   (Nitrosopumilus) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospinaceae) were
   significantly correlated with the concentration of oxidized N species
   (nitrite plus nitrate, which peaked at 14.4 mu M) and the proportions of
   nauplii DNA sequences and biomass. Our data support a tight coupling of
   biogeochemical and food web processes, with rapid oxidation of ammonia
   and accumulation of oxidized N species as hypoxia intensifies during the
   summer.},

Title = {The role of nutrients in promoting a bloom of the nuisance raphidophyte
   species Gonyostomum semen in a subtropical reservoir},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {47-62},
Abstract = {The nuisance raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen (Ehrenberg) Diesing blooms
   in lakes and is known to produce a mucilage which can cause human skin
   irritation. Parameters such as water temperature, iron and high
   dissolved organic matter loads are shown to be important drivers in
   temperate regions. However, the causes of blooms in warmer latitudes are
   less well understood. Over a 6 mo study period, we used field monitoring
   and a nutrient addition experiment within a water reservoir to examine
   the role of nutrients in promoting G. semen growth. Early in the study,
   an inflow event delivered nutrients which increased dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen (DIN) concentrations 2-fold and filterable reactive phosphorus
   (FRP = phosphate) 4-fold. This event shifted the phytoplankton community
   from a mixed community to one dominated by G. semen. Two months after
   the inflow event, the effect of nutrients in promoting G. semen was
   confirmed with a nutrient addition experiment. Total biovolumes of this
   species across the study were strongly predicted by FRP and nitrate +
   nitrite concentrations. G. semen biovolumes also decreased as ratios of
   total nitrogen (TN):total phosphorus (TP) and DIN:FRP increased,
   highlighting the importance of P inputs. The stable isotope tracer 15
   N-nitrate was also used to trace N through the G. semen-dominated
   phytoplankton community. The tracer rapidly cycled through the G.
   semen-dominated phytoplankton community in 1-2 d, settled and
   remineralized, providing an ongoing source of DIN for maintaining
   blooms. Overall, the results highlight the importance of FRP, and to a
   lesser extent nitrate, in promoting blooms of this nuisance species.},

Title = {Refugial peatlands in the Northern Apennines. Vegetation-environment
   relationships and future perspectives},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {275-298},
Abstract = {Aims: We aimed to detect the environmental drivers conditioning plant
   diversity and to predict how modifications in habitat conditions and
   ongoing global warming could lead to vegetation changes or biodiversity
   losses in a region especially rich in peatlands despite its relatively
   low latitude. Study area: The study area was located in the Northern
   Apennines, Northern Italy (about 44 degrees 45' N; 10 degrees 20' E).
   The vegetation study was carried out at 12 peatland sites where 206
   plots were set up. Species composition in the 206 plots were recorded in
   the field and classified with cluster analysis. Data on hydrology, water
   chemistry and peat chemistry were collected at a subset of 127 plots and
   statistically analysed by a multivariate ordination method. Species
   richness and evenness were calculated for all plots. Relationships
   between species composition and environmental variables were analysed by
   stepwise multiple regression. Results: The cluster analysis defined 17
   vegetation units. Water table depth represented the major environmental
   factors accounting for vegetation patterns, with the vegetation units
   being grouped in four main blocks based on vegetation physiognomy and
   species composition: Sphagnum hummocks, Sphagnum lawns, fens and pools.
   Water chemistry and peat chemistry both presented moderate variations
   among the vegetation units with mean water pH ranging from 4.9 to 6.3.
   Concentrations of major cations in the pore water showed that all of the
   habitats investigated were influenced by telluric water, with no
   evidence of ombrotrophic conditions. Species richness and evenness both
   presented poor relations with the environment while responses of
   individual species to environmental factors were more informative on
   vegetation changes triggered by climate change. Conclusions: Prolonged
   drought events associated with high temperature in summer months are
   expected to exert a strong impact on peatland vegetation. The main
   effect of climate change on the vegetation of the peatlands investigated
   consists in the spreading of vascular plants at the expense of Sphagnum
   mosses.},

Title = {Impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on plankton ciliates from a
   saline lowland river in South America},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {43-59},
Abstract = {We analyzed the structure and dynamics of plankton ciliates from the
   Salado River, Buenos Aires (Argentina), during El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation events, to evaluate their response to alterations of certain
   environmental variables during these climatic phenomena. The basin
   exhibits intense land use at the headwaters and fluctuating salinity
   along the main channel, canals and tributaries. During El Nino
   (1997-1998), heavy rainfall caused high discharge, and low mean
   conductivity values were recorded along with low mean abundances in the
   entire basin. During neutral (2004-2005) and La Nina (2007-2009) events,
   the discharge was reduced, and mean conductivity was double the values
   recorded during El Nino, with maxima of mean abundances and diversity at
   the headwaters and the lower basin. The most abundant ciliates were
   tintinnids, heterotrichs and peritrichs. Species replacement was
   detected along the river system, mainly during the neutral event. At the
   headwaters and canals, abundance peaks of certain species were
   attributed to the strong human impact (nutrients and sewage inputs) and
   increased salinity, allowing the establishment of euryhaline ciliates.
   In the middle basin, freshwater species predominated, although less
   abundantly due to higher water flow. The mouth sector showed abundance
   peaks of an estuarine tintinnid. Temperature, conductivity and suspended
   solids were the most important variables driving ciliate structure. High
   discharge as a result of heavy rainfall during El Nino negatively
   influenced ciliate assemblages. In contrast, low water conditions during
   the other events allowed the development of diverse assemblages,
   increasing species number and abundance of particular species.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aquatic organisms rely on microbial symbionts for coping with various
   challenges they encounter during stress and for defending themselves
   against predators, pathogens and parasites. Microbial symbionts are also
   often indispensable for the host's development or life cycle completion.
   Many aquatic ecosystems are currently under pressure due to diverse
   human activities that have a profound impact on ecosystem functioning.
   These human activities are also expected to alter interactions between
   aquatic hosts and their associated microbes. This can directly impact
   the host's health and-given the importance and widespread occurrence of
   microbial symbiosis in aquatic systems-the ecosystem at large. In this
   review, we provide an overview of the importance of microbial symbionts
   for aquatic organisms, and we consider how the beneficial services
   provided by microbial symbionts can be affected by human activities. The
   scarcity of available studies that assess the functional consequences of
   human impacts on aquatic microbial symbioses shows that our knowledge on
   this topic is currently limited, making it difficult to draw general
   conclusions and predict future changes in microbial symbiont-host
   relationships in a changing world. To address this important knowledge
   gap, we provide an overview of approaches that can be used to assess the
   impact of human disturbances on the functioning of aquatic microbial
   symbioses.},

Title = {New insights on plant communities and flora of the southern paramos of
   the Iberian Range (Spain)},
Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {371-382},
Abstract = {Aims: In the Iberian Peninsula, high and flat areas called `paramos' are
   of great ecological interest, due to their unique but little known plant
   and animal communities. In this work, we contribute to the knowledge of
   plant composition and carry out a classification of plant communities in
   central Iberian natural `paramos'. Study area: Two Special Areas of
   Conservation (Natura 2000 Network) in Southern Soria (Spain): `Altos de
   Barahona' and `Paramo de Layna'. Methods: We sampled the vegetation
   (plant cover) in 345 plots of 1 m2 in the two `paramos' considered. A
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering of samples and an indicator value
   (IndVal) analysis were performed to classify the plant communities and
   to determine the most characteristic species of each community. Results:
   A total of 193 species, mainly chamaephytes, were found. Most of these
   are species of Mediterranean biogeographical affinity, with a high
   percentage of Iberian endemism. Plots were hierarchically classified
   into three main clusters, which in turn, successfully aggregated into
   seven subclusters reflecting characteristic visually-known plant
   communities of these `paramos': grassland-thyme scrublands of Thymus
   mastigophorus; savory scrublands of Satureja intricata; two types of
   mixed communities dominated by continental basophilic shrubs; gorse
   shrublands of Genista pumila subsp. rigidissima; praire-thyme scrublands
   of Thymus zygis subsp. zygis; and sage scrublands of Salvia
   lavandulifolia subsp. lavandulifolia. These plant communities, located
   in unique landscapes mainly in Iberia and other parts of Europe, should
   be subject to conservation and restoration measures, in order to
   maintain their ecological value and avoid the loss of unique species.},

Title = {Within-individual leaf allometry and the evolution of leaf morphology: A
   multilevel analysis of leaf allometry in temperate Viburnum (Adoxaceae)
   species},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {145-157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A critical issue in evolutionary biology is understanding the
   relationship between macroevolutionary patterns of diversity and the
   origin of variation at the organismal level. Among-individual allometry,
   the relationship between the size and shape of a structure among
   organisms at a fixed developmental stage, is often similar to
   evolutionary allometry, the relationship between the size and shape of a
   structure among populations or species, and the genetic and
   developmental process that underlie allometric relationships at both
   levels are thought to influence evolutionary diversification. Metameric
   organisms present an additional level of allometry: the relationship
   between the size and shape of structures within individuals. We propose
   that within-individual allometry is also related to evolutionary
   diversification among metameric organisms. We explore this idea in
   temperate deciduous Viburnum (Adoxaceae) species that bear two types of
   leaves, that is, preformed and neoformed leaves, with contrasting
   patterns of development. Examination of within-individual,
   among-individual, among-population, and among-species allometry of leaf
   shape in both leaf types showed that the slopes of all allometric
   relationships were significantly different from isometry, and their sign
   was consistent across allometric hierarchies. Although the allometric
   slope of preformed leaves was constant across allometry levels, the
   allometric slope of neoformed leaves became increasingly steeper. We
   suggest that allometric variation underlying evolutionary
   diversification in metameric organisms may manifest among individuals
   and also among their repeated structures. Moreover, structures with
   contrasting patterns of development within metameric organisms can
   experience different degrees of developmental constraint, and this can
   in turn affect morphological diversification.},

Title = {Inheritance of DNA methylation differences in the mangrove Rhizophora

Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {351-374},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The capacity to respond to environmental challenges ultimately relies on
   phenotypic variation which manifests from complex interactions of
   genetic and nongenetic mechanisms through development. While we know
   something about genetic variation and structure of many species of
   conservation importance, we know very little about the nongenetic
   contributions to variation. Rhizophora mangle is a foundation species
   that occurs in coastal estuarine habitats throughout the neotropics
   where it provides critical ecosystem functions and is potentially
   threatened by anthropogenic environmental changes. Several studies have
   documented landscape-level patterns of genetic variation in this
   species, but we know virtually nothing about the inheritance of
   nongenetic variation. To assess one type of nongenetic variation, we
   examined the patterns of DNA sequence and DNA methylation in maternal
   plants and offspring from natural populations of R. mangle from the Gulf
   Coast of Florida. We used a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
   approach (epi-genotyping by sequencing; epiGBS) to address the following
   questions: (a) What are the levels of genetic and epigenetic diversity
   in natural populations of R. mangle? (b) How are genetic and epigenetic
   variation structured within and among populations? (c) How faithfully is
   epigenetic variation inherited? We found low genetic diversity but high
   epigenetic diversity from natural populations of maternal plants in the
   field. In addition, a large portion (up to similar to 25\%) of
   epigenetic differences among offspring grown in common garden was
   explained by maternal family. Therefore, epigenetic variation could be
   an important source of response to challenging environments in the
   genetically depauperate populations of this foundation species.},

Abstract = {Environmental conditions can impact the development of phenotypes and in
   turn the performance of individuals. Climate change, therefore, provides
   a pressing need to extend our understanding of how temperature will
   influence phenotypic variation. To address this, we assessed the impact
   of increased temperatures on ecologically significant phenotypic traits
   in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). We raised Arctic charr at 5
   degrees C and 9 degrees C to simulate a predicted climate change
   scenario and examined temperature-induced variation in ossification,
   bone metabolism, skeletal morphology, and escape response. Fish reared
   at 9 degrees C exhibited less cartilage and bone development at the same
   developmental stage, but also higher bone metabolism in localized
   regions. The higher temperature treatment also resulted in significant
   differences in craniofacial morphology, changes in the degree of
   variation, and fewer vertebrae. Both temperature regime and vertebral
   number affected escape response performance, with higher temperature
   leading to decreased latency. These findings demonstrate that climate
   change has the potential to impact development through multiple routes
   with the potential for plasticity and the release of cryptic genetic
   variation to have strong impacts on function through ecological
   performance and survival.},

Volume = {87},
Pages = {17-28},

Abstract = {Zoosporic fungi play an important role in aquatic environments, but
   their diversity, especially that of parasitic fungi of phytoplankton,
   has still not been fully revealed. We conducted monthly analyses of the
   community structure of zoosporic fungi at a pelagic site in Lake Biwa,
   Japan, from May to December 2016. Metabarcoding analysis, targeted to a
   large subunit region of ribosomal DNA in the nano-size fraction of
   particles (2-20 mu m), was carried out on the samples. We also counted
   large phytoplankton and chytrid sporangia attached to the hosts. We
   detected 3 zoosporic fungal phyla (Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota
   and Cryptomycota) within 107 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), in
   which Chytridiomycota was the most diverse and abundant phylum. Few
   fungal OTUs overlapped between months, and specific communities were
   detected in each month. These results showed that diverse zoosporic
   fungi with high temporal variability inhabited the lake. Five large
   phytoplankton species were found to be infected by chytrids: Staurastrum
   dorsidentiferum, S. rotula, Closterium aciculare, Asterionella formosa
   and Aulacoseira granulata. Some chytrids were detected by metabarcoding
   analysis: Zygophlyctis asterionellae infecting A. formosa,
   Staurastromyces oculus infecting S. dorsidentiferum and Pendulichytrium
   sphaericum infecting A. granulata. One OTU detected in association with
   infected C. aciculare by microscopic counting might have been an
   obligate parasitic chytrid of C. aciculare. The results indicated that a
   combination of metabarcoding and microscopic analysis revealed more
   information on zoosporic fungi, including those that are parasitic.},

Title = {Effects of polyphenols on plankton assemblages and bacterial abundance
   representative of a pampean shallow lake: an experimental study},
Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {85-100},
Abstract = {Shallow lakes are complex environments that play an important role in
   ecology. Their relationships with the surrounding areas make these
   lentic water bodies susceptible to alterations in response to human
   activity. For example, the input of polyphenols could be critical in
   altering species interactions. The shallow lakes located in the pampean
   plain of Argentina are major reservoirs of diversity, with the
   environmental habitats of the Salado River basin in particular having
   become impacted by human activities. The aim of this work was to
   evaluate the effects of different polyphenol concentrations (i.e.
   tannins) on changes in the plankton assemblages and on the abundance of
   bacteria in San Miguel del Monte Lake. Factorial experiments under
   laboratory conditions (4 tannin concentration levels and 4 response
   times) revealed that high tannin concentrations affected neither the
   phyto- and zooplankton assemblages nor bacterial abundances. Major
   changes both in assemblages and in the bacterioplankton abundances were
   dependent on exposure time. We found that the initial food web of
   grazers shifted to detritivorous feeding, thus producing a
   simplification of the community toward early succession. Although no
   effects of polyphenols were registered here, what proved striking was
   the resilience of the system and the capability to support high tannin
   concentrations throughout the experiment. Therefore, future
   investigations are necessary to elucidate the key role of such humic
   substances in the structuring of plankton assemblages of shallow lakes
   from strongly impacted areas, such as those found in the pampean region.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology, and especially ecological
   developmental biology, is essential for discussions of sustainability
   and the responses to global climate change. First, this paper explores
   examples of animals that have successfully altered their development to
   accommodate human-made changes to their environments. We next document
   the ability of global warming to disrupt the development of those
   organisms with temperature-dependent sex-determination or with
   phenologies coordinating that organism's development with those of other
   species. The thermotolerance of Homo sapiens is also related to key
   developmental factors concerning brain development and maintenance, and
   the development of corals, the keystone organisms of tropical reefs, is
   discussed in relation to global warming as well as to other
   anthropogenic changes. While teratogenic and endocrine-disrupting
   compounds are not discussed in this essay, the ability of glyphosate
   herbicides to block insect development is highlighted. Last, the paper
   discusses the need to creatively integrate developmental biology with
   ecological, political, religious, and economic perspectives, as the
   flourishing of contemporary species may require altering the ways that
   Western science has considered the categories of nature, culture, and
   self.},

Abstract = {Humans are changing and challenging nature in many ways. Conservation
   Biology seeks to limit human impacts on nature and preserve biological
   diversity. Traditionally, Developmental Biology and Conservation Biology
   have had nonoverlapping objectives, operating in distinct spheres of
   biological science. However, this chasm can and should be filled to help
   combat the emerging challenges of the 21st century. The means by which
   to accomplish this goal were already established within the conceptual
   framework of evo- and eco-devo and can be further expanded to address
   the ways that anthropogenic disturbance affect embryonic development.
   Herein, I describe ways that these approaches can be used to advance the
   study of reptilian embryos. More specifically, I explore the ways that a
   developmental perspective can advance ongoing studies of embryonic
   physiology in the context of global warming and chemical pollution, both
   of which are known stressors of reptilian embryos. I emphasize ways that
   these developmental perspectives can inform conservation biologists
   trying to develop management practices that will address the complexity
   of challenges facing reptilian embryos.},

Title = {Modularity in the trilobite head consistent with the hypothesized
   segmental origin of the eyes},
Journal = {EVOLUTION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {177-188},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The trilobite head served multiple functions and was composed of several
   fused segments. Yet, the underlying organization of the trilobite head,
   and whether patterns are conserved across trilobites, remains unclear.
   Modeling the head as being composed of modules, or subunits that vary
   and thus have the potential to evolve semi-independently can reveal
   underlying patterns of organization. Hypotheses of modular organization
   based on the comparative developmental biology of arthropods were
   evaluated using geometric morphometrics. Two-dimensional (semi)landmark
   datasets collected from the cranidia of two Ordovician trilobite
   species, Calyptaulax annulata (Phacopida) and Cloacaspis senilis
   (Olenida sensu Adrain, 2011) were analyzed. The degree and pattern of
   modularity were assessed using the covariance ratio (CR), which compares
   the covariation within putative modules to the covariation between them,
   and the fit of different models was compared using an effect size
   measure derived from the CR. When treating the eyes as a distinct
   module, the best modular hypothesis identified for C. annulata shows the
   eyes and anteriormost region of the head integrated as a single module.
   The best modular hypotheses for C. senilis are more complex but the eyes
   still covary mostly strongly with the anterior part of the head. The
   latter is also the case for all other well-supported models for both
   species. These results can be interpreted as a developmental signal
   corresponding to the anteriormost ocular segment of early arthropods
   that is retained throughout development, despite any likely selective
   pressures related to functional needs.},

Abstract = {In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's
   comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
   117:32493, 2020a), where we reported that BCP/BCPO
   (beta-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide) in fresh horse manure is
   sufficient to drive manure rolling behavior (HMR) in giant panda and
   attenuate the cold sensitivity of mice by directly targeting and
   inhibiting transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an
   archetypical cold-activated ion channel of mammals. The main question we
   arise in this response is: ``which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO?
   Parasites or TRPM8?{''} Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling
   sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO
   concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency
   and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal
   ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced
   TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at
   low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal
   activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive
   mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the
   highly cold-correlated behavior.},

Abstract = {Allelopathic plants release secondary compounds into the soil that then
   suppress the growth of nearby plants. Allelopathy has been shown for the
   invasive Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and Bohemian knotweed (F.
   x bohemica). The aggressive and dominant invaders represent a serious
   threat to the local plant communities outside their native range. Here,
   we analysed the phenols in the knotweed rhizomes using nuclear magnetic
   resonance. We also evaluated the allelopathic potential of methanol
   extracts of F. japonica and F. x bohemica rhizomes and compared these
   with the effects of the individual knotweed phenols resveratrol,
   epicatechin and emodin, and their mixture. Rhizomes of both knotweeds
   contained similar amounts of epicatechin and emodin, with 24\% higher
   resveratrol in F. x bohemica. Only the F. x bohemica methanol extract
   inhibited radish (Raphanus sativus) seed germination. After 3 days of
   treatments with 10\% (w/v) extracts of both knotweeds, radish seedlings
   showed up to 70\% shorter roots. In contrast, root growth of seedlings
   treated with the individual phenols resveratrol, epicatechin and emodin,
   and their mixture, was inhibited by up to 30\%, similar to the 1\%
   knotweed extracts. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress also
   increased in the roots of treated seedlings, with high levels of
   malondialdehyde in particular indicating lipid peroxidation. Total
   antioxidative capacity was also increased in seedlings exposed to 0.6
   mg/mL resveratrol and emodin. This study shows higher allelopathic
   potential of the knotweed methanol extracts compared to the individual
   phenols and their mixture.},

Abstract = {The scent gland secretion of an undetermined species of Prionostemma
   from Costa Rica was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and
   shown to consist of medium-chain carboxylic acids (mainly octanoic acid)
   and a ss-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, eventually identified as myrmicacin (=
   (R)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid). While scent gland secretions in harvestmen
   have traditionally been considered to be products of de novo synthesis,
   we here provide evidence for the unusual case of sequestration-derived
   scent gland constituents: at least myrmicacin appears to be sequestered
   from leaf-cutter ants that constitute a part of the prey of the
   Prionostemma-species herein investigated. This is the first report on
   the scent gland chemistry of the sclerosomatid subfamily Gagrellinae as
   well as on a possible sequestration mechanism in harvestmen.},

Abstract = {In insects, chemical communication is the most common form of
   communication, and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are employed in
   recognition processes. In social insects, CHCs also help define colony
   identity and thus contribute to social cohesion among nestmates.
   Individuals can deposit their chemical signatures on nest surfaces. This
   information serves as a reference for newly emerged individuals and
   allows them to obtain the odor specific to their colony. This study
   examined nest chemical profiles in an inbred invasive species: the
   yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax. We demonstrated that
   nest structures (i.e., envelopes, combs, and pillars) had specific
   hydrocarbon profiles, which were colony specific. There were
   similarities between the chemical profiles of the nests and the CHC
   signatures of hornets. The loss of genetic diversity previously
   documented in the yellow-legged hornet population in France does not
   appear to have constrained nest chemical diversity.},

Abstract = {Herein as a preface to Jukar's ongoing comprehensive systematic review,
   we introduce the fossil vertebrate collection made by G. Edward Lewis in
   1932 as part of the Yale-North India Expedition to British India, and
   briefly discuss its historical and scientific significance. The
   collection, which consists of approximately 1,300 specimens collected
   from 106 sites, was made 100 years after the first fossils were reported
   by Europeans in the Siwalik deposits of the Indian subcontinent, and
   includes several important specimens, most notably fossil primates.
   Studies of the fossils collected by Lewis on this 1932 expedition have
   had a substantial and long-lasting influence on Siwalik paleontology,
   and motivated much subsequent work in this region by both western and
   local Indian and Pakistani researchers. Studies of primate specimens
   collected and first described by Lewis have also heavily influenced the
   field of paleoanthropology and debates surrounding the origin of our
   species.},

Abstract = {Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a notorious
   pest of rice, Oryza sativa L. (Poaceae). Sex pheromones and host-plant
   volatiles can trap C. medinalis separately. To improve the trap
   efficiency of synthetic sex pheromone blend, we first tested the
   synergistic effect of 8 host-plant volatiles, including 2-phenylethanol,
   1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, octanal,
   valeraldehyde, and methyl salicylate, on the attraction of C. medinalis
   to the female-produced sex pheromones in electroantennography. The
   addition of (E)-2-hexenal, methyl salicylate, valeraldehyde, and
   (Z)-3-hexenal increased electroantennogram response of C. medinalis to
   sex pheromones. Further behavioral testing in wind tunnel experiments
   indicated that additive (E)-2-hexenal or methyl salicylate stimulated
   the landing behaviors of both male and female C. medinalis compared with
   sex pheromones alone. Field evaluations showed that mixtures of sex
   pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal /methyl salicylate resulted in
   significantly higher catches to male moths than sex pheromones alone.
   Using 1:1 and 1:10 combinations of the sex pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal,
   the attraction of C. medinalis to mixtures showed a synergistic effect
   of 95\% and 110\%, respectively. Furthermore, 1:1 and 1:10 mixtures of
   the sex pheromones and methyl salicylate exhibited a synergistic effect
   of 69\% and 146\%, respectively. These results may provide the basis for
   developing efficient pest management strategies against C. medinalis
   using host-plant volatiles and insect sex pheromones.},

Title = {Biogeochemical cycling of nickel and nutrients in a natural high-density

Abstract = {The extend of biogeochemical cycling of nickel (Ni) by tropical
   hyperaccumulator plants in their native habitat is largely unknown,
   although these unusual plants are suspected to play a major role in the
   recycling of this element in ultramafic ecosystems. In this study, we
   have assessed the biogeochemical cycling of Ni (and other elements,
   including mineral nutrients) by a tropical Ni hyperaccumulator plant,
   i.e., Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi, which is one of the most promising
   species for tropical Ni agromining. The study site was a young secondary
   forest in Sabah (Malaysia) where Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi occurs as the
   dominant species on an ultramafic Cambisol. For 2 years, we monitored a
   100-m(2) plot and collected information on weather, biomass increase,
   soil fertility, water fluxes to the soil and litter fluxes for a wide
   range of elements, including Ni. The Ni cycle is mainly driven by
   internal fluxes, notably the degradation and recycling of Ni-rich
   litter. Over the period of investigation, the Ni litter flux
   corresponded to the total Ni stock of the litter (5.2 g m(-2) year(-1)).
   The results further show that Ni turnover varies significantly with the
   accumulation properties of the plant cover. This points to the major
   influence of Ni hyperaccumulator plants in building up Ni available
   stocks in the topsoils, as has also been shown in temperate ultramafic
   systems. Litterfall and throughfall contribute substantially to the
   cycling of phosphorus, sulphur and potassium in this ecosystem, with
   throughfall contributing 2-, 220- and 20-fold higher to the respective
   nutrient fluxes relative to litterfall. The magnesium:calcium ratio far
   exceeded 1 in the soil, but was < 1 in the leaves of Phyllanthus
   rufuschaneyi. The insights from this study should be taken into account
   when designing tropical agromining operations; as Ni stocks could be
   more labile than initially thought. The removal of Ni- and
   nutrients-rich biomass will likely affect available Ni (and major
   nutrients) for the next cropping seasons, and requires sustainable
   fertilisation, to be utilized to replenish depleted major nutrients.
   These findings also have major ecological implications.},

Title = {Identification and comparison of allelopathic effects from leaf and
   flower volatiles of the invasive plants Mikania micrantha},
Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Volatilization, one of the most important mechanisms of the allelopathic
   effects of an exotic noxious weed Mikania micrantha, has not been
   adequately investigated to date. In this study, laboratory bioassays
   showed that the effects of volatiles from the leaves and flowers of M.
   micrantha on seed germination and seedling growth were negative for all
   four tested plants (Lactuca sativa, Chrysanthemum coronarium, Bidens
   pilosa, Abutilon theophrasti). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the
   leaf volatiles was generally greater than that of the flower volatiles.
   To assess the reason for the above differences and further explore which
   compounds played the most crucial roles, the volatiles from the two
   tissues were absorbed by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and
   identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Then, 19
   and 10 terpenes were determined respectively. alpha-Terpineol,
   beta-ocimene, beta-myrcene, alpha-pinene and caryophyllene had the
   maximum differences in content and concentration, which were selected
   for further bioassays with B. pilosa. The results indicated that
   morphological indices and SOD activity decreased with increasing
   concentrations of chemicals, whereas the contents of chlorophyll,
   soluble protein and MDA represented adverse changes. In addition,
   significant responses were observed in the treatments with
   alpha-terpineol at 1.0 mu L center dot L-1 and lower concentrations,
   while similar trends were observed in the treatments with beta-ocimene,
   beta-myrcene, alpha-pinene and caryophyllene at 10 mu L center dot L-1
   and higher concentrations. It was concluded that terpenoids released
   through volatilization have an important role in the allelopathic effect
   of M. micrantha, and the oxygenated monoterpene alpha-terpineol played a
   crucial role in these effects.},

Title = {Soybean leaf age and plant stage influence expression of resistance to
   velvetbean caterpillar and fall armyworm},
Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {377-390},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Numerous species of herbivorous insects are associated with soybeans,
   including the specialist velvetbean caterpillar (VBC), Anticarsia
   gemmatalis, and the generalist fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera
   frugiperda. Expression of plant resistance is influenced by factors
   intrinsic to host plants, such as leaf age and plant stage, which can
   differentially affect specialist and generalist insects due to varying
   levels of plant defense and corresponding insect adaptation. In this
   study, four experiments were carried out to test the hypotheses that
   levels of antibiosis-resistance to VBC and FAW in the resistant genotype
   PI 227,687 and susceptible genotype IGRA RA 626 RR are related to leaf
   age and plant stage of soybean. Furthermore, the concentrations of
   nutrients and selected flavonoids were quantified to give insights into
   possible chemical mechanisms underlying the resistance. As results,
   development of VBC and FAW were negatively affected when larvae fed
   leaves of the resistant genotype, older leaves from the lower part of
   plants, or leaves from reproductive-stage soybeans. The effects were
   partly different for each insect species, and the generalist FAW was
   more affected by higher resistance levels in the older leaves of soybean
   than the specialist VBC. Distribution and concentrations of nutrients
   and flavonoids in soybean in function of leaf age and plant stage may
   explain the varying levels of antibiosis-resistance to VBC and FAW.
   These results can benefit developments of specific protocols for
   screening resistant soybean genotypes and pest management strategies
   focused in plant parts and growth stages that insect-resistance levels
   are lowest.},

Abstract = {Two components of the Synanthedonbicingulata sex pheromone,

   investigate the effect of pheromone blends, trap type and trap color on
   the capture of S.bicingulata males. The optimal sex pheromone ratio for
   E3,Z13-18:OAc and Z3,Z13-18:OAc was approximately 4.3:5.7 based on the
   purity of the two pheromone components in all test areas. A significant
   difference was observed in the number of S.bicingulata adult males
   caught in bucket and delta traps. The mean numbers of males caught in
   bucket and delta traps were 13.2 +/- 2.2 and 7.6 +/- 2.0, respectively.
   Trap color affected the number of adult males caught in bucket traps.
   More adult males were attracted to a yellow bucket trap than to green,
   white, blue, black and red traps. An analysis of the relationship
   between trap capture and trap surface-color values (L{*}a{*}b{*})
   revealed a positive relationship between trap capture and b{*} value.},

Title = {Blepharidium guatemalense, an obligate nickel hyperaccumulator plant

Abstract = {Nickel hyperaccumulation in Blepharidium guatemalense Standl.
   (Rubiaceae) was found in the tropical forests of south-eastern Mexico.
   This study aimed to document the geographic extent of nickel
   hyperaccumulation in this species, to understand its process of
   hyperaccumulation and to explore nickel distribution within the tissues
   of this plant. To accomplish these objectives, a complete
   non-destructive elemental screening of herbarium specimens was performed
   with a hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Besides, rhizosphere
   soils and plant tissues were collected in Mexico and analyzed for
   physical-chemical parameters. Finally, elemental distribution maps of
   nickel and other elements in plant tissues were obtained by X-ray
   fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. This study revealed that
   Blepharidium guatemalense is distributed throughout Chiapas, Tabasco and
   Campeche, reaching the maximum nickel concentration in leaves (4.3 wt\%)
   followed by roots and seeds (2.0 wt\%) and bark (1.8 wt\%). Simultaneous
   hyperaccumulation of cobalt and nickel was found in 15\% of the
   herbarium specimens. Blepharidium guatemalense has uncommon
   re-distribution mechanisms via phloem since this tissue is the highest
   nickel-enriched from all parts of the plant (from roots to leaves). A
   high total nickel (mean of 610 mu g g(-1)) was found in rhizosphere
   soils even though no evidence of ophiolite emplacement in that area has
   been reported. Blepharidium guatemalense represents the first
   hypernickelophore (> 1 wt\% Ni) to be reported as growing in soils that
   are neither ultramafic nor enriched by anthropogenic pollutants.},

Abstract = {Percina freemanorum, the Etowah Bridled Darter, is described as a new
   species endemic to the Etowah River system in Georgia, specifically in
   Long Swamp Creek, Amicalola Creek, and the upper portion of the Etowah
   River. The earliest collection records for Percina freemanorum date to
   1948 and in 2007 the species was delimited as populations of Percina
   kusha. Our investigation into the systematics of Percina kusha is
   motivated by the uncertain status of populations in the Coosawattee
   River system and observed morphological disparity in several meristic
   traits between populations in the Conasauga and Etowah River systems.
   Our analyses of morphological divergence, nuclear genotypes, and
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype networks confirm the distinctiveness
   of Percina freemanorum. Morphologically, Percina freemanorum is
   distinguished from Percina kusha through lower average numbers of
   lateral line scales (65.4 vs. 72.3); rows of transverse scales (18.0 vs.
   21.4); scales around the caudal peduncle (22.1 vs. 24.9); and modally
   more pectoral fin rays (14 vs. 13). The two species are not reciprocally
   monophyletic in phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences, but the two
   species do not share mtDNA haplotypes. Analysis of up to 158,000 double
   digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing loci resolve
   each of the two species as reciprocally monophyletic and genomic
   clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms identifies two
   genetic clusters that correspond to the morphologically delimited
   Percina freemanorum and Percina kusha.},

Title = {Pedal Skeletal Proportions of Bipedal and Potentially Bipedal Dinosaurs
   and Other Archosaurs: Interpreting the Makers of Early Mesozoic
   Footprints},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {33-90},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic
   continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be
   associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of
   some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed)
   footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most
   paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some
   workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph
   ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is
   usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead
   attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a
   pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of
   the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal
   dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously
   available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those
   of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges
   from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of
   both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of
   prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter
   unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal
   sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these
   features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit
   I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some
   pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all)
   morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been
   made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to
   determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bark beetles of the genus Polygraphus have recently been involved in
   large bark beetle outbreaks in central Sweden, together with the
   European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. Three species of
   Polygraphus can be found in this region; Polygraphus poligraphus,
   Polygraphus punctifrons and Polygraphus subopacus. Efficient pheromone
   traps would facilitate further investigations of these species and their
   role in bark beetle outbreaks. Pheromone compounds have previously been
   identified in P. poligraphus and P. punctifrons, but not in P.
   subopacus. Thus, we allowed males and females of P. subopacus to bore in
   the bark of stem sections of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in the
   laboratory. Volatile organic compounds from boring insects were sampled
   with SPME and analysed with GC-MS and several male-specific compounds
   were observed. The male specific compounds were 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol,
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-2-butenal, grandisol, fragranol,
   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol,

   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde,
   (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde, geranial and
   gamma-isogeraniol. (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol,
   {[}(Z)-DMCHE], was identified from GC-MS analysis to be the major
   male-specific compound while the (E)-isomer, {[}(E)-DMCHE], was found as
   a minor compound. These two compounds gave positive responses in EAG
   analyses with antennae from males and females of P. subopacus. Thus,
   (Z)- and (E)-DMCHE were used in a field experiment in central Sweden but
   only (Z)-DMCHE was found to be attractive to males and females of P.
   subopacus. Consequently, (Z)-DMCHE was established to be a component of
   P. subopacus aggregation pheromone.},

Title = {Interactions of ants with native and invasive lady beetles and the role

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {323-334},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The predator-predator naivete hypothesis suggests that non-native
   predators benefit from being unknown to native predators, resulting in
   reduced intraguild interference with native predators. This novelty
   advantage should depend on the ability of native predators to recognize
   cues of non-native predators. Here, we compared ant aggression and lady
   beetle reaction in four native and the invasive lady beetle species
   Harmonia axyridis. In addition, we tested whether lady beetle cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) are involved in species recognition, which might
   explain naivete if the invasive species has a specific CHC profile. To
   this end, we conducted behavioral assays confronting two native ant
   species with both living lady beetles and lady beetle elytra bearing or
   lacking CHCs of different lady beetle species. Finally, we characterized
   CHC profiles of the lady beetles using GC-MS. In general, the aggression
   of Lasius niger was more frequent than that of Myrmica rubra and L.
   niger aggression was more frequent towards most native lady beetle
   species compared to H. axyridis. The removal of CHCs from lady beetle
   elytra reduced aggression of both ant species. If CHCs of respective
   lady beetle species were added on cue-free elytra, natural strength of
   L. niger aggression could be restored. CHC analyses revealed a distinct
   cue composition for each lady beetle species. Our experiments
   demonstrate that the presence of chemical cues on the surface of lady
   beetles contribute to the strength of ant aggression against lady
   beetles. Reduced aggression of L. niger towards H. axyridis and reduced
   avoidance behavior in H. axyridis compared to the equally voracious C.
   septempunctata might improve the invasive lady beetle's access to
   ant-tended aphids.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-40},

Abstract = {Carotenoids play multiple roles in insects, including coloration and
   protection. Most insects can obtain carotenoids only from their diet.
   Therefore, carotenoids are proposed to reflect trophic chains and
   lifestyles of insects. We investigated the mini-ecosystem of a gall on a
   hawkweed Hieracium x robustum induced by the gall wasp Aulacidea
   hieracii (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) that is attacked by parasitoid wasp
   Eurytoma cynipsea (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae). The parasitoid larvae
   consume the gall wasp larvae that consume the gall tissues. We employed
   resonance Raman spectroscopy to trace the fate of carotenoids in living
   larvae and pupae of these insects. We showed that carotenoid composition
   in the parasitoid closely corresponds to that of its diet-the gall wasp.
   On the contrary, carotenoid composition in the gall wasp was independent
   of that in the gall tissues, and the carotenoid concentration increases
   as non-feeding larvae mature. Thus, A. hieracii is suggested as a
   candidate among insects to have the ability to synthesize and modify
   carotenoids. Our findings give rise to the question of the relevance of
   using carotenoids as markers of trophic flow in the gall community.},

Title = {Changes in chemical cues of Melissococcus plutonius infected honey bee
   larvae},
Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-200},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {European foulbrood (EFB), caused by Melissococcus plutonius, is a
   globally distributed bacterial brood disease affecting Apis mellifera
   larvae. There is some evidence, even if under debate, that spreading of
   the disease within the colony is prevented by worker bees performing
   hygienic behaviour, including detection and removal of infected larvae.
   Olfactory cues (brood pheromones, signature mixtures, diagnostic
   substances) emitted by infected individuals may play a central role for
   hygienic bees to initiate the disease-specific behaviour. However, the
   mechanisms of cue detection and brood removal, causing hygienic
   behaviour in EFB affected colonies, are poorly understood. Here, coupled
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to detect
   disease-specific substances, changes in cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC)
   profiles, and brood ester pheromones (BEPs) of honey bee larvae
   artificially infected with M. plutonius. Although no diagnostic
   substances were found in significant quantities, discriminant analysis
   revealed specific differences in CHC and BEP profiles of infected and
   healthy larvae. beta-Ocimene, a volatile brood pheromone related to
   starvation and hygienic behaviour, was present in all larvae with
   highest quantities in healthy young larvae; whereas oleic acid, a
   non-volatile necromone, was present only in old infected larvae.
   Furthermore, gamma-octalactone (newly discovered in A. mellifera in this
   study) was detectable in trace amounts only in infected larvae. We
   propose that the deviation from the olfactory profile of healthy brood
   is supposed to trigger hygienic behaviour in worker bees. To confirm the
   relevance of change in the chemical bouquet (CHCs, BEPs,
   gamma-octalactone, etc.), a field colony bioassay is needed, using
   healthy brood and hygienic bees to determine if bouquet changes elicit
   hygienic behaviour.},

   combination of behavioral tests, chemical extractions, and mass
   spectrometry analyses. The individuals of S. stimpsonii used in the
   experiments were sampled around the Great Reef of Toliara (Madagascar)
   where they are found in association with two crinoid species: Comanthus
   wahlbergii and Phanogenia distincta. The chemical attractiveness of the
   two crinoid hosts and a non-host species, Cenometra bella, was tested in
   an olfactometer. The three crinoids produced attractive kairomones
   allowing the snapping shrimp to recognize them. Mass spectrometry
   analyses on purified extracts of P. distincta revealed the presence of
   three different anthraquinones (rhodoptilometrin, comantherin, and a new
   crinoid anthraquinone). Compared to the existing literature, this
   anthraquinonic cocktail is specific to P. distincta. When these extracts
   were injected in the olfactometer, they triggered similar attracting
   behavior suggesting that crinoid anthraquinones are kairomones allowing
   host selection for S. stimpsonii. This hypothesis is also supported by
   the fact that shrimps were chemically attracted by pure commercial
   anthraquinones. In addition to their traditional defensive role
   (allomones), anthraquinones would, therefore, also function as
   kairomones, maintaining the symbiosis between S. stimpsonii and its
   crinoid hosts.},

Abstract = {Climate changes in the North Atlantic and Arctic affect the
   macrophytobenthos along with other components of the ecosystem,
   resulting in an increase of species diversity and biomass in western
   Spitsbergen, as has been reported. Gronfjorden is located at the mouth
   of one of the largest fjords of Spitsbergen, Isfjorden, and is
   influenced by the recent significant increase in the inflow of Atlantic
   Water. However, there are nearly no published data on the phytobenthic
   communities in this area. This research study of the littoral and
   sublittoral areas of Gronfjorden in 2013-14 documented 68 species,
   mostly high-boreal and boreal-Arctic species. When compared with species
   diversity in the other areas of western Spitsbergen, the data show the
   uniqueness of Gronfjorden's species composition.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are initially formed in the form of
   aldehydes, and then converted to alcohol and ester forms by the enzymes
   from plants. However, it remains unclear whether and how plant microbes
   work with aldehyde GLVs, especially under stressed conditions. Here,
   transcriptional response of cold-pretreated Pantoea agglomerans KSC03,
   an endophyte from Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus roots to
   E-2-hexenal was investigated and verified by real-time PCR and GC-MS
   after the time length of cold pretreatment was optimized. The results
   revealed that a 12-h cold stress was the most effective for KSC03 to
   trigger positive response to E-2-hexenal as far as the cell density was
   concerned. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed
   genes induced by E-2-hexenal were enriched in the following pathways:
   ABC transporter, phosphotransferase system, nitrotoluene degradation,
   and metabolisms of hexose and butanoate. Amongst, the upregulated
   transcription of gene3176 and gene4782 encoding N-ethylmaleimide
   reductase and diacetyl reductase in E-2-hexenal treatment was confirmed
   by real-time PCR. So did the enhanced production of 2,3-butanediol
   triggered by E-2-hexenal. Additionally, the transcription of gene3176
   and gene4782 and the production of 2,3-butanediol chronologically
   reached their peaks in the E-2-hexenal-treated cells at the stationary
   phase. The results also indicated that exogenous E-2-hexanal passed
   through the cell membrane at the lag/early logarithmic phase and could
   not be utilized directly. In summary, E-2-hexenal triggers the positive
   cell response of cold-pretreated KSC03 at the transcriptional and
   metabolic levels in a time-length dependent manner.},

Abstract = {The mason wasp Odynerus spinipes shows an exceptional case of
   intrasexual cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile dimorphism. Females of
   this species display one of two CHC profiles (chemotypes) that differ
   qualitatively and quantitatively from each other. The ratio of the two
   chemotypes was previously shown to be close to 1:1 at three sites in
   Southern Germany, which might not be representative given the Palearctic
   distribution of the species. To infer the frequency of the two
   chemotypes across the entire distributional range of the species, we
   analyzed with GC-MS the CHC profile of 1042 dry-mounted specimens stored
   in private and museum collections. We complemented our sampling by
   including 324 samples collected and preserved specifically for studying
   their CHCs. We were capable of reliably identifying the chemotypes in
   91\% of dry-mounted samples, some of which collected almost 200 years
   ago. We found both chemotypes to occur in the Far East, the presumed
   glacial refuge of the species, and their frequency to differ
   considerably between sites and geographic regions. The geographic
   structure in the chemotype frequencies could be the result of
   differential selection regimes and/or different dispersal routes during
   the colonization of the Western Palearctic. The presented data pave the
   route for disentangling these factors by providing information where to
   geographically sample O. spinipes for population genetic analyses. They
   also form the much-needed basis for future studies aiming to understand
   the evolutionary and geographic origin as well as the genetics of the
   astounding CHC profile dimorphism that O. spinipes females exhibit.},

Abstract = {Olfaction plays a major role in the host-finding behaviors of insects.
   However, the irregularity of insect responses to odor interactions has
   hindered our efforts to draw broad conclusions about how a host-finding
   insect uses the complex mixture of various odor plumes in natural
   environments. Particularly, it is still unclear so far why the use of
   non-host odors to control insect pests in practices have met with mixed
   results. To further understand the host-finding of a specific insect, we
   highlight the role of the real-time odor environment (ROE) that the
   host-finding insect is passing through. The ROE may contain various
   odors with different ranks and changes during the insect's host finding.
   A host-finding insect may always prone to switch to the higher rank odor
   plumes in each ROE regardless of the distance is ``short{''} or
   ``long{''} from the odor source. For a specific herbivorous insect, only
   mixing degree of the given host and non-host plant odors reaches some
   certain level (threshold value), can the non-host odors significantly
   affect its ability to locate host plants. When the odor mixing degree is
   low, masking effects may not occur or the non-host plant odors'
   ``attractive{''} effects at long distances and ``repellent{''} effects
   at short distances can even increase the pest loads. In forests, the
   mixing degree of different plant odors is determined by turbulence
   intensity which is mainly affected by plant structures. These may
   further advance our understanding of herbivorous insects' host finding
   and have important implications for the development of pest management
   strategies.},

   Emydidae is absent from the fossil record of this area. All valid named
   taxa pertain to testudinids. Within Testudinidae, the majority of known
   fossil species are members of the clade Geochelona, while a few others
   belong to the clade Testudona. Four fossil taxa are members of
   now-extinct genera, five are members of extant genera, and seven cannot
   be assigned to a known genus with certainty. The fossil record also
   documents that several extant genera had a much broader distribution
   during the Neogene and Quaternary. Endemic insular lineages were
   formerly present on the Canary Islands, Cape Verde islands, and on
   several islands in the Western Indian Ocean. The highest known diversity
   of testudinoids seems to have existed during the Neogene; however,
   definitive conclusions are hampered by the extremely poor Paleogene
   record and large, unsampled areas of Afro-Arabia. A taxonomic review of
   the 22 named Afro-Arabian taxa finds 16 nomina valida, 1 nomen
   invalidum, and 5 nomina dubia.},

   worldwide. They are particularly abundant in the Silurian Bertie Group
   of North America. The Bertie Group Eurypterus species are relatively
   small compared with associated giants such as Acutiramus, Eusarcana, and
   Dolichopterus. Here we report the discovery of an isolated telson of
   Eurypterus lacustris nearly 15 cm long indicating an individual more
   than half a meter in length. This highly maneuverable swimmer with acute
   vision joins the list of eurypterid predators with giant

Title = {Identification of sex-specific compounds in the invasive four-eyed fir

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Polygraphus proximus, a four-eyed fir bark beetle, is an invasive bark
   beetle species which has caused extensive damage to forests of Abies
   sibirica in southern and western Siberia and to Abies species in the
   European part of Russia. There is a high risk that the pest insect will
   spread to areas where it is currently not considered present, such as
   the European Union. In these areas, it threatens to attack conifer
   forests of various species which may result in major environmental and
   economic impact. The aim of this study was to identify pheromone
   components of P. proximus that can be used as pheromone baits. Males and
   females of P. proximus were allowed to bore into the bark of stem
   sections of Abies sibirica at the laboratory, and volatiles were
   collected with solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Analyses of these
   extracts with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed
   several sex-specific compounds. In total, twelve male-specific compounds
   and one female-specific compound were identified. The major
   male-specific compound determined by GC peak area was
   (Z)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-ethanol {[}(Z)-DMCHE] and the minor
   male-specific compounds were 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol,
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-2-butenal, benzyl alcohol, fragranol,
   7-methyl-3-methylene-6-octen-1-ol, (Z)- and
   (E)-2-(3,3-dimethylcyclohexylidene)-acetaldehyde, geraniol, geranial and
   papayanol. The only female-specific compound was identified as
   1-hexanol. Two of the male-specific compounds, (Z)-DMCHE and
   3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol were shown to attract males and females of P.
   proximus in field studies. Thus, we now for the first time can present
   the structures of two male-specific components that are biologically
   active parts of P. proximus aggregation pheromone. However, some
   chemical communication overlap between P. proximus and P. subopacus
   needs to be further investigated as (Z)-DMCHE also attracted males and
   females of P. subopacus.},

Abstract = {Floral displays constitute signals conveyed to potential pollinators by
   pigments and fragrance compounds, which are secondary metabolites
   biosynthesized through a limited number of major metabolic pathways. In
   recent years, the role of defensive secondary metabolites, targeted to
   tolerate/resist herbivory, pathogen-borne diseases and other kinds of
   stress, has become apparent in the context of floral displays. Apart
   from pigments and volatile compounds, these defensive compounds include
   alkaloids, specialized molecules such as glucosinolates (in
   Brassicaceae), and proanthocyanidin phenolics. All these functionally
   overlapping groups of metabolites vary in floral concentrations under
   different kinds of environmental conditions as well as due to endogenous
   regulatory factors, resulting in metabolic and functional synergies or
   trade-offs according to the physiological status of the flowers. In this
   review, we discuss such associations among varying secondary metabolites
   in flowers, and their implications in context of plant stress-response
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {A vast diversity of parasites associates with ants. Living in and around
   ant nests of these organisms must overcome ant colony defenses. As ant
   defensive behavior is mainly mediated by species-specific cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) or alarm pheromones, and ant-associated parasites
   can either crack their hosts' chemical communication code by modifying
   their own CHC profiles or use pro-active strategies like chemical
   weaponry for distraction and repellency. While the chemical nature of
   ant-parasite interactions has been intensively studied for highly
   host-specific parasites, the chemical-deceptive strategies of the rather
   rare ant-resembling heteropterans are unknown. To gain insight into this
   system, I studied the bug Scolopostethus pacificus (Barber 1918) which
   can be found near the nests of the ecologically dominant and aggressive
   velvety tree ant (Liometopum occidentale, Emery 1895). Using behavioral,
   chemical, and molecular approaches, I disentangled the relationship of
   S. pacificus and its host ant. Chemical profiling of the bug and the ant
   revealed that the bug does not make use of CHC insignificance or
   mimicry, but instead uses a cocktail of volatile compounds released from
   its metathoracic glands that likely moderates encounters with its
   aggressive host. Feeding trials with armed and artificially disarmed
   bugs revealed a defensive function of the gland exudates. Targeted
   molecular gut barcoding showed that S. pacificus does not feed on L.
   occidentale. These results suggest that chemical weaponry, rather than a
   chemical code-cracking CHC matching or chemical insignificance, enables
   S. pacificus to get along with and live in close proximity to its host
   ant.},

Title = {Benzoxazinoids in roots and shoots of cereal rye (Secale cereale) and

Volume = {32},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cover crops provide many agroecosystem services, including weed
   suppression, which is partially exerted through release of allelopathic
   benzoxazinoid (BX) compounds. This research (1) characterizes changes in
   concentrations of BX compounds in shoots, roots, and soil at three
   growth stages (GS) of cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), and (2) their
   degradation in soil over time following termination. Concentrations of
   shoot dominant BX compounds, DIBOA-glc and DIBOA were lowest at GS 83
   (boot). The root dominant BX compound, HMBOA-glc, concentration was
   least at GS 54 (elongation). Rhizosphere soil BX concentrations were
   1000 times smaller than in root tissues. Dominant compounds in soil were
   HMBOA-glc and HMBOA. Soil BX compound concentrations were similar near
   root crowns and between-rows. Soil BX concentrations following cereal
   rye termination declined exponentially over time in three of four
   treatments: incorporated shoots (S) and roots (R), no-till S + R (cereal
   rye rolled flat), and no-till R (shoots removed); no-till S had
   consistently low concentrations. In treatments showing changes, soil
   concentrations of HMBOA-glc and HMBOA increased above initial
   concentrations on the day following cereal rye termination.
   Concentrations of these two compounds decreased more rapidly than the
   other compounds. Placement of shoots on the surface of an area where
   cereal rye had not grown (no-till S) did not increase soil
   concentrations of BX compounds. The short duration and complex dynamics
   of BX compounds in soil prior to and following termination illustrate
   the limited window for enhancing weed suppression directly by cereal rye
   allelochemicals; valuable information for programs breeding for enhanced
   weed suppression.},

Abstract = {Social wasps build their nests using plant material and can thereby
   occupy different types of habitats. The organization of their colonies
   is generally based on complex communication systems that include
   chemical compounds of the cuticle that are shared with the material of
   their nests thus contributing to the specific chemical signature of
   their colony. These compounds can vary by environmental factors, in this
   case the nesting substrate may interfere with this composition. However,
   no study to date has investigated whether there is any relationship
   between the chemical signature of the colony and the nesting substrate
   of their nests. Therefore, in this study we investigated the
   relationship between the colonial chemical signature and the plant in
   which the colonies were nesting. Colonies of three species of social
   wasps and samples of plants where they nested were collected, then
   extractions of the chemical composition of adult wasps, nest material
   and plants were performed. The results show that the colonies of social
   wasps investigated here share their chemical composition with the plants
   where their nests were built. Our results suggest that the plant can
   provide the colony with more than just a place with ideal physical
   conditions and safety, but also compounds that compose the colonial
   chemical signature.},

Title = {Missing and misidentified museum specimens hinder long-term monitoring:
   a case study of shell-bearing gastropods from the Kola Meridian
   transect, Barents Sea},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {The consequences of global change cannot be estimated without long-term
   monitoring programmes. The Kola Meridian transect, along 33 degrees
   30'E, in the Barents Sea is the longest term monitoring area in the
   Arctic. Regular (usually annual) hydrobiological benthic surveys along
   that transect have been performed since 1899. Materials stored in museum
   collections remain the main source of the faunistic information obtained
   during the surveys, while only a minor part of these data was published.
   We reexamined all samples of shell-bearing gastropods from the Kola
   Meridian stored at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences and at Saint Petersburg State University. We found only 159
   museum lots from 73 samples, which constitute a very small portion of
   the total material collected along the transect. Approximately one-third
   of them (54 lots) was misidentified or includes individuals that cannot
   be identified at species level. The species composition revealed by
   museum materials differs substantially from published checklists.
   Majority of the studied samples (40) were collected during 1899-1920.
   However, the extant collections do not provide a reliable baseline for
   the Kola Meridian. We propose that the storage of zoological material in
   public collections should be considered as an essential part of
   long-term monitoring programmes.},

Title = {Sudden death of an Arctic wolf population in Greenland},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {This study reports the disappearance of a small Arctic wolf population
   in north-east Greenland founded in 1979 and provides the first long-term
   information on the wolf packs of this region. Data sources comprised
   specialized wolf surveys in two of three distributional core areas
   during three summers, 2012-14, and incidental sightings of wolves by
   military ground patrols during winter and by others year-round. The
   resulting time series spans 40 years (1979-2018). After gradually
   increasing for 14 years, the sighting rate peaked in 1996 and then
   declined to zero after May 2002, suggesting that the population went
   extinct. The crash occurred despite year-round legal protection in a
   national park and resulted in a 51.2\% reduction in the extent of the
   occupied wolf range in Greenland and a 41.8\% reduction in Greenland's
   wolf population size. It was outside the scope of this study to conduct
   a complete analysis of all potential factors in the disappearance. In
   north Greenland, a small population of up to 32 wolves during optimal
   years continues to exist, and dispersers reach north-east Greenland
   occasionally. A number of measures are proposed that, if implemented by
   the Greenland Home Rule Government, would help secure the future of the
   few remaining wolves on the island.},

Title = {Screening for effective odors through which Conopomorpha sinensis
   Bradley (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) locates its host},
Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Insect olfactory systems can efficiently distinguish important host
   signals in a complex background of odor. Notably, Conopomorpha sinensis
   Bradley (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), a host-specific pest of Litchi
   chinensis and Euphoria longan, causes periodic outbreaks in southern
   China. However, little is known about the functions of host volatiles
   and olfactory mechanisms through which C. sinensis senses host taxa.
   Consequently, the present study analyzed the Electroantennogram (EAG)
   responses of C. sinensis antennae to host volatile compounds and their
   mixtures. The results showed that volatile components were more
   stimulatory to female than to male C. sinensis antennae. In addition,
   the highest EAG responses were observed following the stimulation of
   female antennae by the individual volatile component beta-guaiene,
   followed by beta-caryophyllene and beta-elemene. However, odorant
   mixtures containing beta-farnesene and alpha-pinene significantly
   altered EAG responses in female antennae. This was further confirmed by
   behavioral responses to host volatile compounds based on the flight
   orientation of females and males in a wind tunnel. These findings
   demonstrated that the behavior of C. sinensis can be affected by single
   compounds or a mixture of compounds. Moreover, real-time fluorescence
   quantitative PCR suggested that a combination of alpha-pinene with
   beta-farnesene could alter the expression of olfactory genes. Therefore,
   screening for odors that can effectively alter the behavior of insects
   provides a theoretical basis for exploring host recognition and
   utilizing the olfactory networks of C. sinensis for biocontrol, at the
   molecular level.},

Abstract = {Stink bugs (Pentatomidae) produce volatile chemical substances in the
   scent glands, with unpleasant odors that function as alarm and defense
   signals against natural enemies. The contents of the scent glands of the
   predatory Podisus nigrispinus and its prey, the phytophagous Euschistus
   heros were used to evaluate the behavioral interactions between these
   two insects. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of odor components
   were performed by gas chromatography (GC/FID and GC/MS) and behavioral
   response evaluated by video-tracking system. The chemical composition of
   the odor produced by P. nigrispinus and E. heros contains aldehydes and
   hydrocarbons. The chemical mixture has quantitative and qualitative
   component differences between species and sexes, with 20 compounds
   identified for P. nigrispinus and 17 compounds for E. heros. The
   compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexenoic acid, (E)-2-decenal, tridecane,
   tetradecane, and pentadecane occur in both species, but with different
   amounts between males and females. The secretion of the scent gland of
   P. nigrispinus and E. heros produces repellent and irritant effects
   between species and between sexes of the same species, supporting the
   defensive function of these compounds. Chemical identification of the
   Pentatomidae scent gland compounds may influence in insect behavior
   cause side effects in other insects. Overall, these compounds can be a
   sustainable and novel source of insecticides with potential to
   agricultural pest control.},

Abstract = {We used isotopic and genomic data to explore the ecological and social
   context of cultural practices associated with the mummification of
   crocodiles in ancient Egypt. Ancient DNA was recovered from four
   mummified crocodile hatchlings held in the collections of the Peabody
   Museum of Natural history, Yale University. Previous genetic analyses of
   crocodile mummies have indicated that most mummies represent the newly
   resurrected taxon, Crocodylus suchus Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1807.
   However, mitogenomic data for the Yale Peabody Museum mummies indicates
   that these specimens represent the first genomically authenticated
   representatives of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti,
   1768) in museum collections. We explore these findings within the
   broader context of modern and historical distributions of both crocodile
   species and the potential implications for our understanding of funerary
   practices involving crocodiles in ancient Egypt.},

Abstract = {Species-specific pheromone communication in moths is often achieved by
   the precise control of the production of a multi-component sex pheromone
   blend in females and selective perception of pheromone compounds in
   males. Reproductive isolation mediated by sex pheromone can be enhanced
   by the sensitive detection of structurally related non-pheromone
   components that are not used as pheromone in the same species but used
   as pheromone components in similar species. Here, we identified several
   unsaturated aliphatic acetates inhibiting the attraction of male moths
   to conspecific female sex pheromone in the lightbrown apple moth,
   Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), through
   electroantennogram (EAG) and field trapping studies. In EAG screening
   with 46 pheromone and structurally related compounds, eleven compounds
   exhibited significant male-specific EAG responses at 1 mu g dose. The
   EAG-active compounds were mainly mono- or di-unsaturated 14-carbon
   acetates. In subsequent field trapping tests to evaluate the behavioral
   activities of the EAG-active compounds on male attraction to the binary
   blend (E11-14:Ac + E9E11-14:Ac) of female sex pheromone of E.
   postvittana, each of nine compounds (E9-12:Ac, Z9-12:Ac, E9-14:Ac,
   Z9-14:Ac, Z10-14:Ac, Z11-14:Ac, Z12-14:Ac, Z9E11-14:Ac and Z9E12-14:Ac)
   displayed clear inhibition of male moths to the sex pheromone blend in a
   dose-dependent manner. Our findings provide useful information in
   understanding the pheromone communication system of E. postvittana and
   related species.},

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Neotropical poison frogs possess alkaloid-based antipredator defenses
   which they sequester from a diet of arthropods such as oribatid mites
   and myrmicine ants. Alkaloid sequestration is still poorly understood
   and although several studies have examined its uptake, most experiments
   directly feed alkaloids to the frogs. Here, we examined the alkaloid
   uptake system in the poison frog species Dendrobates auratus by feeding
   it an alkaloid-containing prey item, the red imported fire ant
   Solenopsis invicta (Formicidae, Myrmicinae). Captive bred frogs were
   either fed live ants or fruit flies dusted with powdered ants for 4
   months. Using GC-MS, we confirm that S. invicta contain previously
   described piperidine alkaloids known as solenopsins; however, none of
   these piperidine alkaloids was detected in the skin of D. auratus,
   suggesting the frogs are incapable of sequestering solenopsins from S.
   invicta. It is possible that D. auratus are unable to sequester fire ant
   piperidines due to their long hydrocarbon side chains, a feature that
   makes them structurally different than most known alkaloids in poison
   frogs.},

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Free-ranging giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China recently
   were reported to rub and roll in horse manure, a behavior that was
   observed frequently at low ambient temperatures. Two sesquiterpenes,
   beta-caryophyllene (BCP) and caryophyllene oxide (BCPO), that are
   abundant in fresh horse manure elicited rolling in captive giant pandas.
   Mice and rats treated with BCP/BCPO exhibited enhanced cold tolerance in
   behavioral assays, and BCP/BCPO inhibited cold-activated ion channels of
   mammals expressed in human kidney cells; these laboratory results were
   cited in support of the contention that giant pandas tolerate low
   ambient temperatures by applying horse manure to their integument. The
   demonstrated biocidal activities of BCP and BCPO against insects and
   ticks, and the reported elicitation of anointing in giant pandas with
   materials other than horse manure, including substances or constituents
   thereof known to act as arthropod biocides, are consistent with an
   anti-consumer function of anointing by giant pandas. Anointing with the
   scents of heterospecifics as a defense against nuisance arthropods
   constitutes a viable hypothesis for the rubbing and rolling behaviors of
   giant pandas and other ursids.},

Abstract = {Endophytic fungi have the potential to enhance plant resistance to
   various stresses and promote the ecological adaptation of the hosts. To
   evaluate the effects of the riparian endophytes on rice seedlings to
   flooding tolerance, here we screened out two fungi from the plant
   Myricaria laxiflora growing in the Yangtze River zone. Through
   morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS (internal transcriber region)
   sequence, the two strains were, respectively, identified as Aspergillus
   fumigatus and Chaetomium globosum. Metabolites derived from both fungi
   were capable of increasing tolerance of rice to flooding. Systematic
   separation and purification coupled to bioassays revealed that two
   natural antioxidants, Z-N-4-hydroxystyryl formamide (NFA) and
   chaetoglobosin A (CheA), were effective for alleviating flooding stress.
   Both NFA and CheA can reverse the decline trend of oxidative parameters
   caused by long-term flooding, such as malondialdehyde, superoxide
   dismutase, ethanol dehydrogenase, and NADPH oxidase. Gene expression
   analyses of NADPH oxidase families indicated that OsRbohB could be
   involved in conferring flooding tolerance mediated by the two natural
   antioxidants. These findings contribute to understanding the role of the
   natural antioxidants in riparian endophytic fungi and providing a basis
   for improvement of flooding tolerance of rice and other crop plants.},

   H,11 beta H-guaian-3-en-12,6-olide (2) and thapsigargin (3) herbicidal
   activities' were evaluated in comparison with their binary and tertiary
   mixtures, against Lolium perenne. These allelochemicals were isolated
   from Thapsia garganica leaves methanolic extract. Experiments were
   carried out by irrigation and spray in pot trials. Each compound was
   tested at the concentration that inhibits 50\% of L. perenne root growth
   (IC50). Mixtures were prepared at the total concentration determined to
   inhibit 50\% of weed root growth based upon the IC50 value for each
   compound (1000 mu M, 154 mu M and 300 mu M for 1, 2 and 3,
   respectively). The greatest herbicidal effect was observed in tertiary
   mixtures, followed by binary ones, and single compounds showed the
   lowest phytotoxicity. Moreover, spray treatment was more effective at
   inhibiting growth of L. perenne, compared with irrigation. For sprayed
   binary mixtures, the 2 and 3 mixture showed the best inhibitions in
   shoot (75.79\%) and root (91.02\%) growth, and fresh weight (89.28\%).
   These values significantly improved those of the most active single
   compound, 1 (48.01\%, 58.62\% and 57.14\%, respectively, following
   spray). On the other hand, compound 3, whose structure is related to
   guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones, was a common constituent of the most
   active mixtures, suggesting that it plays a more relevant role in the
   improvement of the phytotoxicity of mixtures. Results obtained for the
   spray treatment of the tertiary mixture of 1 (333.33 mu M), 2 (51.33 mu
   M) and 3 (100 mu M) were even more prominent, since weed growth was
   completely inhibited. After irrigation with a tertiary mixture, the
   greatest inhibitions in shoot and root growth and fresh weight did not
   exceed 88.16\%, 94\% and 90.47\%, respectively. The results reported
   highlight a synergistic behavior of the test allelochemicals which could
   be applied in the development of bio-herbicides.},

   added posteriorly over time. Previous interpretations of tooth
   implantation in procolophonids were conflated with replacement patterns
   and mode of implantation. Additionally, the combination of dental
   characters of the specimen suggests Scoloparia glyphanodon had an

   site again, the pheromone also signals the presence of eggs to
   conspecific females. This form of chemical marking is particularly
   prevalent in species which oviposit on discrete hosts with limited
   resources available for developing larvae. The pepper weevil is a major
   pest of cultivated pepper throughout the southern United States, Mexico
   and the Caribbean. The weevil deposits eggs singly in a cavity chewed in
   flower buds and small fruits and caps these cavities with a plug derived
   from an anal secretion. The deterrent was found to be located in this
   oviposition plug and comprised of volatile and contact-acting
   components. Plug volatiles were collected by inducing oviposition into
   Teflon tape sachets containing pepper leaves and collecting volatiles
   from plugs laid on the tape surface. Of the two major components
   observed by GC/MS analyses, only acetophenone elicited a behavioral
   response by the female weevil in small arena and wind tunnel assays.
   Investigations of the oviposition plug matrix identified several free
   unsaturated and saturated fatty acids as major constituents of the plug
   which was in stark contrast to pepper tissue and seeds that contained
   only trace levels of free fatty acids and a distinctly different total
   fatty acid composition. The combined free fatty acids as well as
   acetophenone tested singly gave no significant reduction in oviposition
   while a plug-mimicking blend of unsaturated fatty acids tested in
   combination with acetophenone as artificial `plug spots,' decreased
   oviposition on treated peppers by up to 75\%. We propose that the
   combination of volatile and contact acting marking components improves
   oviposition site selection efficiency by pepper weevils on discrete
   hosts.},

Abstract = {Gonipterus weevils have been a taxonomic challenge for many years, with
   implications on our understanding of invasive species, host plant
   relationships and natural enemies. We assessed cuticular hydrocarbon
   (CHC) analysis as a tool for discrimination of some of the many species
   of Gonipterus occurring in Australia. Weevils were collected across
   several localities and kept under identical conditions prior to a
   whole-body wash for extraction of CHCs in hexane. Weevil identifications
   were confirmed using morphology and molecular tools. CHC extracts were
   analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the
   relative peak areas in profiles were compared; compounds were identified
   according to MS fragmentation and retention indices. CHC profiles of the
   seven species of Gonipterus analyzed differed from each other, and from
   another weevil genus (Oxyops), used as an outgroup. The compounds that
   contributed most to species differences were alkanes, alkenes and methyl
   branched alkanes. Within some species, locality of collection affected
   CHC profiles. Our study presents CHC analysis as a promising tool for
   distinction of Gonipterus species.},

Title = {Extremely high abundances of Prasiola crispa-associated micrometazoans
   in East Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {To elucidate poorly known aspects of the microscopic metazoan
   distribution in ice-free parts of the Antarctic, we examined samples of
   the multicellular terres-trial alga Prasiola crispa, collected over the
   last decade in different parts of con-tinental East Antarctica and
   Haswell Island. We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae
   consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea),
   followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer
   assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species).
   Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities
   ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight
   and the maximum value num-bered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry
   sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with
   mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in
   the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of cor-relations
   between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and
   Na). Our findings are consistent with the patchy distribution of
   terrestrial micrometazoans in the Antarctic that has previously been
   found.},

Title = {Historic temperature observations on Nordaustlandet, north-east Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Long-term meteorological data for the Arctic are sparse. One of the
   longest quasi-continuous temperature time series in the High Arctic is
   the extended Svalbard Airport series, providing daily temperature data
   from 1898 until the present. Here, I derive an adjustment to historic
   temperature observations on the island of Nordaustlandet, north-east
   Svalbard, in order to link these to the extended Svalbard Airport
   series. This includes the Haudegen observations at Rijpfjorden during
   1944/45 and a previously unrecognized data set obtained by the Norwegian
   hunters and trappers Gunnar Knoph and Henry Rudi during their wintering
   at Rijpfjorden in 1934/35. The adjustment is based on data from an
   automatic weather station at Rijpfjorden during 2014-16 and verified
   with other independent historic temperature observations on
   Nordaustlandet. An analysis of the Haudegen radiosonde data indicates
   that the surface tempera-ture observations at Rijpfjorden are generally
   well correlated with the free tro-pospheric temperatures at 850 hPa, but
   occasionally show the occurrence of boundary-layer inversions during
   winter, where local temperatures fall sub-stantially below what is
   expected from the regression. The adjusted historic observations from
   Nordaustlandet can, therefore, be used to fill remaining gaps in the
   extended Svalbard Airport series.},

Title = {Inferring population structure and genetic diversity of the invasive
   alien Nootka lupin in Iceland},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Polar and subpolar regions are known for their particular vulnerability
   and sensitivity to the detrimental effects of non-indigenous species,
   which is well exemplified by the Nootka lupin (Lupinus nootkatensis)
   spread in Iceland. Since understanding the population and ecological
   genetics of invasive alien species offers hope for counteracting harmful
   biological invasions, the objective of the present study was to
   investigate interspecific variation in L. nootkatensis in Iceland in
   relation to a native population in Alaska. Moreover, we aimed to assess
   whether internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) has sufficient phylogenetic
   applicability for a large-scale screening of the genetic diversity of a
   non-indigenous population of this species. This study, which is the
   first attempt to investigate the genetic diversity of the Nootka lupin
   in Iceland, included plant samples from eight locations in Iceland and
   one in Alaska. The analyses included genotyping by sequencing of the
   417-nucleotide fragment of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA, ITS2 and part of the
   large subunit ribosomal RNA (GenBank MT026578-MT026580, MT077004). The
   main findings showed the presence of five previously unexplained
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); however, their discriminatory
   power for Icelandic populations was relatively low, since polymorphism
   information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.0182 to 0.0526, with
   average heterozygosity 0.0296. Concomitantly, analysis of multilocus
   genotypes (MLG) revealed sufficient differences in MLGs variants and
   their frequency to form genotypic patterns unique for Alaskan and
   Icelandic populations, revealing an internal genetic structure of the
   studied group. The proposed SNP panel needs to be supplemented with
   other nuclear and organellar markers.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key insect hormone involved in the regulation
   of physiological, developmental and behavioural processes. In social
   insects, it has been shown that JH can play a key role in modulating
   reproductive division of labour, age-related division of labour and
   chemical signalling, and can display marked changes in function of the
   degree of sociality. Here, we checked the effects of JH on reproduction
   in single foundresses of two neotropical primitively eusocial wasp
   species, Mischocyttarus cerberus and Mischocyttarus cassununga, by
   examining how treatments with the JH-analogue methoprene and the anti-JH
   precocene affect egg-laying, ovarian activation and chemical profiles.
   Our hypothesis was that reproduction and the production of particular
   fertility-linked cuticular hydrocarbon cues might be under shared JH
   control already in primitively eusocial wasp species, and this could
   have been a key enabler to allow such cues to later evolve into
   full-fledged queen pheromone signals in advanced eusocial species. In
   line with this hypothesis, we show that our hormone treatments
   significantly affected both egg laying and the production of particular
   hydrocarbons present on the egg surface. We discuss the relevance of
   these findings in the context of the evolution of social insect queen
   pheromones in advanced eusocial species with a morphologically
   differentiated queen-worker caste.},

   (trans-conophthorin; tC) and acetamides {[}predominantly
   N-(3-methylbutyl)acetamide; N3MBA], are two major groups of volatiles
   discovered in venoms of many Vespidae. In the course of testing the
   attractiveness of tC and N3MBA to Vespidae using Rescue(R) Wasp
   TrapStiks, a significant number of female milichiids, Desmometopa
   nearctica Sabrosky and D. sordida (Fallen) (Diptera: Milichiidae) were
   trapped as well. However, the attraction of vespid wasps was not
   significant at the dosages tested. We found a significant synergistic
   effect of tC and N3MBA in attracting Desmometopa flies. Both D.
   nearctica and D. sordida are kleptoparasitic species; and we conclude
   that females of these two milichiid flies use tC and N3MBA (and likely
   other volatiles) released from venom glands of the social vespids
   (yellowjackets, paper wasps and hornets) as kairomones to locate
   disturbed, injured, or freshly killed insects (vespids and/or their
   prey) as a protein-rich food source for egg development and production.},

Title = {Diversity and distribution of heterotrophic flagellates in seawater of
   the Powell Basin, Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Heterotrophic flagellates are essential components of the marine
   microbial food web. However, how the changes in flagellate populations
   reflect envi-ronmental changes in marine ecosystems is still unclear,
   especially in polar regions. In this study, we used pyrosequencing to
   examine the community structure of heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) in
   the Powell Basin's surface waters of the northern Antarctic Peninsula.
   OTUs (operational taxonomic units) of different taxa and the
   correlations between community structure and environmental factors were
   analysed. Eight taxa of HFs were selected for the principal analysis:
   Telonemia, Picozoa, Rhizaria, Amoebozoa, Apusomonas, Centrohelida,
   Choanomonada and marine stramenopiles (MASTs). The HFs were defined as
   heterotrophic picoflagellates (HPFs; 3 mu m) and heterotro-phic
   nanoflagellates (HNFs; 3 mu m, <20 mu m), which had similar dominant
   phyla (MASTs and Telonemia). However, their taxonomic composition
   dif-fered. Environmental factors exerted similar effects on the
   community struc-ture of both HPFs and HNPs. Compared with the
   correlation between HPF and environmental factors, the correlation
   between HNF and environmental fac-tors was stronger. Salinity, bacterial
   biomass and the biological interactions amongst dominant taxa were the
   main variables to influence the diversity and community structure of
   HFs.},

Title = {Can you hear me? Impacts of underwater noise on communication space of
   adult, sub-adult and calf contact calls of endangered St. Lawrence
   belugas (Delphinapterus leucas)},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Noise and anthropogenic disturbances from vessel traffic are an
   important threat to the recovery of the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary
   (SLE) beluga population. The consequences of acoustic masking could be
   particularly adverse in the case of critical vocalizations that maintain
   contact between mothers and their dependent but mobile calves. This
   study models the communication range of adults, sub-adults and newborn
   beluga contact calls in the presence and absence of vessels in an
   important summering area for this population. Ambient noise
   measurements, a composite beluga audiogram and apparent source levels of
   adult/sub-adult and newborn calls, informed the model. Apparent source
   levels were estimated from received levels of contact calls produced by
   four individuals carrying digital acoustic tags in the SLE, Canada, and
   from received levels of calls recorded from two adults and a newborn
   calf at an aquarium, at known distances from a calibrated hydro phone.
   The median communication ranges were over 18 times larger for SLE adult
   and sub-adult calls than for newborn calls, with a 57 and 53\% reduction
   in range in the presence of vessel noise, respectively. For newborn
   calls, this results in a median range of 170 m in vessel noise. These
   first estimates of the communication range of beluga vocalizations with
   a known function suggest that masking of the quiet calls of newborns by
   anthropogenic noise could impair mother-calf contact. This article is
   part of the special cluster Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas):
   knowledge from the wild, human care and TEK, which has been funded by
   Mystic Aquarium, CAFF and the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and
   Environment.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Chemical communication is fundamental to maintain cohesion in social
   insect colonies, and in this communication process, cuticular
   hydrocarbons act as cues exchanged during interactions between
   nestmates. However, few studies have investigated intraspecific
   variation of these compounds in Neotropical swarm-founding wasps. We
   undertook the present investigation by performing two assessments.
   First, we assessed whether the cuticular chemical composition of females
   in Polybia sericea varies according to the degree ovarian development,
   relative age and different body parts. Second, we assessed whether the
   cuticular chemical profile of colony members and compounds found in nest
   materials could be used as complementary tools to assess population
   differences. To make these determinations, samples were collected from
   three different populations, and the compounds were analyzed by gas
   chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Linear alkanes were found
   to be the most abundant compounds in the cuticle of females and nest
   material. Considering the cuticular composition, it was possible to
   distinguish the females according to degree of ovarian development,
   relative age and different body parts. In addition, cuticular compounds
   and nest material were different in the three analyzed populations;
   therefore, both the cuticular chemical profile of colony members and the
   chemical profile of nest material can be used as complementary tools to
   assess population differences.},

Abstract = {Plants that naturally accumulate aluminium (Al) may also inadvertently
   accumulate rare earth elements (REEs) due to the similar chemical
   properties of Al and REE trivalent ions, and vice versa. In this study,
   an Al hyperaccumulator plant species, Melastoma malabathricum, and a
   species known to have a propensity to hyperaccumulate REEs (in addition
   to Al), Dicranopteris linearis, were evaluated for potential REE
   accumulation in a one-year pot dosing trial in Sabah, Malaysia. To test
   whether the Malaysian accessions of D. linearis and M. malabathricum
   hyperaccumulate REEs (and Al), both species were grown in pots
   containing soil treated with solutions containing yttrium (Y), lanthanum
   (La), neodymium (Nd), and a mixture of these three REEs. The results
   showed that both M. malabathricum and D. linearis accumulated > 1000 mu
   g g(-1) Al in their leaves as expected. The shoots of M. malabathricum
   contained lower REEs than the roots (50 mu g g(-1) compared to 905 mu g
   g(-1)). In D. linearis, the mean foliar REE concentrations ranged from
   145 to 315 mu g g(-1), which is below the hyperaccumulation threshold
   set for REEs (> 1000 mu g g(-1) REEs). This study revealed that the
   Malaysian accessions of both M. malabathricum and D. linearis are Al
   hyperaccumulators, but their REE hyperaccumulation status requires
   further testing.},

Abstract = {An underlying assumption of optimal foraging models is that animals are
   behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically adapted to maximize
   their net energy intake. Here we explored whether this concept applies
   to web-building spiders in a multi-trophic context. If a spider were to
   build her web next to herbivore-fed-on plants that signal the
   herbivores' enemies for help by emitting herbivore-induced plant
   volatiles (HIPVs), that spider may maximize web captures in the short
   term. However, she would also risk predation by generalist predators
   that ``listen{''} to signaling plants to find both herbivore and spider
   prey, likely resulting in lower overall reproductive fitness for the
   spider. We tested the hypothesis that HIPVs trigger avoidance responses
   by web-building spiders. We selected seven common HIPVs and one HIPV
   elicitor, and in two-choice olfactometer bioassays tested their effect
   on four synanthropic spider species (false black widow, Steatoda grossa;
   common cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides; hobo spider, Eratigena
   agrestis; western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus). The 8-component
   HIPV/HIPV elicitor blend had a weak deterrent effect on S. grossa, but
   the effect did not extend to P. phalangioides, E. agrestis, and L.
   hesperus. Our findings imply that there was insufficient selection
   pressure for these spiders to recognize HIPVs in a multi-trophic
   context, where spiders themselves could become prey if generalist
   predators or spider-hunting parasitoid wasps were to respond to
   signaling plants.},

Title = {Why are Svalbard Arctic foxes Brucella spp. seronegative?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are susceptible to smooth Brucella
   (s-Brucella) infection and may be exposed to such bacteria through the
   consumption of infected marine mammals, as implied by the finding of
   s-Brucella antibodies in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard have not previously been investigated for s-Brucella
   antibodies, but such antibodies have been detected in Arctic foxes in
   Iceland, Alaska (USA) and Russia. We investigated blood from Svalbard
   Arctic foxes for s-Brucella antibodies using an indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (iELISA). The animals (0???13 years old) were either
   caught by fur trappers (1995???2003, n = 403) or found dead (1995 and
   2003, n = 3). No seropositive animals were detected. Morbidity and
   mortality due to the infection cannot be ruled out. However, no known,
   large disease outbreaks of unknown aetiology have been reported.
   Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Svalbard Arctic fox is resistant to
   infection as Arctic foxes from other populations are susceptible, and
   there is circumpolar connectivity between populations. The discrepancy
   between the findings in Iceland and Svalbard is surprising as both
   populations are on islands with no known local sources of exposure to
   s-Brucella other than marine mammals. However, our negative findings
   suggest that marine mammals may not be a major source of infection for
   this species. Comparative investigations are needed in order to draw
   conclusions regarding the epizootiology of s-Brucella in Arctic foxes in
   Svalbard and Iceland.},

Title = {A review of the ecology and status of white whales (Delphinapterus
   leucas) in Svalbard, Norway},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The Norwegian Polar Institute initiated a research programme on white
   whales in 1995 to gather biological information relevant for the
   species' management; the results of which are reviewed herein. Satellite
   tracking from two periods (1995- 2001 and 2013-16), between which sea
   ice diminished markedly, showed that the whales in waters off the
   archipelago of Svalbard spent most of their time foraging close to
   tidewater glaciers. Transits between glaciers typically followed the
   coastline, with the whales moving rapidly from one glacier to another.
   During the later period, the whales spent some time out in the fjords,
   suggesting that they might be targeting prey in the Atlantic Water
   masses that now prevail in Svalbard's westcoast fjords. Most of their
   dives were extremely shallow (13 +/- 26 m; maximum 350 m) and of short
   duration (97 +/- 123 s; maximum 31.4 min). Fatty-acid analyses indicated
   that polar cod (Boreogadus saida) was the main prey during the first
   sampling period. An aerial survey in 2018 estimated the population
   numbered 549 (CI: 436-723) animals. Svalbard white whales are
   genetically separate from populations off west Greenland and in the
   White Sea. Predation by killer whales appears to have influenced white
   whale behaviour in Svalbard; they are often silent, despite having a
   normal vocal repertoire for the species and their coastal movements take
   place in very shallow water. This population has extremely high
   contaminant levels. Climate change poses a threat to this small
   population of white whales.},

Title = {Subglacial discharge weakens the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf around
   the grounding line},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine potential impact of discharge in Subglacial
   Lake Engelhardt, West Antarctica, on the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf
   around the grounding line by combining satellite altimetry and remote
   sensing images. According to satellite altimetry data from the Ice,
   Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003-06), Subglacial Lake
   Engelhardt (SLE) discharged ca. 1.91 +/- 0.04 km(3) of water into the
   downstream region. The ice-surface record derived from ICESat (2006-09)
   and CryoSat-2 (2011-17) data shows that the lake gained ca. 2.09 +/-
   0.05 km(3) of water during the refilling event following the drainage
   event, taking three times as much time to reach the previous water level
   before the discharge; the calculation demonstrates that water input from
   an upstream lake is unable to sustain water increase in SLE, indicating
   that the subglacial, hydrologic system and groundwater flow could have
   contributed to water increase in SLE via hydrologic networks. Satellite
   images captured surface depressions and crevasses at the drainage outlet
   point of hydrologic networks around the grounding line; satellite
   altimetry data show that the ice surface there is still depressing even
   though the subglacial discharge has finished, potentially reflecting the
   long-term impact of subglacial discharge on the stability of the
   immediate Ross Ice Shelf around the grounding line.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},

Volume = {41},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {With China becoming more active in Greenland, worries abound that China
   might have hidden intentions. Despite that, the Greenlandic government
   is showing an increasing interest in deepening its cooperation with
   China. This article explores Greenland's motivation behind its positive
   attitude towards China and examines whether China will be a threat to
   Greenland's independence. For Greenland, China is both a deep-pocketed
   investor and a huge consumer market, especially in the mining, fishing
   and tourism industries. Greenland, therefore, views China as an
   important partner in its economic development, which is necessary for
   its independence from Denmark. Considering China's relationship with
   Denmark, its foreign policy and its affairs vis-a-vis Tibet, Xinjiang
   and Taiwan, it is not in China's interest to interfere with any affairs
   related to Greenland's independence.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Behavioural observations of captive beluga whales have complemented and
   extended much of what has been learnt about this species in the wild.
   Aquarium-based research has provided finer-scale specificity for many
   topics, including the seasonal breeding pattern that is characteristic
   of this species, as well as socio-sexual behaviour that appears to be an
   important part of the behavioural repertoire of this species. One
   example is a strong propensity for male-male social interactions that
   begin to develop at an early age. In addition, detailed behavioural
   milestones in calves have been documented in ways that extend that which
   have been collected from wild populations. These include swim positions
   with mother, separations/reunions with mother, and other social
   interactions, and play. Characteristics of beluga maternal care have
   also been studied more often in captive settings than in the wild,
   particularly with respect to details pertaining to nursing behaviour,
   individual differences in maternal style and allomaternal care. Other
   topics that have received scientific scrutiny in zoological settings
   include individual differences and behavioural laterality. Thus, a
   greater understanding of beluga behavioural biology has the potential to
   emerge as a consequence of synergy between research conducted in the two
   settings.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) has important functions that regulate insect life.
   In adult individuals, it induces gonadotropic and behavioral changes.
   Manipulating JH levels helps to understand how it influences insect
   physiology. The effects of JH on Epiponini swarm-founding wasps have
   shown contrasting results, affecting reproduction, chemical compound
   expression, behavior, and age polyethism. In this study, we investigated
   whether JH affects reproductive physiology and production of fertility
   cues in a swarm-founding wasp species Polybia occidentalis in an
   age-controlled experimental setup. We treated newly emerged females with
   methoprene (JH analogue) and precocene-I (JH inhibitor) to determine
   their effects on ovary activation and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC)
   expression. Furthermore, we compared the chemical profiles of treated
   workers with those of queens. Our results show that methoprene and
   precocene-I affected the CHC production in P. occidentalis.
   Additionally, females treated with methoprene were chemically more
   similar to queens than precocene- and acetone-treated females.
   Methoprene affected ovarian status (increasing ovary activation). These
   results suggest that different levels of JH reflect changes in chemical
   and reproductive traits in P. occidentalis females. Furthermore, we
   point out the existence of fertility cues in this Epiponini wasp.},

Abstract = {The dajid parasite Holophryxus alaskensis Richardson, 1905a is reported
   from Pasiphaea pacifica Rathbun, 1902 collected at 1,200 m depth near
   Baja California, Mexico. This represents the southernmost record for
   this species at approximately twice the depth of prior records. A
   juvenile specimen of Holophryxus attached to Parapasiphae sulcatifrons
   Smith, 1884 collected at 1,625 m depth from the Bear Seamount (an
   underwater volcano in the western Atlantic Ocean) was found to be
   similar in morphology to juveniles of H. alaskensis. However, it is also
   not possible to determine whether it is conspecific with either of the
   known Atlantic species of Holophryxus (H. acanthephyrae Stephensen,
   1912a and H. richardi Koehler, 1911). This is the first record of P.
   sulcatifrons as a host for any epicaridean. Finally, H. acanthephyrae is
   reported for the first time from off the Bahamas, where it was found on
   Acanthephyra pupurea A. Milne-Edwards, 1881 collected at 2,134 m depth.
   A discussion of the global distribution and taxonomic issues in the

Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The endostoma of eurypterids is a small ventral structure previously
   known from only 11 specimens and in detail from only a single species,
   Eurypterus tetraganophthalmus. Four previously undescribed eurypterid
   specimens from the Samuel J. Ciurca Jr. Collection, Yale Peabody Museum
   of Natural History, likely belonging to Eurypterus, and a previously
   documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New
   York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and
   homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a
   bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly
   facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are
   noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates
   with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous
   interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh
   body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria.
   This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the
   metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.},

Title = {Value of the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) in
   representing near-surface temperature and wind speed in the north-east
   European Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {The representation of 2-m air temperature and 10-m wind speed in the
   high-resolution (with a 2.5-km grid spacing) Copernicus Arctic Regional
   Reanalysis (CARRA) and the coarser resolution (ca. 31-km grid spacing)
   global European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
   fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) for Svalbard, northern Norway, Sweden
   and Finland is evaluated against observations. The largest differences
   between the two reanalyses are found in regions with complex terrain and
   coastlines, and over the sea ice for temperature in winter. In most
   aspects, CARRA outperforms ERA5 in its agreement with the observations,
   but the value added by CARRA varies with region and season. Furthermore,
   the added value by CARRA is seen for both parameters but is more
   pronounced for temperature than wind speed. CARRA is in better agreement
   with observations in terms of general evaluation metrics like bias and
   standard deviation of the errors, is more similar to the observed
   spatial and temporal variability and better captures local extremes. A
   better representation of high-impact weather like polar lows, vessel
   icing and warm spells during winter is also demonstrated. Finally, it is
   shown that a substantial part of the difference between reanalyses and
   observations is due to representativeness issues, that is, sub-grid
   variability, which cannot be represented in gridded data. This
   representativeness error is larger in ERA5 than in CARRA, but the
   fraction of the total error is estimated to be similar in the two
   analyses for temperature but larger in ERA5 for wind speed.},

Title = {Stability of space use in Svalbard coastal female polar bears:
   intra-individual variability and influence of kinship},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Philopatry influences animal distribution and can lead to a
   kinship-based spatial structure, where proximity and relatedness are
   tightly linked. In the Barents Sea region, polar bears (Ursus maritimus)
   of the coastal ecotype remain year-round within the Svalbard
   archipelago. This coastal strategy is thought to be stable across years;
   however, little is known about the intra-individual variability in site
   fidelity or the influence of kinship on space use. Using high-resolution
   GPS telemetry, we looked at multi-year philopatry among 17 coastal
   female polar bears over eight years (2011-19) and investigated whether
   it is linked to the females' degree of kinship. Individuals showed a
   stable space use in both consecutive and non-consecutive years. Yearly
   individual home ranges (HRs) overlapped, on average, by 44\% (range:
   9-96\%), and their centroids were, on average, 15 km (range: 2-63 km)
   apart. The space use of related females revealed a year-round strong
   female kin structure. Annual HRs of related females overlapped, on
   average, by 24\% (range: 0-66\%), and their centroids were, on average,
   18 km (range: 2-52 km) apart. In contrast, non-related females had much
   larger distances between centroids (average: 160 km, range: 59-283 km).
   Additionally, females showed a great site fidelity in all seasons:
   individual seasonal HR centroids were, on average, less than 30 km
   (range: 1.8-172 km) apart. Bears in this region seem to exhibit a
   stronger site fidelity than those reported from other parts of the
   species range. These findings also highlight the importance of maternal
   learning in space use.},

Journal = {CHEMOECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {259-275},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In flammability assessment, the terpene effect is usually studied using
   their total or subgroup content, missing, therefore, the information
   that could be provided by the molecules themselves. In this study, the
   specific role of terpenes on leaf flammability was sought comparing
   different levels of terpene identification-total, subgroup (i.e. mono-,
   sesqui-, and diterpene), and single compound-as well as their
   interactions with fuel moisture content (FMC) in four species common in
   Mediterranean Wildland-Urban Interfaces (Pinus halepensis,
   Cupressocyparis leylandii, Hesperocyparis arizonica, Cupressus
   sempervirens). Pinus halepensis was the most flammable species (low FMC
   and higher sesquiterpene content but low terpene diversity) while
   Cupressocyparis leylandii presented the highest terpene diversity and
   total terpene content (higher mono- and diterpene content). Flammability
   was differently affected according to the terpene identification level
   used in the models. The effects ranged from non-significant for most
   species studied, using subgroup or total terpene content, to mostly
   significant, using single compound content. Regarding the former, the
   lack of significant results could be due to opposite effects of
   different single compounds within a terpene subgroup. For the latter,
   terpene molecules driving flammability and their effects (positive or
   negative) differed among species. A cumulative effect with FMC was also
   highlighted in some cases but terpenes mostly remained the main
   flammability drivers regardless of the species. Using the refined
   terpene level in modelling allowed a better understanding of the
   compounds' role on flammability, which is useful in the identification
   of plant traits linked to flammability.},

Title = {3D-printed insect models offer a feasible method for mating studies of

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {A variety of models have been used in mating bioassays of insects to
   assess the contribution of chemical and visual signals to mate location
   and mate selection. Although the use of such `dummies' has had varying
   degrees of success, some insect species refuse to accept simplistic
   models. In the present study, we developed a 3D-printed model to explore
   whether more realistic models will be more successful than simplistic
   models in mating assays of difficult to manipulate species such as the
   flea beetle Altica fragariae. We ran five experiments to test (1)
   whether males could discriminate between males and females solely based
   on differences in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), (2) whether males use
   shape or (3) color to choose mates, and (4) whether males can
   discriminate between 3D-printed models and freshly killed beetles either
   with or (5) without legs and antennae. The results of these experiments
   confirmed that male A. fragariae preferred models coated with CHCs of
   females over that of male CHCs, providing strong support for the role of
   CHCs in mate choice in Altica. We also showed that males use both shape
   and color in mate selection, and that males are capable of
   discriminating between the models and real beetle specimens. Together,
   the results indicate that 3D-printed models can provide a feasible and
   cost-effective method for mating studies of insects.},

Title = {The Billefjorden Fault Zone north of Spitsbergen: a major terrane
   boundary?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {The Billefjorden Fault Zone is a major terrane boundary in the Norwegian
   Arctic. The fault separates basement rocks of Svalbard's north-eastern
   and north-western terranes that recorded discrete Precambrian
   tectonothermal histories and were accreted, intensely deformed and
   metamorphosed during the Caledonian Orogeny. Although the fault
   represents a major, crustal-scale tectonic boundary, its north-ward
   extent is not well constrained. The present short contribution addresses
   this issue and presents new seismic mapping of structures and rock units
   north of Wijdefjorden, where the Billefjorden Fault Zone may continue.
   This study shows that there is no evidence for major faulting of the
   top-basement reflection, and therefore, that the Billefjorden Fault Zone
   may die out within Wijdefjorden- Austfjorden, step >= 20 km laterally,
   or be invisible on the presented seismic data. Seismic data also suggest
   that Caledonian basement rocks in Ny-Friesland (north-eastern terrane)
   are not significantly different from basement rocks below the Devonian
   Graben in Andree Land (north-western terrane). Potential implica-tions
   include the absence of a major terrane boundary in northern Spitsbergen.},

Title = {Five decades of terrestrial and freshwater research at Ny-?lesund,
   Svalbard},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {For more than five decades, research has been conducted at Ny-Alesund,
   in Svalbard, Norway, to understand the structure and functioning of High
   Arctic ecosystems and the profound impacts on them of environmental
   change. Terrestrial, freshwater, glacial and marine ecosystems are
   accessible year-round from Ny-Alesund, providing unique opportunities
   for interdisciplinary observational and experimental studies along
   physical, chemical, hydrological and climatic gradients. Here, we
   synthesize terrestrial and freshwater research at Ny-Alesund and review
   current knowledge of biodiversity patterns, species population dynamics
   and interactions, ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and
   anthropogenic impacts. There is now strong evidence of past and ongoing
   biotic changes caused by climate change, including negative effects on
   populations of many taxa and impacts of rain-on-snow events across
   multiple trophic levels. While species-level characteristics and
   responses are well understood for macro-organisms, major knowledge gaps
   exist for microbes, invertebrates and ecosystem-level processes. In
   order to fill current knowledge gaps, we recommend (1) maintaining
   monitoring efforts, while establishing a longterm ecosystem-based
   monitoring programme; (2) gaining a mechanistic understanding of
   environmental change impacts on processes and linkages in food webs; (3)
   identifying trophic interactions and cascades across ecosystems; and (4)
   integrating long-term data on microbial, invertebrate and freshwater
   communities, along with measurements of carbon and nutrient fluxes among
   soils, atmosphere, freshwaters and the marine environment. The synthesis
   here shows that the Ny-Alesund study system has the characteristics
   needed to fill these gaps in knowledge, thereby enhancing our
   understanding of High-Arctic ecosystems and their responses to
   environmental variability and change.},

Title = {Foraging behaviour of sympatrically breeding macaroni (Eudyptes
   chrysolophus) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) penguins at
   Bouvetoya, Southern Ocean},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Species with similar ecological requirements that overlap in range tend
   to segregate their niches to minimize competition for resources.
   However, the niche segregation possibilities for centrally foraging
   predators that breed on isolated Subantarctic islands may be reduced by
   spatial constraints and limitations in the availability of alternative
   prey. In this study we examined spatial and trophic aspects of the
   foraging niches of two sympatrically breeding penguin species, macaroni
   (Eudyptes chrysolophus; MAC) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus;
   CHIN) penguins, at Bouvetoya over two breeding seasons. To measure
   at-sea movements and diving behaviour, 90 MACs and 49 CHINs were
   equipped with GPS loggers and dive recorders during two austral summer
   breeding seasons (2014/15 and 2017/18). In addition, blood samples from
   tracked birds were analysed for stable isotopes to obtain dietary
   information. CHINs displayed marked interannual variation in foraging
   behaviour, diving deeper, utilizing a larger foraging area and
   displaying enriched values of 815N in 2014/15 compared to the 2017/18
   breeding season. In contrast, MACs dove to similar depths and showed
   similar 815N values, while consistently utilizing larger foraging areas
   compared to CHINs. We suggest that low krill abundances in the waters
   around Bouvetoya during the 2014/15 season resulted in CHINs shifting
   toward a diet that increased their niche overlap with MACs. Our findings
   may partly explain the decreasing number of breeding CHINs at the
   world's most remote island, Bouvetoya, while also highlighting the
   importance of characterizing niche overlap of species using multi-season
   data sets.},

Title = {The immune response and diving: conservation considerations for belugas
   (Delphinapterus leucas) in a changing Arctic environment},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {Diving is a critical behaviour of marine mammals, including belugas,
   which dive to forage and travel under Arctic sea ice. While the
   limitations of dive behaviour and physiological dive adaptations have
   been the focus of several studies, cellular adaptations, particularly
   those of the immune system, have been little considered. However, diving
   itself presents several challenges that can impact immune responses,
   leading to disease or injury. As beluga dive their behaviour changes in
   response to human activity or environmental shifts. It is necessary to
   better understand how the beluga's immune system functions during
   diving. This review provides a brief overview of what is known about
   beluga's diving behaviour and physiology and discusses the first efforts
   to understand the link between diving and health via immune function in
   belugas. This new area of research is an important consideration
   regarding potential sub-lethal impacts of a rapidly changing Arctic
   environment on beluga's diving behaviour, health and disease
   susceptibility.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {We report two sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) strandings observed
   in the south-east corner of the Barents Sea (i.e., Pechora Sea) in 2018,
   unusually far from the species' hitherto known distribution. While
   compiling a comprehensive overview of the occurrence of sperm whale
   sightings and strandings in the Russian Arctic, we learnt about one
   further stranding in the Pechora Sea, observed in 2017. All other
   records were from sites considerably closer to the species' usual
   distribution. Reports from the eastern Russian Arctic suggest that sperm
   whales rarely, if ever, entered the Arctic from the Pacific Ocean.
   Although observed occurrences in the Russian Barents Sea have been few
   and sporadic, the occurrence of sperm whales in its south-eastern
   section appears to be a recent phenomenon, which is possibly related to
   declining sea-ice cover.},

Title = {Liverworts frequently form mycothalli on Spitsbergen in the High Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Mycothalli, symbioses between liverworts and soil fungi, have not
   previously been recorded in the Arctic. Here, 13 species of leafy
   liverwort from west Spitsbergen in the High Arctic are examined for the
   symbiosis using epifluorescence microscopy and sequencing of fungal
   ribosomal (r)RNA genes amplified from plant tissues. Microscopy showed
   that intracellular hyphal coils, key indicators of the symbiosis, were
   frequent (>40\% stem length colonized) in nine species of liverwort in
   the families Anastrophyllaceae, Lophoziaceae, Cephaloziellaceae,
   Cephaloziaceae and Scapaniaceae, with hyphae occurring frequently (>40\%
   cells occupied) in the rhizoids of 10 species in the same families. Dark
   septate hyphae, apparently formed by ascomycetes, were frequent on the
   stems of members of the Anastrophyllaceae, Cephaloziellaceae and
   Cephaloziaceae, and typically those growing on acidic mine tailings.
   Sequencing of fungal rRNA genes showed the presence of nine distinct
   groups (based on a 3\% cut-off for ITS sequence divergence) of the
   basidiomycete Serendipita in the Anastrophyllaceae and Lophoziaceae,
   with ordinations and correlative analyses showing the presence of the
   genus to be positively associated with the frequency of hyphal coils,
   the occurrence of which was positively associated with edaphic factors
   (soil delta N-15 value and concentrations of moisture, nitrogen, carbon
   and organic matter). We propose that the frequency of mycothalli in
   leafy liverworts on west Spitsbergen, which is an order of magnitude
   higher than at lower latitudes, may arise from benefits conferred by
   mycobionts on their hosts in the harsh environment of the High Arctic.},

Title = {Sharing country food: connecting health, food security and cultural
   continuity in Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Food security is a complex topic defined not just by having enough
   nutritious food to eat but also by cost, safety and cultural
   considerations. In Arctic Inuit communities, food security is intimately
   connected to culture through traditional methods of harvesting country
   food. In Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut, community-based research was
   conducted in collaboration with Chesterfield Inlet community members
   using interviews and community engagement. Community members were
   consulted about the design of the interview guide, recruitment of
   participants, analysis and validation of results. This study aims to
   develop a theoretical framework of how food security, cultural
   continuity and community health and well-being are interconnected to
   allow for a richer understanding of how increased shipping, climate
   change and social changes are impacting community members. In
   Chesterfield Inlet, harvesting and consuming country food (e.g., seal)
   is perceived as the mechanism that connects food, culture and community
   health. Sharing of freshly harvested country food supports the food
   security of community members without hunters in their families, aligns
   with hunters' cultural beliefs and promotes community health and
   well-being. Changes that reduce a hunter's success in harvesting country
   food limit her or his ability to share country food, which negatively
   impacts community health and well-being. The results of this study
   support existing community efforts to adapt to changes that impact
   harvesting success.},

   movements},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},

Volume = {41},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Accelerated warming of the Arctic has reduced sea ice and has increased
   the occurrence of winter extreme events like rain-on-snow and storms
   that impact sonal movements and grazing conditions. We used caribou
   movements between Banks, Melville and Victoria islands and mainland
   Canada, documented from Indigenous Knowledge, to assess whether
   spatiotemporal trends in sea-ice anomalies (1983-2019) can be used as an
   indicator of caribou movement. We used the SNOWPACK model to evaluate
   how foraging conditions (as indexed by simulated snow properties)
   contribute to the prediction of caribou presence. Our results suggest
   that changes in sea-ice anomalies over time have impacted caribou
   crossings between islands: caribou no longer use areas with less sea ice
   whilst they continue to use areas with more sea ice. Our model
   evaluation shows that, when the simulated snow conditions are paired
   with other environmental variables, the ability of models to predict
   Peary caribou occurrence on land was enhanced across Banks and Melville
   islands. Overall, the land models suggest that caribou are more likely
   to occupy areas with lower density of snow accumulation and a majority
   of forb tundra with dwarf shrubs for Banks Island and cryptogam tundra,
   rush and grass for the Melville Island Complex. Our results suggest that
   future work monitoring changes in sea-ice and snow conditions will be
   important for understanding the impact of climate change on the
   distribution of Peary caribou in the western Arctic.},

Title = {Warming of Atlantic Water in three west Spitsbergen fjords: recent
   patterns and century-long trends},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {We investigated the recent warming of summer Atlantic Water in relation
   to the century-long trends in maximum temperature in three west
   Spitsbergen fjords: Isfjorden, Gronfjorden and Billefjorden. On the
   basis of repeated along-fjord transects in late summer 2003-2019, we
   found that the warming has been pronounced not only in the outer but
   also in the inner domain of Isfjorden, where the presence of waters of
   Atlantic origin was registered more frequently after 2011 compared to
   early 2000s. Furthermore, Atlantic waters occurred more frequently in
   the bottom layers in the inner part of the fjord. In all the
   investigated fjords, the year 2014 was the warmest and saltiest during
   the period 2003-2019, which is consistent with previous reports for
   other west Spitsbergen fjords. In 2014, the mean temperature and
   salinity in Isfjorden and Gronfjorden exceeded 4.9 degrees C and 34.7
   (in Billefjorden, 4.0 degrees C and 34.67, respectively). With the new
   data for 2010-19, we extended the time-series of maximum Atlantic Water
   temperature in Isfjorden and Gronfjorden, covering 1912-2009, reported
   previously by Pavlov et al. 2013. For the period 1912- 2019, the average
   long-term trend of Atlantic Water maximum temperature is 0.25 degrees
   C/decade and 0.22 degrees C/decade in the outer part of Isfjorden and
   Gronfjorden, respectively. In the first two decades of the 21st century,
   the warming trend is steeper compared to the 20th century, 0.78 degrees
   C/decade in Isfjorden and 0.56 degrees C/decade in Gronfjorden,
   highlighting the strength of the ongoing `Atlantification' of west
   Spitsbergen fjords.},

Title = {Applying landscape fragmentation analysis to icescape environments:
   potential impacts for the Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens)},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Sea-ice cover across the Arctic has declined rapidly over the past
   several decades owing to amplified climate warming. The Pacific walrus
   (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) relies on sea-ice floes in the St.
   Lawrence Island (SLI) and Wainwright regions of the Bering and Chukchi
   seas surrounding Alaska as a platform for rest, feeding and
   reproduction. Lower concentrations of thick ice floes are gen-erally
   associated with earlier seasonal fragmentation and shorter annual
   per-sistence of sea-ice cover, potentially affecting the life history of
   the Pacific walrus. In this study, 24 Landsat satellite images were
   classified into thick ice, thin ice or open water to assess sea-ice
   fragmentation over the spring-summer breakup period. Geospatial
   fragmentation analyses traditionally used in terres-trial landscapes
   were newly implemented in this study to characterize the ices -cape
   environment. Fragmentation of sea ice was assessed based on the Percent
   of Landscape, Number of Patches, Mean Area, Shape Index, Euclidean
   Nearest Neighbor and Edge Density. Results show that lower sea-ice
   concentrations in both the SLI and Wainwright regions were associated
   with smaller sea-ice floes. In the Bering Sea, lower sea-ice
   concentrations were also associated with increases in the number of ice
   floes, floe isolation and edge density. By contrast, lower sea-ice
   concentrations in the Chukchi Sea were associated with ice floes that
   were more circular in shape. The continuation of sea-ice decline with
   shift-ing icescape characteristics may result in walruses having to swim
   longer dis-tances in the northern Bering Sea and adapt to use
   less-preferred, rounder ice floes in the Chukchi Sea.},

Title = {Wildfires in the Campanian of James Ross Island: a new macro-charcoal
   record for the Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {The Cretaceous ``high-fire{''} period was a global event that reached
   almost all continental masses during that period in Earth's history. The
   extensive wildfires directly affected plant communities. Significant
   palaeobotanical records in the Antarctic Peninsula have been studied
   from the James Ross Sub-Basin, espe-cially from the Santa Marta
   Formation. However, there is no described evi-dence for palaeo-wildfires
   in the area so far. Here, we present the first occurrence of fossilized
   macro-charcoal coming from James Ross Island, confirming that
   palaeo-wildfires occurred in the Campanian vegetation preserved in the
   Santa Marta Formation. The new charcoal material has a gymnospermous
   taxonomic affinity, more specifically with the Araucariaceae, which is
   in accordance with previous palaeobotanical records from James Ross
   Island. This occurrence adds new information to the construction of the
   palaeo-wildfire scenario for Gondwana.},

Title = {Seasonality of social behaviour among immature belugas (Delphinapterus
   leucas) in managed care},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) in managed care have been reported to
   show seasonal variation in socio-sexual behaviour, hormone levels and
   respiration rates; however, little is known about the social
   interactions of wild belugas when they are not in summer, near-shore
   congregations. To better understand if belugas show seasonal variation
   in social interactions, this study recorded the behaviour of 10 belugas
   (five females, five males, ranging from birth to 10 years of age) housed
   in managed care. Social interactions typically peaked in the summer
   months but persisted at very low levels during the rest of the year.
   Seasonal variation was most dramatic for socio-sexual behaviour but was
   generally mirrored in pattern by agonistic and affiliative interactions.
   Subjects closer to maturity displayed more seasonal variation than
   younger subjects, and males displayed more seasonal variation compared
   to females. The peak in social interactions found in this study aligns
   rather closely with wild belugas' summer, near-shore congregations,
   where belugas have increased opportunities for socializing. Although
   belugas in managed care do not experience a seasonal change in habitat,
   they do show seasonal changes in social behaviour, which are likely
   driven by seasonal fluctuations in hormone levels. It is therefore
   expected that wild beluga populations would show similar behavioural
   patterns if they were observed throughout the remainder of the year.
   This research has applications for belugas in managed care and may
   provide a framework for understanding the social behaviour of wild
   belugas. This article is part of the special cluster Beluga whales
   (Delphinapterus leucas): knowledge from the wild, human care and TEK,
   which has been funded by Mystic Aquarium, CAFF and the Norwegian
   Ministry of Climate and Environment.},

Title = {A climatology of wintertime low-level jets in Nares Strait},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Intense, southward low-level winds are common in Nares Strait, between
   Ellesmere Island and northern Greenland. The steep topography along
   Nares Strait leads to channelling effects, resulting in an along-strait
   flow. This research study presents a 30-year climatology of the flow
   regime from simulations of the COSMO-CLM climate model. The simulations
   are available for the winter periods (November-April) 1987/88 to
   2016/17, and thus, cover a period long enough to give robust long-term
   characteristics of Nares Strait. The horizontal resolution of 15 km is
   high enough to represent the complex terrain and the meteorological
   conditions realistically. The 30-year climatology shows that LLJs
   associated with gap flows are a climatological feature of Nares Strait.
   The maximum of the mean 10-m wind speed is around 12 m s(-1) and is
   located at the southern exit of Smith Sound. The wind speed is strongly
   related to the pressure gradient. Single events reach wind speeds of 40
   m s(-1) in the daily mean. The LLJs are associated with gap flows within
   the narrowest parts of the strait under stably stratified conditions,
   with the main LLJ occurring at 100-250 m height. With increasing
   mountain Froude number, the LLJ wind speed and height increase. The
   frequency of strong wind events (>20 m s(-1) in the daily mean) for the
   10 m wind shows a strong interannual variability with an average of 15
   events per winter. Channelled winds have a strong impact on the
   formation of the North Water polynya.},

   naumanni) in High-Arctic Greenland},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Morphological measurements of 45 adult Atlantic puffins Fratercula
   arctica were collected in High-Arctic Greenland between 2010 and 2016.
   Measurements support that the population belongs to the F. a. naumanni
   subspecies and were significantly larger than those from populations
   found at lower latitudes, including F. a. grabae and F. a. arctica
   populations. Male puffins from High-Arctic Greenland had greater mass,
   bill length and tarsus length than females, but no difference was found
   in wing length. In comparison to other naumanii populations, body size
   was most similar to puffins in Svalbard. Overall, the measured Atlantic
   puffins from High-Arctic Greenland had some of the largest and most
   variable morphological measurements reported for any studied Atlantic
   puffin population. While morphological measurements and the relative
   geographic isolation of the puffin population in High-Arctic Greenland
   support the naumanni subspecies designation, additional research should
   use genetic methods to determine if this population and other
   populations in the North Atlantic are isolated. This is the only
   collection of naumanni morphometric measurements from geographical North
   America and enhances our collective knowledge of the species.},

Title = {Hormone profiles from Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and aquarium beluga whales},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from Cook Inlet (CI), Alaska, are
   listed as ???endangered??? because of dramatic declines in abundance,
   with no indications of population recovery. Serum samples from this
   population are exceedingly rare. Longitudinal samples from aquarium (AQ)
   belugas can potentially provide health assessment reference ranges for
   free-ranging beluga, including reproduc-tive and metabolic hormones. We
   analysed serum hormone concentrations from CI (n = 6, three females and
   three males) and Bristol Bay (Alaska; BB; n = 5, four males and one
   female), alongside AQ (n = 3, two females and one male) belugas, to
   conduct physiological comparisons of reproductive hormones
   (progesterone, testosterone and total oestrogens) and metabolic hormones
   (total thyroxine, triiodothyronine and cortisol) in beluga serum.
   Oestrogen and progesterone profiles from January through May from two AQ
   female beluga were typical of non-pregnant, cycling females. CI and BB
   sex steroid concentrations were within AQ hormone ranges, with the
   exception of elevated progesterone concentrations in four potentially
   pregnant females. Both CI and BB belugas had elevated meta-bolic
   hormones, which may indicate greater metabolic effort required in the
   wild environment or capture response. Because sample collection from CI
   belugas is rare, analysis of even the few samples that we analysed may
   contribute to the conservation of the small and declining population of
   genetically distinct CI beluga whales. It is important that each sample
   collected from free-range CI belu-gas provides the maximum biological
   information possible. Continued compari-son of hormones in AQ and
   free-ranging beluga will enhance the interpretation of health data in
   both groups.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {This study uses cetacean sighting data, acquired via a citizen science
   pro-gramme, to update distributions and spatial trends of whales and
   dolphins in waters around the Svalbard Archipelago during the period
   2005-2019. Distri-butions, based on kernel density estimates, from an
   early period (2005-2019) and a recent period (2015-19) were compared to
   identify potential shifts in distribution in this area, which is
   experiencing rapid warming and concomi-tant sea-ice losses. Among the
   three Arctic endemic cetaceans, white whales (Delphinapterus leucas,
   also known as beluga) had a stable, coastal distribution throughout the
   study, whereas narwhals (Monodon monoceros) and bowhead whales (Balaena
   mysticetus) were observed only north of the archipelago, but with
   increasing frequency during the recent period. White-beaked dolphins
   (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) had a stable distribution along the
   continental shelf break, west and south of Svalbard. Sperm whale
   observations shifted from west of Bjornoya during the early period to
   being concentrated around the north end of Prins Karls Forland, west of
   Spitsbergen during the recent period. The four summer-resident baleen
   whales-blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera
   physalus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and minke whales
   (Balaenoptera acutorostrata)-have shifted their distributions from the
   continental shelf break west of Spitsbergen during the early period into
   fjords and coastal areas during the recent period. These changes
   coincide with increased inflows of Atlantic Water into the fjords along
   the west coast of Spits-bergen and across the north of the archipelago.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Many areas in the Arctic are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change. We observe large-scale effects on physical, biological, economic
   and social parameters, including ice cover, species distributions,
   economic activity and regional gover-nance frameworks. Arctic living
   marine resources are affected in various ways. A holistic understanding
   of these effects requires a multidisciplinary enterprise. We synthesize
   relevant research, from oceanography and ecology, via economics, to
   political science and international law. We find that multidisciplinary
   research can enhance our understanding and promote new questions and
   issues relating to impacts and outcomes of climate change in the Arctic.
   Such issues include recent insights on changing spawning migrations of
   the North-east Arctic cod stock that necessitates revisions of
   socioeconomic estimates of ecosystem wealth in the Barents Sea, better
   integrated prediction systems that require increased coopera-tion
   between experts on climate prediction and ecosystem modelling, and
   institu-tional complexities of Arctic governance that require enhanced
   coordination.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pterygotid eurypterids are the most speciose eurypterid Glade,
   accounting for almost a fifth of the approximately 250 known species,
   although it is unclear whether this increase in diversity is due to
   their increased dispersal ability, shift in predation style to
   cheliceral-driven prey capture, or some other factor. Determining if the
   development of their characteristic large chelicerae represents a key
   trait facilitating increased diversification is hindered by uncertainty
   regarding the form of the chelicerae in Slimonia, the sister taxon to
   Pterygotidae. Here I report the discovery of a specimen of Slimonia
   acuminata preserving the chelicerae in detail and corroborate reports
   from the 1800s suggesting that the chelicerae of Slimonia were short and
   robust. The evidence from the new specimen, taken in concert with the
   morphology of the rest of the animal, indicates that Slimonia was an
   active predator that captured prey with its robust prosomal appendages.
   The apparent increase in pterygotid species diversity therefore does
   indeed seem to be associated with the development of the large
   chelicerae; however, further work is needed to determine whether
   taphonomic biases in preservation due to increased sclerotization of the
   chelicerae or taxonomic oversplitting due to minor changes in denticle
   morphology are driving this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The genus Lepidisis was established by Verrill in 1883 for three species

   description. Using what remains of Verrill's syntype specimens and a new
   specimen collected from off of the coast of the New England region, USA,
   we show that Verrill made a serious mistake in his description of the
   type species, and that mistake has caused some of the confusion
   surrounding this genus. We redescribe the type species, then use that
   description to evaluate the other species currently assigned to the
   genus.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {For more than 20 years Antarctic Treaty Parties have been discussing how
   to appropriately manage cumulative impacts in the continent. Preventing
   cumu-lative impacts requires the fluent exchange of information to
   enable proper and timely assessment of, and response to, the impacts
   that result from multiple activities, undertaken by multiple
   stakeholders and supervised by different Parties. This is a particular
   challenge for the effective management of Antarctic Specially Protected
   Areas (ASPAs), as a lack of coordination may potentially put at risk the
   fulfillment of their conservation objectives. Here we suggest that
   incorporating lessons learnt from protected areas management elsewhere
   might improve the effectiveness of ASPAs and provide valuable
   experiences and insights on how to better manage cumulative impacts in
   the rest of the continent. Key concepts to incorporate in Antarctica???s
   environmental manage-ment toolbox include (1) the notion of adaptive
   management, which is a cor-nerstone of protected areas management
   effectiveness elsewhere, and (2) the need of empowering protected area
   managers, which are a key (but often miss-ing) element to ensure local
   compliance with management plans, co-ordinate on site activities,
   facilitate exchange of information, promote cooperation and manage
   conflicts.},

Title = {Distribution and habitat characteristics of pinnipeds and polar bears in
   the Svalbard Archipelago, 2005-2018},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {This study presents comprehensive mapping of the current distribution of
   pinnipeds and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) around Svalbard based on a
   regional marine mammal sightings programme and explores time-trends
   (2005- 2018). Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) were observed with high
   frequency and in high numbers around previously identified haul-out
   sites. At-sea walruses were seen close to the coast in shallow waters.
   Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) were observed in coastal areas throughout
   Svalbard, often in association with tidewater glacier fronts. There was
   no increase in the mean latitude for ringed seal observations, but there
   was an increased frequency of observations at around 82 degrees N, which
   reflects their following a northward shift in the ice edge during summer
   foraging trips. Bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were observed
   frequently in north-western Spitsbergen and shared many habitat features
   with ringed seals. There was a slight increase in the mean latitude of
   bearded seal observations and a decreased frequency of observation in
   the southern parts of the archipelago, suggesting that this species
   might be shifting its distribution. Harbour seal (Phoca vitulina)
   observations within fjords have increased, likely as a consequence of
   increased inflow of Atlantic water into west coast fjords. Harp seals
   (Pagophilus groenlandicus) were observed with high frequency north of
   Svalbard. Hooded seals (Cystophora -cristata) were observed only rarely.
   Polar bears were reported most frequently, undoubtedly as a result of an
   effort bias favouring this species. In spite of biases, citizen-based
   observations are useful for assessing broad distributional patterns of
   marine mammals through time.},

   possible mineralization risks of soil organic matter and assess
   microbial communities in the tundra and forest-tundra permafrost soils
   of the southern Yamal region of Russia. The profile distribution of
   carbon, nitrogen and the C:N ratio showed non-gradual changes with depth
   due to the manifestation of cryopedogenesis in soil profiles, which lead
   to cryogenic mass transfer. Mean carbon stocks for the study area were
   7.85 +/- 2.24 kg m(-2) (0-10 cm layer), 14.97 +/- 5.53 kg m(-2) (0-30
   cm) and 23.99 +/- 8.00 kg m(-2) (0-100 cm). The analysis of the humus
   type revealed a predominance of fulvic type and low-molecular-weight
   fragments in the fulvic acid fraction, which indicates high
   mineralization risk of humic substances under Arctic warming conditions.
   The taxonomic analysis of soil microbiomes revealed 48 bacterial and
   archaeal phyla, among which proteobacteria (27\%) and actino-bacteria
   (20\%) were predominant. The pH range and nitrogen accumulation were the
   main environmental determinants of microbial community diversity and
   composition in the studied soils.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the health status and potential effect of disease outbreaks
   among Southern Ocean fauna may be decisive for its conservation. We
   assessed the exposure and infection of Antarctic fur seals
   (Arctocephalus gazella, AFS) and Southern elephant seals (Miroun,ga
   leonine, SES) to parapoxvirus, Phocid alphaherpesvirus-1 (PhHV 1),
   smooth Brucella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. AFS = 65) serum and swab
   samples, and SES (n = 13) serum samples from the sub-Antarctic island of
   Bouvetoya (54 degrees 25'S, 03 degrees 22'E) were collected during two
   austral summers (2014/15, 2017/18). Three polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) tests amplifying the DNA polymerase, B2L and GIF parapoxvirus
   genomic regions were performed, investigating DNA from mucosal swab
   samples. The glycoprotein B gene was targeted to detect PliHV-1 viral
   DNA. Sera were assayed for T. gondii and smooth Brucella spp. antibodies
   with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Parapoxvirus PCR
   amplicons of the expected size were generated in two of the 29 AFS pups
   (nasal swabs, 2014/15), targeting the B2L (n = 2) and DNA polymerase (n
   = 1) genes, whereas the GIF PCR did not amplify target sequences. The
   PCR amplicons were sequenced and blasted in GenBank, revealing highest
   similarity with a seal parapoxvirus, confirming the presence of the
   virus in AFS for the first time. No PhHV-1 amplicons were generated, and
   antibodies against T gondii or smooth Brucella spp. were not detected.
   Our data indicate that these seals are host for parapoxvirus but are
   neither exposed to smooth Brucella spp. nor T. gondii. Evidence of
   PhHV-1 shedding was not detected.},

Title = {Stranded beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) calf response and care: reports
   of two cases with different outcomes},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Given the remote, rugged areas belugas typically inhabit and the low
   rehabilitation success rate with any cetacean, it is rare to have the
   opportunity to rescue a live-stranded beluga. The Alaska SeaLife Center
   cared for two stranded beluga calves with two different outcomes. In
   2012, a neonatal male beluga calf (DL1202) stranded following intense
   storms in Bristol Bay. In 2017, a helicopter pilot discovered a stranded
   male beluga calf (DL1705) during a flight over Cook Inlet. The Alaska
   SeaLife Center transported both calves for rehabilitation and utilized
   supportive care plans based on those for other species of stranded
   cetaceans and care of neonatal belugas at zoological facilities.
   Diagnostics included complete blood counts, serum chemistries, microbial
   cultures, hearing tests, imaging and morphometric measurements to
   monitor systemic health. Treatments included in-pool flotation support;
   antimicrobials; gastrointestinal support; and close monitoring of
   respirations, urination, defecation and behaviour. After three weeks of
   supportive care, the Bristol Bay calf (DL1202) succumbed to sepsis
   secondary to a possible prematurity-related lack of passive transfer of
   antibodies. After seven weeks, the Cook Inlet calf (DL1705) recovered
   and all medications were discontinued. Unable to survive on his own, he
   was declared non-releasable and placed in long-term care at a zoological
   facility, to live with other belugas. Aspects and details from
   successful cases of cetacean critical care become important references
   especially vital for the survival of essential animals in small,
   endangered populations.},

Title = {The challenges of a small population exposed to multiple anthropogenic
   stressors and a changing climate: the St. Lawrence Estuary beluga},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Until 2012, the St. Lawrence Estuary beluga population was considered
   stable with about 1100 individuals. An abnormally high number of calves
   reported dead that year triggered a population status reassessment. This
   review article summarizes the findings from this reassessment and
   various studies subsequent to it and provides an updated analysis of
   carcass recovery rates up to 2019. The 2013 review indicated a decreased
   incidence of cancer in adults, suggesting positive impacts from the
   regulation of toxic substances (e.g., PCBs and PAHs). However, the
   review also revealed that the population initiated a decline of ca. 1\%
   per year in the early 2000s and had reached a size of ca. 900
   individuals by 2012. This decline was accompanied by high inter-annual
   variability in calf survival and pregnancy rates and by more frequent
   peripartum complications among dead females. The change in population
   dynamics coincided with a shift in the St. Lawrence ecosystem structure
   and warmer environmental conditions, suggesting a link through effects
   on reproductive success and adult female body condition. This was
   supported by the continued high calf mortality after 2012 and a
   documented decline of fat reserves in beluga blubber from 1998 to 2016.
   Other factors, such as the exposure to chronic vessel noise, increasing
   whale-watching activities, high contaminant levels and episodic harmful
   algal blooms, may also be contributing to the long-term non-recovery and
   current decline of the population. The strong natal philopatry and
   complex social system of the beluga likely increase its vulnerability to
   extinction risk by limiting dispersal.},

Title = {Stable ringed seal (Pusa hispida) demography despite significant habitat
   change in Svalbard, Norway},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Ringed seals, which are small phocid seals, range across the circumpolar
   Arctic, and have evolved in close association with sea ice and depend on
   it for all aspects of their life history. This research study compares
   age structure, reproductive parameters, body size and condition during
   three time periods-1981-82 (n = 277), 2002-04 (n = 272) and 2012-18 (n =
   212)- to study potential changes in demography in ringed seals in
   western Svalbard, Norway, an area that has undergone dramatic changes in
   sea-ice conditions during recent decades. Age distributions for the
   three time periods were similar, with the exception that the most recent
   period had a higher proportion of young animals. Age at sexual maturity
   for both sexes was similar for the two most recent periods, both being
   lower than in the 1980s. Ovulation rates did not vary significantly
   among the three periods (range 0.86-0.94). Pregnancy rates were only
   available for the most recent study period (0.71); this value falls
   within the range reported from other Arctic regions. Body length showed
   no clear temporal patterns; males were slightly longer in the most
   recent period, while females were slightly longer in the first period.
   Data from May in all periods suggest that body condition has not varied
   significantly through time. In conclusion, although the ringed seal
   breeding habitat in Svalbard has declined significantly in recent
   decades, demographic parameters appear to be largely unaffected.
   Life-history plasticity in combination with a small-scale regional
   variation in environmental conditions might explain the lack of changes
   in demography over time.},

   photolysis and sublimation: a field investigation},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Nitrate in snow is subject to post-depositional processing, which leads
   to a net loss and redistribution within the snowpack. The relative
   importance of post-depositional loss processes such as the
   volatilization of nitric acid (HNO3) and photolysis of nitrate has long
   been debated. Changes in nitrate and chloride concentrations in the
   snowpack were investigated at H128 (69 degrees 23.584'S, 41 degrees
   33.712'E), an Antarctic coastal site approximately 100 km from Syowa
   Station in East Antarctica from December 2015 to February 2016. Results
   indicate that chloride migrated to deeper sites within the snowpack
   under the influence of water vapour movement. Moreover, 50\% of the
   nitrate on surface snow was lost to photolysis, and approximately 20\%
   of the nitrate was absent at a depth of 40 cm. To enhance our knowledge
   of the Antarctic geochemical cycle, this study is the first to suggest
   chloride ion movement in snowpacks or significant nitrate loss for any
   Antarctic coastal site.},

Title = {Patterns of interdisciplinary collaboration resemble biogeochemical
   relationships in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: a historical
   social network analysis of science, 1907-2016},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Co-authorship networks can provide key insights into the production of
   scientific knowledge. This is particularly interesting in Antarctica,
   where most human activity relates to scientific research. Bibliometric
   studies of Antarctic science have provided a useful understanding of
   international and interdisciplinary collaboration, yet most research has
   focused on broad-scale analyses over recent time periods. Here, we take
   advantage of a `Goldilocks' opportunity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, an
   internationally important region of Antarctica and the largest ice-free
   region on the continent. The McMurdo Dry Valleys have attracted
   continuous and diverse scientific activity since 1958. It is a
   geographically confined region with limited access, making it possible
   to evaluate the influence of specific events and individuals. We trace
   the history of environmental science in this region using bibliometrics
   and social network analysis. Our results show a marked shift in focus
   from the geosciences to the biosciences, which mirrors wider trends in
   the history of science. Collaboration among individuals and academic
   disciplines increased through time, and the most productive scientists
   in the network are also the most interdisciplinary. Patterns of
   collaboration among disciplines resemble the biogeochemical
   relationships among respective landscape features, raising interesting
   questions about the role of the material environment in the development
   of scientific networks in the region, and the dynamic interaction with
   socio-cultural and political factors. Our focused, historical approach
   adds nuance to broad-scale bibliometric studies and could be applied to
   understanding the dynamics of scientific research in other regions of
   Antarctica and elsewhere.},

Title = {Minimally invasive physiological correlates of social behaviour in
   belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) under human care},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Simultaneous observations of reproductive physiology and behaviour were
   conducted on a group of two male and two female belugas under
   professionally managed care for one year to explore potential mating
   strategies. Weekly blow sampling for progesterone in females was used to
   define the breeding season by detecting three oestrous cycles in one
   female. Twice weekly blow sampling for testosterone and twice monthly
   testes measurements via ultrasonography were used to detect reproductive
   seasonality in both males. Female-male association frequency varied
   longitudinally, with 70\% of all interactions occurring during the
   16-week breeding season. Male-male associations did not vary seasonally.
   Male display behaviours towards the female occurred 14.8 times more
   frequently during the breeding season (0.164 +/- 0.188 behaviours/min)
   than outside of the breeding season (0.011 +/- 0.042 behaviours/min).
   The cycling female responded variably to male display behaviours by
   altering swim speed or body orientation towards the male. Although this
   small sample size limits broad conclusions, the frequent display
   behaviours, low copulation rate and lack of serious male-male aggression
   are consistent with predictions for pre-copulatory female mate choice
   developed from the current knowledge of beluga reproductive physiology.
   These observations, which are not feasible for wild belugas, provide
   important management considerations because reduced opportunities for
   mate choice could limit the reproductive rate, especially in small
   populations.},

Title = {Variation in body size of ringed seals (Pusa hispida hispida) across the
   circumpolar Arctic: evidence of morphs, ecotypes or simply extreme
   plasticity?},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The ringed seal is a small phocid seal that has a northern circumpolar
   distribu-tion. It has long been recognized that body size is variable in
   ringed seals, and it has been suggested that ecotypes that differ in
   size exist. This study explores patterns of body size (length and girth)
   and age-at-maturity across most of the Arctic subspecies' range using
   morphometric data from 35 sites. Asymptotic lengths varied from 113 to
   151 cm, with sites falling into five distinct size clus-ters (for each
   sex). Age-at-maturity ranged from 3.1 to 7.4 years, with sites that had
   early ages of sexual maturity generally having small length-at-maturity
   and small final body length. The sexes differed in length at some sites,
   but not in a consistent pattern of dimorphism. The largest ringed seals
   occurred in western Greenland and eastern Canada, and the smallest
   occurred in Alaska and the White Sea. Latitudinal trends occurred only
   within sites in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Girth (with length and
   season accounted for) was also highly variable but showed no notable
   spatial pattern; males tended to be more rotund than females. Genetic
   studies are needed, starting with the ``giants{''} at Kangia (Greenland)
   and in northern Canada to determine whether they are genetically
   distinct ecotypes. Additional research is also needed to understand the
   ecologi-cal linkages that drive the significant regional size
   differences in ringed seals that were confirmed in this study, and also
   to understand their implications with respect to potential adaptation to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {We present the Late Pleistocene extinct shrub-ox, Euceratherium collinum
   (Bovidae), dung pellets recovered from Pontatoc Ridge Shelter, a dry
   alcove in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona. The shelter
   is at the current upper edge of the ArizonaUpland subdivision (the
   highest and coldest part) of the Sonoran Desert. Packrat (Neotoma)
   middens with macrobotanical fossils and a floor deposit consisting of
   midden debris and dung pellets were sampled and are described here. Six
   packrat middens radiocarbon date to 15,690-22,874 cal yr B.P.
   (calibrated years before present); dung pellets from the floor deposit
   date to 14,990 cal yr B.P. Macrobotanical fossils primarily from the
   middens but also from the floor deposit indicate that a woodland
   composed of Arizona cypress (Hesperocyparis {[}Cupressus] arizonica),
   Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a
   hybrid singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla var. fallax), border
   pinyon (Pinus discolor), juniper (Juniperus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos
   pungens), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) grew outside the
   shelter. Dung pellets were measured, compared with other extant and
   extinct species, and sampled for phytoliths and pollen. Based on size,
   morphology, DNA, and physiographic setting (cliff face), our assumption
   is that only a single taxon of slickrockclimbing ruminant used the
   small, extremely inaccessible Pontatoc Ridge Shelter and that all large
   pellets belong to the extinct shrub-ox. The distribution of Late
   Pleistocene shrub-ox is reviewed; the stocky, rather short ruminant is
   recovered mainly in mountainous and canyon-county terrains of western
   United States and northern Mexico.},

Abstract = {We studied the roles of traditional irrigation systems called acequias
   in supporting riparian habitat in terms of riparian tree planting
   success. We planted Populus deltoides wislizenii (Rio Grande cottonwood)
   pole cuttings at locations close to and far from surface water: 1, 2,
   and 3 m from the edge of an acequia, within 100 m from the river that
   supplies water to the acequia, and in the middle (lengthwise) of a
   500-m-long, 115-m-wide, fallow field between the acequia and the river.
   The poles were planted at deep and shallow depths. We measured survival
   and growth at each plot and planting depth after the 2008 and 2009
   growing seasons. We hypothesized that the poles planted near the acequia
   would survive and grow similarly to poles planted near the river.
   Acequia-related seepage created localized areas where riparian plantings
   had survival rates >80\%. Poles planted by the acequia and river had
   higher survival rates (>80\%) than those in the fallow field (<50\%).
   The deeper plantings led to, on average, 50\% more growth than the
   shallow plantings in terms of height gain, leaf area, number of new
   shoots, and basal diameter gain. Results from this study show that
   acequias successfully support cottonwood pole plantings.},

Abstract = {We report the results of standardized surveys to determine Mojave desert
   tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) direct mortality and injury as a result of
   the 2020 Cottonwood Trail Fire in the Red Cliffs National Conservation
   Area, Utah. We encountered 14 tortoise remains attributed to fire, one
   fire-injured tortoise, and three live tortoises within a 250-ha area of
   burned tortoise habitat. We used an infrared-equipped trail camera to
   monitor the health of a fire-injured tortoise at a burrow site. The
   camera recorded the first observation of a desert woodrat (Neotoma
   lepida) feeding on a live, fire-injured desert tortoise. We hypothesize
   that desert woodrat carnivory of fire-injured tortoises in burrows might
   contribute to indirect (and undetected) firerelated tortoise mortality.},

Title = {VARIATION IN THE DIET OF GREATER ROADRUNNERS (GEOCOCCYX CALIFORNIANUS)

Abstract = {Greater roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) are conspicuous and
   well-recognized members of the southwestern fauna. Conventional wisdom
   suggests that roadrunners prey heavily upon vertebrates, particularly
   lizards and snakes, but detailed studies are lacking. We investigated
   roadrunner diet at a site in southern Texas inhabited by four
   state-threatened reptiles to better characterize seasonal variation in
   diet and speculate on the relative impact of these predators on
   state-threatened species. We examined gizzards from 144 greater
   roadrunners collected across four seasons (Summer 1997, Spring 1998,
   Summer 1998, Winter 2002) and enumerated the number of food items for
   each taxa identified. We compared dietary richness, diversity, evenness,
   number of food items, and similarity among the four seasons. We also
   evaluated the relationship between roadrunner body size and diet, and we
   estimated annual consumption rates for each taxa found in the diet.
   Roadrunner diet was rich and highly variable, but 95.9\% of 6,834
   identifiable food items were invertebrates. Overall, grasshoppers and
   beetles dominated all samples. Total number of food items consumed,
   particularly weevils, birds, and fruit, increased during the winter
   sampling period. There was a significant, but weakly predictive, inverse
   relationship between wing chord length and dietary richness. Our
   calculations suggested the average roadrunner would minimally consume
   34,639 prey items per year on this site. Snake consumption was less
   common than the popular perception of greater roadrunners would suggest.
   The consumption of vertebrates seemed to coincide with general abundance
   or when weather patterns decreased abundance of invertebrates.
   Consumption of two state-threatened species (Texas horned lizard
   {[}Phrynosoma cornutum] and Texas indigo snake {[}Drymarchon melanurus])
   occurred, but not at a level to suggest that greater roadrunners
   negatively impacted populations of these species. Thus, the diet of this
   species appears to be driven by availability, and greater roadrunners
   act as exceptional generalist omnivores.},

Abstract = {Submerged aquatic macrophytes (SAMs) have been studied extensively in
   lotic ecosystems at low elevations, but few studies have been conducted
   in high-elevation systems, and factors controlling SAM distribution at
   high elevation are not well understood. After anecdotal and published
   documentation of abundant SAMs in high-elevation streams in the Jemez
   Mountains, northern New Mexico, USA, we wanted to determine what
   combination of physical factors are controlling the presence or absence
   of SAMs in the Jemez River watershed. We surveyed several sites on the
   three major river systems in the watershed along a gradient of elevation
   for physical factors, presence-absence, and percent cover of each taxa.
   Our results showed that SAMs were observed in 60\% of surveyed sites
   that were associated with deeper, narrower, lower-velocity streams with
   low gradients. This evidence suggests that SAMs at high elevations are
   subject to similar abiotic controls found for SAM presence at lower
   elevations.},

Abstract = {Numerous species of long-distance, Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds
   use Venezuela as a nonbreeding or migratory stopover site. We examined
   band recovery data (recaptures or dead-recoveries) in Venezuela from
   1926 to 2017. The band recovery data included 1,891 individual birds,
   representing 42 species from 17 families. Banding countries or islands
   of origin included Argentina, French Guiana, Aruba, Barbuda, the United
   States (U.S.) Virgin Islands, Trinidad, the continental United States,
   and Canada. Blue-winged teal (Spatula discors; 1,432 of 1,891 total
   recoveries, 75.7\%), royal tern (Thalasseus maximus; 117/1,891, 6.2\%),
   osprey (Pandion haliaetus; 93/1,891, 4.9\%), common tern (Sterna
   hirundo; 88/1,891, 4.7\%), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus;
   27/1,891, 1.4\%) were the most common banded birds in our assessment.
   Despite ongoing banding efforts, other bird species banded in Venezuela
   have not been recovered or recaptured in the Western Hemisphere. Despite
   significant social and political challenges that impede scientific
   research in Venezuela, the bird-banding community in Venezuela is
   growing, and this growth will likely facilitate our understanding of the
   annual cycle of numerous avifauna.},

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Arthropods are important prey for many avian taxa, particularly during
   the breeding season. Many studies have used sticky traps to estimate
   relative abundance of arthropods as avian prey, but we know little about
   the potential biases associated with sticky traps. We evaluated the
   effect of small-scale variation in trap placement on the biomass of
   arthropods caught on sticky traps in six riparian woodlands in
   southeastern Arizona. We detected differences in arthropod biomass
   between two height categories (1 and 4 m off the ground) for three
   insect orders and between two sampling locations (0 and 10 m from the
   center of the stream bed) for two insect orders. These differences
   indicate that placement of sticky traps affects arthropod capture rates
   and, hence, small variation in trap placement can bias investigators'
   ability to document spatial and temporal differences in arthropod
   abundance. Investigators who use sticky traps to make comparisons of
   arthropod abundance need to ensure that placement is consistent over
   time or across treatments to ensure that comparisons are not biased.},

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tourist activity in natural areas may impact species' behavior and
   ecology as well as predator-prey dynamics. Although previous research
   has demonstrated effects of human disturbance on wildlife communities,
   only a limited number of studies have focused on small mammals and
   coyote predator-prey systems. To generate an overview of human impacts
   on these wildlife communities, we analyzed camera trap data from a
   human-disturbed site at Lake Tahoe, California. To compare species'
   activity patterns in relation to distances from human-disturbed areas,
   we used single-species occupancy models, estimations of species'
   temporal activity overlaps, and the time between detections of different
   species at camera sites. We found that in general black bears (Ursus
   americanus) avoided areas of high human disturbance, whereas coyotes
   (Canis latrans), rodents, and lagomorphs favored them. However, rodents
   and lagomorphs also avoided areas with high coyote detections,
   indicating that rodents and lagomorphs mostly used human-disturbed areas
   that were not highly frequented by coyotes. Additionally, all
   aforementioned species avoided humans temporally and this avoidance
   increased in closer proximity to human-disturbed areas. These findings
   indicate that while some species frequented human-disturbed areas more
   than others, all species studied exhibited greater temporal avoidance of
   humans when closer to areas of higher human activity. Our results also
   indicate that rodents' and lagomorphs' activity patterns overlapped more
   with coyotes' activity patterns closer to humandisturbed areas and
   rodents and lagomorphs avoided coyotes less in these areas. The greater
   overlap of the species' activity patterns suggests that there is likely
   more interaction between coyotes and their prey closer to areas of high
   human activity. The changes in the behavior and ecology of wildlife
   communities closer to human-disturbed areas reported here emphasize how
   proximity to human-disturbed areas may influence both predator and prey
   demographics.},

   recovered from the Ogallala Formation in western Oklahoma are three taxa
   of bats. The bat fossils occurred together with vertebrate fossils of
   the Whisenhunt local fauna of Clarendonian age, biochron Cl2, from the
   Whisenhunt Quarry and another nearby locality tentatively assigned to
   the same local fauna. The only previous record of fossil bats from the
   area was of Myotis cf. yumanensis. We prefer to call the previous record
   of Myotis species indeterminate and provide the first Oklahoma Miocene
   records of a pallid bat, Antrozous cf. pallidus (Vespertilionidae), and
   a freetailed bat of indeterminate genus (Molossidae). The molossid is a
   relatively large species approximately the size of the recent big
   free-tailed bat, Nyctinomops macrotis. Although the sample is very
   limited, these are the only pre-Quaternary bats known from Oklahoma.},

   and 2011 surveys. Dermatophyte cultures on skin and hair samples were
   positive on specimens examined in 2004, but fungi identified were
   nonpathogenic. Environmental stress is implicated as a potential factor
   contributing to alopecia in the population.},

Title = {NO RELATIONSHIP OBSERVED BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND RICKETTSIA PRESENCE IN

Abstract = {Ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks are important vectors of pathogens
   affecting humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. Habitat type is a
   major determinant of abundance of small mammals, abundance of associated
   ectoparasites, and community composition, but the role habitats have in
   the association of a pathogen occurring within an ectoparasite is
   currently unknown. We tested the hypothesis that natural history and
   habitat type of small mammal hosts shape the probability of their
   ectoparasites serving as hosts for a pathogen. Ectoparasites were
   collected from small mammals captured in mature hardwood forests,
   midrotation, previously thinned loblolly pine plantations, and early
   successional field habitats. The ectoparasites were screened for
   Rickettsia using genus-specific polymerase chain reaction. Rodents
   consisted of 14 Peromyscus leucopus with 28.57\% Rickettsia-infected
   ectoparasites, 25 Sigmodon hispidus with 8.86\% infected ectoparasites,
   and 2 Microtus pinetorum with 0.00\% infected ectoparasites. Rickettsia
   was identified in 13 (12.38\%) of the 105 ectoparasites screened from 41
   (17.01\%) of the 241 small mammal hosts. No significant association
   between host traits, habitat type, and Rickettsia-positive ectoparasites
   was detected. Although habitat type and availability of small mammals
   may shape the abundance and composition of ectoparasite communities,
   results of our study suggested these determinants likely do not
   influence the probability of Rickettsia infection.},

Title = {EFFECT OF UNDERLYING HYDROTHERMALLY ALTERED BEDROCK ON THE BENTHIC AND
   HYPORHEIC INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN CABRESTO CREEK, NEW MEXICO},
Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Red River watershed of Taos County, New Mexico, is underlaid in part
   by hydrothermally altered granitic bedrock, including stockwork veins of
   metal sulfide deposits. Erosion has exposed ``scars'' of this weathered,
   altered material along the watershed ridges above the mainstem Red
   River. Precipitation brings acid rock drainage (high sediment loads and
   toxic by-products of metal sulfide decomposition) into the Red River,
   negatively impacting the water quality, substrate, and aquatic community
   of the stream. A tributary to the Red River, Cabresto Creek, is also
   underlaid in part by hydrothermally altered granitic bedrock but has
   little erosion. I collected data on water quality, sediment, and the
   benthic and hyporheic invertebrate communities from 2005 to 2009 at
   sites along Cabresto Creek to assess the potential effect of the
   underlying geology in the absence of erosion. Statistically significant
   differences in both density and taxa richness existed among sites in
   both communities; however, values for density and taxa richness
   recovered to upstream levels at sites downstream of the zone of
   hydrothermal alteration in the hyporheic community, but only to a
   limited extent in the benthic community. Smaller sediment grain sizes
   and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in the hyporheic within the
   zone of hydrothermal alteration may have restricted recruitment to the
   benthic community. These effects continued downstream, possibly due to
   drift. The results suggest that the underlying geology might affect the
   benthic and hyporheic invertebrate communities in Cabresto Creek even in
   the absence of eroded hydrothermal scars in the watershed.},

Title = {RECENT COLONIZATION OF NESTING CANADA GEESE (BRANTA CANADENSIS) IN GLEN
   AND GRAND CANYONS},
Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) appear to be colonizing
   portions of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon and Grand Canyon, Arizona.
   We report the first appearance of nesting geese in this area with one
   record in the 1950s, followed several decades later by single-pair
   nesting records in 2001, 2012, 2013, and 2016, increasing to two pairs
   in 2018, five or six pairs in 2019, and at least two pairs in 2020. Our
   recent field observations (2018-2020) document that nesting geese are
   currently successfully raising broods in two geographically distinct
   areas separated by over 300 km along the river corridor in Grand Canyon:
   a 4-km area from river kilometer 80 to river kilometer 84 in eastern
   Grand Canyon, and a 54-km area from river kilometer 392 to river
   kilometer 446 in western Grand Canyon. The eastern nesting area is
   dominated by riparian habitat that has proliferated in a relatively
   stabilized shoreline since Glen Canyon Dam began regulating the river in
   1963. The western nesting area is within the fluctuating inflow of the
   river with Lake Mead, a geomorphologically distinct area where >20 years
   of drought-induced declining reservoir levels have exposed sediments
   deposited when Lake Mead was higher than at present (1950s-2001). Two
   factors likely contribute to the increased presence of nesting geese in
   Grand Canyon, including (1) expanding populations of nonmigratory,
   resident geese and the southward expansion of their historic breeding
   range and (2) the availability of nesting habitat along the Colorado
   River today that may not have existed historically.},

Abstract = {The Chihuahuan Desert swamps are a hotspot for imperiled organisms

   endemic to the desert and to the individual waterbodies where they

   account for the life history of the organisms, but also interactions
   between organisms including microbes. We documented the microbial
   assemblage associated with Tryonia metcalfi, a critically imperiled
   freshwater snail endemic to a cienega system in western Texas. We
   identified 14 bacterial families in our snail samples and determined a
   core assemblage of 19 bacterial taxa (4 of which represented novel
   lineages) that are likely dependent on the snail. Future conservation
   efforts involving T. metcalfi and its environment should therefore
   consider the microbial diversity associated with both the snail and the
   cienegas.},

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nutrient dynamics in dryland river floodplains remain poorly understood,
   particularly where ungulate herbivory results in significant dung
   deposition. I assessed organic matter and nitrogen (N) losses from elk
   (Cervus elaphus) dung deposited on the floodplain of the unregulated
   Yampa River in semiarid northwestern Colorado. Intact elk fecal pellets
   were placed on relatively high, vegetated floodplain surfaces in loose
   piles or enclosed in mesh bags and monitored for up to 847 days. No
   pellets were inundated by Yampa floodwaters. Modified exponential decay
   models indicated intact pellets lost 50\% of their initial ash-free dry
   matter (AFDM) and N content in 980 and 903 days, respectively, and 90\%
   in 2,224 and 1,820 days, respectively. Macroinvertebrates appeared to be
   unimportant in decomposition. Based on dung deposited in <= 19 permanent
   28-m(2) plots monitored from 1999 to 2006, elk added an average 13.7 g
   AFDM.m(-2) and 200 mg N.m(-2) to the floodplain each year. Mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) added an average of 2.85 g AFDM.m(-2) and 68.2 mg
   N.m(-2) each year. Fecal N deposited on the floodplain, but derived from
   foraging outside it, would add to the N in flood-deposited sediment
   hypothesized to explain the N buildup observed during succession on the
   Yampa floodplain. The roles of large herbivores and dung decay processes
   in N cycling and dynamics on this and other dryland floodplains warrant
   greater attention.},

Abstract = {Andromonoecy, a sexual system in which individuals have both bisexual
   and male flowers, is rare in angiosperms as a whole, but fairly common
   in Cleomaceae. We conducted greenhouse experiments on how fruit
   maturation and self- vs. cross-fertilization affect male flower
   production in Polanisia dodecandra (L.) DC. subsp. riograndensis. When
   we prevented fruit maturation, plants produced only bisexual flowers,
   but when we allowed fruit maturation, plants produced alternating zones
   of bisexual and male flowers. This is the first documentation of
   andromonoecy in P. dodecandra subsp. riograndensis. Our results support
   the resource limitation hypothesis for the origin and maintenance of
   andromonoecy, but not the alternative dichogamy and architectural
   effects hypotheses. Polanisia dodecandra subsp. riograndensis has a
   mixed mating system. Selfpollination did not result in slower
   transitions from bisexual to male flowers, but for the initial zone of
   bisexual flowers, selfed fruits weighed less than crossed fruits.
   Andromonoecy is likely widespread in North American cleomids, and we
   urge field botanists to be mindful of floral sex when observing and
   collecting.},

Abstract = {We rescued 22 Crocodylus moreletii adult individuals from an area
   designated to become a theme park in the Riviera Maya tourist corridor
   in Quintana Roo, Mexico. They were translocated between January and
   February 2018 to Rio Yalikin stream located in the wildlife sanctuary
   Area de Protecci6n de Flora y Fauna Yum Balam. Our goal was to evaluate
   the survival and dispersal of the translocated specimens, and to measure
   their possible impact on the local crocodile populations (C. moreletii,
   C. acutus, and possible hybrids) already established in the Yum Balam
   Protected Arca. We conducted diurnal and nocturnal field surveys from
   January to June 2019 to search for translocated crocodiles, and to
   estimate abundance, size class structure, and sex ratio of the
   population (local and translocated crocodiles). Ten of the translocated
   crocodiles (five females and five males) were tagged with very high
   frequency (VHF) radiotransmitters with global positioning system
   datalogger. After spending 36 h at a fixed-point location and utilizing
   a boat to track animals (2,748 km traveled and 254 h expended), we did
   not recapture any of the translocated crocodiles, and we failed to
   detect individuals with radiotransmitters. We detected, however, VHF
   signals from three individuals outside of Rio Yalikin area during an
   aerial survey. The spatial distribution of all crocodiles was aggregated
   with possible segregations as they moved away from the stream's delta.
   The estimated total abundance was 26 crocodiles with an encounter rate
   of 3.64 individuals/km. The population structure by size classes
   consisted of yearlings (1.14\%), juveniles (9.66\%), subadults
   (11.36\%), adults (13.64\%), and large adults (5.68\%). An important
   fraction of sightings (58.52\%) was assigned to the ``Eyes Only{''}
   category. Twenty-six crocodiles were captured (12 C. moreletii and 14 C.
   acutus). The observed sex ratio for both species was 1:1 during our
   study. Our results concerning the dynamics of the local population and
   the possible impacts of the introduced individuals provide relevant
   information to determine the best practices that wildlife managers
   should pursue to achieve sustainable management and conservation of
   crocodiles.},

Title = {ORIGINS AND DIVERSITY OF PERIPHERAL POPULATIONS OF RIO GRANDE SUCKER

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},

Pages = {25-34},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rio Grande sucker (Pantosteus plebeius) is continuously distributed in
   parts of its range, but occurs in geographically isolated populations at
   the periphery. We used 10 microsatellites and DNA sequence data from the
   mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to characterize genetic diversity and
   reconstruct evolutionary relationships of five peripheral populations in
   the southwestern United States. An isolated population in Rio Bonito
   (Pecos River drainage) is most closely related to a central Rio Grande
   population in Alamosa Creek, and part of the monophyletic Rio Grande
   lineage. Another disjunct population, Bluewater Creek in the western Rio
   Grande drainage, has a Mimbres lineage mtDNA haplotype that likely
   originated via interbasin transfer. Both peripheral populations are
   important for conservation of the species as a whole. Three other
   isolated populations are closely related to mainstem ``core{''}
   populations in the Mimbres and Gila rivers that colonized these
   intermittently connected tributaries. One peripheral population in Allie
   Canyon, Mimbres River, has persisted longer in isolation than Rocky
   Canyon or Trout Creek in the Gila system. In general, a process of range
   expansion during relatively cool and wet periods, followed by retreat to
   wetted refugia during warm and dry periods, leads to genetic
   differentiation of peripheral populations of Rio Grande sucker at local
   and across-basin scales.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of climatic habitat suitable for biomes of
   the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, under the contemporary climate
   (1961-1990) and projected to the decade centered on the year 2030. This
   was achieved through previous modeling of the climatic habitat using
   random forest of the program R and six different climatic model
   scenarios. By the year 2030, there will be a reduction in the area
   occupied by a climatic habitat suitable for temperate biomes: conifer
   forests (-100\% change relative to the area currently occupied), San
   Lucas pine-oak woodland (-100\%), and Madrean-Transvolcanic pine-oak
   woodland (-34\%). In contrast, climatic habitats suitable for dry biomes
   will expand and some will appear that do not currently exist in
   Tamaulipas, such as the Sinaloa-Guerrero thornscrub (+38\% of the state
   area occupied). In the area occupied by the Biosphere Reserve ``El
   Cielo,'' suitable climatic habitat will diminish for the Gulf Coast
   thornscrub (-100\%), tropical semievergreen forest (-100\%), and cloud
   forest (-99\%); however, suitable climatic habitat will increase inside
   that Reserve for the biomes chaparral (+1,703\%) and
   MadreanTransvolcanic pine-oak woodland (+33\%). In addition, habitat
   suitable for the dry deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (+22\% of
   the area of the Reserve, previously nonexistent). For the Biosphere
   Reserve ``Sierra de Tamaulipas,'' suitable climatic habitat will be lost
   mainly for the biomes chaparral (-92\%) and MadreanTransvolcanic
   pine-oak woodland (-89\%). However, habitat suitable to the dry
   deciduous forest of Sinaloa will appear (66\% of the area of the
   Reserve, which does not currently exist). Modification of the climatic
   habitat could imply serious challenges for the conservation and
   management of contemporary vegetation and may provide evidence that the
   in situ measures of conservation in place for these biome types in the
   state are insufficient, even within the Biosphere Reserves.},

Abstract = {An accumulation of Pleistocene owl pellets (strigilites) containing 30
   arvicoline rodent teeth was found at the Little Dell Dam fossil site
   outside of Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah, in 1992. The
   accumulation was recovered in a single block of matrix with partially
   exposed teeth. We used high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) to
   segment, digitally prepare, and describe teeth belonging to Allophaiomys
   pliocaenicus, Mictomys kansasensis, or Mictomys meltoni, and a
   previously recognized but unnamed morphotype of Phenacomys. Digital
   preparation revealed 10 associated upper or lower dentitions of those
   taxa. A reinterpretation of the age of the site (similar to 150 thousand
   years ago) using arvicoline rodent biochronology was made based on
   recent research at Cathedral Cave, Nevada. The new estimate is a much
   younger age for the Little Dell Dam fauna from Locality 2 than was
   previously reported.},

Title = {SYSTEMATIC LARVAL FISH SURVEYS AND ABIOTIC CORRELATES CHARACTERIZE
   EXTANT NATIVE FISH ASSEMBLAGE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE COLORADO
   RIVER, WESTERN GRAND CANYON, ARIZONA},

Abstract = {Systematic larval fish surveys increase the probability of detecting
   rare species and provide ecological insights for more common species
   that can be difficult to infer from surveys of older life-stages. To
   characterize the reproductive success of the extant fish assemblage in
   the western Grand Canyon portion of the Colorado River, we conducted
   systematic larval fish surveys in 2014 and 2015. The effort identified
   endangered razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) as initiating spawning
   in February with a continuation through July. We collected recently
   hatched protolarval fish throughout the study area including the most
   upstream sample sites, suggesting fish spawned throughout and upstream
   of the study area. Our collection of a protolarval endangered humpback
   chub (Gila cypha) supports the hypothesis that the population increased
   in range within the Grand Canyon from its dramatic 2001 contraction into
   the Little Colorado River and suggests localized spawning.
   Back-calculating hatching dates indicated humpback chub began hatching
   in late April and continued through mid-May. Native fishes numerically
   dominated larval fish collections (97.6 and 99.3\% for 2014 and 2015,
   respectively) and recruitment to the early juvenile life-stage was
   documented for all fish species captured except razorback sucker.
   Abundance, measured as catch per unit effort and frequency of
   occurrence, was different between years for each native species captured
   (n = 5). Interannual differences in abiotic factors (discharge, diel
   fluctuations in discharge, and water temperature) were significantly
   different for most months between years. A redundancy analysis,
   evaluating the relationship between abiotic environmental factors and
   catch rates, suggested both discharge and water temperature were
   associated with speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), bluehead sucker
   (Catostomus discobolus), and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus
   latipinnis), with a positive correlation to water temperature and a
   negative correlation to discharge. We were unable to identify
   associations between abiotic factors and the endangered fishes, which
   may have been due to the lack of variability in those species' catch
   rates. Improving our understanding of the relationship between
   reproductive success and abiotic factors would enhance management of the
   system to benefit native fishes.},

Abstract = {In August and October 1982-1988, we collected 880 mourning doves
   (Zenaida macroura) in southeastern New Mexico to determine amounts and
   kinds of food items ingested and to evaluate variation in feeding habits
   by sex, age, time of day, month, and year. Crop contents did not differ
   significantly by sex, but did differ significantly by age, month, and
   year. Differences by age group may reflect differences in foraging
   ability between subadults and adults. Differences by month probably
   reflect differences in availability of food items. Differences by year
   may be related to differences in annual precipitation, although no such
   relationship was observed in this study. Crop contents also differed
   significantly by time of day collected, but this likely reflects
   activity patterns of birds and not true differences in diet.},

Title = {EFFECTS OF CATTLE DISTURBANCE ON CHANGE IN POPULATION DENSITIES AND

Abstract = {In 1979, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Wright
   fishhook cactus (Sclerocactus wrightiae L.D. Benson) as endangered.
   Since that time, the potential impacts associated with cattle grazing
   have been a central focus of land management policies and debate. To
   better understand and monitor the impacts of cattle disturbance on
   Wright fishhook cactus population trends, the Bureau of Land Management
   established 30 macroplots (25 x 50 m). These macroplots were placed in
   multiple grazing allotments and located in areas representing different
   levels of disturbance (high, moderate, and low). Our objective was to
   evaluate the effects of cattle soil disturbance on change in population
   densities (individuals/macroplot), flowering plant frequency (\%), and
   flowering density (number of reproductive structures/macroplot) of
   Wright fishhook cactus across 7 years (2011-2017). Our analysis suggests
   that decreased flowering frequency (\%) is significantly associated with
   high cattle disturbance. However, we observed no significant association
   between level of disturbance and flower density or change in population
   density. These results indicate that soil disturbance by cattle may not
   be significantly impacting Wright fishhook cactus populations or
   contributing to their range-wide population decline.},

Abstract = {Spiders of the genus Anelosimus are social, subsocial, and solitary. A
   recent report described one of these species as tolerant to foreign
   arthropods in their webs. In this study we report the arthropod
   diversity found in 90 nests of Anelosimus cf. analyticus from the
   southern Sonoran Desert. We sampled from March 2015 to November 2016 and
   during January 2017. We separated the nests into small, medium, and
   large, counting spiders and insects. We also counted females, males, and
   juveniles of each spider species. We analyzed diversity with and without
   A. cf. analyticus with the Shannon-Weaver (H') diversity index and used
   the equitability index (E-Pielou) to analyze the similarity of richness
   between months. We found 48 species inhabiting the nests, and in 67
   nests A. cf. analyticus was present along with other species of spiders
   and insects. Ovisacs and molts of the spider were also frequent. The
   ensemble of foreign species did not show a consistent pattern of
   similarity among months, but small and medium sizes showed a low value
   of similarity. From these results, we consider A. cf. analyticus a
   subsocial species whose small and medium nests had great activity and
   species turnover during the months sampled, which did not allow groups
   of foreign species to establish for more than two consecutive months.},

Abstract = {In the late 1990s, a 63\% decline of the mountain plover (Charadrius
   montanus) population warranted that effective monitoring be considered;
   since this decline, the Bureau of Land Management distinguished the
   mountain plover as a sensitive species. We conducted triennial
   single-observer transect surveys of mountain plovers in an effort to
   monitor their local population and further base land management
   decisions accordingly. Our results after four survey years indicate a
   stable occupancy of mountain plovers in South Park, Colorado, with an
   occupancy probability of 0.152. We recommend continued monitoring of
   mountain plover to constructively determine its status over time in its
   inevitably changing habitat.},

Abstract = {Hericium erinaceus, known as lion's mane, is one of the most important
   cultivated mushrooms worldwide. It grows wild through European and North
   American countries; meanwhile, in Asia it is mostly artificially
   cultivated. Several studies revealed the difficulty of its taxonomic
   identification and the influence of environmental conditions over its
   morphological characters. The present study aimed to evaluate the
   morphological and genetic variability of wild specimens of H. erinaceus
   collected from seven different sites in the temperate forests of the
   Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango, Mexico. The H. erinaceus isolates
   showed important morphological differences between the different
   specimens, mainly in the length of the basidioma, in some cases
   presenting as twice the size (55 cm) as that previously reported for the
   species. Unlike the morphological results, the genetic analysis showed
   homogeneity among the samples. Despite the obvious differences in
   morphological studies, the genetic study did not indicate a significant
   difference between the analyzed individuals. However, current results
   provide new information for the morphological characterization of
   specimens for northern Mexico, and the first record of seven new
   internal transcribed spacer sequences and geographic distribution data
   for this species in northern Mexico.},

Abstract = {Increasing urbanization over the last century has resulted in a greater
   abundance of invasive species. Invasive feral pigeons (Columba livia)
   damage critical urban infrastructure and pose risks to human health.
   Universities, including Texas Tech University (TTU), located in Lubbock,
   Texas, have difficulty decreasing adverse effects caused by pigeons.
   Assessing reliable estimates of population demographics is an important
   first step to understanding and managing damaging pigeon populations.
   Our goal was to estimate pigeon abundances at TTU and understand the
   underlying mechanisms that facilitated pigeon persistence on campus. We
   surveyed 23 independent locations from March to April 2017 to estimate
   pigeon abundance across the entire campus. Separately, we also examined
   pigeon densities on two campus buildings from March to December 2017 to
   assess and quantify variation in pigeon detection probabilities and
   abundance both during the diurnal period and among calendar seasons. Our
   estimates suggested campus abundance was comparable to other urban areas
   (1,584.4 pigeons/km(2), SE= 43.58, 95\% CI= +/- 1,969). Our results
   indicated hot spots (i.e., high pigeon abundances) existed on campus;
   for example, we estimated similar to 2,819 pigeons (SE = 76, 95\% CI=
   +/- 138) on a single building on campus during our surveys. Enumeration
   of pigeon abundance on two campus buildings (mean = 326, SE= 16, 95\%
   CI= +/- 11) indicated abundance was greatest in the fall and during the
   morning hours, and peak abundance occurred shortly after 0700 h and
   declined during the day. Our results suggested pigeons were abundant on
   campus due to structure and composition of buildings that facilitated
   nesting and loafing spots that likely maximized efficiency and
   effectiveness of thermal regulation as well as direct access to water
   during the study period. In general, pigeons clustered on two buildings
   on campus and our findings suggested success of population-control
   measures may be maximized if they are implemented around these
   buildings.},

   SPECIES OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS IN KANSAS},
Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Distributions of species are frequently treated as responding to current
   environmental conditions across areas that have been accessible to them.
   Although that paradigm has been quite successful in describing
   distributional areas, the effects of land use history have been
   neglected in most studies to date. In this study, we analyzed effects of
   historical land use (i.e., 1850s to present) on distributions of four
   reptile and amphibian species in eastern Kansas. We fit typical species
   distribution models using a broad diversity of descriptors of landscape
   and environmental conditions, and detailed model selection exercises in
   all cases identified a combination of current land use and topographic
   features as the best defining dimensions for species' distributions.
   However, within the areas identified as suitable in these modeling
   exercises, known occurrences of each species were concentrated in areas
   that had been forested in the 1850s, and that remain forested. That is,
   although current land use was crucial, land use history was an important
   modifier, such that distributional ecology must look to more than just
   current environmental conditions in efforts to characterize species'
   geographic distributions comprehensively.},

Abstract = {Extensive efforts to reduce the population of invasive channel catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus) in the San Juan River, USA, have increased the
   relative abundance of juveniles, with little understanding about
   potential trophic interactions between these juveniles and native
   fishes. Gut contents of juvenile (<250 mm total length) and adult (>=
   300 mm) channel catfish in the San Juan River were collected in the
   summer and fall of 2018 and 2019 to quantify ontogenetic change in diet.
   Juveniles primarily consumed aquatic insects and terrestrial plants,
   whereas adults primarily consumed fewer aquatic insects and
   significantly more plants and fish. Logistic regression confirmed these
   diet shifts as a function of total length and suggest the nature of
   interactions between channel catfish and native fishes can change with
   life stage: from potential competitor for aquatic invertebrates, to
   competitor and predator.},

Title = {FLAT-TAILED HORNED LIZARDS-20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AT THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE

Abstract = {Flat-tailed horned lizards (Phrynosoma mcallii) exist in one of the
   hottest, driest deserts of North America. Much of this lizard's habitat
   has been reduced and fragmented because of conversion from aeolian sand
   flats to agriculture, golf courses, housing, industrial-scale solar, and
   off-road vehicle recreation, as well as the construction of multiple
   highways, railroads, and aqueducts. To inform management actions aimed
   at sustaining populations in these habitat fragments it is critical to
   monitor the lizards' population fluctuations within a context of changes
   to the quality and quantity of their habitat and available resources.
   Here we describe fluctuations and relationships to habitat variables for
   a population of flat-tailed horned lizards at the northwesternmost edge
   of their range. Over 20 years of surveys, the lizards' population did
   not correlate with rainfall amounts as would be expected in such an arid
   environment. Rather, the lizards showed a negative correlation with the
   density of an invasive nonnative plant, Sahara mustard (Brassica
   tournefortii). In years with high rainfall the mustard formed dense
   stands, inhibiting native annual plants, and creating a negative trophic
   cascade that included the lizards' primary food, harvester ants.
   However, in moderate- and low-rainfall years, when the mustard is absent
   or at low densities, flat-tailed horned lizard populations rebound. The
   result is that the last remaining Coachella Valley population of
   flat-tailed horned lizards continues to persist.},

Abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are aesthetically and
   economically important to landowners in Texas. Winter diets are heavily
   dependent upon browse species because of a decrease in herbaceous
   production during periodic winter droughts. Our objective was to
   determine the influence of winter progression on nitrogen and fiber
   concentration as well as in vitro organic matter disappearance (using
   white-tailed deer rumen inoculum) of six browse species of moderate to
   high dietary importance to whitetailed deer in north-central Texas. We
   also measured protein-precipitable phenolic concentrations because of
   their potential influence on digestion kinetics. We collected leaf and
   stem tips during prefrost, midwinter, and late-winter periods from four
   properties in the Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas over 2 years.
   Browse nutritive value differed between years and there was an
   interaction between species and period for all nutritive values.
   Nitrogen and in vitro true digestibility decreased with winter
   progression, as browse nutritional value decreased rapidly after the
   first freeze when most species shed leaves. Protein-precipitable
   phenolics demonstrated species-by-year and species-by-period
   interactions. The decrease in nitrogen and increase of fibrous
   constituents, in combination with the presence of biologically active
   tannins, considerably reduced digestibility during late winter. These
   results indicate a need for vegetational species diversity to meet
   whitetailed deer nutritional requirements during the fall and winter.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Sex ratio is an important parameter influencing the demography of
   wildlife species. Sex ratios are categorized as primary (sex at
   fertilization), secondary (sex at birth through immaturity), tertiary
   (sex at adulthood), and quaternary (sex at post-reproductive age).
   Herein, we examined the secondary(1) (hatchling), secondary(2) (juvenile
   or subadult), and tertiary (adult) sex ratios of white-winged doves
   (Zenaida asiatica). Also, because white-winged doves typically hatch two
   eggs, we also evaluated the secondary sex ratio of co-occurring
   nestlings. Interestingly, secondary and juvenile sex ratios were
   significantly male biased, whereas tertiary sex ratios were not biased.
   Additionally, the ratio of same-sex nestlings was also male biased. The
   lack of bias at the tertiary level supports Fisher's principle that
   differential selection for sex ratios of 1:1 exist and lead to more
   stable populations. Therefore, we conclude that there is some selection
   mechanism present in this species that selects against males reaching
   adult status given our findings at the secondary and juvenile sex ratio
   levels.},

Abstract = {Springs are essential sources of water for humans and wildlife in the
   Sonoran Desert and, despite their isolation, they often support diverse
   aquatic communities. However, flows in these systems are declining due
   to groundwater pumping and increasing temperatures and aridity. In the
   western Sonoran Desert, two spring-fed systems represent the vast
   majority of perennial surface water along the U.S.-Mexico border:
   Quitobaquito, an upland hillslope spring, and a nearby spring-fed reach
   of the Rio Sonoyta. In this study, we quantified how aquatic
   invertebrate species richness and community composition varied by
   habitat type and season at these two sites. We found that habitat was a
   significant driver of composition for both sites, but seasonal variation
   was only influential for species richness in the Rio Sonoyta. Continued
   declines in flow will likely lead to significant losses of aquatic

Title = {PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE EXOSKELETAL MICROBIOTA OF ARMADILLIDIUM
   VULGARE (THE COMMON PILL},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to preliminarily examine the breadth of
   microbial diversity on the pill bug (Armadillidium vulgare) exoskeleton.
   To address this question, we collected pill bugs at four time points
   (approximately 3 months apart) and analyzed their external microbiotas.
   Preliminary results suggest that each time point contained a unique
   microbiome, suggesting a rapid turnover of the exoskeletal microbiota.
   In total, we recovered 15 unique isolates, which we resolved into three
   phyla and nine families. There were only three instances in which we
   recovered a single isolate from multiple time points, and we recovered
   only a single isolate from all four time points. Among the phyla
   identified, sequence divergence ranged from a minimum of 6.2\% (among
   isolates recognized within the Actinobacteria) to a maximum of similar
   to 34\% (between isolates recognized within the Actinobacteria vs.
   b-proteobacteria). Overall, the results of this study suggest that in
   order to gain a complete understanding of the exoskeletal microbiota of
   pill bugs, and perhaps other arthropods, researchers must examine a
   temporal scale.},

Title = {USE OF REGIONAL BREEDING BIRD SURVEYS TO ESTIMATE BIRD POPULATIONS IN

Journal = {SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We used data collected during surveys of seven North American Breeding
   Bird Survey routes in eastern Texas to estimate avian populations within
   Big Thicket National Preserve. On only 61 of the 350 count locations
   located along these routes did observers monitor birds within the
   boundaries of this preserve. On selected routes, we recorded initial
   bird detections during the 3-min bird count within 1-min time intervals
   and within two distance classes (<= 50 or >50 m). We used these data,
   combined with data collected using standard Breeding Bird Survey
   protocols during 2009-2016, to estimate detection probabilities and
   effective detection radii for commonly detected species. For species
   often detected in flocks, we estimated these parameters for group
   detections. From these parameters, we estimated regional densities for
   60 species. Because habitat within Big Thicket National Preserve
   differed from habitat along surveyed routes, for each species we
   adjusted the projected population estimate to account for the
   relationship between density of detected birds and habitat descriptors
   from the National Land Cover database. On the basis of our estimates of
   regional density of each species, and accounting for differences in
   habitat availability, we estimated that commonly detected avian species
   comprises a population of 192,201 breeding birds (95\% confidence
   interval = 144,269-340,790) within Big Thicket National Preserve.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian collared-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) has expanded its
   range into South Texas, bringing it into contact with native columbid
   species. We studied urban columbid breeding ecology at three study
   sites, representing five South Texas towns, in 2006 and 2007. Columbids
   began nesting in April and peaked in late spring, followed by a
   secondary nesting peak. A positive relationship occurred between nesting
   vegetation type and mean nest density of each columbid species but was
   inconsistent within and among study sites. Eurasian collared-doves also
   utilized human-constructed structures for nesting sites. Columbids were
   nonselective in choosing nest placement within trees except for Eurasian
   collared-doves nesting in Rio Grande ash (Fraxinus berlanderiana).
   White-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) and Eurasian collared-doves tended
   to nest higher in trees than mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) or Inca
   doves (Columbina inca) where all four species co-occurred. Eurasian
   collared-dove, Inca dove, mourning dove, and white-winged dove
   productivity was 1.3 6 0.1 (SE) fledged young/nest, 1.3 6 0.2, 0.9 6
   0.1, and 1.1 6 <0.1, respectively. Overall, urban nesting columbids used
   a generalist habitat and nest site association strategy, which negated
   interspecific competition for available nest sites. We provide some of
   the first information on nesting ecology and productivity of the
   Eurasian collared-dove associated with native columbid species within
   North America.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Dispersal distance of bobcats (Lynx rufus) can be affected by many
   factors: age and sex, bobcat density, prey abundance, and landscape
   permeability. Female offspring typically remain near their natal range,
   whereas males travel farther distances. Studies report dispersal
   distances between 10 and 85 km, with distances >= 80 km being rare. We
   report dispersal distances of two male bobcats in the Southern High
   Plains of Texas, and one male bobcat from the Rio Grande Plains of South
   Texas. The two male bobcats of Southern High Plains traveled 63 and 133
   km and the male bobcat of Rio Grande Plains traveled 100 km. Severe
   droughts occurred in both regions during dispersal, which may have
   influenced distance traveled. In all cases, it is likely that nearby
   available territories were occupied by older resident bobcats, thus
   eliciting the need for longer-distanced dispersal to secure a permanent
   home range.},

Abstract = {Gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are considered a widespread and
   common species in the southwestern United States, although little is
   known about their spatial ecology that can inform rabies management
   strategies. We used data acquired from very high frequency and global
   positioning system satellite collars on gray foxes in the White
   Mountains and Pinaleno Mountains of Arizona to assess habitat use,
   movement patterns, and home range requirements. We present preliminary
   results from adult gray foxes (n = 3) from a larger study aimed at
   understanding gray fox space use for zoonotic disease management in the
   state. Average home range size was 3.78 - 2.74 km(-2) (SD) and gray
   foxes used ponderosa pine forests across both study sites, with
   individuals also selecting for this vegetation community at the home
   range scale.},

   DIVERSITY AND POPULATION DENSITY},

Abstract = {Buffelgrass ( Cenchrus ciliaris, syn. Pennisetum ciliare) is exotic to
   the Sonoran Desert and has caused drastic changes in this ecosystem.
   Yet, little research has documented the impact of buffelgrass on
   wildlife in the region, including small mammals. The objective of this
   study was to estimate abundance of native nocturnal rodents and
   characterize habitat structure in an area with native vegetation and
   buffelgrass prairies to assess the effect of this exotic grass on the
   diversity and population density of this community in the Sonoran
   Desert, located in the municipality of La Colorada, in central Sonora,
   Mexico. We trapped nocturnal rodents in a buffelgrass prairie site and
   in a site with native vegetation (with two trapping plots at each site),
   before and during the summer rainy season, and observed the differences
   in species composition between sites. We used capture-mark-recapture and
   distance sampling models to estimate population density of the two most
   common species, Dipodomys merriami and Chaetodipus penicillatus. Despite
   differences in habitat structural diversity between buffelgrass prairies
   and native vegetation, our results suggest that buffelgrass does not
   seem to affect dominance or population density of these two heteromyids,
   whereas evenness and species richness showed some differences between
   buffelgrass prairies and native vegetation sites.},

Title = {COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LABORATORY-DERIVED THERMAL MAXIMA OF GILA
   TROUT (ONCORHYNCHUS GILAE) WITH CURRENT STREAM TEMPERATURES},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) represent an iconic species of the
   American Southwest. The salmonid has survived extensive logging,
   livestock grazing, and mining, and is currently threatened by climate
   change, wildfire, and extended drought. Long-term conservation and
   recovery of the species and its unique lineages rely on stocking and
   translocation into historically inhabited streams. Thus, the fish's
   thermal tolerance is essential in determining suitable habitat and
   potential vulnerability to a warming climate. We compared a
   laboratory-derived temperature metric, critical thermal maximum (CTMax),
   in hatchery-reared Gila trout from three lineages (Main Diamond, South
   Diamond, and Whiskey Creek) to determine if CTMax differed among the
   lineages. The average initial (28.9(o)C, SD = 0.81(o)C) and final
   (29.2(o)C, SD = 0.74(o)C) temperature at loss of righting responses did
   not differ across the lineages. We compared the CTMax values with stream
   temperatures across three drainages representative of extant Gila trout
   populations from spring 2015 to fall 2018. The East Fork Gila River
   drainage was represented by more extreme stream temperatures. The
   maximum daily maximum temperature (i.e., single highest temperature)
   varied from 24.1 to 33.4(o)C, exceeding CTMax in four of the five
   streams. The maximum daily temperature varied from 12.1 to 28.6(o)C, and
   the mean weekly maximum temperature varied from 19.9 to 31.1(o)C. Mean
   weekly maximum temperature in Lower Diamond Creek exceeded CTMax on 11
   occasions. Stream temperatures were cooler within the Middle and the
   West Fork Gila River drainages and did not exceed CTMax. Intermittency
   loggers within the East Fork Gila River drainage, which supports Main
   Diamond and South Diamond lineages of Gila trout, recorded over 300 days
   of intermittency during a drought. Continued long-term monitoring of
   stream temperature and comparison with CTMax of Gila trout could assist
   with decisions of which streams in the Gila Drainage are suitable for
   Gila trout recovery, stocking, and translocation.},

Title = {A decision tool to identify population management strategies for common
   ravens and other avian predators},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {556-574},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Some avian species have developed the capacity to leverage resource
   subsidies associated with human manipulated landscapes to increase
   population densities in habitats with naturally low carrying capacities.
   Elevated corvid densities and new territory establishment have led to an
   unsustainable increase in depredation pressure on sympatric native
   wildlife prey populations as well as in crop damage. Yet, subsidized
   predator removal programs aimed at reducing densities are likely most
   effective longer-term when conducted in tandem with subsidy control,
   habitat management, and robust assessment monitoring programs. We
   developed decision support software that leverages stage structured
   Lefkovitch population matrices to compare and identify treatment
   strategies that reduce subsidized avian predator densities most
   efficiently, in terms of limiting both cost and take levels. The
   StallPOPd (Version 4; available at https://doi.org/10.7298/sk2e-0c38.4)
   software enables managers to enter the area of their management stratum
   and the demographic properties (vital rates) of target bird
   population(s) of interest to evaluate strategies to decrease or curtail
   further population growth. Strategies explicitly include the reduction
   in fertility (i.e., eggs hatched) and/or the culling of hatchlings,
   non-breeders and/or breeders, but implicitly comprise reduction in
   survival or reproduction through subsidy denial. We illustrate the
   utilities of the software with examples using common ravens (Corvus
   corax; ravens) in the Mojave Desert of California, USA. Unfortunately,
   the survival and reproduction effects of each unit of a particular
   subsidy in that system have remained elusive, though this is the
   priority of current research. Because the software leverages a life
   history representation that is known to characterize hundreds of
   wildlife species in addition to ravens, the work expands the suite of
   tools available to wildlife managers and agricultural industry
   specialists to abate bird damage and impacts on sensitive wildlife in
   habitats with persistent human subsidies.},

Abstract = {Scientists in and beyond academia face considerable challenges to
   effectively sharing science, including lack of time and training,
   systemic disincentives, and the complexity of the modern media/attention
   landscape. Considering these constraints, 3 achievable shifts in mindset

   Here, we provide evidence-based and experientially informed advice on
   how to center shared values, articulate science communication goals, and
   leverage the power of stories to advance our communication goals in
   connection with the values we share with our stakeholders. In addition
   to a discussion of relevant, foundational principles in science
   communication, we provide actionable recommendations and tools
   scientists can immediately use to articulate their values, identify
   shared values between stakeholders, set science communication goals, and
   use storytelling as a means of building and reinforcing relationships
   around shared values, thereby working productively to achieve those
   goals.},

Title = {Repellent surface applications for pest birds},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Common pest birds in the United States include the non-native European
   starling (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and the
   pigeon (Columba livia domestica), as well as native birds including
   Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and gull species (Laridae). Large
   concentrations of pest birds can create human health hazards and
   monetary losses due to consumption of crops, depredation, and fecal
   contamination and accumulation. Fecal contamination hazards include the
   potential spread of zoonotic diseases including antimicrobial-resistant
   zoonoses and human injury due to the accumulation of fecal material on
   walking surfaces. Additionally, fecal accumulation causes structural and
   aesthetic damage due to the accelerated deterioration of building
   materials and increased maintenance costs. Methods to alleviate hazards
   and damages from aggregations of pest birds are needed. In a series of 3
   experiments conducted in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, between 2016 and
   2018, we evaluated 3 surface-application repellent formulations for the
   reduction of fecal accumulations due to European starlings: Airepel (R)
   HC with castor oil, an anthraquinone-based repellent; Airepel HC with
   castor oil without anthraquinone; and MS2, a novel inert formulation
   with a tacky, oily texture. We compared each formulation directly to an
   untreated control. All 3 formulations reduced fecal accumulations
   beneath treated aluminum perches as compared to fecal accumulations
   beneath untreated aluminum perches. Interestingly, both formulations
   that contained no anthraquinone worked equally well or better than
   Airepel HC with castor oil, the anthraquinone-based formulation. The
   benefits of an exclusively inert formulation include less risk to
   applicators and non-target species. Comprehensive experimental field
   testing of these surface-application repellent formulations is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {Collisions between wildlife and aircraft are a major safety concern for
   international aviation. In the Americas, vultures (Cathartidae) are
   considered to be one of the most hazardous bird species to airport
   operations. In this study, we evaluated the use of translocations as a
   management technique to reduce vulture abundance near the Manaus
   International Airport (MAO), Manaus, Brazil. The MAO is one of the
   busiest and most strategically important airports in South America,
   often referred to as the gateway to the Brazilian Amazon. We captured,
   wing-tagged, and translocated 98 vultures between August and October
   2013 and between January and April 2014. The wing-tags were colored
   plastic tags specifically developed to tag vultures to enhance
   identification in flight and not alter bird behavior. The tagged
   vultures were translocated different distances (100, 150, and 200 km)
   from MAO. Only 25.5\% of translocated vultures retumed to the airport.
   However, the relative abundance of vultures did not differ between
   monitoring periods before and after captures and translocations. Our
   results demonstrated that the translocations failed to decrease MAO
   vulture abundance. We recommend habitat modifications associated with
   nonlethal (dispersion by bird repellents) and lethal (kill some
   individuals reinforcing dispersion) strategies to reduce vulture bird
   strike risks.},

Title = {Reduced fecundity in free-ranging Norway rats after baiting with a
   liquid fertility control bait},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-123},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) cause extensive crop loss,
   infrastructure damage, and are vectors for zoonotic diseases. Due to
   reduced efficacy, environmental and animal welfare concerns related to
   traditional pest management tools, such as rodenticides, it is
   imperative to find new methods for controlling commensal rodents.
   Fertility control is emerging as a safe, humane, and effective method of
   long-term population management. Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) and
   triptolide are 2 compounds that are known to target and inhibit ovarian
   function. Furthermore, triptolide debilitates spermatogenesis and sperm
   motility. We prepared liquid bait containing no active ingredients
   (control) or containing VCD (0.098\%) and triptolide (0.0012\%,
   treatment) and offered ad libitum for 56 days to male and female Norway
   rats placed in open, indoor arenas and allowed to breed for 4 rounds (a
   total of 138 days). The first 3 breeding rounds of treatment-matched
   matings produced fewer pups in the treatment rats compared to control
   rats (P < 0.001). In the fourth breeding round, control rats were
   cross-bred with treatment rats. There were no differences in pup numbers
   between these cross-breeding groups, but the litter sizes in both groups
   were smaller than those seen in the control female/control male matings.
   In addition to reduced pup numbers, treatment males and females
   exhibited decreased reproductive organ weights without any effect on
   adrenal, kidney, spleen, and liver weights compared to control rats. Use
   of a liquid contraceptive bait containing VCD and triptolide may be a
   suitable alternative to the traditional pest management tools used to
   control wild rat pest populations.},

Title = {Influence of anthropogenic subsidies on movements of common ravens},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {318-330},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic subsidies can benefit populations of generalist predators
   such as common ravens (ravens; Corvus corax), which in turn may depress
   populations of many types of species at lower-trophic levels, including
   desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) or greater sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). Management of subsidized ravens often has
   targeted local breeding populations that are presumed to affect species
   of concern and ignored ``urban{''} populations of ravens. However,
   little is known about how ravens move, especially in response to the
   presence of anthropogenic subsidies. Therefore, subsidized ravens from
   distant populations that are not managed may influence local prey. To
   better understand this issue, we deployed global positioning system -
   global system for mobile communications transmitters to track movements
   of 19 ravens from September to December 2020 relative to 2 land cover
   types that provide subsidies: developed areas and cultivated crops. On
   average, ravens moved 41.5 km (+/- 30.5) per day, although daily
   movement distances ranged from 0.13-206.1 km. Raven movement among cover
   types during the non-breeding season varied widely, with 100\% of
   individuals each using land cover types that provide subsidy and other
   types at least once in the season. On 100\% of days ravens used areas
   that did not provide subsidy, on 86.7\% of days they used developed
   areas, and on 20.5\% of days they used cultivated crops. Although on
   some days a raven would stay exclusively in areas that did not provide
   subsidy, there were no days in which a single raven ever stayed
   exclusively in developed or cultivated crops. Ravens moved shorter
   distances on days when they used subsidies more frequently. Further,
   time spent in developed areas and cultivated crops increased when ravens
   roosted closer to them, although this effect was greater for developed
   areas than for cultivated crops. Individual ravens were not associated
   exclusively with either of the subsidy-providing landscapes we
   considered, but instead all birds used both subsidized and other
   landscapes. Our research suggests that management of ravens during the
   non-breeding season and possibly during the breeding season, intended to
   reduce risk of predation on desert tortoises, will be most effective if
   conducted on a broad scale because of distances the birds travel and the
   lack of separation between putative ``urban{''} and ``natural{''}
   populations of ravens.},

Title = {Visual marking of ground nests might attract corvids},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {455-464},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {For ground-nesting birds such as waterfowl, estimating nest survival is
   a crucial step in assessing population dynamics, and marking nests
   facilitates continuous monitoring. A conventional method for marking
   ground nests is to use an inconspicuous rod at the nest bowl and a
   wooden lathe 10 m away. Nests are visually marked to allow for greater
   efficiency when revisiting nests and to facilitate subsequent nest
   searching sessions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that common ravens
   (Corvus corax) and American crows (C. brachyrhynchos) might learn to
   recognize these nest markers, resulting in artificially inflated rates
   of nest predation. In 2017 in central Alberta, Canada, we compared fates
   of nests marked with the conventional lathe-rod combination versus only
   a rod. We also tested the prevalence of corvid predation of marked nests
   in areas with and without high observations of corvid activity, using
   data from a study of dabbling duck (Anas spp.) nest survival. Our
   results suggest that marking nests with a lathe can increase predation
   by corvids and that nests marked with a rod only were more likely to
   hatch. Evaluation and use of alternate nest-marking methods would be
   beneficial for future studies of ground-nesting birds in areas where
   corvids are common. Our work highlights the importance of re-evaluating
   the efficacy of well-established field methods.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) are on the increase due to shrinking
   space that results in increased competition for land, water, and other
   natural resources between humans and wildlife. Investigating the
   occurrence of HWCs is important in that the results can be used to
   formulate better management policies and strategies. In this paper, we
   describe the nature of HWCs emerging between humans and the Nile
   crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and between humans and the African
   hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; hippo) on Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe.
   Lake Kariba is the second largest manmade lake by volume in the world.
   Conflicts involving humans and these species are readily noticeable and
   played out around water bodies, which are sources of daily human
   sustenance and important habitats for aquatic wildlife. We used a
   mixed-methods approach to gather data on these conflicts, including
   questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions, and
   participant observation. The research participants involved national
   parks officials, fishing camp residents, and HWC victims. Our research
   confirmed that crocodiles and hippos have negatively affected humans
   through deaths, injuries, instilling fear, and destruction of sources of
   livelihood for fishermen such as fishing nets and boats. In retaliation,
   humans have implemented lethal methods to remove problem animals. The
   results of this research can inform the conservation community about the
   severity of the conflicts, which have been exacerbated by current
   economic hardships, to better inform conservation policies.},

Title = {Thinking like a raven: restoring integrity, stability, and beauty to

Abstract = {Common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens) are generalist predators that pose
   a threat to several rare wildlife species in the western United States.
   Recent increases in raven populations, which are fueled by increased
   human subsidies-notably food, water, and nest sites-are concerning to
   those seeking to conserve rare species. Due to the challenges and
   inefficiencies of reducing or eliminating subsidies, managers
   increasingly rely on lethal removal of ravens. Over 125,000 ravens were
   killed by the U.S. Government from 1996 to 2019, and annual removals
   have increased 4-fold from the 1990s to mid-2010s. We contend that
   lethal removal of ravens, while capable of improving the reproduction of
   rare species, is at best a short-term and ethically untenable solution
   to a problem that will continue to grow until subsidies are meaningfully
   reduced or made inaccessible to ravens. In part because of ravens'
   abilities to track natural and anthropogenic resources across unfamiliar
   and expansive areas, the removal of subsidies can lead to sustained
   shifts in raven abundance, which can have long-lasting benefits for
   sensitive species. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, USA, for
   example, we documented extensive use of human subsidies during
   fall/winter, daily 1-way commutes regularly in excess of 50 km by
   territorial birds to such subsidies, and dispersals of >700 km by
   nonbreeders that exploited food and roost subsidies. We call for
   managers to embrace new approaches to subsidy reduction including:
   increased involvement of conservation social scientists; increased
   enforcement of local, state, and federal laws; and increased deployment
   of a diversity of new technologies to haze and aversively condition
   ravens. Tackling the hard job of reducing subsidies over the expansive
   area exploited by ravens is right because it will increase the
   integrity, stability, and beauty of western ecosystems.},

Title = {Efficacy of manipulating reproduction of common ravens to conserve
   sensitive prey species: three case studies},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Expansion of human enterprise across western North America has resulted
   in an increase in availability of anthropogenic resource subsidies for
   generalist species. This has led to increases in generalists' population
   numbers across landscapes that were previously less suitable for their
   current demographic rates. Of particular concern are growing populations
   of common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens), because predation by ravens is
   linked to population declines of sensitive species. Ecosystem managers
   seek management options for mitigating the adverse effects of raven
   predation where unsustainable predator-prey conflicts exist. We present
   3 case studies examining how manipulating reproductive success of ravens
   influences demographic rates of 2 sensitive prey species. Two case
   studies examine impacts of removing raven nests or oiling raven eggs on
   nest survival of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus;
   sage-grouse) within Wyoming and the Great Basin of California and
   Nevada, USA, respectively. The third case study uses Mojave desert
   tortoise (Gopherus agassizii; tortoise) decoys to examine effects of
   oiling raven eggs on depredation rates of juvenile tortoises in the
   Mojave Desert in California. Initial trial years from all 3 case studies
   were consistent in finding improved vital rates associated with the
   application of strategies for reducing reproductive success of ravens.
   Specifically, removal of raven nests resulted in increased nest survival
   of sage-grouse within treatment areas where predation by ravens was the
   primary cause of nest failure. In addition, nest survival of sage-grouse
   and survival of juvenile tortoise decoys was higher following a
   treatment of oiling the eggs of ravens in their nests at 2 sites within
   the Great Basin and 4 tortoise conservation areas in the Mojave Desert
   in California. Along with specialized technologies that can make
   techniques such as egg-oiling more feasible, these findings support
   these management practices as important tools for managing ravens,
   especially in areas where breeding ravens have negative impacts on
   sensitive prey species.},

Title = {Household perceptions and patterns of crop loss by wild pigs in north
   India},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Loss to cultivated crops by wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is widespread and can
   jeopardize low-income farmers. In India, although there is lot of
   political interest in the problem, efforts to understand the patterns,
   correlates, and underlying reasons for wild pig conflict continue to be
   minimal. We quantified loss of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to wild pigs
   and assessed the spatial patterns of damage in a forest settlement of
   Van Gujjar (Haridwar, India), which is a dairy-based pastoralist
   community. We chose a 4-km(2) cultivated area comprising 400 farmlands
   (each measuring 0.8 ha and belonging to a family) and assessed crop
   damage by wild pigs through field surveys during the harvest season. We
   interviewed 159 respondents who manage 219 of the total 400 farmlands in
   the study area to compare actual crop loss with perceived losses. Wild
   pigs damaged 2.29 tonnes (2,290 kg) of wheat, which was about 2.6\% of
   the potential yield in the study area. A total of 39 farmlands (9.5\%),
   managed by 28 respondents, suffered losses during the survey period at
   an average loss of about 58.8 kg (SD +/- 89.5, range = 0.7-388 kg).
   During interviews, 81 respondents managing 155 farmlands (70.7\%)
   reported having suffered wild pig-related crop loss during the survey
   period. They also perceived losing about 23.4\% of the potential yield
   of wheat due to wild pigs. The perceived losses were much higher than
   actual losses. Actual losses measured through field surveys underscore
   the dichotomy between actual and perceived crop loss due to wild pigs.
   About 81\% of recorded wild pig-related damage to wheat occurred within
   200 m from the forest edge. The crop protection measures aimed at
   stopping wild pigs from entering the fields were mostly reactive.
   Although overall crop losses due to wild pigs seem low at the settlement
   level, for affected individual families, the losses were financially
   significant. Such recurrent crop losses can cause families to go into
   debt, trigger animosity toward conservation, and lead to retaliation
   measures, which may be indiscriminate and have the potential to affect
   other endangered mammals in conservation priority landscapes. Because
   crop losses by wild pigs are severe along the narrow band of fields
   along the edge of the forest, channeling monetary benefits through
   insurance-based compensation schemes can help assuage losses to farmers.
   Further, because crop damage by wild pigs is seasonal, experimenting
   with mobile fences that can be dismantled and packed away after use
   would be beneficial.},

Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurological disease impacting
   cervids. The disease can move swiftly through populations, making CWD
   management a priority for wildlife agencies across the United States.
   Stakeholder perceptions of CWD may shape behaviors that can negatively
   impact wildlife agencies. Thus, agencies need comprehensive assessments
   of stakeholder risk perceptions and enhanced understandings of how
   perceptions are formed to improve communications. Using a mail- and
   online-based questionnaire to collect data from September 2020 through
   January 2021, we surveyed 503 hunters throughout the state of Texas,
   USA, and 481 Texas landowners who owned property in CWD-affected
   counties to better understand risk perceptions, knowledge of CWD, and
   relationships between both elements. Furthermore, we compared risk
   perceptions across multiple host types and wildlife-related diseases. We
   documented frequent ``don't know{''} responses across perceptions and
   found a negative or no relationship between factual knowledge and risk
   perceptions, context dependent. As such, results suggest wildlife
   agencies should consider communications that emphasize actionable
   knowledge to better encourage preventive action.},

Title = {Bat mortality at Ontario wind farms quantified and compared using four
   candidate estimator equations},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Wind farm development is expanding globally. While wind energy is a
   low-cost option for new electricity supply, the impacts to wildlife
   populations, including bats (Chiroptera), are of ecological concern. To
   quantify these impacts, scientists have developed estimator equations to
   estimate bat mortality, which vary in assumptions related to correction
   factors. We compared the results of 4 estimators applied to
   post-construction monitoring data from Ontario, Canada, wind farms to
   evaluate the effects of field methods and correction factors on
   estimator consistency. To conduct our study, we obtained data from 21
   wind farms between 2011 and 2017 for a total of 26 wind farm survey
   years, because some wind farms supplied fatality monitoring data in >1
   year, to estimate mortality. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
   and Forestry estimator (OMNRF) tended to be highest, while the Huso,
   Schoenfeld-Erickson, and GenEst estimators produced similar results.
   Huso and Schoenfeld-Erickson estimates tended to fall within 95\%
   confidence intervals for GenEst, while OMNRF estimates tended to be
   higher than the upper confidence interval for GenEst. The results from
   the OMNRF estimator were consistent with the other candidates when
   carcass persistence times were >6.5 days but inconsistent when carcass
   persistence times were shorter. Our results demonstrated the degree to
   which mortality estimates can vary among estimators and highlight the
   need for a consistent estimator in comparative studies. We recommend
   GenEst for such studies, as this estimator can incorporate more inputs
   with flexibility to reflect site-specific field conditions and produces
   highly consistent results. Conversely, the OMNRF estimator produced
   consistently higher estimates than the other candidate estimators, and
   assumptions related to carcass persistence were regularly violated. We
   recommend that these limitations be acknowledged when interpreting
   results from this estimator and that its use be reconsidered when
   assumptions related to carcass persistence are not met.},

Title = {Holiday lights create light pollution and become ecological trap for

Abstract = {Ecological light pollution is now recognized as a significant source of
   ecosystem alteration. We documented that holiday lights are a seasonal
   source of light pollution that constitute an ecological trap for eastern
   fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). Texas A\&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK)
   wildlife students surveyed a 2-km walking transect 5 times per month
   each month for the relative abundance and diel behavior of eastern fox
   squirrels and feral cats (Felis catus) on the TAMUK campus during
   2018-2019. Eastern fox squirrels exhibited diurnal behaviors throughout
   the year but extended their foraging behavior nearly 4 hours after
   sunset with the addition of holiday lights. Feral cats and owls
   (Strigiformes) exhibited diurnal and nocturnal behaviors but conducted
   the majority of their hunting during crepuscular hours. We documented
   that monthly squirrel mortality increased 7-fold with the addition of
   holiday lights, possibly due to the extension of foraging time by
   squirrels. Although seasonal lighting is intended to be festive for
   humans, it can have negative consequences for eastern fox squirrels.
   Educating the public concerning the issue of light pollution on wildlife
   species is needed because the majority of the public appears unaware
   that bright lights can negatively alter wildlife behaviors. Reducing
   light intensity by either using less outdoor lights or perhaps using
   colored lights rather than clear white bulbs may lessen the negative
   effect on foraging behavior of squirrels.},

Title = {Human-carnivore conflicts in a recently established Pakistani national
   park},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {144-157},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Human-carnivore conflicts (HCCs) are increasing globally. These
   conflicts may encompass competition for food resources, crop and
   livestock depredations, and attacks on humans. Concerns over conflicts
   may result in retaliatory killings of carnivores and negative views of
   wildlife or landscape conservation. Yet, despite the economic and
   conservation implications of HCCs, data regarding the magnitude and
   severity of the conflicts may be lacking because many incidents are
   unreported. To better inform this issue, we compared HCC data for 2016
   to 2018 obtained from official records of the Punjab Wildlife and Parks
   Department for a newly established national park in the Punjab Region of
   Pakistan to data we obtained regarding HCCs based on a survey of 200
   households from 25 villages abutting the park. The households surveyed
   reported 250 incidents of livestock lost to leopards (Panthera pardus),
   jackals (Canis aureus), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) during the study
   period. Most of the losses (83\%) were attributed to leopards. In
   contrast, official data reported 42 animals lost for the villages
   studied, with most losses attributed to leopards. Thus, official agency
   records underreported depredation losses by >80\%. Because of HCC, 19\%
   of households supported eliminating leopards from the park, and 25\% of
   households supported fencing the park to prevent leopards from entering
   human settlements. However, 47\% of the households also supported
   increasing programs focused on improving herding practices and enhanced
   livestock infrastructure that might prevent attacks. Our results
   suggested new opportunities for wildlife officials to help residents
   mitigate HCCs while enhancing local support of carnivore conservation.},

Title = {A rapid assessment function to estimate common raven population
   densities: implications for targeted management},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Common raven (Corvus corax; raven) populations have increased over the
   past 5 decades within the western United States. Raven population
   increases have been largely attributed to growing resource subsidies
   from expansion of human enterprise. Concomitantly, managers are becoming
   increasingly concerned about elevated adverse effects on multiple
   sensitive prey species, damage to livestock and agriculture, and human
   safety. Managers could benefit from a rapid but reliable method to
   estimate raven densities across spatiotemporal scales to monitor raven
   populations more efficiently and inform targeted and adaptive management
   frameworks. However, obtaining estimates of raven density is data- and
   resource-intensive, which renders monitoring within an adaptive
   framework unrealistic. To address this need, we developed a rapid survey
   protocol for resource managers to estimate site-level density based on
   the average number of ravens per survey. Specifically, we first
   estimated raven densities at numerous field sites with robust distance
   sampling procedures and then used regression to investigate the
   relationship between those density estimates and the number of ravens
   per survey, which revealed a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.86). For
   management application, we provide access to R function software through
   a web-based interface to estimate density using number of ravens per
   survey, which we refer to as a Rapid Assessment Function (RAF). Then,
   using a simulation analysis of data from sites with abundant surveys and
   the RAF, we estimated raven density based on different numbers of
   surveys to help inform how many surveys are needed to achieve reliable
   estimates within this rapid assessment. While more robust procedures of
   distance sampling are the preferred methods for estimating raven
   densities from count surveys, the RAF tool presented herein provides a
   reliable approximation for informing management decisions when managers
   are faced with resource and small sample size constraints.},

Title = {Spatial modeling of common raven density and occurrence helps guide

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {331-349},

Abstract = {Common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens) are a behaviorally flexible nest
   predator of several avian species, including species of conservation
   concern. Movement patterns based on life history phases, particularly
   territoriality of breeding birds and transiency of nonbreeding birds,
   are thought to influence the frequency and efficacy of nest predation.
   As such, predicting where on the landscape territorial resident and
   non-territorial transient birds may be found in relation to the
   distribution of sensitive prey is of increasing importance to managers
   and conservationists. From 2007 to 2019, we conducted raven point count
   surveys between mid-March and mid-September across 43 different field
   sites representing typical sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems of the
   Great Basin, USA. The surveys conducted during 2007-2016 were used in
   previously published maps of raven occurrence and density. Here, we
   examined the relationship between occurrence and density of ravens using
   spatially explicit predictions from 2 previously published studies and
   differentiate areas occupied by higher concentrations of resident ravens
   as opposed to transients. Surveys conducted during 2017-2019 were
   subsequently used to evaluate the predicted trends from our analytical
   approach. Specifically, we used residuals from a generalized linear
   regression to establish the relationship between occurrence and density,
   which ultimately resulted in a spatially explicit categorical map that
   identifies areas of resident versus transient ravens. We evaluated
   mapped categories using independently collected observed raven group
   sizes from the 2017-2019 survey data, as well as an independent dataset
   of global positioning system locations of resident and transient
   individuals monitored during 2019-2020. We observed moderate agreement
   between the mapped categories and independent datasets for both
   evaluation approaches. Our map provides broad inference about spatial
   variation in potential predation risk from ravens for species such as
   greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and can be used as a
   valuable spatial layer for decision support tools aimed at guiding raven
   management decisions and, ultimately, improving survival and
   reproduction of sensitive prey within the Great Basin.},

Title = {Using bioenergetics and radar-derived bird abundance to assess the
   impact of a blackbird roost on seasonal sunflower damage},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Methods aimed at reducing avian damage to agricultural crops are
   routinely implemented in situations where efficacy can be assessed by
   quantifying blackbird (Icteridae) abundance relative to environmental
   variables and extrapolating to ensuing crop damage. Concomitantly,
   Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR) data may have potential to enhance crop
   damage mitigation through improved monitoring of nuisance wildlife
   populations. We used WSR to derive daily abundance estimates of
   blackbirds at a fall roost in North Dakota, USA from 2012 to 2019. We
   integrated these estimates with previously developed
   bioenergetics-economic models to estimate local sunflower (Helianthus
   annuus) damage. The greatest losses usually occurred during a brief
   period in October, when peak blackbird abundance coincided with large
   percentages (>50\%) of mature but unharvested sunflower fields. Most
   sunflower fields were harvested later than peak blackbird abundance
   (360,000-1,120,000 birds) and maximum daily damages (\$900-\$2,000 USD
   per day). This seasonal trend suggests advancing harvest time as a
   strategy to avoid the greatest losses in yield (up to \$1,800 in savings
   at this 1 roost), which may be attainable by earlier planting of
   early-maturing crop varieties or crop desiccation.},

Title = {European starling use of nest boxes relative to human disturbance},

Abstract = {European starling (Sturnus vulgaris; starling) nesting poses debris
   hazards within airport hangars and to engine and flight surfaces of
   moored aircraft. We questioned whether consistent removal of nest
   material would negatively affect use of a nest site, measured by a
   reduction in material accumulation. We conducted our study on a 2,200-ha
   site in Erie County, Ohio, USA (41 degrees 22 ` N, 82 degrees 41 ` W),
   from April 15 through June 2, 2020. We used 120 wooden nest boxes on
   utility poles, protected by an aluminum predator guard below the box.
   Our treatments included (1) twice weekly, repeated nest material removal
   (RMR; n = 40 nest boxes); (2) complete nest removal, but only after nest
   construction and >= 1 starling egg was laid (CNR; n = 40 nest boxes);
   and (3) a control; n = 40 nest boxes; N = 120 nest boxes). Starlings
   deposited approximately 50\% greater mass of nest material and eggs at
   RMR than CNR nest boxes, indicating that consistent disturbance failed
   to dissuade use. Predator guard protection of nest boxes at our site
   reduced nest predation of starlings; the current starling population is
   likely adapted to selecting these sites. Similar selection toward low
   nest-predation risk associated with anthropogenic structures and moored
   aircraft is also possible. Aside from covering moored aircraft and
   closing hangar doors, actions not necessarily feasible, removal of
   starling nesting material more than twice weekly would be necessary to
   maintain minimum control over material deposition that could affect
   aircraft function and safety.},

Title = {A novel method for detecting wild boar presence},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-80},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Populations of wild boar and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are increasing in
   numbers and distribution worldwide, in parallel with their significant
   environmental and economic impact. Reliable methods to detect the
   presence of this species are needed for monitoring its natural range
   expansion and its occurrence in areas where animals have been
   deliberately or accidentally introduced. The main aim of this study,
   carried out in English woodlands recently colonized by wild boar, was to
   assess the effectiveness of a birch wood tar-based compound, to detect
   the presence of this species in presence/absence surveys. A pilot trial
   in woodlands where wild boar had been established for circa 20 years
   found that wild boar sniffed and rubbed their bodies against stakes
   treated with this compound significantly more than against control
   stakes treated with water, thus confirming that the birch wood tar
   attracted wild boar to stakes. A second trial, carried out by applying
   the birch wood tar to trees in 8 woodlands surrounding the core range of
   wild boar, found that these animals left consistently more activity
   signs such as rubbing, tusk marks, and rooting on or around trees
   treated with this compound than on or around control trees treated with
   water. These results suggest that birch wood tar can be used as a method
   to confirm presence of wild boar in an area. Possible applications of
   this compound include its use to increase trapping efficiency or its
   deployment to confirm the success of a local eradication.},

Title = {Line of sight: simulated aerial avian predators can reduce problematic
   bird flyovers of airfields},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Collisions between birds and aircraft (bird strikes) are a serious
   threat to air safety and represent a substantial economic cost to the
   global aviation industry. In recent years, the frequency of wood pigeons
   (Columba palumbus) flying over active runways has increased at airports
   in Ireland. Here, we examine the effectiveness of imitation hawk-kites
   as a means of excluding wood pigeons from sensitive airfield locations.
   Over 2 years, during August and September, we conducted control (no
   kites deployed) and treatment trials (kites deployed) at Casement
   Aerodrome, an active airfield of approximately 320 ha in County Dublin,
   Ireland and on agricultural farmland in County Waterford, Ireland, where
   the movement of large numbers of wood pigeons had previously been
   identified (>= 50 birds per hour). Overall, we recorded a significant
   reduction in the mean (+/- SE) number of wood pigeons observed to
   successfully cross sites during deployment of the hawk-kites (70.69 +/-
   11.01 per hour), compared to control trials (178.37 +/- 29.98 per hour).
   Although preliminary, our data suggest that hawk-kites can be used to
   provide an additional means of bird control to reduce instances of
   airfield flyovers by a problematic species. Nevertheless, further
   research is required to determine the reliability of hawk-kites under a
   range of context-dependencies, such as airfield location, size
   surrounding land-use, seasonality, and weather conditions.},

Title = {Ecological factors influencing wild pig damage to planted pine and

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Expanding wild pig (Sus scrofa) populations across the southern United
   States has the potential to impact longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
   restoration efforts. The depredation of planted pine seedlings is the
   most widespread and economically costly damage caused by wild pigs in
   forest plantations. A better understanding of the ecological factors
   affecting depredation rates will allow managers to implement best
   management practices to reduce seedling mortality from wild pigs at
   their most vulnerable stage of growth. From March 2016 to March 2017, we
   evaluated wild pig preferences for planted pine and hardwood species at
   a 34.4-ha cutover site and 4.7-ha pecan (Carya illinoinensis) orchard in
   Bullock County, Alabama, USA. Wild pig damage differed for the 5
   seedling species tested, with longleaf and cherrybark oak (Quercus
   pagodaefolia) being the most preferred. Ninety one percent of seedlings
   destroyed by wild pigs were from the cutover site. Wild pigs at the
   cutover site experienced substantially more hunting pressure compared to
   those at the other site. We believe the debris scattering practices of
   the logging crew following a clearcut created a desirable foraging
   environment that led to the initial discovery of the seedlings. The
   short-term protection and minimization of seedling depredation in young
   forest plantations may be the most realistic solution to reducing the
   impact of wild pigs on forestry and timber resources.},

Abstract = {Depredation of domestic livestock by wildlife is a leading source of
   human-wildlife conflict, often requiring intervention at the local
   level. Historically, these interventions have resulted in the use of
   lethal methods to remove the offending animal. In response to increased
   public opposition to lethal control methods, wildlife managers have
   sought to identify effective nonlethal biological options to mitigate
   wildlife depredations. In 2018, we tested the concept of a biological
   deterrent using red wolf (Canis rufus) scat that had historically been
   spread along fence lines to prevent depredation of lambs (Ovis aries)
   and kid goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) at the North Carolina State
   University College of Veterinary Medicine 32-ha Teaching Animal Unit
   (TAU), North Carolina, USA. To conduct the study, we deployed paired
   camera traps at 3 locations where we had previously observed coyotes (C.
   latrans) accessing the TAU. The study was conducted over a 94-day period
   alternating between no scat and freshly collected scat that was placed
   every 3 days from adult male red wolves. The study period overlapped
   lambing and kidding season. In addition to coyotes, the camera traps
   routinely detected red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and raccoons (Procyon
   lotor). The red wolf scat we placed at the access point did not deter
   any of the mesocarnivores from entering the pasture.},

Title = {Increased abundance of the common raven within the ranges of greater and

Abstract = {The common raven (Corvus corax; raven) is native to North America and
   has increased in abundance, especially throughout western North America,
   during the last century. Human subsidies have facilitated raven
   dispersal into less suitable habitats and enabled these populations to
   maintain higher annual survival and reproduction. Concomitantly,
   overabundant raven populations are impacting other native at-risk
   species such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and
   potentially the Gunnison sage-grouse (C. minimus). Using Breeding Bird
   Survey data from 1995-2014, we evaluated raven count data to
   quantitatively describe changes in abundance and expansion into
   sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems, specifically sage-grouse habitat.
   We focused our analyses on the 7 sage-grouse management zones (MZs)
   delineated across 11 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. We
   assessed the effects of land cover and anthropogenic disturbance on
   instantaneous growth rate (r) or carrying capacity (K) of ravens.
   Abundance of ravens in western and southeastern MZs was greater than
   northeastern MZs within the greater sage-grouse range. While raven
   abundance was lower in MZ I and II (Alberta, Canada; Dakotas, Montana,
   and northwestern Colorado, USA; Saskatchewan, Canada; and Wyoming, USA),
   raven expansion and percent increase were equivalent or greater than all
   other MZs. High abundance in MZ VII indicated Gunnison sage-grouse have
   been exposed to increased raven populations for several decades. Areas
   with greater electric power transmission line density had higher r;
   higher K was positively related to proportion of urban land cover within
   25 km and burned area within 3 km and negatively related to greater
   distance from landfills and proportion of forest land cover within 15
   km. Ravens have capitalized on human subsidies to increase abundance and
   expand into sagebrush ecosystems that did not historically support high
   raven populations. As such, managers are now faced with a new dilemma of
   reducing populations of a native species to benefit other native
   sagebrush obligate species.},

Title = {Estimating trends of common raven populations in North America,

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Over the last half century, common raven (Corvus corax; raven)
   populations have increased in abundance across much of North America.
   Ravens are generalist predators known to depredate the eggs and young of
   several sensitive species. Quantifying raven population increases at
   multiple spatial scales across North America will help wildlife resource
   managers identify areas where population increases present the greatest
   risk to species conservation. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling
   approach to analyze trends of standardized raven counts from 1966 to
   2018 using Breeding Bird Survey data within each Level I and II
   ecoregion of the United States and Canada. We also compared raven
   abundance within and outside the distributions of 9 sensitive or
   endangered species. Although we found substantial evidence that raven
   populations have increased across North America, populations varied in
   growth rates and relative abundances among regions. We found 73\% of
   Level I (11/15) and II (25/34) ecoregions demonstrated positive annual
   population growth rates ranging from 0.2-9.4\%. We found higher raven
   abundance inside versus outside the distributions of 7 of the 9
   sensitive species included in our analysis. Gunnison sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus minimus) had the highest discrepancy, with 293\% more
   ravens within compared to outside of their range, followed by greater
   sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis tabida; 280\%), and greater
   sage-grouse (C. urophasianus; 204\%). Only 2 species, least tern
   (Sternula antillarum) and piping plover (Charadrius melodus), indicated
   lower raven abundance within relative to outside their distributions.
   Our findings will help wildlife resource managers identify regional
   trends in abundance of ravens and anticipate which sensitive species are
   at greatest risk from elevated raven populations. Future research
   directed at identifying the underlying regional drivers of these trends
   could help elucidate the most appropriate and responsive management
   actions and, thereby, guide the development of raven population
   management plans to mitigate impacts to sensitive species.},

Title = {Management of the brown-headed cowbird: implications for endangered
   species and agricultural damage mitigation},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {The brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater; cowbird) is unique among North
   American blackbirds (Icteridae) because it is managed to mitigate the
   negative effects on endangered songbirds and economic losses in
   agricultural crops. Cowbird brood parasitism can further affect species
   that are considered threatened or endangered due to anthropogenic land
   uses. Historically, cowbirds have often been culled without addressing
   ultimate causes of songbird population declines. Similar to other North
   American blackbirds, cowbirds depredate agricultural crops, albeit at a
   lower rate reported for other blackbird species. Conflicting information
   exists on the extent of agricultural damage caused by cowbirds and the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures for application to management. In
   this paper, we reviewed the progress that has been made in cowbird
   management from approximately 2005 to 2020 in relation to endangered
   species. We also reviewed losses to the rice (Oryza sativa) crop
   attributed to cowbirds and the programs designed to reduce depredation.
   Of the 4 songbird species in which cowbirds have been managed, both the
   Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) and black-capped vireo (Vireo
   atricapilla) have been removed from the endangered species list
   following population increases in response to habitat expansion. Cowbird
   trapping has ceased for Kirtland's warbler but continues for the vireo.
   In contrast, least Bell's vireo (V. bellii pusillus) and southwestern
   willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) still require cowbird
   control after modest increases in suitable habitat. Our review of rice
   depredation by cowbirds revealed models that have been created to
   determine the number of cowbirds that can be taken to decrease rice loss
   have been useful but require refinement with new data that incorporate
   cowbird population changes in the rice growing region, dietary
   preference studies, and current information on population sex ratios and
   female cowbird egg laying. Once this information has been gathered,
   bioenergetic and economic models would increase our understanding of the
   damage caused by cowbirds.},

Title = {Nighttime traffic volume predicts risk of deer-vehicle collisions},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Annually, in the United States, >1 million deer (Odocoileus
   spp.)-vehicle collisions are reported, resulting in losses of \$4.6
   billion in vehicle damage and medical expenses. Wildlife and
   transportation managers require better information about traffic volumes
   relative to seasonal and diurnal deer movement patterns to appropriately
   evaluate the risks associated with deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We
   incorporated traffic volume data with DVC data and the movement rates
   and incidences of road crossings by white-tailed deer (O. virginianus)
   to evaluate if traffic volume or deer behaviors mediate the incidence of
   DVCs along a high-volume interstate highway in Morgan County in central
   Georgia, USA. From May 2012 to July 2014, we monitored the movements and
   survival of 25 deer (13 males, 12 females) instrumented with global
   positioning system (GPS) collars in an area 1.6 km north and south of a
   7.7-km section of Interstate 20 in our study area. We used a linear
   mixed model to quantify the effects of mean traffic volume and total
   road crossings on DVCs for each hour of the day. Deer movements and DVCs
   were primarily crepuscular. Approximately 60\% of GPS-collared deer
   crossed roads; 7 deer accounted for >90\% of all road crossings.
   Approximately 73\% of daily traffic occurred between 0700 and 1859
   hours. Nearly twice the number of daily DVCs occurred during the fall
   (9.8 DVCs/day) than during the next highest season (winter; 4.9
   DVCs/day). Although DVCs occurred at greater frequencies during
   crepuscular periods, results of our linear mixed model suggested only
   nighttime traffic volume predicted DVCs. The relationship between
   nighttime DVCs and traffic volume is likely due to the inability of
   drivers to perceive deer in a roadway during this time. We recommend
   mitigation efforts focus on increasing driver vigilance and reducing
   vehicle speed during nighttime periods, especially during the fall
   season.},

Title = {Does hunting affect the behavior of wild pigs?},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-55},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Wild boar and feral swine (Sus scrofa) numbers are growing worldwide. In
   parallel, their severe ecological and economic impacts are also
   increasing and include vehicle collisions, damage to crops and
   amenities, reduction in plant and animal abundance and richness, and
   transmission of diseases, the latter causing billions of U.S. dollars in
   losses to the livestock industry each year. Recreational hunters are the
   main cause of mortality for this species, and hunting has traditionally
   been the main method to contain populations of wild pigs. Hunting might
   affect the behavior of the species, which potentially can lead to these
   animals moving to new areas or to an increase in disease transmission.
   This review summarized the evidence that recreational hunting influences
   the behavior of wild pigs. Twenty-nine studies reported the effect of
   recreational hunting on social, spatial, and temporal behavior. Although
   most found that recreational hunting caused changes in home range size,
   home range shifting, habitat use, and activity patterns, there was
   little agreement between studies on the size, direction, and duration of
   these effects. Several studies suggested that other factors, such as
   season and food availability, equally affect the behavior of this
   species. Very few studies provided details about the type and frequency
   of hunting, the number of hunters and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), the
   number of animals harvested, or the presence of reserve areas where
   hunting was forbidden on neighboring sites. As wild pigs adapt to human
   disturbance, these factors should be investigated to minimize the
   effects of recreational hunting on the behavior of the species,
   particularly in the context of disease transmission.},

Abstract = {Increasing global rates of wildlife species extinctions, extirpations,
   and declines warrant improvements to population monitoring and
   management approaches. To address regional environmental and wildlife
   issues, Indigenous communities globally are re-establishing traditional
   roles as stewards of the land through emerging Indigenous Guardianship
   Programs (IGPs). By providing the opportunity for community-level
   participation in monitoring and management, IGPs help foster cohesive
   solutions for long-term conservation of species while promoting
   environmental stewardship at the community level. Addressing challenges
   in monitoring and management of wildlife is especially critical for
   species that are of cultural and ecological importance at both community
   and distribution-wide scales. Herein, we describe IGPs in Canada with a
   focus on moose (Aloes ekes), an important species to many Indigenous
   Peoples across the species' distribution. We outline common Western
   approaches to moose monitoring applied across Canadian jurisdictions and
   discuss ways in which weaving Indigenous knowledge systems and
   information gathered through local participation from Indigenous
   communities enhances monitoring initiatives at regional levels. We
   elaborate on a case study on moose monitoring and co-management in the
   community of Gitanyow in British Columbia, Canada to highlight the value
   of Guardianship to communities and species conservation in relation to
   moose. Our study reveals how IGPs and the weaving of Indigenous and
   Western knowledge systems can contribute to the maintenance of both
   ecological and cultural integrity to strengthen wildlife monitoring and
   management under changing global environments.},

Title = {No difference in corticosterone concentrations between Missouri

Abstract = {Baseline health data for species of conservation concern are important
   for understanding threats to the long-term viability of populations. One
   indication of health is physiological stress among individuals.
   Corticosterone (CORT) is frequently used to quantify stress in
   free-living reptile populations, as high values may be associated with
   reduced fitness. Herein, we describe and validate methods for
   quantifying blood CORT levels in three-toed box turtles (Terrapene
   mexicana triunguis). We subsequently use this information to evaluate
   stress levels in 2 populations of free-living three-toed box turtles in
   Missouri, USA. To our knowledge, this is the first quantification of
   CORT levels in the three-toed box turtle. In 2012 we collected blood
   samples from 11 three-toed box turtles in human care at the Saint Louis
   Zoological Park (zoo), St. Louis, Missouri for assay validation, and
   from 2012 to 2016 we collected 220 samples from 144 free-living
   three-toed box turtles at 2 sites, 1 urban and 1 rural. In the zoo
   turtles, mean CORT concentration was 0.71 +/- 0.10 ng/mL. Following a
   handling experiment, CORT concentration increased to 3.14 +/- 0.72 ng/mL
   (P = 0.011). Mean CORT levels between free-living turtles at the urban
   and rural sites did not differ (urban = 0.54 +/- 0.08 ng/mL, rural =
   0.37 +/- 0.02 ng/mL, F pr = 0.12). Sex did not influence CORT levels (F
   pr = 0.29). These results suggest that the turtles living in the urban
   environment did not experience chronic elevated glucocorticoid
   production and supports urban parks as potential habitat for box
   turtles.},

Abstract = {Supplemental feeding of cervid species such as white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) is now a common management practice in
   the United States. Supplemental feeding can be costly and more expensive
   when supplements are consumed by non-target species such as wild pigs
   (Sus scrofa; pigs). From May 13 to June 17, 2015, we evaluated the
   effects of using ground blueberry juniper (Juniperus ashei) or
   cottonseed (Gossypium spp.) hulls as a roughage ingredient in a
   supplemental deer pellet to deter pig consumption at the Texas A\&M
   AgriLife Research Center in San Angelo, Texas, USA. We analyzed dry
   matter intake, growth performance, in vitro digestibility and
   fermentation, and blood serum chemistry of pigs using a 2 x 2 factorial
   study design that included 3 feeding periods. Pigs were assigned to 1 of
   4 supplement diets (n = 5 pigs/supplement) or to a commercially
   available swine diet (BASAL; n= 4 pigs). Animals assigned to supplement
   diets were also offered BASAL based on percentage of body weight (BW)
   during each period. Supplement diets differed by roughage source and
   percentage of roughage: cottonseed hulls 20\%, cottonseed hulls 40\%,
   blueberry juniper 20\%, or blueberry juniper 40\%. During each period,
   the amount of supplement and BASAL diet offered to animals assigned to a
   supplement was fed as a percentage of BW; period 1 (day 0 to 17) = 5\%
   supplement diet and 5\% BASAL diet, period 2 (day 18 to 26) = 5\%
   supplement diet and 2\% BASAL diet, period 3 (day 27 to 34) = 5\%
   supplement diet and 5\% BASAL diet. Animals assigned to only BASAL were
   offered the same amount of feed as a percent of BW as supplement animals
   during each period. We observed a roughage x period interaction (P =
   0.03) for supplement dry matter intake g/day and a roughage x period
   interaction (P < 0.09) for total dry matter intake as a percentage of
   BW. No differences were observed within period. No other variables had
   percent roughage x period differences. Ground blueberry juniper was
   indigestible by pigs; the in vitro digestibility of dry matter and gross
   energy was <1\%. Greater blood serum alanine aminotransferase (P = 0.07)
   in pigs consuming experimental supplement diets suggested the
   possibility of liver damage. Our findings suggest that there does not
   appear to be a benefit of using ground juniper as a roughage source to
   reduce consumption of supplemental deer feed by pigs.},

Title = {What happens after a shark incident? Behavioral changes among Australian
   beachgoers},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-83},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Sharks (Selachimorpha) have an important ecological function and are
   both valued and feared by people around the world. Shark bite incidents
   present a high consequence risk in terms of human health and safety. In
   Australia, shark interactions with humans are most frequently recorded
   for the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), bull shark (Carcharhinus
   leucas), and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Human anxiety of
   encountering sharks may be elevated relative to the actual level of risk
   due to intensive media coverage, which typically emphasizes a narrative
   of highly abundant animals actively targeting human water users. This
   narrative is not supported by scientific evidence. Public perceptions of
   shark incidents can strongly influence shark management efforts. To help
   management, we set out to understand how people change their behavior in
   response to shark incidents and why some behaviors do or do not change.
   In October 2019, we used 4 participatory workshops, attended by 60
   people, and a visual communication approach to study the socioecological
   context of beachgoer behavior to sharks in a high shark incident region
   around Ballina and Byron Bay in New South Wales, Australia. Of all
   recorded comments captured at the workshops (174), 91\% mentioned
   changes in behavior following the reported incidents, and 9\% indicated
   no behavior change. The behavior changes generally did not result in
   less beach use but in different types of use. When beachgoers visited
   the beach and used the ocean, they implicitly asked themselves the
   following questions in selecting activities and behaviors: (1) how much
   risk do I think is present, (2) how much risk am I willing to accept,
   and (3) how much do I trust the information and advice available to me
   to mitigate these risks? We found that families, teenagers, and
   experienced beachgoers (such as surfers) used different socioecological
   information on which to base their risk assessments and that these
   groups had different risk profiles. Despite these variations, a common
   finding across beachgoers was a strong desire to improve the quality of
   publicly available and locally relevant information on risk factors.
   Using the graphic visualization of our findings for communication
   purposes can help beachgoers contextualize their own risk perception and
   learn from how others have changed their reported behavior. Sharing of
   behavior change information and risk reduction strategies can help
   target public investment in mitigation measures and may encourage
   further risk reduction strategies and policies to be implemented.},

Title = {Fertility control options for management of free-roaming horse
   populations},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-38},
Abstract = {The management of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus) and burros (E.
   asinus) in the United States has been referred to as a ``wicked problem
   `` because, although there are population control options, societal
   values will ultimately determine what is acceptable and what is not. In
   the United States, free-roaming equids are managed by different types of
   organizations and agencies, and the landscapes that these animals
   inhabit vary widely in terms of access, size, topography, climate,
   natural resources, flora, and fauna. This landscape diversity, coupled
   with contemporary socioeconomic and political environments, means that
   adaptive management practices are needed to regulate these free-roaming
   populations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently manages
   free-roaming equids on 177 herd management areas in the United States by
   applying fertility control measures in situ and/or removing horses,
   which are either adopted by private individuals or sent to long-term
   holding facilities. The BLM off-range population currently includes >
   50,000 animals and costs approximately \$50 million USD per year to
   maintain; on-range equid numbers were estimated in March 2022 to be
   approximately 82,384. On-range populations can grow at 15-20\% annually,
   and current estimates far exceed the designated appropriate management
   level of 26,715. To reduce population recruitment, managers need better
   information about effective, long-lasting or permanent fertility control
   measures. Because mares breed only once a year, fertility control
   studies take years to complete. Some contraceptive approaches have been
   studied for decades, and results from various trials can collectively
   inform future research directions and actions. Employing 1 or more
   fertility control tools in concert with removals offers the best
   potential for success. Active, iterative, cooperative, and thoughtful
   management practices can protect free-roaming horses while
   simultaneously protecting the habitat. Herein, we review contraceptive
   vaccines, intrauterine devices, and surgical sterilization options for
   controlling fertility of free-roaming horses. This review provides
   managers with a ``fertility control toolbox `` and guides future
   research.},

Abstract = {Visual counts are frequently used to assess efficacy of management tools
   for ground squirrels (Marmotini), but the effectiveness of this approach
   has not been assessed for many ground squirrel species including
   California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus spp.). As such, we used
   visual counts of California ground squirrels to determine the efficacy
   of diphacinonetreated oat groat applications in rangelands in central
   California, USA, and compared those results to efficacy values derived
   from the use of radio-collared ground squirrels in the same plots. We
   also used location data of radio-collared ground squirrels to explore
   the size of buffer zone needed around census plots to provide an
   accurate assessment of efficacy when using visual counts. We did not
   observe a difference in efficacy associated with the 2 monitoring
   strategies, indicating that visual counts are an effective monitoring
   tool for ground squirrels. We observed low efficacy in 2 treatment
   plots, likely due to low usage of those plots by ground squirrels.
   Increasing the size of buffer zones would increase the usage of
   treatment areas by the target population and would help to minimize
   reinvasion by adjacent ground squirrel populations, which could bias
   efficacy values low. We suggest a minimum of a 61-m buffer surrounding
   census plots. Increasing to 66 m or more would further benefit efficacy
   assessments, but increased size of the buffer zone must be balanced with
   greater costs and regulatory constraints.},

Abstract = {Trapping of terrestrial animals is an important tool for harvest, pest
   control and research worldwide. To catch animals alive, animal welfare
   has to be ensured, which is reflected in different agreements on trading
   and trapping of animals between sovereign nations (Council Regulation
   {[}EEC] No 3254/91). The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and stone marten
   (Martes foina) represent important predatory animals. Their influence on
   protected species as well as their increasing appearance in urban areas
   demand responsible handling. In our study, we evaluated 2 trap systems
   used for trapping red foxes and stone martens in accordance with
   criteria stipulated in the Agreement on International Humane Trapping
   Standards (AIHTS) and International Organisation for Standardisation
   10990 Part 5 - Methods for Testing Restraining Traps (ISO 10990). In
   total, we captured 20 red foxes in a concrete pipe vault trap and 13
   stone martens in a Strack's wooden box trap in Schleswig-Holstein,
   Germany, and observed their behavior inside each trap. After anesthesia,
   a clinical examination of each animal was conducted, and blood and hair
   samples were taken. After euthanasia, radiological examinations of the
   full body were taken, and necropsies and histopathological
   investigations were performed. No trap-associated lesions were found.
   Hormone analysis showed no remarkable signs of stress for the animals,
   according to state-of-the-art methods. Apart from serum cortisol, the
   quotient of dehydroepiandrosterone in serum and hair seems to be the
   most predictive value on stress response of the 2 different species.
   Video observation of the trapped animals emerged as a valuable tool to
   estimate animal welfare by behavior. This study complements AIHTS and
   ISO 10990 criteria with results on behavior and hormone analysis, being
   an additional benefit when evaluating animal welfare of each trapping
   system.},

Abstract = {Range expansion of American black bears (Ursus americanus; bear) and
   residential development have increased the bear presence in suburbia.
   Suburban landscapes exhibiting patchworks of variable-sized parcels and
   habitats and owned by landowners with diverse values can create large
   areas of suitable habitats with limited public access. These landscapes
   may limit the effectiveness of hunting as a traditional bear population
   management tool. Managers require better information regarding landowner
   attitudes about hunting before implementing harvest regulations intended
   to mitigate conflicts in suburban areas. To address this need, in 2013,
   we surveyed landowners to identify properties that allowed bear hunting
   in 3 suburban areas of Pennsylvania, USA where bear sightings or
   human-bear conflicts have increased. We then used location data obtained
   for 29 bears equipped with global positioning system transmitters from
   2010 to 2012 to model their resource selection in the study area. We
   assessed the influence of hunting access, housing density, land cover,
   and topographic variables on radio-marked black bears monitored 10 days
   before, during, and after the bear hunting season. We found that
   resource selection of radio-marked bears was similar for all 3 periods
   and bears selected for forested land in all 3 seasons and herbaceous
   cover in the pre-hunting and hunting periods. Resource selection by
   bears was not influenced by hunting access in the pre-hunting and
   hunting periods. For the post-hunting period, lands closed to hunting
   had support as the second-best model. All of the radio-marked bears in
   our study were vulnerable to harvest. However, they did not change
   resource selection during the hunting season, nor did they avoid areas
   open to hunting. Integrating human dimension data with bear habitat use
   studies, especially in suburban landscapes, has the potential to address
   bear space use and population management needs often overlooked by
   traditional research designs.},

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in developing countries is faced with many and
   mounting challenges, including increasing human-wildlife conflicts
   (HWCs). In Africa and other developing countries, increasing HWCs,
   particularly those adjacent to protected areas, can adversely affect
   local stakeholder perceptions and support for conservation. We analyzed
   HWC reports for multiple wildlife species compiled >23 years (1995-2017)
   from the Greater Tsavo Ecosystem (GTE) in Kenya to determine HWC trends.
   The GTE is the largest protected area in Kenya, covering 22,681 km(2).
   Overall, 39,022 HWC incidents were reported in 6 GTE regions (i.e.,
   Taveta, Mutomo, Kibwezi, Rombo, Galena, Bachuma). The 5 wildlife species
   most often implicated in HWC incidents were the African elephant
   (Loxodonta africana, 61.6\%, n = 24,032), nonhuman primates (11.5\%, n =
   4,480), buffalo (Syncerus caffer, 6.2\%, n = 2,432 ), African lion
   (Panthera leo, 4.2\%, n = 1,645), and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus
   amphibius, 3.8\%, n = 1,497). The HWC reports also revealed spatial
   distinctions across the 6 GTE regions. More human-elephant conflicts
   (HECs; 43.3\%, n = 10,427) were reported in the Taveta region than other
   regions. The Mutomo region was the epicenter of primate, snake, and
   python (Python spp.) conflicts. More large carnivore depredations on
   livestock were reported in the Taveta, Rombo, and Mutomo regions. Lions,
   spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), and leopards (P pardus) were
   implicated in more livestock depredations than other camivores. The
   number of HWCs reported varied by year and season and were related to
   similar variations in the availability, quality, and distribution of
   food and water governed by rainfall fluctuations. Reported HECs were
   positively and linearly related to human, elephant, and livestock
   population densities. The Kenya Wildlife Service responded to >90\% of
   the reported HWCs. In general, the number of HWCs and trends reported
   were higher in the regions that also exhibited the highest human
   population growth rates and densities. Sustainable biodiversity
   conservation in human-dominated landscapes is contingent upon
   communities deriving meaningful benefits from wildlife conservation.
   Far-sighted measures and different conservation approaches are required
   to mitigate HWCs in communities neighboring protected areas.},

Abstract = {In the United States alone, there are >5,000 state-licensed wildlife
   rehabilitators in addition to a multitude of other wildlife caregivers
   across rehabilitation and sanctuary settings. Wildlife rehabilitation
   and sanctuary care provide a unique lens from which to explore
   human-wildlife interactions. We examined the experiences of wildlife
   caregivers within a continuum of acute veterinary services,
   community-based rehabilitation, and sanctuary care to gain insight into
   wildlife caregiving and its implications for human-wildlife coexistence.
   Between 2016 and 2018, we completed in-depth interviews with 15 wildlife
   caretakers in Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, USA. In addition
   to the interviews, we observed 197 unique human-animal interactions
   during wildlife care. The overarching paradigm that emerged from our
   research was what we refer to as ``caring for the circle of life.{''}
   Embraced within this paradigm were 5 themes: (1) entering and
   persevering in the circle of care; (2) honoring natural processes; (3)
   knowing and being known by the wild creature; (4) extending the circle
   of care; and (5) fulfillment. Wildlife rehabilitation and sanctuary
   care, in addition to providing medical assistance to animals in need,
   advance knowledge about individual species and contributes to increased
   public awareness regarding wildlife conservation and human-wildlife
   coexistence.},

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Bird interactions with electric power lines can cause faults (e.g.,
   disruption of electrical service). Faults on 500kV transmission lines in
   Montana, USA, which are integral to the Northwest USA power grid, became
   concerning during winter 2016-2017. In 2017 we found insulators
   contaminated with bird droppings and discovered a large nocturnal roost
   of common ravens (Corvus corax). To assess the potential magnitude of
   the impact of raven roosts on electric power transmission, we summarized
   fault data obtained from the Energy Management System and raven
   abundance data obtained from the Christmas Bird Count in central Montana
   from 2005 to 2020. We also conducted counts at 7 roosts in the study
   area in winter 2019-2020. We detected a positive relationship between
   the number of faults reported and raven abundance. The 3 largest roosts
   we surveyed peaked at 1,000-1,500 ravens on single evenings. The number
   of faults reported in winter 2019-2020 decreased after use of
   silicon-coated insulators, perch deterrents, and periodic washing of
   insulators. Increased raven populations throughout their range may cause
   similar conflicts for other electric utilities. Long-term management of
   ravens will need to integrate approaches at both local and landscape
   scales.},

Title = {One step closer to a better starling trap},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are an invasive species in the
   United States that damage agriculture, personal property, and threaten
   human health and safety. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife
   Services provides technical support to mitigate damage by controlling
   starling populations at concentrated animal feeding operations,
   landfills, utilities, and urban areas. Wildlife Services uses DRC-1339,
   a registered toxicant, to reduce starling populations. Trapping can also
   be an effective tool but requires more time at a higher cost than
   DRC-1339. Trapping starlings, however, may be needed to provide a viable
   alternative to mitigate damage in areas where toxicant use may be
   restricted. To address this need, I developed a unique and effective
   starling trap to increase catch rates. I began testing multiple trap
   designs in November 2007 at cattle (Bos taurus) feedlots, meat
   processing plants, and urban staging areas in a 45-km radius of the city
   of Omaha, Nebraska, USA. In December 2011, I designed a 4-chamber,
   basket-style starling trap that has been instrumental in a nearly 90\%
   reduction of the roosting starling population in downtown Omaha. Herein,
   I discuss the development and testing of the trap and provide guidelines
   and instructions for building and strategic placement of the trap.},

Abstract = {The common raven (Corvus corax; raven) is a large, highly intelligent
   passerine songbird with a Holarctic distribution attributable to a high
   degree of plasticity in its foraging and nesting behavior. Historically,
   ravens have received special attention in human culture, being either
   respected or vilified. In the western United States, ravens are
   exploiting the expanding human enterprise, which provides them with
   unintended subsidies of food, water, and breeding locations, allowing
   ravens to expand their range and increase in population density and
   resulting in raven depredation threatening species of conservation
   concern. From a conservation biology perspective, increased raven
   populations present a difficult challenge in managing human-wildlife
   conflict. Some raven control measures are effective empirically but
   present ethical dilemmas, are economically expensive, or are socially
   divisive. Current studies seek to better understand raven population
   dynamics in relation to human land use and to identify socially
   acceptable ways to ameliorate raven impacts on biodiversity in the
   American West. The purpose of this paper is to provide readers with
   summaries of important constraints in the search for how to address
   deleterious effects of an expanding raven population. Specifically, I
   describe ethical, legal, social, and biological constraints in relation
   to calls for lethal control of ravens. Despite these constraints, a
   conservation strategy may emerge through modeling the relationship
   between raven presence and reproduction of sensitive prey species, and
   developing a clearer understanding of raven ecology. Papers in this
   special issue explore raven population dynamics, conservation
   consequences, and conservation solutions in detail and reveal innovative
   ways to address the complex human-wildlife conflict presented by ravens.},

Title = {Inter- and intra-annual effects of lethal removal on common raven
   abundance in Nevada and California, USA},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Populations of common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens) have increased
   rapidly within sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems between 1960 and
   2020. Although ravens are native to North America, their population
   densities have expanded to levels that negatively influence the
   population dynamics of other wildlife species of conservation concern,
   such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and desert
   tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). For this reason, lethal removal, such as
   the application of the avicide DRC-1339, has been used to manage raven
   numbers at local scales and under certain circumstances. Because the
   relative effectiveness of DRC-1339 in reducing raven populations
   densities is not thoroughly understood, we completed 2 case studies
   using a before-after-control-impact experimental design of density
   estimates generated from point count data within a Bayesian hierarchical
   distance sampling framework. Specifically, we analyzed >16,000 point
   count surveys collected during 2009-2019 and split into 2 study designs
   covering multiple field sites within the Great Basin region. The first
   experiment evaluated intra-annual changes in density by comparing before
   and after treatment time periods within a single breeding season for
   multiple treatment regions compared to 2 control regions. The other
   experiment focused on inter-annual differences by comparing time periods
   across years before and after the onset of annual avicide application
   for a single treatment region compared to multiple control regions. Our
   models estimated a 100\% probability of decline in density relative to
   control sites for both the intra- and inter-annual model designs. At
   treatment sites, expected densities of ravens varied but were reduced by
   43\% (95\% CRI: 33-49\%) and 54\% (95\% CRI: 24-71\%) according to
   intra- and inter-annual analyses, respectively, whereas densities
   increased by 42\% (95\% CRI: 27-60\%) and 15\% (95\% CRI: -17 to 58\%)
   at control sites. Although population densities were reduced with
   treatments, trends indicated that sustained effort would likely be
   needed to maintain densities at acceptable levels within regions of
   interest. Effectively reducing the adverse effects of raven populations
   on other native species likely will depend on a variety of targeted
   management actions such as improving habitat quality for prey species,
   possibly reducing ravens' population density, and treating the cause of
   increased raven abundance to reduce future carrying capacity and prevent
   rebounds.},

Abstract = {Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a non-native, invasive species that cause
   considerable damage and transmit a variety of diseases to livestock,
   people, and wildlife. We explored Twitter, the most popular social media
   micro-blogging platform, to demonstrate how social media data can be
   leveraged to investigate social identity and sentiment toward wild pigs.
   In doing so, we employed a sophisticated machine learning approach to
   investigate: (1) the overall sentiment associated with the dataset, (2)
   online identities via user profile descriptions, and (3) the extent to
   which sentiment varied by online identity. Results indicated that the
   largest groups of online identity represented in our dataset were
   females and people whose occupation was in journalism and media
   communication. While the majority of our data indicated a negative
   sentiment toward wild pigs and other related search terms, users who
   identified with agriculture-related occupations had more favorable
   sentiment. Overall, this article is an important starting point for
   further investigation of the use of social media data and social
   identity in the context of wild pigs and other invasive species.},

Title = {Characteristics of non-fatal attacks by black bears: conterminous United
   States, 2000-2017},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Attacks on humans by bears (Ursus spp.) have increased in recent
   decades, as both human and bear populations have increased. To help
   mitigate the risk of future attacks, it is important to understand the
   circumstances in past attacks. Information and analyses exist regarding
   fatal attacks by both American black bears (Ursus americanus) and brown
   bears (U. arctos) as well as non-fatal attacks by brown bears. No
   similarly thorough analyses on non-fatal attacks by black bears are
   available. Our study addressed this information gap by analyzing all (n
   = 210) agency-confirmed, non-fatal attacks by black bears in the 48
   conterminous United States during 2000 to 2017. Most attacks were
   defensive (52\%), while 15\% were predatory and 33\% were
   food-motivated. Of defensive attacks, 85\% were by female bears, and
   91\% of those females had young. Of predatory attacks, 95\% were by male
   bears, and of food-motivated attacks, 80\% were by male bears. Forty
   percent of defensive attacks by female bears involved dogs (Canis lupus
   familiaris). Sixty-four percent had an attractant present during the
   attack and 74\% indicated there were reports of property damage by bears
   or of bears getting a food-reward in the area prior to the attack. A
   classification and regression tree model show the highest proportion of
   severe attacks were among a female victim who was with a dog and who
   fought back during an attack. When compared with previous studies of
   fatal attacks by black bears, which are typically predatory attacks by
   male bears, our results illustrate clear differences between fatal and
   non-fatal attacks. Our study also lends evidence to the hypothesis that
   dogs can trigger defensive attacks by black bears. These results have
   implications for risk assessment, attack mitigation, and how we advise
   the public to respond to an attacking bear.},

Title = {Supporting farmer adoption of sustainable bird management strategies
   Comment},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Pest birds cause substantial and costly damage to crops. Managing birds
   is complex because (1) they are highly mobile, (2) they habituate
   quickly to many deterrents, (3) some species provide benefits to farmers
   by deterring and consuming pest insects, rodents, and other birds, and
   (4) birds are highly valued by many people. Thus, farmers have many
   issues to consider when developing bird management strategies. Here I
   discuss recent work indicating that farmer adoption of sustainable
   agricultural practices is more likely when practices are effective,
   clear guidelines for implementation are available, implementation is
   relatively easy, and when practices are linked, in farmers' minds and
   logistically, with other farm management practices. This manuscript
   draws together information about these factors for common bird
   management tactics to aid in the development of sustainable bird
   management strategies by farmers and the development of education
   programs for farmers by extension personnel and researchers. Such
   strategies will necessarily involve combinations of tactics, following
   the framework of Integrated Pest Management.},

Title = {ND2 as an additional genetic marker to improve identification of diving
   ducks involved in bird strikes},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Knowing the exact species of birds involved in damaging collisions with
   aircraft (bird strikes) is paramount to managing and preventing these
   types of human-wildlife conflicts. While a standard genetic marker, or
   DNA barcode (mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome-c oxidase 1, or CO1), can
   reliably identify most avian species, this marker cannot distinguish
   among some closely related species. Diving ducks within the genus Aythya
   are an example of congeneric waterfowl involved in bird strikes where
   several species pairs cannot be reliably identified with the standard
   DNA barcode. Here, we describe methods for using an additional genetic
   marker (mitochondrial DNA gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, or ND2) for
   identification of 9 Aythya spp. Gene-specific phylogenetic trees and
   genetic distances among taxa reveal that ND2 is more effective than CO1
   at genetic identification of diving ducks studied here. Compared with
   CO1, the ND2 gene tree is more statistically robust, has a minimum of
   1.5 times greater genetic distance between sister clades, and resolves
   paraphyly in 2 clades. While CO1 is effective for identification of most
   bird strike cases, this study underscores the value of targeted
   incorporation of additional genetic markers for species identification
   of taxa that are known to be problematic using standard DNA barcoding.},

Abstract = {While management measures cannot eliminate human-wildlife conflicts,
   they have the potential to minimize the damage done to both parties,
   especially if areas where the nature of the potential interaction can be
   predicted before an encounter occurs. The timber rattlesnake (Crotalus
   horridus) represents a wildlife species associated with public
   misconceptions that may foster unwarranted fears and retribution. This
   species is native to the eastern and southern regions of the United
   States, including a small population remnant in the southeastern region
   of Minnesota. To gain a better understanding of the environmental
   predictors relevant to human-snake encounters in Minnesota (that require
   action such as relocation), we studied point locations of human-snake
   interactions requiring human intervention in Winona County in
   southeastern Minnesota over a 13-year period between 2006 and 2019. We
   used the points to create a model to predict areas of increased
   potential for human-snake interactions. Our analysis identified areas
   with high potential for such contact between humans and rattlesnakes.
   This research highlighted environmental factors favorable to timber
   rattlesnake encounters with humans and may serve as a guide for
   management efforts to mitigate human-snake conflicts.},

Title = {Serum chemistry values in wild black vultures in Mississippi, USA},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Vultures (Cathartidae and Accipitridae) play an important role in
   ecosystem balance by rapidly disposing animal carcasses and thus
   preventing the potential spread of pathogens. Blood chemistry values
   provide a means of assessing the health of wildlife and wild animal
   populations; however, there are significant differences in chemistries
   among species and when comparing captive and free-living New and Old
   World vultures. In 2007, we collected blood serum from 30 female and 14
   male wild, healthy black vultures (Coragyps atratus) live-trapped by the
   U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection
   Service, Wildlife Services from a power substation in Lowndes County,
   Mississippi, USA. We analyzed the blood serum to provide serum chemistry
   base values for use in clinical pathology. The chemical analytes we
   measured included sodium, chloride, potassium, carbon dioxide, anion
   gap, glucose, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin,
   globulin, and aspartate aminotransferase. In general, blood chemistry
   values of black vultures were similar to those found in New and Old
   World vultures and raptor species. Average chemistry values for males
   were lower than females for sodium, chloride, creatinine, calcium, total
   protein, albumin, and globulin. The serum chemistry values we describe
   in this paper can be important indicators of avian health by gender for
   the black vulture. Our study provided important blood chemistry values
   from a large sample size, which is rarely available in free-ranging
   black vultures. These values could be used by scientists, veterinary
   pathologists, wildlife rehabilitation centers, and other researchers for
   baseline data for wild and free-ranging birds. Furthermore, the use of
   such parameters in assessing population health may enable
   conservationists to further research environmental conditions affecting
   species reproduction and survival.},

Title = {Common raven nesting and spatial distancing on power lines in southeast
   Idaho, USA},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {289-303},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Common raven (Corvus corax; raven) abundance and distribution have
   increased in western North America in recent decades, facilitated by
   anthropogenic subsidies and other environmental changes. Electrical
   power transmission line structures provide nesting substrates for
   ravens. When these structures transect landscapes where natural nest
   substrates are limited, they may facilitate raven predation on eggs and
   juveniles of sensitive avian and reptile species. Little information is
   available regarding raven nest density trends on adjacent power lines or
   how raven territorial behavior influences spatial partitioning of nests,
   and hence, nest density. This knowledge would be valuable for managers
   of sensitive prey species who may be considering if interventions to
   reduce nesting are warranted. During 2014-2020, we conducted annual,
   repeated surveys for raven and buteo hawk nests along 272 km of
   electrical power transmission lines (69-233 kV) and 37 km of electrical
   distribution lines (12.5-13.8 kV) within a sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)
   ecosystem of southeastern Idaho, USA. Our objectives were to document
   annual raven nest trends on power lines and investigate spatial
   distancing between nests of conspecific ravens and those of ravens and
   raptors. We hypothesized that territorial raven pairs would maintain
   similar minimum distances between nearest-neighbor conspecific and
   raptor nests, as was observed in a study in western Idaho. Across the
   7-year study, the number of occupied raven nests remained relatively
   stable ((x) over bar = 26.7, SD = 5.3, range = 20-30), and an assessment
   of past research on our site suggests this plateau in power line nesting
   occurred following increases during the past 2 or 3 decades. Occupied
   raven nests were never closer than 1,033 m (annual minimum distance
   ranged from 1,033-2,054 m), but raven nests and buteo hawk nests were
   occasionally as close as 200-500 m. Forty-three percent of ravens whose
   nearest nest was occupied by a ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) or
   red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) pair were <1 km away. Conspecific raven
   nest distances and raven and raptor nest distances differed, suggesting
   raven breeding pairs were less tolerant of conspecific pairs than they
   were of raptor pairs. Our study provides a method for monitoring raven
   nesting on power lines in semi-arid regions of western North America and
   an additional monitoring strategy to complement the more widely used
   point-count surveys to sample breeding and nonbreeding ravens.},

Title = {Enhancing existing isolated underpasses with fencing reduces wildlife
   crashes and connects habitat},

Abstract = {The impact of wildlife-vehicle collisions on drivers and wildlife
   populations has been gaining attention in the United States. Given the
   established success of wildlife crossings with fencing in reducing
   wildlife crashes and connecting habitat, information is needed on
   cost-effective means of implementation for departments of
   transportation. When wildlife crossings are constructed, they are often
   built into new road projects as a series of 2 or more underpasses and/or
   overpass structures connected by exclusionary fencing. Given limited
   transportation budgets and the prevalence of maintenance activities more
   so than new construction in many states, enhancing existing underpasses
   on previously constructed roads has been recognized as a cost-effective
   mitigation opportunity. More research is needed, however, on the effects
   of adding fencing to existing underpasses, particularly those that are
   too far from one another to be connected with contiguous fencing. In
   this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of this measure when applied
   to isolated underpasses. Approximately 1.6 km of 2.4-m-high wildlife
   fencing was added to each of 2 existing underpasses, a large bridge
   underpass and a large box culvert, situated approximately 8 km apart
   from one another on Interstate 64 in Virginia, USA. We conducted a
   2-year post-fencing camera monitoring study and compared the findings
   from a 2-year pre-fencing study with regard to collision frequencies
   with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and black bears (Ursus
   americanus); the use of the underpasses by wildlife; and roadside deer
   activity. We also evaluated deer activity data to compare different
   fence end designs applied at the study sites. After fencing
   installation, deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were reduced by 96.5\% and
   88\% at the box culvert and bridge underpass, respectively, and there
   were no increases in DVCs within 1.6 km of the fence ends. Deer
   crossings increased 410\% at the box culvert and 71\% at the bridge
   underpass. Use of the culvert and bridge underpasses by other mammals
   increased 81\% and 165\%, respectively. Although deer use of the
   underpasses was much greater than their activity at any of the fence
   ends, there was relatively high deer activity at the fence ends that did
   not tie into a feature such as right-of-way fencing. Our study found
   that the addition of wildlife fencing to certain existing isolated
   underpasses can be a highly cost-effective means of increasing driver
   safety and enhancing habitat connectivity for wildlife. The benefits
   from crash reduction exceeded the fencing costs in 1.8 years, and
   fencing resulted in an average saving of >\$2.3 million per site over
   the 25-year lifetime of the fencing. The results add to the growing body
   of knowledge about effective ways we can use existing infrastructure to
   connect wildlife habitat and increase driver safety.},

Title = {Role of farmer knowledge in agro-ecosystem science: rice farming and

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa) agriculture provides food and economic security for
   nearly half of the world's population. Rice agriculture is intensive in
   both land and agrochemical use. However, rice fields also provide
   aquatic resources for wildlife, including amphibians. In turn, some
   species may provide ecosystem services back to the farmers working in
   the rice agroecosystem. The foundation for understanding the complexity
   of agroecosystem-human relationships requires garnering information
   regarding human perceptions and knowledge of the role of biodiversity in
   these rice agroecosystems. Understanding farmer knowledge and
   perceptions of the ecosystem services provided by wildlife in their
   fields, along with their understanding of the risks to wildlife
   associated with agrochemical exposure, can inform biodiversity
   preservation efforts. In June and July 2014, we used focus groups and
   structured and semi-structured interviews that engaged 22 individuals
   involved in rice agriculture operations in Laguna, Philippines, a
   village close to the International Rice Research Institute in Los Banos,
   Philippines, to learn more about farmer perceptions and knowledge of
   amphibians in their rice fields. We found that many, though not all farm
   workers (managers, tenants, and laborers) noted declines in amphibian
   populations over time, expressed how they incorporated frogs and toads
   (Anura) into their daily lives, and recognized the value of amphibians
   as ecosystem service providers. Specifically, farmers noted that
   amphibians provide pest-management through consumption of rice pests,
   act as biomonitors for pesticiderelated health outcomes, and provide a
   local food and economic resource. Some farmers and farm workers noted
   the general cultural value of listening to the ``frogs sing when it
   rains.{''} Overall, our findings demonstrate that farmers have an
   understanding of the value of amphibians in their fields. Future efforts
   can support how engagement with farmers and farm workers to evaluate the
   value of wildlife in their fields can lead to directed education efforts
   to support biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems.},

Title = {Evaluating common raven take for greater sage-grouse in Oregon's Baker

Abstract = {The common raven (Corvus corax; raven) is a nest predator of species of
   conservation concern, such as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus). Reducing raven abundance by take requires authorization
   under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. To support U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service's take decisions (e.g., those that authorize killing a specified
   proportion or number of individuals annually in a defined area),
   including the most recent one for Oregon's Baker County Priority Area
   for Conservation (PAC), we modeled raven population dynamics under
   hypothetical scenarios with take rates ranging from below to above the
   maximum sustained yield (MSY; i.e., tr(msy) = 0.01-0.60). We fit a
   Bayesian state-space logistic model to estimate abundance based on the
   Breeding Bird Survey route-level count data for the PAC during 1997-2019
   and Great Basin Region (GBR) during 1968-2019. We predicted abundance
   for 2019-2030 and evaluated potential take levels (PTL) for the PAC and
   GBR. Abundance averaged 682 (SE = 93) for the PAC during 1997-2019 and
   333,027 (SE = 20,504) for the GBR during 1968-2019. With take rates
   between 0.41 and 0.60, predicted abundance averaged 308 (SD = 405) for
   the PAC and 142,258 (SD = 53,474) for the GBR during 2019-2030. With
   management factor F = 0.75-2 for takes ranging from below to above the
   MSY, the PTL 50th percentiles were 150-401 yr(-1) for the PAC and
   60,457-161,219 yr(-1) for the GBR. Our modeling framework is flexible
   and can be part of a comprehensive management strategy for ravens in the
   western United States.},

Abstract = {Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a widespread exotic, invasive species that
   pose ecological, agricultural, and human health risks in their invaded
   range. Wildlife managers must manage wild pig abundance and range
   expansion to mitigate these risks. The diversity of stakeholders
   involved in the issue of wild pig management complicates efforts to
   manage the species, and, to be successful, wildlife professionals must
   consider the human dimensions associated with wild pig management. The
   prevalence of privately owned lands in Texas, USA necessitates
   cooperation to enact effective management policies. In this study, we
   investigate the impact of hunter motivations on wild pig harvest
   quantity. Motivations driving wild pig hunting are diverse. While the
   majority of wild pig hunters in Texas are motivated by trophy value,
   meat-motivated hunters harvest more wild pigs per day afield. Wildlife
   managers should develop plans that include various management techniques
   to control wild pig population growth and damage. Education and outreach
   will continue to be important for involving private landowners in
   effective wild pig management.},

Title = {Do urban red foxes attack people? An exploratory study and review of
   incidents in Britain},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-165},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife interactions are believed to be increasing worldwide, and
   a number of studies have analyzed the risks posed by larger carnivores.
   However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as
   threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing
   public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These
   events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate
   intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as
   potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for
   hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15
   residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December
   2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban
   foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not
   more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence,
   although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the
   source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to
   be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the
   incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were
   bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be
   bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds
   inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to
   investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's
   homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data
   suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events,
   possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the
   public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status,
   and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.},

Title = {Synthesis of nest predation impacts of common ravens on sensitive avian
   species},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {350-373},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Decades of mounting scientific evidence have revealed that common raven
   (Corvus corax; raven) population numbers have been increasing across
   nearly all regions of their geographic range in North America.
   Concomitantly, numerous native wildlife species have experienced
   elevated predation rates from ravens as populations have increased and
   expanded their range. Managers are concerned that increased raven
   predation of many threatened and endangered avian species in the U.S.
   and Canada during nesting periods may be hampering species recovery. We
   explored the literature to aggregate existing knowledge and evaluate the
   impacts of raven predation on nests and young of sensitive avian
   species. We used this information to develop a simple relative index for
   each species, the ``Raven Impact Index{''} (RII). The RII incorporated
   the species demographic rates, abundance of ravens in relation to each
   sensitive species' breeding range, and the degree of overlap between
   raven and sensitive prey distributions. We also developed a second
   relative descriptor describing our confidence in each RII, termed a
   ``Impact Credibility Index (ICI).{''} The species ICI was based on the
   number of published studies and the type of evidence presented (e.g.,
   circumstantial vs. direct). We found evidence of nest predation on 8
   sensitive avian species and suspected nest predation on 1 additional
   species. All species shared aspects of nesting biology that suggested
   they would likely be susceptible to raven nest predation. The RII varied
   among prey species, with greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)
   having the highest relative impact values, followed by snowy plover
   (Charadrius nivosus nivosus), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus
   marmoratus), and Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus). Our
   species RII is intended to inform management decisions regarding actions
   that mitigate the negative effects of raven predation of sensitive avian
   species. Although elevated nest predation may be of high conservation
   concern, it is important to recognize that all of the sensitive native
   prey species we established an RII for also face multiple conservation
   threats.},

Title = {Instability of glucocorticoid metabolites in coyote scats: implications

Volume = {14},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Studying physiologic stress responses can assist in understanding the
   welfare of animals. One method of measuring the physiologic stress
   response is evaluating concentrations of glucocorticoid metabolites in
   feces. Previously, using an adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge, we
   found fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels were a reliable indicator
   of physiologic stress response in coyotes (Canis latrans). We determine
   whether glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations remain stable when
   collecting feces over a 2-week period, a timeframe commonly used in scat
   surveys for wild canids. We collected feces from 6 captive coyotes
   maintained at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services,
   National Wildlife Research Center, Predator Research Facility near
   Millville, Utah, USA, and exposed them to the environment for 13 days
   during summer (August 26 to September 8, 2011) and winter (January
   11-24, 2012). Every 2 days, we collected a sub-sample from each
   individual scat and then quantified the concentration of fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites. We found changes in fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite concentrations over the 13-day period, with values increasing
   45-79\% from day 1 to day 3 of sampling. There was also high variation
   in fecal glucocorticoid metabolites among individuals over time. We
   provide evidence that fecal samples collected in the field even 3 days
   after defecation will not provide reliable measures of fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites and thus recommend using only fresh fecal
   samples. We also recommend that, due to high individual variability in
   fecal glucocorticoid metabolites, a large number of individuals be
   sampled when a population-wide assessment is desired.},

Title = {Evaluation of the effect of culling on browse damage by the Japanese
   serow in Gifu Prefecture, Japan},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},

Abstract = {The Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus; serow) is a protected
   territorial ungulate native to Japan. However, locally overabundant
   serow populations can damage forest plantations and agriculture through
   browsing. Despite government permitted annual culling of serows on
   forest lands of Gifu Prefecture, Japan, browse damage continues to be
   reported in hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa; cypress) plantations.
   Sika deer (Cervus nippon; deer), which are co-located with serows can
   also browse cypress, but their impacts have never been evaluated. The
   objective of our research was to evaluate the involvement of each
   species in browse damage and to establish the damage-causing mechanisms
   after serow culling at selected study sites (T1 {[}0.3 ha], T2 {[}0.2
   ha], and T3 {[}1.1 ha]) in 3 cypress plantations in Takayama City, Gifu
   Prefecture, where serow culling was conducted. In 2019 and 2020, 2 and 2
   serows were culled in T1, 3 and 0 in T2, and 1 and 1 in T3,
   respectively. Forestry workers also applied a chemical repellent
   (ziram-based fungicide) to some stands in T3 in October 2019 and May
   2020. Between December 2018 and September 2020, we used camera traps to
   monitor activity patterns of serows and deer and the replacement of
   territorial serows before and after culling. We also investigated
   seasonal browsing impacts between August 2019 and June 2020 by
   thoroughly checking for browsing marks on the terminal shoot. Serows and
   deer accounted for 79\% and 21\% of camera-trap videos, respectively.
   Despite annual culling, serows were recorded at all browsed sites before
   the next growing season. Browse damage was higher in autumn and winter,
   but in T3 it was reduced when the repellent was applied. Management of

Title = {Common ravens disrupt greater sage-grouse lekking behavior in the Great

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Expansion of human enterprise has contributed to increased abundance and
   distribution of common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens) across sagebrush
   (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems within western North America. Ravens are
   highly effective nest predators of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus; sage-grouse), a species of high conservation concern.
   Sage-grouse population trends are estimated using count survey data of
   males attending traditional breeding grounds, known as leks. We sought
   to investigate associations of ravens to sage-grouse lek sites and
   document interactions between the sage-grouse and ravens as well as
   those between sage-grouse and other animals observed around leks. First,
   we used extensive raven point counts and sage-grouse lek observation
   data collected across Nevada and California, USA, from 2009-2019 to
   evaluate spatial associations between sage-grouse and ravens while
   accounting for other environmental covariates. We found that ravens were
   more likely to be observed closer to lek sites, especially as leks
   increased in size. Second, we used a subset of the lek dataset from
   2006-2019 to describe behavioral changes of male sage-grouse in the
   presence of ravens and other predators. Our analysis indicated that
   ravens are attracted to lek sites and were associated with disrupting
   lekking sage-grouse by causing flushes or ceasing displaying behaviors.
   These results suggest that adult and yearling sage-grouse perceive
   ravens as a reason to alter breeding activity, and ravens may adversely
   influence their reproduction during the lekking stage. Additionally,
   standardized techniques to count sage-grouse on leks for population
   trend analyses could be biased low if raven presence during surveys is
   not accounted for.},

Abstract = {We reviewed the scientific literature to inventory existing studies of
   common raven (Corvus corax; raven) ecology in western North America. We
   conducted an intial literature review between June 2015 and March 2018.
   Prior to completing our review, we revisited the published literature
   for any additional relevant studies in July 2021. Our goal was to
   identify knowledge gaps and to synthesize the current understanding of
   environmental features that may support raven populations that pose
   general threats to biodiversity and sensitive species in particular. We
   focused our review on studies with direct conservation applications
   related to 3 processes of raven ecology: occurrence, resource use, and
   demography. We identified covariates that researchers associated with
   these processes of raven ecology, and we also quantified the geographic
   distribution of studies. Our review identified 54 studies, with an
   increasing number of studies published per decade and a geographic bias
   characterized by more studies conducted in the Mojave and Columbia
   Plateau ecoregions than elsewhere. Most studies (44) reported on a
   single ecological process, but 10 studies reported on multiple
   ecological processes. Results related to raven occurrence appeared 31
   times; demographic results appeared 21 times; and resource use was
   reported 17 times. We also identified 13 explanatory covariates
   regularly invoked to explain variation in raven ecological processes.
   Greater attention was given to covariates including vegetation land
   cover, human settlement, recreation, and linear rights-of-ways than were
   used to explain variation in ecological processes. Most demographic
   studies investigated raven reproduction exclusively, but a small number
   of studies considered raven survival exclusively or in combination with
   reproduction. Along with a detailed summary of individual studies
   provided as an appendix, we intend for our findings to serve as a
   reference and to help identify future research priorities.},

Abstract = {The Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) is an endangered
   subspecies of brown bear (U. a. spp.) and is found throughout the
   Himalayan region of south and central Asia. We describe the type of and
   the current level of human-bear conflict (HBC) with Himalayan brown
   bears in the Zanskar region of northern India and suggest potential
   mitigation methods. Between July and September 2018, we interviewed 218
   households across the Zanskar region, all of whom had experienced HBC.
   Participants reported increasing numbers of HBC events in the last 4
   years. The most common form of HBC was damage to granaries where food is
   stored (50\%). As a result of HBC, most participants said they feared
   bears (95\%) and did not like them (73\%). However, 95\% of participants
   thought that the Himalayan brown bear should be conserved. We conclude
   that local people are receptive to bear conservation, but the current
   measures are insufficient to protect property and livestock. We
   encourage community involvement in bear monitoring as well as
   installation of bear-resistant food containers, solar lights, and
   electric fences to reduce incidences of HBC and foster tolerance of
   bears in Zanskar, India.},

Title = {Evaluation of damage to forest tree plantations by wild boar in the
   Czech Republic},

Abstract = {Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in Central Europe have been growing
   long-term, and damages to crops and forests where boars damage freshly
   planted tree seedlings are growing too. In addition to having a
   significant economic impact, these damages worsen the prospect of
   successful restoration of bare land. This study presents an analysis of
   damage to tree seedling plantations caused by wild boar in the Czech
   Republic. We used data from an extensive questionnaire survey among
   forest owners, our own survey of the extent of damage in model areas,
   and experiments in locations with a large boar population. Damage to
   plantings is a widespread phenomenon, and up to 80\% of planted trees
   may be damaged in heavily affected locations. The wild boar does not
   differentiate between bareroot or containerized seedlings or tree
   species. Trees were often simply pulled out, without any traces of
   damage to the root system. Wild boar preferences were not affected by
   the composition of the substrate of containerized seedlings. Seedlings
   were damaged most often during the 4 weeks after planting; after this
   period, the risk of damage fell considerably. Based on the obtained
   data, we estimated that the damage caused by wild boar rooting out
   seedlings in 2019 throughout the Czech Republic amounted to \$3,199,200
   USD, which is equivalent to \$122 USD per km(2) of forest land. As we
   are not currently aware of any method of protection against this damage,
   the most expedient solution seems to be the reduction of the wild boar
   population, as well as to monitor and protect freshly established
   cultures, for a period of at least 4 weeks after planting.},

Title = {Movement behavior of radio-tagged European starlings in urban, rural,

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Since their intentional introduction into the United States in the
   1800s, European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) have become the fourth most
   common bird species and a nuisance bird pest in both urban and rural
   areas. Managers require better information about starling movement and
   habit-use patterns to effectively manage starling populations and the
   damage they cause. Thus, we revisited 6 radio-telemetry studies
   conducted during fall or winter between 2005 and 2010 to compare
   starling movements (n = 63 birds) and habitat use in 3 landscapes.
   Switching of roosting and foraging sites in habitat-sparse rural
   landscapes caused daytime (0900-1500 hours) radio fixes to be on average
   2.6 to 6.3 times further from capture sites than either urban or exurban
   landscapes (P < 0.001). Roosts in urban city centers were smaller
   (<30,000 birds, minor roosts) than major roosts (>100,000 birds) 6-13 km
   away in industrial zones. Radio-tagged birds from city-center roosts
   occasionally switched to the outlying major roosts. A multitrack
   railroad overpass and a treed buffer zone were used as major roosts in
   urban landscapes. Birds traveling to roosts from primary foraging sites
   in exurban and rural landscapes would often pass over closer-lying minor
   roosts to reach major roosts in stands of emergent vegetation in large
   wetlands. Daytime minimum convex polygons ranged from 101-229 km(2) ((x)
   over bar = 154 km(2)). Anthropogenic food resources (e.g., concentrated
   animal feeding operations, shipping yards, landfills, and abattoirs)
   were primary foraging sites. Wildlife resource managers can use this
   information to predict potential roosting and foraging sites and average
   areas to monitor when implementing programs in different landscapes. In
   addition to tracking roosting flights, we recommend viewing
   high-resolution aerial images to identify potential roosting and
   foraging habitats before implementing lethal culls (e.g., toxicant
   baiting).},

Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-143},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Wildlife exclusion fencing can significantly reduce wildlife-vehicle
   collisions. However, some animals breach the fence and become trapped in
   the highway corridor, thereby increasing risk of a wildlife-vehicle
   collision. An emerging solution to this problem is the installation of
   earthen escape ramps (i.e., jumpouts), which allow trapped animals to
   escape the highway corridor. Few studies have quantified wildlife use of
   jumpouts, and none have investigated intraspecific differences in use.
   We used camera traps to document wildlife use of 4 2m-high jumpouts
   associated with wildlife exclusion fencing along Highway 101 near San
   Luis Obispo, California, USA, from 2012 to 2017. We surveyed for 7,361
   nights across all 4 jumpouts, yielding 1,015 visitation events by 10
   different species of large- and medium-ized mammals. Mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) accounted for 895 (88\%) detections; they jumped
   out 20\% of the time when detected at the top of the ramp and were never
   detected using the jumpout to enter the highway corridor. We
   differentiated male and female deer using the presence of antlers and
   found that they jumped out at similar rates, but females were detected 6
   times more often and were more likely to return to the same jumpout. Two
   groups of 2-3 deer accounted for similar to 41\% of deer detections,
   which allowed us to investigate their behavior over time. These results
   indicate that individual variation could influence jumpout use, which
   should be considered when quantifying their use. To increase the overall
   jumpout rate, we recommend a jumpout height between 1.75 and 2 m.},

Abstract = {Traditional trapping techniques for common ravens (Corvus corax; raven)
   require significant effort, often produce low capture rates, and cannot
   be used in some situations. We designed a 3-m noose pole to secure
   ravens from nocturnal roost locations while using a strobe spotlight to
   temporarily disorient them. We collected measures of trapping efficiency
   and contrasted them with padded leghold traps also used in the study. We
   effectively implemented our noose pole method in July and August of
   2018, 2019, and 2020 in the Baker and Cow Lakes sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus) Priority Areas of Conservation in eastern
   Oregon, USA, which yielded trapping efficiency of 0.48 trap-hours/ raven
   (37 total captured ravens). Our trapping efficiency using leghold traps
   during the same summer months was 76.42 trap-hours/raven (3 total
   captured ravens). Our new trapping method constitutes an inexpensive and
   simple way to safely trap ravens at accessible communal roosts and
   merits further refinement to increase utility and capitalize on the
   vulnerability of ravens to capture at night.},

Title = {Population increases of large birds in North America pose challenges for
   aviation safety},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {There is a strong correlation between bird mass and the likelihood of
   aircraft damage during a bird-aircraft collision. Thus, the U.S. Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) has established airworthiness standards
   related to bird mass for engines, airframes, and windshields. Most
   standards use large (1.8 kg) and medium (1.1 kg) birds as benchmarks
   (the empennage and certain large turbofan engines use a 3.6-kg bird).
   There are 20 large (>= 1.8 kg) and 16 medium (1.1-1.7 kg) bird species
   in North America with >= 20 strikes reported for civil aircraft (FAA
   National Wildlife Strike Database), 1990 to 2018. I analyzed the
   population changes of these 36 species from 1990 to 2018 in relation to
   flocking behavior. For the 20 large species, the combined population had
   a net gain of 27.8 million birds (129\% increase). For the 16 medium
   species, the combined population had a net gain of 6.7 million birds
   (20\% increase). Notably, all 9 species with body mass >= 3.6 kg
   indicated population increases. In agreement with the increased numbers
   of birds, the number of strikes involving large and medium birds showed
   significant (P < 0.01) positive trends from 1990 to 2020 as did strikes
   involving multiple birds. The threat to aviation safety from large and
   medium birds, especially flocking species, was much higher in 2018 than
   in 1990. Although progress is being made to mitigate the risk by
   management programs to keep large and medium birds away from airport
   properties, these actions do little to mitigate the threat during climb
   and approach phases of flight. Enhanced airworthiness standards for
   aircraft components, bird-detecting radar to provide real-time warnings,
   and aircraft lighting schemes to improve visibility of aircraft to birds
   are priority areas of research and development to mitigate these
   off-airport threats to aviation safety.},

Title = {A desert tortoise-common raven viable conflict threshold},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {405-421},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Since 1966, common raven (Corvus corax; raven) abundance has increased
   throughout much of this species' Holarctic distribution, fueled by an
   ever-expanding supply of anthropogenic resource subsidies (e.g., water,
   food, shelter, and nesting substrate) to ecoregion specific raven
   population carrying capacities. Consequently, ravens are implicated in
   declines of both avian and reptilian species of conservation concern,
   including the California (USA) endangered and federally threatened
   Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii; desert tortoise). While
   ravens are a natural predator of desert tortoises, the
   inter-generational stability of desert tortoise populations is expected
   to be compromised as annual juvenile survival is suppressed below 0.77
   through a combination of raven depredation and other sources of
   mortality. To estimate the extent to which raven depredation suppresses
   desert tortoise recruitment within the Mojave Desert of California, we
   collected data from 274 variable-radius point counts, 78 desert tortoise
   decoy stations, and 8 control stations during the spring of 2020.
   Additionally, we complied a geodatabase of previously active raven
   nests, observed between 2013 and 2020. Raven density estimates from 4
   monitoring areas ranged between 0.63 (eastern most) and 2.44 (western
   most) raven km(-2) (95\% CI: 0.35-1.14 and 1.33-4.48, respectively). We
   used a Bayesian shared frailty model to estimate the effects of raven
   density and distance to the nearest previously active raven nest on the
   annual ``survival{''} of juvenile desert tortoise decoys (75-mm Midline
   Carapace Length), which we then converted into survival estimates for 0-
   to 10-year-old desert tortoises by adjusting exposure to reflect natural
   activity patterns. At the 1.72-km median distance from the nearest
   previously active raven nest, the estimated annual survival of desert
   tortoises decreased as raven density increased, ranging among
   conservation areas from 0.774 (eastern most) to 0.733 (western most).
   Accordingly, our model predicts that desert tortoise populations exposed
   to raven densities in excess of 0.89 raven km(-2), at a distance <1.72
   km from a previously active raven nest, are not expected to exhibit
   inter-generational population stability, as excess additive juvenile
   mortality is expected to exceed the natural history limits of desert
   tortoise populations. These results also demonstrate that estimates of
   raven density, distance to the nearest previously active raven nest, and
   decoy ``survival{''} rates can inform development of a desert
   tortoise-raven viable conflict threshold.},

Title = {Black vulture conflict and management in the United States: damage
   trends, management overview, and research needs},
Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Contrary to rapid declines of many vulture (Accipitridae, Cathartidea)
   species worldwide, black vulture (Coragyps atratus) populations are
   increasing and expanding their range in North America. Vultures exhibit
   complex behaviors and can adapt to any human-dominated landscape or land
   use. These traits, combined with population growth and range expansion,
   have contributed to increased human-vulture conflicts. Our goal was to
   summarize the current status and trends in human-black vulture conflicts
   (hereafter human-vulture conflicts), review available management
   strategies, identify knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations to
   enhance management and understanding of this species and the associated
   conflicts. We found human-vulture conflicts are increasing in
   agriculture (livestock), private and public property (both personal and
   infrastructure-based), and threats to human health and safety. The
   greatest increases in conflicts were reported in agriculture and private
   and public property damage. Regarding livestock depredation, good
   progress has been made toward assessing producer perceptions of the
   conflicts, including estimates of economic damage and mitigation
   strategies, but a basic understanding of the underlying mechanism
   driving the conflict and advancing strategies to mitigate damage is
   lacking. For damaged property, little information is available regarding
   economic losses and perceptions of stakeholders who are experiencing the
   damage, and most of the tools recommended for mitigating this damage
   have not been rigorously evaluated. Regarding human health and safety,
   recent research quantifying flight behavior of black vultures has direct
   implications for reducing aircraft collision risks. However, it is
   unclear what factors influence roost site selection and the most
   effective means to leverage the sensory ecology of the species to
   mitigate risks. We identify additional knowledge gaps and research needs
   that if addressed could increase managers' understanding of black
   vulture ecology and facilitate enhanced management of this species while
   simultaneously allowing for the species to provide valuable ecosystem
   services.},

Abstract = {The Andean bear (Tremarctos omatus; bear) is endemic to the tropical
   Andes Mountains of South America. Previous assessments predict that bear
   populations will decline by >30\% in the next 30 years. The species may
   face the greatest threats within its historical distribution in Colombia
   where rapid agricultural expansion into natural habitats is increasing
   human-bear conflicts. Between April 2017 and March 2018, we studied bear
   feeding behavior on plantain (Musa sapientum) and banana (M.
   paradisiaca) crops within the Barbas-Bremen protected area in the
   central mountain range of Colombia to describe the magnitude of crop
   damage, economic losses, and spatial distribution of feeding sites where
   human-bear conflicts would most likely occur. We also identified all
   affected farmers and used structured interviews to determine their
   attitudes toward the bears and their conservation. We recorded 237
   damaged plants and identified 57 bear feeding area locations on 9 farms.
   Bear damage consisted of bites to the trunk of each plant and
   consumption of the centers. The damage polygon covered 198 ha, and it
   was located in the northwestern portion of the protected area. Although
   we estimated that <1\% of the total plantain and banana production in
   the area was lost due to bear depredation, surveyed farmers expressed
   negative attitudes toward bears and conservation groups seeking their
   protection. Our research is the first estimation of the magnitude of
   crop consumption by bears and social and economic dimensions of damage
   caused by the species in Colombia. Our research also provides insights
   on how human-bear conflicts may be mitigated in the study area.},

Abstract = {Coyotes (Canis latrans) are now recognized as a permanent feature in
   urban environments across much of North America. Behavioral aversion
   conditioning, or humane hazing, is increasingly advocated as an
   effective and compassionate alternative to wildlife management
   strategies, such as trap and removal. Given a growing public interest in
   humane hazing, there is a need to synthesize the science regarding
   methods, outcomes, efficacy, and other relevant considerations to better
   manage human-coyote conflicts in urban areas. This paper was prepared as
   an outcome of a workshop held in July 2019 by Coyote Watch Canada (CWC)
   to synthesize the literature on aversion conditioning. The paper also
   includes the deployment experiences of members of the CWC Canid Response
   Team. Herein, we propose best practices to enhance the efficacy of
   aversion conditioning for the management of urban wildlife, particularly
   coyotes. We detail recommendations concerning: the importance of
   consistency, adaptability, humaneness, and clear goals; training and
   proactive implementation; and the need for a comprehensive wildlife
   coexistence program. We further detail additional considerations
   surrounding domestic dogs (C. lupus familiaris), public perceptions, and
   defining behavior and conflict. We hope this synthesis will assist
   wildlife managers and local governments in identifying and deploying
   nonlethal human-coyote conflict mitigation strategies that are
   effective, humane, and community supported.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) are increasing globally and contributing
   to the decline of wildlife species. In sub-Saharan African countries
   such as Namibia, most of the suitable land has been or is currently
   being converted to crop and livestock production to support income or
   subsistence agriculture. These changes in land use often incur increased
   levels of HWCs because of crop and livestock depredation by native
   species. To quantify livestock predation risks posed by carnivores in
   Namibia, we deployed 30 trail cameras on a 6,500-ha farm in the Khomas
   region of Namibia from May to July 2018. We developed occupancy models
   to make inferences about the factors influencing presence and temporal
   activity patterns of 2 carnivore species. We found that livestock were
   most at risk from predation by black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) at
   night in agricultural areas and from brown hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea)
   at night in riparian habitats. Our results suggest that farmers can
   reduce HWC risks by implementing animal husbandry practices to include
   protecting livestock at night using methods such as nighttime corrals
   and livestock guarding dogs (C. lupus familiar's)), or herders.
   Increasing livestock producer access to funding (i.e., individual
   donations or governmental agencies) to implement improved animal
   husbandry practices could reduce HWCs.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover
   (Charadrius nivosus nivosus; plover) has declined due to loss and
   degradation of coastal habitats, predation, and anthropogenic
   disturbance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the subspecies in
   1993 as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to the
   population declines and habitat loss. Predation of nests and chicks has
   been identified as an important cause of historic population declines,
   and thus, most predator management actions for this subspecies are
   focused on reducing this pressure. In recent years, common ravens
   (Corvus corax; ravens) have become the most common and pervasive
   predators of plover nests and chicks, especially in areas with
   subsidized food sources for ravens and sites without predator
   management. We compiled data from a variety of sources to document the
   impact of raven predation on plover nesting success. We discuss current
   raven management and suggest several tools and strategies to increase
   plover nesting success, including multi-state approval for the use of
   the avicide DRC-1339, the use of lures and new trap types, and an
   increase in funding for predator management. The lack of coordinated and
   integrated management continues to impede the recovery of the Pacific
   coast plover population.},

Abstract = {Human-snake conflict results in negative outcomes for people and snakes,
   and if left unmanaged, could undermine conservation efforts. One
   approach to managing conflict between people and snakes is to use
   signage to inform members of the public on the presence of venomous
   snakes and measures to prevent snakebites. To be an effective tool,
   however, signs must first be noticed, then read and understood by the
   target audience. As part of conservation efforts targeting eastern
   massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) in southwestern Ontario,
   Canada, we tested the effectiveness of signage at increasing awareness
   of its presence, status and threats, and snakebite prevention. We
   installed 6 informational signs at trailheads in a park occupied by
   massasaugas and conducted a random questionnaire survey of visitors
   during a 3-week period before (n = 51) and after (n = 54) sign
   installation. Awareness of the presence of massasauga habitat increased
   significantly after sign installation, whereas awareness of status,
   threats, and snakebite prevention methods did not change. Our results
   suggest that informational signs were effective, to some degree, at
   short-term information sharing with recreationists in the context of
   venomous snake conservation. This cost-effective approach warrants
   consideration as part of an overall strategy to mitigate human-snake
   conflict.},

Abstract = {The bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) is listed as vulnerable in
   Europe on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List
   because of population declines over multiple generations. Vulture
   population declines have been attributed to shooting, use of toxicants,
   and changes in land use, which have resulted in habitat degradation and
   increased anthropogenic disturbances. Concomitantly, conservation
   authorities have restricted practices deemed harmful to the species and
   have established protection buffers around occupied vulture breeding
   sites to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on breeding
   success. Comor et al. (2019) compared bearded vulture breeding success
   over 6 years within and outside areas with restricted activities in the
   western French Pyrenees and assessed distances between vultures and
   hunting parties. They concluded that hunting was not a threat to species
   conservation and may even benefit vultures by providing alternative food
   resource. We dispute the conclusions of Comor et al. (2019) and present
   concerns about the data used, the study design, and the inferences taken
   from some of the data presented. Herein we provide arguments and
   rationale to support our opinion.},

Abstract = {Homeowners whose landscape plants are repeatedly browsed by white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) desire repellent products that are
   effective and long-lasting. We conducted a 12-week trial from January 6
   through April 5, 2021 to test the duration and efficacy of a novel deer
   repellent (Trico((R))) relative to Plantskydd((R)), a commonly used deer
   repellent, and untreated plants. We placed treated and control Japanese
   yew shrubs (Taxus media `Hicksii') at 4 homeowner sites (Birch Hills
   Drive, Fairview Crescent, Pinegrove Ave., and St. Paul Blvd.) near
   Rochester, New York, USA, where we detected deer presence. Yews are
   frequently eaten by deer during winter and provide a good bioassay for
   testing repellents. To gauge the efficacy of the repellents, we
   photographed the yews and scored the level of deer browsing. We used
   ordinal logistic regression to determine the change in efficacy over
   time. Trico deer repellent reduced deer damage to yews (chi-square =
   97.273, P < 0.0001). Damage to yews treated with Plantskydd did not
   differ from control plants (chi-square = 0.24, P = 0.621) after 12
   weeks. The performance of deer repellents varied considerably among
   sites (chi-square = 109.460, P < 0.0001). Where there was intense deer
   browsing pressure (Pinegrove Ave. site), both repellents failed to
   protect the yews. However, at 3 of 4 sites, the Trico repellent
   effectively protected yews from deer browsing during winter through
   spring green-up in April. We found Trico to be an effective,
   long-lasting repellent for protecting ornamental shrubs from deer
   browsing during winter.},

Title = {Is mitigation translocation an effective strategy for conserving common

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Mitigation translocation remains a popular conservation tool despite
   ongoing debate regarding its utility for population conservation. To add
   to the understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation translocation,
   in 2017 and 2018 we monitored a population of protected common
   chuckwallas (Sauromalus ater) following translocation away from the area
   of construction of a new highway near the South Mountains, Phoenix,
   Arizona, USA. We removed chuckwallas from the construction right-of-way,
   paint-marked and pit-tagged them, and then released them in a nearby
   municipal preserve. We deployed very high frequency radio-telemetry
   transmitters on a sub-sample of 15 translocated adult chuckwallas. We
   monitored the radio-marked chuckwallas once a day at 1- to 3-day
   intervals for up to 46 days to document survival, body mass, and
   post-release movements. The average distance moved following
   translocation was 359 +/- 53 m. Using minimum convex polygons, the
   average home range size of translocated lizards was 0.9 +/- 0.3 ha,
   which was 18-45 times larger than expected for the species. Following
   translocations, we surveyed the translocation sites 1 month later and
   again 1 year later to determine the presence of translocated
   chuckwallas. Translocated individuals were rarely observed a second
   time: in 2017, only 11 of 160 translocated chuckwallas were seen again,
   and in 2018, only 11 of 192 translocated chuckwallas were detected. In
   the light of low recapture rate, consistent loss of body mass, and large
   movements of marked lizards, we conclude that survival of translocated
   chuckwallas was low over a single year. In the future, efficacy of
   mitigation translocation could be better evaluated by assessing the
   spatial ecology of both resident and translocated individuals
   simultaneously using radio-telemetry.},

Title = {SMaRT: a science-based tiered framework for common ravens},

Abstract = {Large-scale increases and expansion of common raven (Corvus corax;
   raven) populations are occurring across much of North America, leading
   to increased negative consequences for livestock and agriculture, human
   health and safety, and sensitive species conservation. We describe a
   science-based adaptive management framework that incorporates recent
   quantitative analyses and mapping products for addressing areas with
   elevated raven numbers and minimizing potential adverse impacts to
   sensitive species, agricultural damage, and human safety. The framework
   comprises 5 steps: (1) desktop analysis; (2) field assessments; (3)
   comparison of raven density estimates to an ecological threshold (in
   terms of either density or density plus distance to nearest active or
   previous nest); (4) prescribing management options using a 3-tiered
   process (i.e., habitat improvements, subsidy reductions, and direct
   actions using StallPOPd.V4 software); and (5) post-management
   monitoring. The framework is integrated within the Science-based
   Management of Ravens Tool (SMaRT), a web-based application outfitted
   with a user-friendly interface that guides managers through each step to
   develop a fully customized adaptive plan for raven management. In the
   SMaRT interface, users can: (1) interact with pre-loaded maps of raven
   occurrence and density and define their own areas of interest within the
   Great Basin to delineate proposed survey or treatment sites; (2) enter
   site-level density estimates from distance sampling methods or perform
   estimation of raven densities using the rapid assessment protocol that
   we provide; (3) compare site-level density estimates to an identified
   ecological threshold; and (4) produce a list of potential management
   options for their consideration. The SMaRT supports decision-making by
   operationalizing scientific products for raven management and
   facilitates realization of diverse management goals including sensitive
   species conservation, protection of livestock and agriculture,
   safeguarding human health, and addressing raven overabundance and
   expansion. We illustrate the use of the framework through SMaRT using an
   example of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) conservation
   efforts within the Great Basin, USA.},

Abstract = {Common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens) are known nest predators that have
   the ability to negatively impact nesting birds, including imperiled
   species of seabirds and shorebirds. We conducted systematic necropsies
   of ravens that were lethally controlled in Monterey Bay, California, USA
   during 2013-2015, in or near western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus
   nivosus) nesting areas, in an effort to better understand body
   condition, overall health, and diet of individual ravens. Raven
   predation of snowy plover nests has increased over the years in the
   Monterey Bay study area, and lethal removal of ravens has been employed
   to reduce predation. Most ravens examined in this study were in moderate
   to excellent body condition and also exhibited good organ health. There
   were statistically significant differences between male and female
   morphometrics (mass, culmen length, and wing length; P < 0.05). Stomach
   content analysis indicated a varied diet with consumption of animal
   remains and eggshell fragments, and anthropogenic sources of food (e.g.,
   human food items and human-produced non-food items). Our study provides
   evidence that lethal control of ravens targeted some individual ravens
   that were responsible for depredating snowy plover nests.},

Abstract = {Common ravens (ravens; Corvus corax), an adaptable, synanthropic
   generalist, have thrived coincident with increasing human landscape
   modifications and fragmentation, consequently affecting their prey,
   which are often sensitive native and protected species. Ravens are a
   conservation concern for the protected western snowy plover (plover;
   Charadrius nivosus nivosus), causing low nest and chick survival in some
   breeding areas along the Pacific coast of North America. We used a
   long-term dataset from a breeding snowy plover monitoring program in
   Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS) to investigate potential impacts of
   ravens on snowy plover nest and fledging success. Between 2002 and 2020,
   ravens accounted for 33.7\% of all plover nest failures and 40.8\% of
   unexclosed plover nest failures. Raven activity varied by plover
   breeding site, with more ravens observed per survey hour at Kehoe Beach
   and the Abbotts Lagoon restoration area, sites that had lower fledge
   success than other breeding areas. Binomial generalized linear mixed
   models found that plover nest success was best explained by raven
   activity (negative relationship) and use of nest exclosures (positive
   relationship). Our model results on snowy plover fledge success were
   less apparent, resulting in difficult management planning for this vital
   rate when using exclosures. Furthermore, nest exclosures were effective
   in increasing long-term snowy plover nest success in an ecosystem
   inundated by high raven activity. Evidence from PRNS and other plover
   breeding sites along the Pacific coast point to long-term negative
   impacts from ravens.},

Abstract = {Levels of biodiversity are globally underestimated, especially in
   tropical ecosystems. This is particularly so for bats compared to other
   mammalian taxa, due to morphological conservatism. Here, we investigate
   West African bats of the Hipposideros caffer complex, an insectivorous
   bat group occurring throughout the Afrotropics. From samples collected
   in Ghana, we aim to resolve the cryptic diversity identified by
   mitochondrial (mt) DNA using nuclear genetic, acoustic, and external
   morphometric data. We confirmed the presence of four previously
   established mtDNA lineages within the H. caffer complex and found
   significant genetic divergence among lineages based on nuclear
   microsatellite data and significant differences in frequencies of
   echolocation calls and morphometric measures. From these new data, we
   conclude that H. caffer complex in West Africa consists of at least four
   distinct species. While the small-sized species from coastal savanna
   could be assigned to H. caffer tephrus, the taxonomic identity of the
   three sympatric, similarly sized species pertaining to H. ruber from the
   forest zone of Central Ghana is yet to be assessed.},

Abstract = {Alopoglossus is a Neotropical lizard genus the taxonomy of which has
   extensively evolved over the past decade. Previous works suggest that
   many species still remain unnamed in this genus. Here, we expand the
   knowledge of Alopoglossus diversity in Amazonian lowlands. Molecular
   phylogenetic relationships, and species boundaries, were inferred based
   on the variation of mitochondrial (Cytb and ND4) and nuclear (SNCAIP and
   PRLR) loci. Morphological variation was assessed through analyses of
   external morphology of 401 specimens, covering the entire distribution
   range of Alopoglossus angulatus and its closely related taxa, and
   hemipenes of five specimens were examined. Combined, our evidence
   supports the recognition of three new species. We describe these species
   and redefine A. amazonius sensu stricto, increasing the number of known
   Alopoglossus species to 18. Our study also presents the first detailed
   descriptions of hemipenes for the genus.},

Abstract = {Parasites are important components of ecosystems, thus identifying
   patterns of their diversity is crucial for studies investigating
   ecosystem functioning, food web structure, trophic interactions and
   epidemiological parameters. Via an integrative taxonomic approach, we
   studied the diversity and distribution of trematodes of the genus
   Plagiorchis Luhe, 1899 in snails in the sub-Arctic freshwater ecosystems
   of Iceland and for comparative purposes in West and North Europe
   (Ireland and Finland, respectively), supplemented by data from Alaska,
   USA, all regions with remarkably few data on trematode diversity.
   Molecular genetic and morphological analyses of 68 samples of cercarial
   isolates of Plagiorchis collected from 3,069 snails belonging to six
   species revealed a total of 16 species/species-level lineages of
   Plagiorchis with five found in Iceland, six in Finland, nine in Ireland
   and five in Alaska. Two species-level lineages found in Iceland, Finland
   and Ireland were reported for the first time; for all
   species/species-level lineages identified by DNA sequences we provide
   the first morphological characterization. Our analysis of the diversity
   of Plagiorchis and their snail host spectrum in Europe provides evidence
   for Radix balthica and Lymnaea stagnalis as primary first intermediate
   hosts. By comparing DNA sequence data for Plagiorchis spp. from this and
   previous studies, we demonstrate no overlapping spatial distribution for
   members of the genus in our material between the continents of Europe
   and North America. We infer that the spatial distribution of Plagiorchis
   spp. is constrained mainly by migratory birds' ranges. Finally, in
   Europe, further research is needed to evaluate whether the diversity of
   Plagiorchis spp. in R. balthica is unique to high latitude ecosystems.},

Title = {Immunoecology of Species with Alternative Reproductive Tactics and
   Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to
   polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual
   two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that
   have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition.
   Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental,
   behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the
   balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being
   immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic
   of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative
   morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex per se from other
   factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first
   summarize the evolution, development, and maintenance of ARTS. We then
   review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS,
   dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological
   hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in
   detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS.
   Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of
   studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working
   with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless
   forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the
   hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has
   generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest
   level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general
   guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated
   predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but
   perhaps they should take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as
   ``immunocompetence{''} and ``androgens{''} might be useful to develop a
   rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated.
   Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving
   deeper into physiology, sometimes at the cost of ignoring their
   organisms' evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful
   framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting
   immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that
   depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being
   increasingly recognized and sometimes applied to species with ARTS, but
   we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the
   effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.},

Abstract = {Hypostomus Lacepede, 1803, is a species-rich and widespread fish genus
   from the Neotropical region, but its evolutionary history and
   systematics remain largely unclear. In addition, species from regions
   with high levels of species richness and endemism such as the
   Northeastern Mata Atlantica (NMA) and Sao Francisco (SF) hydrographic
   freshwater ecoregions are underrepresented in phylogenetic studies so
   far. In this study, we performed a broad sampling of Hypostomus in NMA
   and SF to investigate the interspecific boundaries and phylogenetic
   relationships using a multilocus approach based on one mitochondrial and
   three nuclear markers. Seven genetic groups were found for both
   ecoregions, in addition to one lineage exclusive to the SF represented
   by populations of the species Hypostomus velhochico. Moreover,
   multilocus analyses validated 16 formally described species and two new
   lineages for the NMA and SF ecoregions, as well as putative cases of
   species complexes. In general, lineages with independent evolutionary
   histories were revealed within the same ecoregion alongside genetically
   related groups between NMA, SF, and other ecoregions. These data
   reinforce the intricate scenario of this group of Neotropical fish and
   are useful to outline further phylogeographic studies in Hypostomus.},

Title = {Climate change pushes an economic insect to the brink of extinction: A
   case study for Cyamophila astragalicola in Iran},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline
   worldwide, through shifting or shrinking habitats of species. Predicting
   the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change
   is essential for conservation planning. Cyamophila astragalicola is a
   specialist psyllid dependent on a spiny shrub, endemic to Zagros
   Mountains of Iran. The current study represents a modeling approach for
   lesser-known small invertebrates to assess their threat status.
   Ecological niche modeling was used to assess current suitable habitats
   of C. astragalicola, to develop model-based predictions of its habitat
   suitability under different climatic scenarios, and to assess the
   extinction risk of the species based on IUCN Red List criteria. Results
   revealed a sharp decline in suitable habitats (97.26\% and 99.8\% for
   the years 2050 and 2070, respectively) under the scenario of RCP 8.5.
   Further, under the two RCP scenarios, C. astragalicola was classified as
   IUCN Threat 2. A shift toward higher altitudes with lower temperature
   and higher precipitation was predicted. Results of modeling are based on
   abiotic factors only. Human interactions are not modeled; hence, the
   status of the species may be even more dramatic than the models may
   reveal. Generally, the results of this study indicate the high
   sensitivity of C. astragalicola to global warming. The narrow
   distribution range of the species coupled with the low dispersal ability
   can increase the risk of extinction. Ecological, economic, and social
   risks associated with the extinction need to be further evaluated to
   formulate future management policies.},

Abstract = {Wing interference patterns (WIPs) and wing interference colors have been
   highlighted in taxonomy for their usefulness in the discrimination of
   species, particularly in the case of some parasitic wasps. Here, we
   evaluate the usefulness of these stable structural color patterns as
   species-specific characters in nine species of Aphidiinae (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae) within seven genera including Aphidus Nees, 1819; Binodoxys
   Mackauer, 1960; Diaeretiella StarATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE, 1960;
   Ephedrus Haliday, 1833; Lysiphlebus Forster, 1863; Praon Haliday, 1833;
   and Trioxys Haliday, 1833. Six color parameters including red, green,
   and blue (RGB) as well as hue, saturation, and value were compared.
   Preliminary statistical analysis of color values, as well as a
   qualitative comparison of patterns, were performed. Our findings show
   that both qualitative and quantitative measurements can discriminate
   selected taxa at the genus and species level. Moreover, different
   biotypes of Lysiphlebus fabraum (Marshall) and Aphidus matricariae
   Haliday present identical color patterns (WIPs) with only slight
   qualitative differences. Despite some slight qualitative differences in
   WIPs between sexes, quantitative measurements were not sexually
   dimorphic. This is the first study of its kind in the subfamily
   Aphidiinae and to provide a preliminary WIP-based key to the studied
   species of Aphidiinae. Our findings show that WIPs and WICs are stable
   and can be useful for museum collections.},

Abstract = {Mangroves are an ideal habitat for brachyuran crabs because of
   nutritional and shelter support. Using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling
   technique, we projected the potential global distributions of 10
   dominant species of mangrove crabs from the Persian Gulf and the Sea of
   Oman under future climate change. The highest species richness of
   mangrove crabs was in the Northeast Persian Gulf, including the Strait
   of Hormuz and Qeshm Island, as well as the North Sea of Oman. Our
   results revealed that depth and sea surface temperature (SST) were the
   most important drivers of distribution of mangrove crabs. The most
   potential suitable environments are located along the coastal areas of
   the Persian Gulf, and the Sea of Oman, where the depth is <16.89 m,
   temperature is between 27.70 and 28.08 degrees C, salinity is between
   37.21 and 40.61 PSS, and currents velocity is between 0.01 and 0.05
   m(-1) for the present output models. Future distribution model outputs
   showed that, areas with depth <3.12 m, temperature between 28.53 and
   28.92 degrees C, salinity between 37.21 and 40.63 PSS, and current
   velocity between 0.01 and 0.05 m(-1) were the most suitable environments
   for future potential distributions of mangrove crabs. MaxEnt model
   outputs revealed that five species (50\%) will expand and the remaining
   (50\%) will shrink in their future distribution ranges. The model
   outputs predicted that some of the species might lose their habitat in
   future, and some might invade other ecosystem as invasive species. These
   findings thus highlight not only the vulnerability of mangrove crabs to
   habitat loss, but also alert their potential invasions to other
   ecosystems due to future climate changes. This outcome should be
   considered as a basic guideline for species management of mangrove
   systems.},

Title = {Cryptic speciation in the ``Marshallora nigrocincta{''} species complex

Abstract = {Marine gastropods of the ``Marshallora nigrocincta{''} species complex
   range from southeastern Canada to southern Brazil, comprising M.
   nigrocincta, described from the northeastern United States, and
   Marshallora modesta, from the Caribbean. This study aims to disentangle
   this complex, elucidating how many species are indeed present in the
   western Atlantic, and whether M. nigrocincta is different from M.
   modesta. The mitochondrial markers COI and 16S were congruent in
   splitting the complex into six lineages: one belonging to M. nigrocincta
   (mainly from eastern United States), other two lineages related to M.
   cf. modesta (one from Florida, USA, and the second from Colombia), and
   three undescribed species from Brazil. Intra- and interspecific genetic
   distances, respectively, vary from 0-2.7\%/6.3-13.5\% (COI). The nuclear
   gene 28S was conservative to separate Marshallora sp. A (Brazil) from M.
   cf. modesta 2, but recognized M. cf. modesta 1, M. nigrocincta, and
   Marshallora sp. B (Brazil). The shell morphology is highly variable, but
   the presence of three basal cords seems to occur only in M. nigrocincta.
   The radular morphology exhibits a wide variation in the number of cusps
   of the central and lateral teeth. The new species herein identified will
   require formal descriptions following further fieldwork efforts, since
   the selected voucher material was lost during a fire. New generic
   allocations are made to Marshallora amicorum comb. nov., Marshallora
   pusilla comb. nov., and Marshallora medinae comb. nov., which is
   regarded as nomen dubium. This study may stimulate the incorporation of
   DNA analysis in the systematics of Triphoroidea, improving the knowledge
   about its biodiversity.},

Title = {Follow the Footsteps of Leonardo Fea: An Example of an Integrative
   Revision of Freshwater Mussel Taxa Described from the Former British
   Burma (Myanmar)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Leonardo Fea, an Italian explorer and traveler, sampled a comprehensive
   collection of continental Mollusca during his travels throughout the
   former British Burma (currently Myanmar) in 1885-1887. Cesare Maria
   Tapparone-Canefri, an Italian malacologist, studied this sample and
   published a paper with a description of numerous terrestrial and
   freshwater molluscan taxa new to science. This collection was partly
   deposited in the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova (MSNG), Italy
   and the Indian Museum (ZSI: Zoological Survey of India) in Kolkata.
   Here, we provide a re-analysis of C.M. Tapparone-Canefri's Burmese
   Unionidae collection. Our study reveals that the type series of only
   four nominal taxa described by Tapparone-Canefri as new to science in
   1889 are still available in the MSNG, i.e. Unio rectangularis, U.
   pulcher, U. protensus var. obtusatus, and U. marginalis var.
   subflabellata. The first taxon is a valid species belonging to the genus
   Yaukthwa, while U. pulcher and U. protensus var. obtusatus are
   considered here as junior synonyms of the widespread Lamellidens
   generosus, and the last nominal taxon corresponds to L. savadiensis. The
   MSNG collection also contains shell lots of Indochinella pugio pugio, I.
   pugio paradoxa, Indonaia andersoniana, Radiatula chaudhurii, R. mouhoti
   haungthayawensis, Lamellidens savadiensis, L. generosus, Yaukthwa
   nesemanni, and Y. zayleymanensis, most of which were listed in
   Tapparone-Canefri's work under incorrect names. We revise all the
   freshwater mussel taxa listed by Tapparone-Canefri based on the original
   descriptions, available DNA sequences, morphological data, and
   biogeographic evidence. A freshwater mussel from the Haungthayaw River
   that was identified by Tapparone-Canefri as Unio exolescens is described
   here as Trapezoideus mitanensis sp. nov., a fourth species in this small
   Contradentini genus with a restricted range. Finally, new taxonomic
   opinions are proposed here for Leoparreysia tavoyensis, Trapezidens
   dolichorhynchus, Lamellidens generosus, and Lamellidens savadiensis.},

   for the taxonomy of the genus Makalata Husson, 1978 (Rodentia,

Abstract = {Morphology has been used to establish interspecific limits in echimyid
   rodents. However, using only morphology can be problematic, especially
   for polymorphic or morphologically cryptic species. Recently, combined
   data sources have been used to recognize and delimit species and have
   proven to be especially useful for taxonomic resolutions. Makalata is a
   taxonomically problematic genus that needs revision. Currently, two
   species are recognized: M. didelphoides and M. macrura. A third species,
   M. obscura, is considered questionable. Molecular studies demonstrate
   that diversity in the genus has been underestimated. In the present
   study, we identified 14 subclades representing potential species in the
   genus Makalata using molecular and cytogenetic data. Analysis of species
   delimitation corroborated this hypothesis. Four lineages in the Guiana
   Shield, currently considered to be a single taxonomic entity in the
   literature (M. didelphoides) based only on morphology, were shown to be
   potential cryptic species, differentiated only by molecular and
   karyotype data. We verified that the name M. didelphoides cannot be
   applied to any clade or museum specimen without a genetic approach and
   sequencing of the holotype. We present an amended diagnosis for M.
   macrura through examination of the original description, sequencing, and
   karyotype of topotypic samples allowed us to associate with the name M.
   macrura represented by subclade I in this study. Karyotype data proved
   to be a powerful tool in differentiating the Makalata species according
   to different combinations of diploid number (2n) and fundamental number,
   as for other genera of spiny tree-rats. Our results demonstrate a
   heterogeneous status for Makalata, highlighting the importance of using
   multiple tools to determine the taxonomy of this group and reinforcing
   the importance of molecular and chromosomal data added to the
   morphological data to obtain a more accurate picture of the taxonomic
   diversity of this and other small mammal genera.},

Abstract = {Although necessary to promote conservation, defining evolutionary units
   and naming biodiversity remain a difficult task, especially in
   problematic species groups that experienced a dynamic biogeographic
   history. In this article, we undertake such task for midwife toads of
   the Alytes obstetricans complex by integrating recent molecular studies
   altogether-multilocus phylogenies and population genetic barcoding.
   Despite a partly unresolved phylogeny underlain by deep cyto-nuclear
   discordances, nuclear and mitochondrial evidence support the validity of
   six genuine lineages assigned to two different species (A. obstetricans
   and A. almogavarii), which could be accurately mapped across most of
   their ranges. In particular, we demonstrate the existence for an
   overlooked yet genetically distinct lineage previously confounded with
   A. almogavarii, confined to the northern part of Huesca Province in the
   Spanish Central Pyrenees. We describe this micro-endemic as the
   subspecies Alytes almogavarii inigoi ssp. nov., with reports on the
   mating call and the larvae. Conservation genetics of eight populations
   of this new taxon revealed two independent conservation units, separated
   by topographic barriers. In the wait for upcoming genomic analyses to
   unravel many elusive aspects of the evolution, diversity and systematics
   of Alytes, the present paper offers an integrative phylogeographic
   overview to guide future investigations and generally illustrates how
   multiple lines of molecular evidence can be combined to clarify the
   confusing taxonomy of complex species groups.},

Title = {Evolution of sexual dimorphism in an endemic toad of the Qinghai-Tibet

Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {According to Rensch's rule, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) decreases with
   increasing body size in species where females are larger than males,
   whereas SSD increases with body size when males are larger than females.
   In this study, we examined body size from 15 populations of Bufo
   minshanicus in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in China. We estimated the age
   of the individuals from eight populations to evaluate Rensch's rule and
   possible causes of variation in SSD. After or before correcting male and
   female body size for age differences, the patterns of SSD failed to obey
   Rensch's rule or its inverse, even though fecundity selection in toads
   tends to favor larger female body size. We also found that the degree of
   SSD was positively correlated with the operational sex ratio in the
   field across B. minshanicus populations. Thus, sexual and fecundity
   selection play an equal role driving the evolution of SSD within toads.
   In addition, sex-specific growth rate and age structure explain part of
   the variation observed in SSD across populations.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny and systematic of the Schneider's skink Eumeces
   schneiderii (Daudin, 1802) (Squamata: Scincidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1589-1603},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eumeces is a little-known group of skinks with few phylogenies
   published. Within its distribution range, five subspecies were
   identified for Schneider's Skink (Eumeces schneiderii) based on color
   pattern, pholidosis, intra- and inter-subspecific relationships, but the
   validity of these taxa has yet to be assessed using molecular markers.
   Here, a robust phylogeny of the E. schneiderii group is presented based
   on three molecular markers (Cytb, 16S rRNA, and c-mos) from 80 samples
   collected across Anatolia and the Iranian Plateau. Both Maximum
   Likelihood and Bayesian Inference approaches were used to infer
   phylogenetic relationships within this group. The results revealed
   monophyly of E. schneiderii subspecies and Eumeces persicus. These
   clades also differ in habitat preferences, with the small-bodied,
   striped forms generally inhabiting lower elevations and drier
   environments than the larger, uniform morph E. schneiderii subspecies.
   Molecular-clock dating based on Cytb implies that most speciation events
   took place during the Upper Miocene to Lower Pliocene. A strongly
   supported basal dichotomy of Eumeces schneiderii zarudnyi + E. persicus
   in the southern and eastern slopes of the Zagros Mountains, with the E.
   schneiderii subspecies in the western Zagros, was identified in all
   individual and concatenated trees. Eumeces schneiderii zarudnyi should
   be elevated to species level and, therefore, we propose the name Eumeces
   zarudnyi for this taxon, increasing the number of species in the genus
   to seven described species.},

Title = {The correlation between wing interference patterns and body size in
   Coniceromyia Borgmeier (Diptera: Phoridae) and its implications to the
   understanding of the former as a sexually selected trait},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wing interference patterns (WIPs) are stable structural color
   reflections of insect transparent wings. The WIP colors are the result
   of thin-film interference and vary according to wing thickness and other
   wing characteristics. These patterns have been thought to play a display
   role during courtship. Recent empirical studies concluded that WIPs
   affect male drosophilid attractiveness and that WIP evolution is driven
   by sexual selection. However, these studies did not account for body
   size variation, a variable that has been demonstrated to be sexually
   selected and that may be related to wing thickness and WIP color. I
   consider herein the possibility that body size could be the trait being
   selected in these studies, and not the WIPs, with the latter being
   indirectly selected. A first step to consider this alternative
   hypothesis would be to demonstrate the correlation between WIPs and body
   size. I analyzed whether such correlation exists through the
   phylogenetic tree of the genus Coniceromyia (Diptera: Phoridae) by
   comparing evolutionary models assuming dependent and independent
   evolution of both traits. I also investigated whether WIPs are
   correlated to body size within two species of this genus. Strong
   evidence was found in favor of the correlation between WIPs and body
   size in the tree analyzed and within one of the two species. If these
   results are confirmed as a general pattern, the signaling role of WIPs
   and their direct relation to sexual selection may be questioned by the
   alternative hypothesis that body size could be the sexually selected
   trait in recent studies' experiments.},

Abstract = {We studied molecular variability to clarify intraspecific
   differentiation and phylogenetic relationships in three pine vole
   species (genus Microtus, subgenus Terricola): Microtus subterraneus,
   Microtus daghestanicus, and Microtus majori. Multilocus analysis was
   performed using the entire mitochondrial cytb gene and fragments of
   nuclear BRCA1, IRBP, and XIST genes. Results confirmed separation of the
   species, especially M. majori compared with M. daghestanicus and M.
   subterraneus. These species showed different molecular polymorphism in
   the genetic markers. We identified two close forms of M. majori,
   differing in cytb gene and the nuclear gene XIST; one form inhabits the
   northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus, another the Transcaucasia.
   Separation of M. daghestanicus populations from North Ossetia and the
   others was clear. Microtus subterraneus populations from southern Europe
   and Asia Minor were characterized by maximal genetic heterogeneity; the
   specimen from Samsun (northern Asia Minor) appeared to be most distant
   from the others. Despite polymorphism in the chromosome number in M.
   subterraneus populations from the East European Plain, they possess a
   depleted gene pool. Results indicated that M. subterraneus colonized the
   East European Plain in the Holocene, and chromosome variability
   originated in this part of the species' range as a result of chromosomal
   fission and quick fixation of the arrangement in northern populations.
   We argue that differences in the genetic differentiation patterns of
   Terricola species are mainly due to their ecological peculiarities.},

Abstract = {Interspecific variation in climatic niche breadth underlies many
   ecological phenomena, yet only recently have studies-focused explicitly
   on the evolution of climatic niche breadth. Here, we integrate data on
   geographical distributions, bioclimatic variables, and phylogenetic
   relationships of 18,404 terrestrial vertebrate species to investigate
   the evolution of climatic niche breadth. We demonstrate that the
   evolutionary rates of upper and lower climatic niche boundaries are
   largely uncoupled. For instance, the rate of evolution of low
   temperature limits was nearly twice that of high-temperature limits,
   whereas low- and high-precipitation limits remained relatively constant
   despite a considerable variation in average precipitation. These results
   suggest that the evolution of climatic niche breadth is fundamentally
   different between axes. Finally, we found no relationship between
   climatic niche breadth and speciation rates. The consistency of these
   patterns across taxa suggests that they represent general principles
   governing the evolution of climatic niche breadth.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the intertidal oribatid mite fauna of southern
   Japanese islands revealed the presence of the selenoribatid Arotrobates
   granulatus Luxton, 1992 and two yet undescribed species. The latter are
   herein described as Indopacifica taiyo n. sp., occurring from the
   Southern to the Central Ryukyus, and Indopacifica tyida n. sp., which
   was only found on the most western island of the Ryukyus, namely
   Yonaguni. A concomitant molecular genetic study using mitochondrial COI
   and 18S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrated that the phylogeographic
   pattern of I. taiyo n. sp. reflects recent expansion on the Southern and
   Central Ryukyus, probably due to existing land bridges during the late
   Pleistocene. Arotrobates granulatus, on the other hand, shows three
   distinct lineages, one on Japanese mainland, another on the island of
   Amami, and the third on part of the Central and Southern Ryukyus. These
   lineages are most likely the result of the break-up of a large peninsula
   reaching from China to the Northern Ryukyus about 1.2-1.7 million years
   ago. Despite emerging land bridges in the late Pleistocene, this species
   was not able to expand its range again which indicates very low
   dispersal abilities. Morphometric data of I. taiyo n. sp. show
   considerable intraspecific variation between island populations
   correlating with geography. This found variation is suggested to be a
   result of phenotypic plasticity caused by diverging local environmental
   factors. From an ecological perspective, all three found species are
   classified as intertidal rock-dwellers feeding on diverse algae, whereas
   I. taiyo n. sp. and Arotrobates granulatus occasionally occur in
   mangrove habitats.},

Title = {Testing the phylogenetic hypotheses of Stevardiinae Gill, 1858 in light

Abstract = {The Stevardiinae are a high diverse subfamily of Characidae, the richest
   family of Neotropical fishes. Many species are inseminating (internal
   fertilization) and consequently display diverse morphology of
   reproductive organs and sperm cells. We test the monophyly and internal
   relationships of the Stevardiinae through a phylogenetic analysis based
   on a new set of morphological characters, including reproductive traits,
   combined with publicly available molecular data. We defined 176
   characters from general morphology and primary and secondary sexual
   characters, coded for 54 species. Analyses were made under parsimony
   using a broad range of extended implied weighting parameters. Given the
   different morphological characters we use, this analysis provides
   additional synapomorphies and an independent test for previous
   hypotheses based on morphological and combined morphological and
   molecular datasets. Our final hypothesis is a single most parsimonious
   tree of 6341 steps obtained under three different weighting schemes.
   This recovers the monophyly of the tribes Creagrutini, Diapomini,
   Glandulocaudini, Hemibryconini, Landonini (including Eretmobryconini),
   Stevardiini, and Xenurobryconini. It also supports the recognition of
   the monotypic tribe Phenacobryconini. Insemination is ambiguously
   optimized as present in the common ancestor of Stevardiinae and in the
   common ancestor of all members of the subfamily except for Landonini.
   That reconstruction constitutes a novel hypothesis about the evolution
   of insemination within Characidae.},

Title = {Life on the edge: Tadpoles of Cycloramphidae (Amphibia; Anura), anatomy,

   semiterrestrial tadpoles},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolutionary success of anurans can be partially explained by the
   occurrence of free-living larvae. Tadpoles occupy several distict
   habitats, including the terrestrial environment. Semiterrestriality
   appears to have evolved seven times in anurans, and tadpoles of
   distantly related lineages have converged in a set of phenotypic
   characters, such as a depressed body, ventral mouth, massive,
   well-keratinized and laterally compressed jaw sheaths, low fins, and
   well-developed hind limbs. The semiterrestrial tadpoles of the South
   American family Cycloramphidae remain poorly studied. In this work, we
   perform a comparative analysis of the external and internal morphology
   of these larvae, we comment on the systematic and evolutionary
   implications for the family, and finally, we discuss the convergent
   evolution of semiterrestrial tadpoles in anurans. We studied the
   external, buccopharyngeal, and musculoskeletal morphology of
   semiterrestrial tadpoles of 14 species of Cycloramphidae. These tadpoles
   are highly modified and present several character-states associated with
   semiterrestrial life. Most of them are unique and restricted to the
   family, such as the novel configuration of the muscles subarcualis
   rectus I, rectus abdominis, and levator arcuum branchialium III. We
   propose 13 new synapomorphies for Cycloramphidae and one for Thoropa.
   The presence of similar, homoplastic, character-states in all
   semiterrestrial tadpoles of unrelated phylogenetic lineages seems to
   suggest that these character-states are adaptations for
   semiterrestriality.},

Abstract = {The presence of aflagellate spermatozoa in two species of Kryptodasys
   (Fam. Macrodasyidae), a gastrotrich genus recently described, is
   reported. Their ultrastructure shows common features, which appear
   peculiar to the genus and different from those of male gametes of the
   phylogenetically unrelated Dolichodasys (Fam. Cephalodasyidae), the only
   other macrodasyidan genus known to have aflagellate sperm. Additional
   information on the ultrastructure of the genital apparatus of the two
   Kryptodasys species is given, which confirm the data of the originals
   description and the systematic delimitation of this new genus from
   Macrodasys, which was mainly based on the structure of the reproductive
   system until now. The functional and phylogenetic significance of the
   aflagellate condition of spermatozoa in the two taxa under study and in
   other species is discussed also in the light of the generally flagellate
   condition of functional sperm in Gastrotricha.},

Abstract = {Bats are facing several threats like land-use change, habitat loss,
   overexploitation for food, mortality at wind energy turbine
   installations, disease, and climate change worldwide. Defining
   biodiversity of bat species can help conservation biologists to
   prioritize areas for bat conservation. In this study, we assembled
   distribution records of all bats of Iran to generate the first richness
   map of bats, as no richness map is available for bat species in the
   country. By constructing generalized linear models, we determined which
   historical and environmental factors drive the richness of bat species
   across the country. Results of richness mapping showed that Zagros
   Mountains host the highest number of species in Iran. We found that
   precipitation is the most influential variable in shaping bat richness
   in Iran by explaining 26\% of variation in species richness. Topographic
   heterogeneity, with 19\% of explained variance, was the second most
   important determinant of bat richness. We also estimated bat assemblage
   similarity among the biomes in the country. Temperate Grasslands,
   Savannas, and Shrublands biome was the most distinct biome based on bat
   assemblage. On the other hand, Montane Grasslands and Shrublands and
   Deserts and Xeric Shrublands were the most similar biomes based upon
   distributions of the bat species. Areas that were identified to have
   higher species diversity were regions with high priority for the
   conservation of bat biodiversity in the country. Temperate Grasslands,
   Savannas, and Shrublands, which host the most unique assemblage of bat
   species, have high importance for conservation. Therefore, to enhance
   the conservation of bats and maintain the important ecosystem services
   which they provide, we must have a clear knowledge of their richness and
   essential needs.},

Abstract = {Climate change has essential effects on patterns of population
   persistence, connectivity, and divergence. We used mtDNA sequences and
   species distribution modeling to assess the impact of climatic changes
   in the past (Last Glacial Maximum {[}LGM: 21 Kya] and Mid-Holocene {[}6
   Kya]), recent (1970-2000), and future (2070) on the phylogeography and
   spatial distribution of populations of the Hyrcanian wood frog, Rana
   pseudodalmatina, in northern Iran. Based on two mitochondrial genes
   (cytochrome b and 16S ribosomal RNA), we found evidence for two regional
   patterns that diverged in the Pleistocene (1.6 Mya) and are distributed
   in the eastern and western sections of the current species range.
   Biogeographic analyses support the hypothesis that both vicariance (an
   increase in the Caspian Sea water levels) and dispersal events have been
   involved in shaping the species' genetic structure. Reconstruction of
   the ancestral distribution of R. pseudodalmatina suggests the species'
   range contracted in two independent eastern and western glacial refugia
   during the LGM, expanding from the Mid-Holocene to the present to occupy
   Hyrcanian forests continuously. According to future climate projections,
   the species' range shows a tendency to shift to higher altitudes.
   Landscape connectivity analyses support higher population continuity in
   the central part of the current range, with isolated populations in the
   easternmost and westernmost extremes. Our integrative study of R.
   pseudodalmatina provides support for the ``refugia-within-refugia{''}
   scenario in the Hyrcanian forests.},

Abstract = {The relative roles of different microevolutionary forces, like natural
   selection and demographic processes, in affecting genetic variation are
   of great scientific interest. In this study, we investigated recent
   divergence of the sibling bat species Rhinolophus episcopus and R.
   siamensis, which share a partially sympatric distribution and have
   different phenotypic characteristics among populations. We combined
   neutral {[}microsatellite (SSR)] and adaptive {[}major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-DRB locus] markers to
   investigate the evolution of adaptive markers and disentangle the
   relative effects of neutral and adaptive microevolutionary forces on
   this MHC gene region. Our results revealed a stronger level of genetic
   differentiation in SSRs than in MHC genes of both species, which
   indicates effects of balancing selection on the geographical variation
   of MHC genes. However, we detected significant correlations in genetic
   differentiation between MHC and SSRs in R. episcopus, indicating that
   demographic processes have influenced the level of MHC genetic diversity
   in this species. In addition, significant moderate genetic
   differentiation was detected in sympatric populations and no alleles
   were shared between the two species. Therefore, we speculate that these
   sibling species have been subject to independent adaptive evolutionary
   processes.},

Title = {Phylogeography and Wolbachia Infections Reveal Postglacial
   Recolonization Routes of the Parthenogenetic Plant Louse Cacopsylla
   myrtilli (W. Wagner 1947), (Hemiptera, Psylloidea)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {To reveal the phylogeographic pattern of the parthenogenetic psyllid
   Cacopsylla myrtilli (W. Wagner 1947) (Hemiptera, Psylloidea), we
   sequenced a 638 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene from 962
   individuals. These insects originated from 46 sampling sites, which
   cover a significant part of the northern Palearctic distribution range
   of the species. The sequence data revealed 40 haplotypes, with three
   main (H1, H2, and H3) and 37 derived ones. The main haplotypes H1 or H2
   or both were present at all sampling sites. The star-like shape of the
   haplotype networks indicated recent population expansion. In most cases,
   the derived haplotypes were specific for each country, suggesting that
   the main haplotypes H1 and H2 are of refugial origin, and the derived
   haplotypes have emerged after the postglacial recolonization process.
   Based on the haplotype sequences, we suggest H3 to represent the
   ancestral haplotype from which H1 and H2 have evolved. We suggest that
   the main haplotype H3 together with its derived haplotypes represents
   bisexual C. myrtilli, which shows a limited distribution on both sides
   of the border between Finland and Russia in northern Fennoscandia. The
   genetic diversity was the highest in Sjoa in southern Norway and also
   high in the White Sea region in northwest Russia. Higher diversity in
   Sjoa was attributed to both earlier recolonizations compared to that of
   the White Sea region and the absence of Wolbachia infection. We suggest
   that these sites were colonized from different Pleistocene refugia,
   i.e., from western and eastern refugia, respectively. From the White Sea
   region, recolonization continued eastwards to Ural Mountains and
   westwards to Finland and further north to Kola Peninsula. From northern
   Finland, recolonization continued to Finnmark, Norway, and further to
   Sweden and finally reached a secondary contact zone with colonizers from
   Norway in Central Sweden. The Caucasus and Siberian/Manchurian refugial
   regions have played an important role in the origin of C. myrtilli
   populations in Siberia and the Russian Far East.},

Title = {Evolutionary patterns of cranial ontogeny in Sigmodontines (Rodentia,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2440-2456},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sigmodontines comprise one of the most diverse radiations of mammals.
   The cranial ontogeny has been studied in several mammals, but remains
   poorly studied in the group. We quantified the ontogenetic pattern for
   22 sigmodontine species and 8 outgroups, generating partial
   reconstructions of ancestral allometric growth patterns, and testing the
   role of evolutionary history on cranial ontogeny. Sigmodontines were
   conservative in growth pattern, without unique patterns defining tribes.
   The allometric growth of the cranium was mostly negative, with
   Akodontini being the most isometric and Phyllotini the most allometric
   tribes. Allometry of variables associated with the neurocranium was
   mostly negative, while those linked to trophic functions showed positive
   allometry or isometry. A general cranial lengthening was detected, but
   variables associated with cranial width or height grew at lower rates.
   Cranial growth and development were associated with changes in the
   musculature functionally involved in bite and mastication. Most changes
   occurred in earlier postnatal stages, achieving an early morphological
   optimum. Few changes in the rate of growth at internal nodes were
   detected, and the stasis along the backbone was recurrent. Cranial
   elongation was a pattern widespread in the sample and likely a
   plesiomorphic condition. The few synapomorphies defining the ancestor of
   Sigmodontinae conform to a pattern with zygomatic arches little expanded
   laterally and globose braincases. The conservative pattern may be
   attributed to the biomechanically optimal morphology for omnivorous
   diets, suggesting that the generalized morphology allows the
   exploitation of multiple types of food with minor morphological
   adjustments.},

Abstract = {A phylogenetic investigation of genera and species of the semislug
   family Vitrinidae from Europe, East Africa, Arabia, and Macaronesia is
   presented. Two mitochondrial markers (COI \& 16S) and a set of nuclear
   markers (H3 \& ITS2) were used in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
   inference (BI) analyses. The synopsis of DNA sequence data and
   anatomical data provide a first insight into the phylogenetic
   relationships of these groups. The existence of major groups comprising
   European, Macaronesian, and Arabian-African genera is proven, however,
   their relationship remains unresolved. The sister-group relationship
   between the Macaronesian radiation and a newly discovered East African
   genus Sanettivitrina nov. gen., perhaps a relic of this radiation, is
   demonstrated. The separation of the remaining East African Vitrinidae
   into two clades as hypothesized by earlier authors, viz. Arabivitrina
   Thiele, 1931 and Calidivitrina Pilsbry, 1919 could not be confirmed. The
   hitherto used generic definitions based on genital morphology are not
   able to explain the existence of at least five lineages in East Africa.
   Apparently, Arabivitrina and Calidivitrina morphotypes experienced
   several parallel losses of genital organ appendices.},

Abstract = {Ecology influences the process of speciation. The interspecific
   differences in mammalian skull morphology, induced by environmental
   factors, are important when investigating speciation. In the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the genus Eospalax consists of six species of
   subterranean rodents, each with its unique niche, making it an ideal
   model for studying the relationship between biological evolution and the
   environment. Here, the interspecific differences in five of the six
   extant species (E. cansus, E. baileyi, E. rufescens, E. smithii, and E.
   fontanierii) were evaluated at the morphometric and ecological levels
   using geometric morphometrics, a powerful tool for studying
   morphological variation. The multivariate analysis of variance showed
   significant differences in skull morphology on the dorsal and ventral
   sides in all species. The thin-plate splines showed that the variations
   in skull morphology were primarily in the infraorbital foramen, frontal
   bone, zygomatic arch, occipital bone, incisors, incisive foramen, and
   tooth row. The multivariate regression analysis showed a significant
   positive correlation between skull morphological variations and
   ecological factors; precipitation accounted for the more variations than
   altitude and temperature. Species inhabiting regions with the highest
   altitude, minimum precipitation, and temperature (E. baileyi) had the
   largest infraorbital foramen and zygomatic arch, shortest occipital bone
   and widest frontal bone, smallest angle formed by two incisors, and
   longest incisive foramen. Our study elucidates the relationship between
   skull morphological differentiation and environmental factors in
   Eospalax, while the biological response to the environment detected
   warrants further investigation. Our results can provide references for
   speciation at local environmental scale.},

Abstract = {For over a century, Lepidosiren paradoxa has been recognized as the
   single lungfish species in South America. Previous studies have failed
   to identify morphological differences in lungfish populations inhabiting
   the Amazon and Parana-Paraguay River basins. Here, we report molecular
   evidence of cryptic speciation in South American lungfish. Our analysis
   of mitochondrial gene sequences from 56 L. paradoxa individuals
   collected in the Amazon and Parana-Paraguay river systems revealed that
   genetic distances between individuals from different basins were on
   average 20 times greater than those obtained for individuals that occur
   in the same basin. Haplotype network did not uncover shared haplotypes
   between basins. Additionally, the species delimitation analysis showed
   that the posterior probability for the existence of distinct species is
   highly significant (PP = 0.99961). The phylogenetic analyses (BI and ML)
   recovered individuals from distinctive basins in reciprocally
   monophyletic clades. Our divergence time estimate suggests that the
   Lepidosiren in the Amazon basin are seven million years split from those
   that occur in the Parana-Paraguay basin. On the other hand, in agreement
   with previous reports, our morphological comparison of 20 specimens from
   the Amazon and 14 specimens from the Parana-Paraguay basins revealed no
   distinctive morphological features. The combined molecular and
   morphological results suggest that these two forms may represent cryptic
   species.},

Title = {Cystic Echinococcosis: An Impact Assessment of Prevention Programs in
   Endemic Developing Countries in Africa, Central Asia, and South America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background. Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the tapeworm species,
   Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1), is one of many primary
   neglected zoonoses worldwide. Within endemic developing countries, CE
   has multiple effects on animal and human health and well-being. To
   address such effects, veterinary and human medical sector collaboration
   on prevention program delivery is essential. To begin preliminary
   evaluations of county specific prevention programs, a critically
   appraised topic (CAT) was conducted. It sought to answer: What impact do
   CE prevention programs have on human and animal disease prevalence, in
   populations living in endemic developing countries within Africa,
   Central Asia, and South America? Methodology. The aim was to assess the
   ability of prevention and control program outputs to produce measurable
   differences in health, social, and economic outcomes (e.g., improved
   access to medical services, positive behavioral change, or reduced
   treatment costs, respectively). Included articles were obtained using
   predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria from the four databases (CAB
   Abstracts and Global Health; the National Library of Medicine (PubMed);
   ScienceDirect; and WHO Institutional Repository of Information Sharing
   (IRIS)). The articles were appraised using three checklists: the Royal
   College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the Critical Appraisals Skills
   Programme (CASP), and the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Results.
   Ten articles were selected. Geographically, 20\% of studies were
   conducted in South America, 30\% in Africa, and 50\% in Central Asia.
   For definitive hosts, dogs, CoproELISA antigen testing, before and after
   Praziquantel (PZQ) de-worming, was a primary focus. For humans, who are
   intermediate hosts (IH), disease surveillance methods, namely ultrasound
   (US), were commonly assessed. Whilst for sheep, also acting as IH,
   disease prevention methods, such as the EG95 livestock vaccine and
   de-worming farm dogs, were evaluated. Common to all studies were issues
   of program sustainability, in terms of regular human US screening, dog
   de-worming, and annual sheep vaccination. This was attributed to
   transient and remote human or animal populations; limited access to
   adequate roads or hospitals; few skilled health workers or
   veterinarians; an over-reliance on communities to administer
   preventatives; and limited resources. Conclusion. Despite variations in
   result validity and collection periods, useful comparisons of CE endemic
   countries produced key research and program recommendations. Future
   research recommendations included testing the significance of multiple
   program outcomes in relation to prevalence (e.g., the social outcome:
   behavioral change), further research on the impact of livestock
   vaccinations, and the CE transmission role of waterways and sanitation.
   Program recommendations included calculating and distinguishing between
   stray versus owned dog populations; formal representation of internal
   and external stakeholder interests through institutional organization;
   establishing sustainable guidelines around the frequency of PZQ and
   vaccination administration; improved veterinary-human medical training
   and resource sharing; and combined prevention methods and multiple
   canine disease management.},

Abstract = {The Mesoamerican dry forests (MDF), rich in species and in endemic taxa,
   are distributed nearly continuously nearly continuously along the
   American Pacific slope from Mexico to Costa Rica; however, several of
   the bird species inhabiting the MDF show clear phenotypic
   differentiation recognized through the description of subspecies. There
   are two currently recognized species of magpie-jays of the genus
   Calocitta (Corvidae) distributed throughout the MDF: the monotypic
   black-throated magpie-jay (C. colliei) and the polytypic white-throated
   magpie-jay (C. formosa). These two species have sometimes been
   considered conspecific and have been reported to hybridize in sympatric
   areas, where birds with intermediate plumage characters are recorded.
   Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers from individuals of the two
   species, we analyze the phylogeographic structure and the genetic
   diversity within Calocitta under an isolation with migration (IM) model.
   The results showed strong genetic structure, in which the two currently
   recognized species and some of the C. formosa subspecies grouped into
   four well-supported and reciprocally monophyletic clades. IM analyses
   suggested divergence dates for the split between C. colliei and C.
   formosa that were congruent with geological factors, as well as with the
   deep divergence of the three lineages within C. formosa. These factors
   likely led to a dynamic demographic history in all lineages. We also
   found strongly limited gene flow, null or near null migration values,
   and large genetic fixation and genetic distance values. We suggest that
   the strong genetic differentiation between lineages is the result of
   allopatric differentiation with later secondary contact, further
   supporting a highly dynamic biotic history in MDF.},

Title = {Hidden diversity, ancient divergences, and tentative Pleistocene

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The systematics and taxonomy of the scorpion family Euscorpiidae are
   still unresolved, and, within it, the eastern Adriatic scorpiofauna is
   largely unknown and under-researched. Based on two mitochondrial
   sequences (COI and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear marker sequence (ITS1), we
   put 107 newly analyzed samples originating from the Alps, the Eastern
   Adriatic, and the adjacent Dinaric karst area into phylogenetic context.
   Several species delineation approaches were applied to reveal cryptic
   diversity. Divergence time dating was used to highlight the major events
   in the evolutionary history of the genera Euscorpius and Alpiscorpius.
   The deep intraspecific genetic divergences observed in some clades
   warrant taxonomic revision of several taxa (Euscorpius tergestinus,
   Euscorpius hadzii, Euscorpius biokovensis, and Euscorpius (Alpiscorpius)
   croaticus). In this study, the population of E. hadzii from Lastovo
   Island (formerly Euscorpius carpaticus lagostae) is elevated to species
   level as Euscorpius lagostae Di Caporiacco, 1950, stat. nov. Euscorpius
   croaticus is moved to the genus Alpiscorpius as Alpiscorpius croaticus
   (Di Caporiacco, 1950) comb. nov. The distribution ranges of several
   species are revised, and based on the new data, a more detailed revision
   of species distribution is necessary. We attribute the major divergence
   events to the impact of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, the
   Messinian Salinity Crisis, and the Middle Pleistocene Climate
   Transition. The observed patterns are therefore a direct consequence of
   the geological history and complex topography of the region, which
   provided numerous microhabitats, as well as of the Pleistocene
   microrefugia that enabled their persistence.},

Title = {Locomotor habits and phenotypic evolution of the appendicular skeleton
   in the oryzomyalian radiation in the Neotropics (Sigmodontinae,

Abstract = {Sigmodontine rodents colonized South America in Late Miocene or earlier,
   leading to the clade Oryzomyalia, which rapidly radiated in distinct
   lineages and occupied almost all continental habitats, in a pattern
   classically interpreted as an adaptive radiation. Nevertheless, no
   evidence of strong influence of niche diversification on the evolution
   of cranial and mandibular morphology, or of deceleration in rates of
   phenotypic evolution in these structures over time following niche
   saturation, as expected according to the Ecological Opportunity model,
   has been detected. Here, we investigated morphometric variation among 59
   oryzomyalian species using phylogenetically informed comparative
   analyses for testing (1) if the diversification of locomotor habits
   played an important role in shaping the morphology of the appendicular
   skeleton, and (2) if the disparification of appendicular skeleton showed
   high rates at the early diversification of Oryzomyalia and then has
   deaccelerated. Results showed that the different locomotor habits are
   associated with different shapes in both the forelimb and hindlimb, and
   selection of evolutionary models suggested that each locomotor habit was
   associated with their own adaptive optima. Moreover, the most extreme
   and specialized phenotypes, found in the semifossorial species Geoxus
   valdivianus, Blarinomys breviceps, and Paynomys macronyx, seem to have
   appeared after events of acceleration in the rates of morphological
   evolution. On the other hand, no evidence of a reduction in the rate of
   evolution over time was detected. The results suggest that the
   acquisition of different locomotor habits in oryzomyalians was
   associated with morphological specializations in the appendicular
   skeleton guided by natural selection and that, especially in the case of
   the evolution of fossoriality, there was a marked change in evolutionary
   regimes, generating highly modified phenotypes after acceleration of the
   pace of morphological changes. Despite the strong association between
   diversification of locomotor niches and evolution of the appendicular
   skeleton, the diversification of oryzomyalians does not seem to have
   experienced niche saturation, as noted in some other adaptive radiation
   events on Neotropics.},

Abstract = {We assessed the Chironomidae fauna of Qeshlagh River, the second largest
   running water in the Kurdistan Province of Iran, and a major tributary
   of Sirwan River, using molecular and morphological methods. We
   identified a total of 35 Chironomidae species from the Qeshlagh River.
   Of these, Eraniella kurdistanensis gen. n., sp. n. (Orthocladiinae),
   Cricotopus (Cricotopus) hedayati sp. n., and Tanytarsus ronaki sp. n.
   are new to science. We combined DNA barcodes of cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I gene obtained from the three new species with available
   sequences in GenBank and BOLD. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree placed
   Eraniella as a likely sister group of Parakiefferiella group of genera.
   The ML tree placed C. hedayati in Cricotopus festivellus group and a
   sister group of Cricotopus albiforceps (Kieffer, 1916). The ML tree
   placed T. ronaki as a sister group of Tanytarsus tamagotoi Sasa, 1983.
   This study also identified 11 new faunistic records for Iran and range
   extensions for the Palearctic. The importance of these local faunistic
   studies reflects broadly on the whole country, as the baseline
   information on the taxonomy and biogeography of the Iranian Chironomidae
   is scarce.},

Abstract = {Variation in landscape features plays an important role in shaping the
   distribution of species in natural populations. These can influence
   population connectivity, gene flow, genetic drift, and ultimately the
   genetic structure and diversity of isolated populations. In this study,
   we aimed to identify the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the
   dispersal patterns of the threatened Kaiser's mountain newt, Neurergus
   kaiseri. We integrated population genetics and geospatial data to
   predict the rates and patterns of genetic differentiation as well as to
   identify potential movement corridors among populations. For this
   purpose, we used two mitochondrial DNA markers and combined data on
   genetic subdivision (theta(ST)) and least-cost path (LCP) analyses from
   15 fragmented highland streams and spring-ponds representing the entire
   species distribution area. Five possible dispersal routes used in this
   study were straight-line, stepping-stone, least cost slope, stream
   likelihood and combination least cost slope/stream likelihood. Genetic
   and LCP analyses indicated that two clades in the northern and southern
   distribution range have experienced two differing dispersal routes. The
   newts identified through the northern populations with high genetic
   diversity have dispersed with stepping-stone movements. In contrast, the
   southern populations are more isolated and dispersal might be
   facilitated by aquatic corridors in the least cost slope. We suggest
   that this study allows new implications for the conservation priorities
   of N. kaiseri by estimating the potential dispersal activity of the
   species in the face of climate change and ongoing habitat destruction
   relating to human activities in the southern Zagros mountains of Iran.},

Abstract = {The nominal species referred to the endemic southern South American
   genus Buccinanops are revised, clarifying the definition of
   Buccinanopsinae. All valid Recent species are redescribed based on type
   material and other specimens emphasizing anatomy and illustrated using
   SEM photographs of radulae, embryos, and shell ultrastructure. Only
   seven of 13 nominal species described are considered valid: Buccinanops
   cochlidium (Dillwyn, 1817) (type species); B. latus sp. nov. (formerly
   B. gradatus or B. lamarckii from Brazil only); B. monilifer (Kiener,
   1834); B. deforme (King, 1832); B. paytense (Kiener, 1834); B.
   uruguayense (Pilsbry, 1897) and B. duartei Klappenbach, 1961. A
   phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters of these species
   and 12 other buccinoideans is carried out in order to compare results
   with recent DNA sequence approaches. The ingroup cladogram is ((B.
   monilifer (B. latus-B. cochlidium)) (B. duartei (B. uruguayense (B.
   deforme-B. paytense)))). The former genus Buccinanops, supported by 11
   synapomorphies, can be divided, and Buccinastrum gen. nov. (3
   synapomorphies of support) is introduced for the 4 latter species in the
   above cladogram; its type species is Buccinastrum deforme. Buccinanops
   (8 synapomorphies) is thus restricted to B. cochlidium, B. monilifer,
   and B. latus, which are large-sized, living in relative deep waters
   (subtidal), while Buccinastrum includes small-sized species mostly
   restricted to the intertidal zone. The analysis of morphological
   characters is suggestive of a traditional subfamily Dorsaninae, with 12
   synapomorphies, including four genera-Dorsanum, Bullia, Buccinanops, and
   the new Buccinastrum, but this result is only informative, as it has
   been considered paraphyletic in a DNA sequence approach, being
   subdivided into Dorsaninae, Buccinanopsinae, and Buliinae.},

Title = {Genetic structure, morphological variation, and gametogenic

Abstract = {The edible frog, Pelophylax esculentus, is a hybrid form that reproduces
   via clonal propagation of only one of the parental genomes through
   generations of hybrids while the genome of other parental species is
   eliminated during gametogenesis. Such reproductive ability requires
   hybrids to coexist with one of the parental species or rarely both
   parental species causing the formation of so-called population systems.
   Population systems and reproductive biology of water frogs from the east
   of the range remained partially unexplored. In this study, we
   investigated the distributions, population systems, genetic structure,
   types of gametes, and morphological variability of water frogs of the
   genus Pelophylax from the northeastern parts of their ranges (Mari El
   Republic and adjacent territories, Russia). We examined 1,337
   individuals from 68 localities using morphological traits combined with
   DNA flow cytometry and a multilocus approach (fragments of a nuclear and
   two mitochondrial genes). We revealed five types of population systems:
   ``pure{''} populations of the parental P. ridibundus (R) and P. lessonae
   (L), mixed populations of parental species (R-L) along and with their
   hybrids (R-E-L), as well as mixed populations of P. lessonae and P.
   esculentus (L-E). However, the ``pure{''} hybrid (E) and the mixed P.
   ridibundus and P. esculentus (R-E) population systems were not found.
   All hybrids studied by DNA flow cytometry were diploid. Analysis of
   gametogenesis showed that the majority of hybrid males, as well as
   hybrid females from the L-E system, produced gametes with the P.
   ridibundus genome. However, in the R-E-L system, hybrid females were
   usually sterile. The reproduction of hybrids in such systems is
   primarily based on crosses of P. esculentus males with P. lessonae
   females. Molecular analysis showed the presence of mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA introgression of the Anatolian marsh frog (P. cf. bedriagae)
   into both P. ridibundus and P. esculentus. The observations of alleles
   and haplotypes of P. cf. bedriagae in P. ridibundus and P. esculentus
   individuals from the same localities suggest de novo formation of local
   hybrids. However, the presence of the Balkan marsh frog (P.
   kurtmuelleri) haplotypes in local hybrids supports the hypothesis
   regarding the migration of old hemiclonal lineages from glacial refugia.
   Finally, the diagnostic value of various morphological characteristics
   was discussed.},

Title = {Massive LINE-1 retrotransposon enrichment in tamarins of the Cebidae
   family (Platyrrhini, Primates) and its significance for genome evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {To study heterochromatin distribution differences among tamarins, we
   applied LINE-1 probes using fluorescence in situ hybridization onto
   chromosomes of Saguinus mystax, Leontocebus fuscicollis, and
   Leontopithecus rosalia with the aim to investigate possible evolutionary
   implications. LINE-1 repeats were shown to be involved in genome
   architecture and in the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements in many
   vertebrates. We found bright LINE-1 probe signals at centromeric or
   pericentromeric areas, GC rich, on almost all chromosomes in three
   tamarin species. We also found non-centromeric signals along chromosome
   arms. In a phylogenetic perspective, we analyzed the pattern of LINE-1
   distribution considering human chromosomal homologies and C banding
   patterns. Our data indicate that LINE-1 centromeric expansions and
   accumulation presumably arose in a common tamarin ancestor and that the
   presence of LINE-1 at the junction of human chromosome associations is
   presumably linked to interchromosomal rearrangements. For example, we
   found bright centromeric signals as well as non-centromeric signals on
   chromosomes 1 and 2, in all species analyzed, in correspondence to human
   chromosome associations 13/9/22 and 20/17/13, which are synapomorphic
   for all tamarins. Furthermore, we found other faint signals that could
   be apomorphisms linked both to intrachromosomal rearrangements as well
   as to retro-transposition events. Our results confirm that the three
   species have similar karyotypes but small differences in LINE-1 and
   heterochromatin amplification and distribution; in particular on
   chromosome pairs 19-22, where we show the occurrence of small
   inversions, in agreement with previous classic cytogenetic hypotheses.},

Title = {Systematics of the oil bee genus Lanthanomelissa (Apidae:
   Tapinotaspidini) and its implications for the biogeography of South
   American grasslands},

Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Lanthanomelissa has an uncertain taxonomic history, and was formerly
   treated either as an independent genus or as a subgenus of Chalepogenus.
   It is endemic to southern South American grasslands, an endangered and
   poorly known environment. We aimed to understand the origin of these
   bees in time and space, the influence of Quaternary climatic
   fluctuations on their current distribution, and the possible link to the
   southern South American grasslands' history. We inferred phylogenetic
   relationships in Lanthanomelissa using 37 specimens from all six species
   and 3430 nucleotides of three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes and
   estimated divergence times and ancestral geographic range. We modeled
   species distribution for the current and two past climatic scenarios
   (LIG, similar to 120 kya, and LGM, similar to 21 kya), performing an
   ensemble with three algorithms in a dataset of 192 georeferenced
   occurrence points using 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables. The results
   support the monophyly of the genus and taxonomic changes, including the
   species Lanthanomelissa parva n. comb., and the treatment of the
   goeldianus group of Chalepogenus as the genus Lanthanella.
   Lanthanomelissa originated at the Oligocene-Miocene border in the
   Chacoan-Pampean region, and the glacial-interglacial models indicate
   expansion in the Last Glacial Maximum and retraction in the Last
   Interglacial. This origin was approximately synchronized with their
   exclusive floral host, Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae). The diversification of
   Lanthanomelissa supports the estimated austral expansion of the
   ancestral southern grasslands in South America before the origin of
   Cerrado during the late Miocene. Expansion and retraction in
   distribution during the last glacial-interglacial indicate grasslands
   distributional shifts through climate cooling and warming periods.},

Abstract = {The causes of population genetic divergence within the Atlantic Forest
   of South America are diverse. For example, studies have pointed to the
   importance of regions of stable suitable habitat throughout the
   Pleistocene, large rivers acting as biogeographic barriers, as well as
   changes in elevation. Here, we generate a phylogeographic dataset for
   the Rio Doce Snouted Treefrog (Ololygon carnevallii), a species that is
   endemic to a narrow portion of the Atlantic Forest. Gene-tree analyses
   demonstrate that this species is composed of three distinct lineages
   that diverged from one another during the Pliocene. Ecological niche
   models projected to climate during the Pleistocene and mid-Holocene
   suggest that regions of suitable habitat would have shifted through time
   since the last glacial maximum, and regions of stable habitat were
   identified. Using generalized dissimilarity modeling, we find no
   association between genetic divergence and ecological niche models,
   riverine barriers, elevation, slope, or current climate suggesting that
   none of these variables have been responsible for lineage formation in
   the Rio Doce Snouted Treefrog. We suggest that additional
   phylogeographic studies of narrowly endemic species within the Atlantic
   Forest are needed to better understand the drivers of diversification
   and accumulation of biodiversity.},

Title = {A comprehensive appraisal of evolutionary diversity in venomous Asian
   coralsnakes of the genus Sinomicrurus (Serpentes: Elapidae) using

Abstract = {While species boundaries between conspicuously divergent populations of
   the medically important snake genus Sinomicrurus are well established,
   instances of erratic chromatic and meristic variation continue to
   confound taxonomists, since the mid-1800s. This predicament can be
   attributed to an inadequate molecular phylogenetic framework and the
   lack of a comprehensive taxonomic representation of geographic variants.
   Here, we revisit lineage delineation in this genus, drawing cohesive
   evidence from a plurality of data and analysis types, including a
   promising, yet taxonomically under-utilized, supervised machine learning
   algorithm (random forest). Overall, this study incorporates data
   generated by molecular analyses as well as morphometrics and comparative
   anatomy based on 236 specimens from 28 different natural history
   collections examined by us, and an additional 161 records from 47 other
   sources. Our results indicate several very divergent evolutionary
   lineages concealed as subspecies. Thus, to better reflect this
   phylogenetic diversity, we raise S. macclellandi iwasakii from the
   southern Ryukyus and S. m. swinhoei from Taiwan to full species, and
   resurrect S. annularis. We highlight the need to distinguish at species
   level the current subspecies of S. japonicus, namely as, S. japonicus
   and S. boettgeri, and provide diagnostic characters to that end. On the
   other hand, given unpersuasive support of lineage independence, we sink
   Taiwanese S. hatori into S. sauteri and S. nigriventer into S.
   macclellandi. We also meticulously redescribe S. peinani from mainland
   China and Vietnam based on a substantial number of additional specimens,
   while synonymizing the recently described S. houi under S. kelloggi. We
   conclude with a discussion on the role of regional biogeography as a
   primary driver of cladogenesis in the genus.},

Abstract = {Many land snail taxa have undergone speciation in the Ryukyu Islands and
   Taiwan in East Asia. We examined the shell, radular, and genital
   morphology, and mitochondrial phylogeny of two described Sicradiscus
   species distributed in Miyako Island and Taiwan, and the newly
   discovered Sicradiscus pallgergelyi sp. nov. from Iriomote Island.
   Canonical variate analysis based on adult shell measurements indicated
   that S. pallgergelyi sp. nov. and the Taiwanese Sicradiscus ishizakii
   had more similar shell measurements, whereas S. pallgergelyi sp. nov.
   shared common characteristics of shell sculpture with the Japanese
   Sicradiscus hirasei. The leave-one-out cross-validation results
   correctly classified 100\%, 71.4\%, and 88.0\% of S. hirasei, S.
   ishizakii, and S. pallgergelyi sp. nov., respectively. The radular and
   genital morphology was similar in these three species. Moreover,
   molecular phylogenetic analyses showed monophyly of the three species,
   although the Japanese lineages were more closely related to each other
   than to the Taiwanese species. Accordingly, the characteristics of shell
   sculpture are common traits of the two Japanese species, and these
   findings indicate that shell morphology has significantly diverged in
   Japan. The different apertural callus lengths among the three species
   may be an adaptation to predators, and shell flatness may reflect
   interspecific differences in microhabitats.},

Abstract = {Parasite species lacking a free-living stage rely on their hosts for
   dispersal. Their population genetic structure depends on the host's
   vagility and dispersal rate. To gain more insight into the drivers
   responsible for shaping the spatio-temporal population structure in
   host-parasite systems, we used mitochondrial DNA sequences to compare
   patterns of genetic diversity in two closely related and
   contact-transmitted parasitic wing mites Spinturnix psi and S. myoti
   with their bat hosts Miniopterus pallidus and Myotis blythii,
   respectively, across vast distances in Iran. We observed almost no
   genetic differentiation between mites living on bats in different
   colonies even from distant locations, whereas we found some level of
   genetic differentiation and isolation by distance in each host species,
   particularly in the less vagrant M. blythii. Despite Iran's high spatial
   divergence and long distance between the sampled locations, local
   genetic diversity and inter-population gene flow in the parasites were
   high, even between different sides of the Zagros and Alborz Mountains.
   The genetic similarity that was observed among mite populations likely
   reflects genetic exchanges between colonies at swarming places of bats,
   as well as the possible occupation of other host species, resulting in a
   higher effective population size and more dispersal opportunities for
   the mites.},

Abstract = {The islands of Trinidad and Tobago form a southern extension of the
   Lesser Antilles. Unlike the continental island of Trinidad, the more
   northerly Tobago formed as an older oceanic island volcanic arc. Their
   reptile biodiversity reflects colonization events from the South
   American mainland through land bridge connections at times of glacial
   maxima. Most of Tobago's herpetofauna has colonized through
   stepping-stone events from Trinidad. However, the enigmatic presence of
   a rare and poorly known fossorial snake in Tobago, Western Venezuela and
   Colombia, but absent in Trinidad and Eastern Venezuela, raises
   interesting questions regarding its biogeography, mode and timing of
   colonization of the island. Here, we sequence for the first time gene
   fragments from three individuals from Western Venezuela and one from
   Tobago and include them in the largest phylogeny of Atractus to date. We
   validate the monophyly of the species based on morphology and molecular
   data, with an unexpected low genetic divergence between island and
   mainland specimens. Despite more than 1000 km separating them, our time
   tree indicates a mean 550,000 year divergence. We examine alternative
   scenarios to explain the biogeography and conclude on an ancient
   corridor of coastal land bridges at times of very low (>100 m) sea-level
   falls that connected Venezuela to Tobago.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Pherusellid ctenostomes are a little-investigated clade of bryozoans
   comprising three described species that are usually distinguished by
   their different peristome sizes. In this study, the entire family of
   Pherusellidae is revised with description of two new species, Pherusella
   minima from the Mediterranean Sea and Pherusella liowae from Singapore.
   Serial semithin sections and 3-D reconstruction are used for the first
   time on an entire family of bryozoans. Soft-tissue morphology yields
   numerous characters such as details of the digestive tract, duplicature
   bands, and pore-plate structure that are useful and necessary for
   species identification. Cystid characters alone are regarded as
   insufficient for proper species recognition. Numerous previous studies
   have reported Pherusella tubulosa from Asia, but probably have
   misidentified this species. Hence, it appears to be restricted to the
   Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we suggest Pherusella
   brevituba only occurs in the Pacific Ocean and is not an alien species
   to the Mediterranean Sea, as previously suggested. We conclude that
   previous records most likely belong to the new species P. minima, which
   itself is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea.},

Abstract = {The integration of morphological data and data from molecular genetic
   markers is important for examining the taxonomy of meiofaunal animals,
   especially for eutardigrades, which have a reduced number of
   morphological characters. This integrative approach has been used more
   frequently, but several tardigrade taxa lack molecular confirmation.
   Here, we describe Crenubiotus ruhesteini sp. nov. from the Black Forest
   (Germany) integratively, with light and electron microscopy and with
   sequences of four molecular markers (18S, 28S, ITS2, cox1 genes).
   Molecular genetic markers were also used to confirm the recently
   described Crenubiotus genus and to establish its phylogenetic position
   within the Macrobiotoidea (Eutardigrada). The erection of Crenubiotus
   and its place in the family Richtersiidae are confirmed. Richtersiidae
   is redescribed as Richtersiusidae fam. nov. because its former name was
   a junior homonym of a nematode family.},

Abstract = {The Peloponnese wall lizard, Podarcis peloponnesiacus, is endemic to the
   Peloponnese. Although the phylogeny and species diversity of the Balkan
   species of Podarcis have been extensively studied, the intraspecific
   relationships of P. peloponnesiacus are not yet well defined. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the intraspecific diversity in this
   species and clarify its taxonomic status by analyzing eight gene
   fragments (two mitochondrial and six nuclear) and several morphological
   traits, typically used for systematic inferences within the genus
   Podarcis. Together with ecological niche modeling, we provided an
   integrative evaluation of the differentiation between lineages. The
   combination of several phylogenetic, species delimitation, and
   chronophylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of two highly
   supported and divergent clades with a distinct geographical and
   parapatric distribution and high niche overlap. The differentiation of
   the two clades dates back to the Pleistocene and is probably correlated
   with the paleogeography of the Peloponnese. These clades also differed
   in several phenotypic traits, which, however, exhibit extensive overlap
   and are not fully diagnostic. The combination of the above results
   allowed us to identify the two revealed clades as distinct species.},

Abstract = {The genus Aulopyge, represented by a single species, the Dalmatian
   barbelgudgeon, Aulopyge huegelii, is an endemic genus with very
   restricted distribution range comprising several rivers in southern
   Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this study, molecular genetic
   analyses based on three molecular markers (one nuclear and two
   mitochondrial) were performed to confirm the position of Aulopyge within
   Cyprinidae, obtain data on its evolutionary history, and describe its
   population genetic structure and diversity. Specimens of A. huegelii
   were obtained throughout the distribution range. Phylogenetic
   reconstruction corroborated the independent position of this species and
   its placement within the Barbinae subfamily. The evolutionary history of
   A. huegelii started already in the middle Oligocene, whereas
   intraspecific divergences that left a trace in its current genetic
   structure and diversity are of much younger origin, starting in the
   middle Pleistocene. Unlike in other cypriniform species and genera
   distributed in the Dinaric karst region, there is no significant
   structuring within A. huegelii, or distribution of haplotypes concordant
   with the geographic scale. Furthermore, low effective population sizes
   estimated for most populations and low genetic diversities within them
   raise strong concerns about the viability and future survival of this
   endemic species.},

Title = {Diversity, distribution, and evolutionary history of the most studied
   African rodents, multimammate mice of the genus Mastomys: An overview

Abstract = {Despite the importance of rodents as agricultural pests and reservoirs
   of zoonoses, the taxonomy and evolutionary history of many groups is
   still not sufficiently understood. The genus Mastomys (multimammate mice
   or rats) comprises abundant and intensively studied rodents, widespread
   across sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we used an extensive dataset of
   mitochondrial DNA markers comprising of nearly 2700 individual sequences
   from 30 African countries to update the information about the
   geographical distribution of their genetic diversity. In the next step,
   we sequenced complete mitogenomes, six nuclear markers, and produced
   anchored phylogenomic data (355 loci) and, for the first time,
   sufficiently resolved phylogenetic relationships among all extant
   Mastomys species and reconstructed their evolutionary history. The
   results suggest eight species of Mastomys occupying various non-forested
   environments. Some species are very widespread (Mastomys natalensis,
   Mastomys kollmannspergeri, and Mastomys erythroleucus; for the latter we
   provide first records from Tanzania, thus significantly extending its
   distribution), while others have their distribution restricted to
   particular geographical areas (Mastomys coucha in South African region,
   Mastomys awashensis in Ethiopia, and Mastomys angolensis in Angola and
   southern DRC) or to particular habitat, that is, wetlands in western
   (Mastomys huberti) or southwestern (Mastomys shortridgei) Africa. The
   first split separating M. angolensis (with five pairs of mammae only)
   from remaining multimammate taxa occurred in mid-Pliocene, but the most
   intensive radiation occurred in mid-Pleistocene and was likely driven by
   the intensification of climate oscillations. The resolved phylogeny of
   Mastomys will facilitate their further use as model taxa, for example,
   in understanding proximate mechanisms of evolution of the multimammate
   phenotype.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview on troglobitic springtails found in
   European caves, including a checklist at species level. The paper also
   reviews what is currently known about Collembola, which occur in caves
   of the most important mountain ranges in Europe. Only troglobitic
   species were included since many troglophiles were of uncertain
   ecological status. A total of 338 troglobitic species of Collembola is
   recorded from European caves, distributed across 12 families. Spain and
   France appear to host the highest richness of species, including
   endemics. From a biogeographic perspective, troglobitic species are
   unevenly distributed in Europe, especially in the most important
   mountain ranges, like the Alps, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees, the
   Caucasus, and other European mountains. Troglobitic springtails are far
   more abundant in temperate zones than in the tropics. Despite this,
   several genera of Collembola appear to be well represented, while some
   are poorly represented (or lacking) in European caves. Many advances in
   knowledge of subterranean springtails have been made, particularly in
   the description of new species. However, there are still major gaps in
   the knowledge of the biology, environmental requirements, and impacts on
   subterranean fauna. This paper highlights the need for further research
   and provides baseline data for such efforts.},

Abstract = {Highlands are the most heterogeneous and complex biogeographic regions
   of Mexico. Species inhabiting these regions have been exposed to
   geologic events and climatic fluctuations in the past causing limited
   historical gene flow that resulted in structured genetic variation and
   high endemism. We examined the genetic variation of the mouse Peromyscus
   hylocetes throughout its geographic distribution within the
   Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB), to estimate its current environmental
   suitability, habitat connectivity, and to reconstruct its evolutionary
   history by inferring the role of past events and abiotic factors. Two
   main genetic clusters corresponding to the west and east range of the
   species distribution were detected. Gene flow occurred largely from the
   west to the east cluster. Peromyscus hylocetes and P. aztecus diverged
   during the Pliocene-Pleistocene at the central-south region of the TVB.
   We hypothesized that after this divergence, P. hylocetes colonized the
   TVB during the Pleistocene and later expanded its distribution to the
   western TVB. Due to the climatic oscillations in the late Pleistocene,
   populations were restricted in western TVB during the warmer periods,
   and displacements occurred during colder periods from the west to the
   central TVB on several episodes.},

Abstract = {We review the Atractus snethlageae species complex based on the

   new species previously assigned to it in the literature and natural
   history collections. Two of them are diagnosed through both phenotypic
   (meristic, morphometric, color pattern, and male genital structure) and
   molecular (phylogeny) evidence, while the other two are recognized on
   the basis of morphological characters only. We show that some Amazonian
   lowland species have more restricted ranges. The area covering the
   eastern portion of the state of Para and western portion of the state of
   Maranhao in Brazil harbors restricted endemism for Atractus. This
   biogeographically important region is also the most threatened within
   Amazonia. Finally, we discuss the expected changes in the taxonomy of
   ground snakes with more robust hypotheses based on well-sampled

Abstract = {The Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) are operational species units based on
   patterns of COI divergences that in most cases correspond to species. It
   has been repeatedly observed that more than one BIN can be found under
   the same species name particularly when large geographic scales are
   considered. One such case concerns Eupithecia conterminata, a species
   widespread in North European countries and restricted to mountainous
   regions in the rest of the continent, for which five BINs are found in
   Europe. In order to solve the question concerning the taxonomic status
   of these BINs and European populations, we employed an integrated
   approach by combining classical morphological traits (genitalia and wing
   markings) with those of molecular data, the latter involving both
   mitochondrial and nuclear genes. This approach allowed us to recognize
   two valid species in Europe, E. conterminata, currently known only in
   Fennoscandia, Baltic countries and Russia, and Eupithecia manniaria sp.
   rev., with distribution covering Central and South European countries.
   We furthermore synonymized Eupithecia pindosata syn. nov. from Greece
   with E. manniaria. The European range of these species and their
   mitochondrial diversity appear to be coherent with biogeographical
   histories of their foodplants Picea abies and Abies species.},

Abstract = {The distribution and diversification processes of freshwater fishes have
   been influenced by tecto-volcanic and climatic events that have in turn
   promoted genesis, destruction, and numerous changes in the drainage
   networks, leaving complex phylogeographic patterns in the ichthyofauna
   of highly dynamic regions such as central Mexico. In this study, we
   evaluated the evolutionary history of the Aztec shiner Aztecula sallaei,
   which is distributed in currently isolated drainages in the highlands of
   central Mexico, performing phylogenetic, biogeographic, and
   phylogeographic analyses using three genes: the mitochondrial cytb and
   two nuclear genes, S7 and ACTB. The studied populations show three
   genetically divergent and structured lineages: two are exclusive to the
   Panuco biogeographic region and the third is widely distributed in the
   Upper Lerma, Middle Lerma, Cuitzeo, and Balsas (Zempoala Lakes)
   biogeographic regions, as well as one population in Panuco. This widely
   distributed lineage also presents a genetic structure that is congruent
   with these biogeographic regions supported by the cytb gene and
   partially supported by the S7 gene. The divergence time of these
   lineages was dated to the Pleistocene period (0.56-2.79 Mya) and was
   associated with temporally or spatially independent events of river
   capture, which promoted the exchange of fishes between the river
   headwaters followed by subsequent isolation, explaining the current
   distribution of this cyprinid in neighboring but currently isolated
   basins. Our results indicate that, in the highlands of central Mexico,
   tecto-volcanic activity has shaped the geographic ranges,
   diversification, and phylogeographic patterns of freshwater fishes.},

Abstract = {Genetic and phenotypic differentiation in allopatric conditions can be
   explained either by neutral phenomena or adaptative processes driven by
   selection. In reptiles, coloration can affect aspects directly related
   to their survival, representing a classical character under selection.
   In this context, secondary contact areas are natural laboratory to
   understand evolutionary processes underlying genetic permeability,
   especially when populations differ in phenotypic traits such as
   coloration. The western whip snake Hierophis viridiflavus presents two
   divergent mitochondrial clades, characterized by the presence of one of
   two main color phenotypes, namely one with black and yellow stripes and
   a fully melanic one. Here, we investigated whether melanogenesis-linked
   genes are determinant of the chromatic differences observed across the
   phenotypic variation of the species. In addition, we used a multilocus
   dataset, including 134 original ND4 sequences, to better define the
   overall genetic structure and to provide a characterization of a contact
   zone identified in Central Italy by estimating the amount of nuclear
   gene exchange. While we found no evidence supporting a direct
   association between target genes and coloration, a non-synonymous
   substitution polymorphism, at high frequency, was detected in the beta
   melanocyte-stimulating hormone whose possible function has been
   discussed. Concerning the genetic structure, both mtDNA and nuDNA were
   partly concordant indicating introgression events occurring at the
   contact zone. When we measured the nuclear gene flow, we found a
   significant amount of gene exchange, mainly guided from one clade to the
   other, that is, asymmetric. These results might suggest the presence of
   ecological and/or behavioral processes driving the observed directional
   gene flow.},

   Frog (Aromobatidae, Rheobates)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {The complex topography of the species-rich northern Andes creates
   heterogeneous environmental landscapes that are hypothesized to have
   promoted population fragmentation and diversification by processes such
   as vicariance or local adaptation. Previous phylogenetic work on the
   palm rocket frog (Anura: Aromobatidae: Rheobates spp.), endemic to
   midelevation forests of Colombia, suggested that valleys were important
   in promoting divergence between lineages. In this study, we first
   evaluated previous hypotheses of species-level diversity, then fitted an
   isolation-with-migration (IM) historical demographic model, and tested
   two landscape genetic models to explain genetic divergence within
   Rheobates: isolation by distance and isolation by environment. The data
   consisted of two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes from 24 samples
   covering most of the geographic range of the genus. Species delimitation
   by Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography recovered five highly
   divergent genetic lineages within Rheobates, among which few to no
   migrants are exchanged according to IM. We found that isolation by
   environment provided the only variable significantly correlated with
   genetic distances for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, suggesting
   that local adaptation may have a role in driving the genetic divergence
   within this frog genus. Thus, genetic divergence in Rheobates may be
   driven more by variation among the local environments where these frogs
   live rather than by geographic distance.},

Abstract = {We describe a new species, Kobeltocochlea tamarae Sitnikova, Teterina \&
   Maximova sp. nov., from Lake Baikal discovered in the Saint Petersburg
   methane seep at a depth of approximately 1400 m. The uncorrected genetic
   distance was 4.26\% of the COI gene between this new species and K.
   falsipumyla collected from the Academic Ridge at depths between 157 and
   163 m. The two shallow-water species, K. martensiana and K. olchonensis,
   differed in substrate preference and geographic habitats, with a genetic
   distance of 0.97\% for COI. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial (COI,
   16S) and nuclear (ITSI, 28S) sequences indicated that Kobeltocochlea was
   paraphyletic with respect to other benedictiid genera Benedictia and
   Yaroslawiella, formed well-supported monophyletic groups. We revealed
   the discordance of morphological and genetic data within Kobeltocochlea
   and other benedictiids, which reflected their complicated history. The
   current knowledge of benedictiids does not allow for significant changes
   in the taxonomy of the Benedictiidae, except for synonymizing K.
   lindholmiana with K. olchonensis and Pseudobenedictia with Benedictia
   that were also investigated. We speculate that three main lineages of
   benedictiids originated from three populations of a single ancient
   species approximately 3.2 Ma. The speciation of deep-water species was
   probably driven independently by bathymetric isolation in the cold
   methane seeps of different geomorphological structures. The
   diversification of the third lineage consisting of littoral (including
   K. martensiana/K. olchonensis), deep-water, and eurybathic benedictiids
   may be explained by rapid adaptive radiation to intralacustrine
   environments.},

   distribution limits of the M. olivieri complex, refining the
   distribution of Mesalina simoni, and Mesalina pasteuri. Our study
   confirmed one previously unidentified speciation event, leading to the
   description of Mesalina adrarensis sp. nov. Together with this new
   species, we also describe the south-western Moroccan populations of M.
   olivieri as Mesalina simoni saharae ssp. nov. Mesalina adrarensis sp.
   nov. is sympatric with M. pasteuri and parapatric with M. simoni saharae
   ssp. nov. in Mauritania and southern Morocco. Based on our revised
   taxonomy, M. simoni now includes most populations of the M. olivieri
   complex in Morocco, M. olivieri being restricted in Morocco to the east
   and southeast of the country. We also build on these results to provide
   further insight on the biogeography of North Africa. Our results point
   to a diversification of the complex during the late Miocene, that led to
   the formation of the four species M. simoni, M. olivieri, M. pasteuri,
   and M. adrarensis sp. nov. After these four speciation events, high
   intraspecific diversification processes occurred since the beginning of
   the Plio-Pleistocene transition, in parallel with the beginning of the
   humid and arid cycles. Through our phylogenetic analysis, we highlight
   the existence of high levels of undescribed intraspecific diversity in
   M. olivieri and M. pasteuri that will need to be addressed in future
   studies. Moreover, we uncover instances of cytonuclear discordances,
   stressing the need of considering both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for
   integrative taxonomic studies to explore biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Recent sampling efforts in the deep seas of southern and eastern
   Australia have generated a wealth of DNA-suitable material of
   neogastropods of the family Raphitomidae. Based on this material, a
   molecular phylogeny of the family has revealed a considerable amount of
   genus and species level lineages previously unknown to science. These
   taxa are now the focus of current integrative taxonomic research. As
   part of this ongoing investigation, this study focuses on the genera
   Austrobela, Austrotheta (both Criscione, Hallan, Puillandre \& Fedosov,
   2020), Spergo Dall, 1895 and Theta Clarke, 1959. We subjected a
   comprehensive mitochondrial DNA dataset of representative deep-sea
   raphitomids to Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, which recognized 24
   primary species hypotheses (PSHs). Following additional evaluation of
   shell and radular features, as well as examination of geographic and
   bathymetric ranges, 18 of these PSHs were converted to secondary species
   hypotheses (SSHs). Based on the evidence available, the most likely
   speciation mechanisms involved were evaluated for each pair of sister
   SSHs, including niche partitioning. Eleven SSHs were recognized as new
   and their systematic descriptions are provided herein. Of these, four
   were attributed to Austrobela, one to Austrotheta, four to Spergo and
   two to Theta. While all new species are endemic to Australian waters,
   other species studied herein exhibit wide Indo-Pacific distributions,
   adding to the growing body of evidence suggesting that wide geographic
   ranges in deep-sea Raphitomidae are more common than previously assumed.},

Abstract = {In the light of the wide distribution and ecological importance of the
   genus Tigriopus in coastal rock pool habitats, and of its frequent use
   in aquaculture and as a model organism, we investigated the identity of
   the Atlantic-Mediterranean Tigriopus populations and elucidated their
   taxonomy and patterns of morphological and genetic diversity. In order
   to reach these goals, an ``integrative taxonomy{''} multisource approach
   was implemented. First, we investigated the constancy and taxonomical
   value of the morphological characters currently used to distinguish
   among the Tigriopus species occurring in the Mediterranean and in
   Eastern Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer, and checked the
   actual morphological differences possibly present among topotypical
   samples of Tigriopus fulvus fulvus (Fischer, 1860) and its two
   subspecies Tigriopus fulvus adriaticus Van Douwe, 1913 and Tigriopus
   fulvus algiricus Monard, 1935. Then, we sequenced fragments of
   mitochondrial (12S) and nuclear (28S) genes. In the frame of this study,
   different ``DNA taxonomy{''} approaches were implemented in order to
   check whether the subspecies of Tigriopus fulvus were actually lineages
   evolving independently, that is, valid species according to the
   ``evolutionary genetic species concept.{''} The results coherently
   indicate the presence of a single species, characterized by constant
   morphology and a noteworthy geographically based genetic structure in
   the whole study area. No morphological or genetic support was found for
   the taxa of allegedly subspecific rank within T. fulvus, which are thus
   to be considered junior synonyms of T. fulvus s.s. Finally, a restricted
   locus typicus is established for T. fulvus, and a neotype is designated.},

Title = {Reproductive Variability in Hippolytid Shrimp Shape Morphotypes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Shape morph-specific studies in hippolytid shrimps revealed significant
   results on their ecomorphology and evolutionary adaptations. Among the
   species of the genus Hippolyte, only one exhibits an unusual, sharp
   rostral dimorphism and has been used as an animal model for the
   investigation of mechanisms of the morph-specific adaptation: the
   intertidal Hippolyte sapphica. The species is endemic of the
   Central/Eastern Mediterranean basin and exhibits morph-A with a long
   dentate rostrum and morph-B with a short, juvenile-like one. The two
   morphotypes were recently confirmed to be conspecific, while offspring
   and morphological studies showed significant microevolutionary
   adaptations, which balance the disadvantage of the ``rostral loss.{''}
   The present study aims to investigate the effect of such phenotypic
   variation on the reproductive traits of the species. We collected
   ovigerous females of H. sapphica in mixed (morph-A and morph-B) and
   unmixed populations (morph-A) along the species geographical range. We
   measured seven morphometric and maternal investment traits: carapace
   length, fecundity, embryo volume, egg density, female dry weight, brood
   dry weight, and reproductive output. Our results showed that ovigerous
   females were bigger in morph-A than in morph-B, whereas fecundity did
   not show any significant differences between the two morphotypes. High
   egg volume might be attributed to the latitudinal differences of our
   sampling sites compared to congenerics. Interestingly, the reproductive
   output was found to be bigger in morph-A specimens, suggesting that the
   maternal energy investment is selectively determined from the rostral
   presence/absence and the morphotype's higher viability in the species
   populations.},

Title = {Putting European lampreys into perspective: A global-scale multilocus

Abstract = {Previous studies on the phylogenetic relationships between lamprey
   species relied either on a low number of morphological characters
   related to the feeding apparatus, or on a low number of molecular
   mitochondrial DNA markers. Here, we apply a multilocus approach to
   assess the phylogenetic relationships of northern hemisphere lampreys,
   with a special emphasis on the 17 European species. The study comprises
   two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene-DNA barcodes, and
   cytochrome b gene) and two nuclear (internal transcribed spacers I and
   II) markers to investigate species' phylogenetic affinities. The
   phylogeny obtained with mitochondrial markers revealed a clear and
   highly supported separation of all northern hemisphere lampreys. Among
   those, our multilocus results show several polyphyletic genera,
   stressing the need for a taxonomic revision in a near future. Lampetra
   morii (Berg, 1931) from East Asia, often included in Eudontomyzon, is
   placed in the genus Lethenteron. Lampetra richardsoni Vladykov \&
   Follett, 1965 and Entosphenus hubbsi (Vladykov \& Kott, 1976) should be
   placed in a new genus, as well as the southern populations of
   Lethenteron camtschaticum (Tilesius, 1811) and Lethenteron reissneri
   (Dybowski, 1869). Considering European species, our results argue for a
   taxonomic revision of Eudontomyzon, with emphasis on Eudontomyzon
   vladykovi Oliva \& Zanandrea, 1959.},

Abstract = {Diverse associations of freshwater sponges with molluscs were recently
   described from the Xingu River, Amazon Basin. However, such associations
   in other parts of the world are almost unknown. Here, we report on the
   discovery of epifaunal associations of a freshwater sponge
   (Corvospongilla, Spongillidae) with a byssus-attaching clam (Limnoperna,
   Mytilidae) and a freshwater mussel (Hyriopsis, Unionidae) in tropical
   Asia (Mun River, Thailand). We used this association as a model system
   to show how the application of an integrative taxonomic approach can
   change modern views on the taxonomic status and biogeographic affinities
   of tropical invertebrates in a rather small sample. The freshwater
   sponge from the Mun River morphologically corresponds to the nominal
   taxon Corvospongilla siamensis but it is identical to Corvospongilla
   ultima from the Kaladan River, western Myanmar, based on the sequences
   of five DNA markers and the PTP species delimitation modeling. Hence,
   the first species is considered here to be a junior synonym of C.
   ultima. Conversely, the Limnoperna clam from the Mun River is found to
   be distant phylogenetically from the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna
   fortunei based on the sequences of three DNA markers. We therefore
   restore Limnoperna siamensis stat. rev. as a valid species. Our
   time-calibrated multi-locus phylogeny reveals that the split between L.
   siamensis and L. fortunei most likely occurred at the Miocene-Pliocene
   boundary. Finally, the freshwater mussel Hyriopsis khoratensis is an
   abundant species endemic to the Mun River. Our novel data highlight that
   associations of freshwater sponges with bivalves are present in Asia but
   were historically overlooked there and that the Mekong's sponge-mollusc
   association can be considered analogous to those discovered in South
   America.},

Abstract = {A new predatory semislug, Libania rhodia sp. nov. (Oxychilidae:
   Daudebardiinae), is described from Rhodes. Whereas rudimentary shells of
   L. rhodia were previously identified with Lotharia cretica from Crete,
   the investigation of the genitalia demonstrated that it is a distinct
   species that differs from L. cretica in the lack of an externally
   differentiated epiphallus, the lack of a penis coecum, and the longer
   pedunculus of the bursa copulatrix. Molecular phylogenetic analyses
   based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences showed that, contrary
   to previous classifications, Libania is more closely related to Lotharia
   than to Daudebardia. Libania rhodia and L. cretica split already in the
   Early Miocene. The ancestor of the Libania-Lotharia clade colonized
   Crete from the east before a marine ingression formed the mid-Aegean
   trench, which separated Crete from the east Aegean Islands and Anatolia.},

Abstract = {Interspecific differences in species abundances are one of the oldest
   and most universal patterns in ecology, yet little is known about how
   these differences are generated over evolutionary time. In this study,
   we test whether there is evidence for phylogenetic signal in population
   densities of four large groups of terrestrial vertebrates, namely birds,
   mammals, amphibians, and squamates. In addition, we test the hypothesis
   that the relative number of species in a clade might be a predictor of
   the abundance of its constituent species. However, given that the number
   of species in a clade is the outcome of both its age and diversification
   rate, and each of these factors was tested separately. Our results
   provide strong support for phylogenetic signal in species densities for
   all clades, regardless of differences in how species density was
   computed, or phylogenetic uncertainty. On the other hand, there was no
   evidence for a relationship between species abundance and the diversity
   of its encompassing clade. The implications of phylogenetic signal are
   discussed in the context of models of species abundance distributions,
   including Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography.},

Abstract = {The Oriental jumping spider genus Flacillula Strand, 1932 has remained
   taxonomically un-revised and has never been subjected to phylogenetic
   evaluation. Due to its ambiguous circumscription, several species not
   sister to its type species were subsequently placed in it, rendering the
   genus a ``holdall.{''} This study is designed to investigate the
   monophyly of the genus, its placement within the subtribe Simaethina
   Simon, 1903, and to review its composition. Using two target genes (28S,
   COI), we provide the first hypothesis on the internal phylogenetic
   structure of the genus and its placement within Simaethina.
   Additionally, we describe seven new species: Flacillula dothalugala sp.
   nov., Flacillula ellaensis sp. nov., Flacillula henryi sp. nov.,
   Flacillula hodgsoni sp. nov., Flacillula johnstoni sp. nov., Flacillula
   naipauli sp. nov., and Flacillula piyasenai sp. nov. Further, the
   following new combinations are proposed: Iona minuta (Berland, 1929)
   comb. nov. and Iona nitens (Berry, Beatty \& Proszynski, 1997) comb.
   nov. The newly described species might be endangered due to their small
   population size and restricted distribution in high-altitude cloud
   forest.},

Abstract = {Many lacustrine charrs of the genus Salvelinus were described as
   separate species, and their origin and phylogenetic relationships are
   still under debate. In this study, we described the genetic variation of
   charrs from Lake Grand (Elikchan Lake Group, the mainland coast of the
   Sea of Okhotsk, Russia) and several locations outside of this system
   based on eight microsatellite (ms) loci and mitochondrial (mt) DNA
   control region. We tested the hypothesis of the resident charr
   membership to (a) the Arctic lineage of Salvelinus taranetzi sensu
   (Oleinik et al., Russian Journal of Genetics, 51, 2015, 55); (b) the
   Bering lineage of the Northern Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma malma; and
   (c) the Atlantic lineage of the Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus.
   Analysis of phylogenetic relationships based on the mtDNA control region
   showed that all individuals from Lake Grand grouped with the Bering
   lineage. Bayesian analysis using msDNA supports the clustering together
   of charrs from Lake Grand and Arctic lineage, regardless of their mtDNA
   haplotypes. Incongruence between mtDNA and msDNA markers provided strong
   evidence of historical mtDNA introgression from S. malma malma to S.
   taranetzi. Patterns of divergence confirm a postglacial secondary
   contact of the representatives of Arctic and Bering lineages in the area
   of the Sea of Okhotsk coast and past hybridization in Lake Grand with
   the following features: (a) complete fixation of introgressed mtDNA of
   one species within populations of another and (b) absence of modern
   population of S. malma malma in the lake.},

Abstract = {The diamondback squid, Thysanoteuthis rhombus, is the only currently
   accepted species within the family Thysanoteuthidae. In this study, the
   mitogenome of T. rhombus was sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000
   platform. Features of the mitogenome were detected, and phylogenetic
   relationships among the Cephalopoda were reconstructed. Our results
   indicated that the mitogenome of T. rhombus had six duplicated genes and
   long non-coding regions. The gene arrangement of T. rhombus was
   consistent with that of species belonging to Ommastrephidae. Moreover,
   the most gene rearrangement patterns were found in Oegopsida and
   Octopoda, whereas only one pattern was detected in Sepioidea. The
   mitogenome of Myopsida was highly rearranged among the four taxa. The
   phylogenetic relationship of T. rhombus + (((Dosidicus gigas +
   Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) + Ommastrephes bartramii) + (Illex
   argentines + Todarodes pacificus)) was highly supported by both
   mitochondrial gene rearrangement analyses and all the phylogenetic
   analyses. Our study indicated that both gene sequences and arrangements

Abstract = {Extreme sexual size dimorphism is one of the most striking phenomena in
   evolutionary biology. While the origin has been well discussed and some
   causes have been suggested, the evolutionary history remains unclear. We
   found a new species of deep-sea scale worm (Annelida: Polynoidae) inside
   gastropod shells, either empty or occupied by hermit crabs collected at
   140-306 m in depth, Mie Prefecture, Japan. This highly specialized
   habitat, together with the fact that it has never been found
   free-living, led us to consider the scale worm to be an obligate
   symbiont. The species is characterized by males being dwarf, with their
   minute bodies (ca. one-fourth the length of females) always riding on
   the dorsal side of females, being thus the first case of extreme sexual
   size dimorphism in scale worms. Based on a detailed morphological,
   histological, and molecular phylogenetic approach we are here describing
   a new species, Eunoe issunboushi sp. nov.},

Abstract = {We advance on the knowledge of Eigenmanniinae by proposing a hypothesis
   of phylogenetic relationships based on the parsimony analysis of a
   diverse set of 144 anatomical characters, 12\% of them treated as
   quantitative and 88\% treated as qualitative (8\% external morphology,
   51\% osteology, 21\% myology, and 8\% neuroanatomy). Thirty-seven of 45
   valid species of Eigenmanniinae are examined in the study, including the
   incertae sedis species ``Eigenmannia{''} goajira. The final tree yields
   new insights on species relationships, thus, producing a new
   classification to Eigenmanninae. Our analysis recovered the monophyly of
   Eigenmanniinae, Archolaemus, Eigenmannia, and Rhabdolichops. Eigenmannia
   is proposed as monophyletic based on four morphological synapomorphies,
   one of which exclusive to the genus. Japigny is proposed to be the
   sister group of all remaining Eigenmanniinae and ``E.{''} goajira to be
   the sister group of Archolaemus. The hypothesis of monophyly of
   Distocyclus including D. conirostris and D. guchereauae is rejected.
   Consequently, D. guchereauae is included in Eigenmannia, and a new genus
   is established to include ``E.{''} goajira. A taxonomic key to all
   genera is provided. In addition, this study highlights the critical
   played by a diverse set of anatomical and quantitative characters
   without discretization on phylogenetic reconstructions.},

Abstract = {Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera, Reduvidae) is the main vector of Chagas
   disease in South America between the latitudes 10 degrees and 46 degrees
   S. The analysis of the spatial genetic structure of populations at fine
   scale can provide insight into the dynamic population and evolutionary
   process of T. infestans and a complementary approach to help improve
   vector control strategies. Spatio-temporal analysis of the genetic
   structure of T. infestans populations was performed using inter-simple
   sequence repeats markers. A total of 242 polymorphic bands were detected
   from 234 individuals captured in different houses from the locality of
   San Martin and in one surrounding area (Capayan department, Catamarca
   province, Argentina) in October 2007 and May 2010. Significant levels of
   genetic differentiation were detected among the collection sites in both
   temporal samples, including the different sampled sites within the same
   house. These results confirm a high degree of subdivision in T.
   infestans populations. Comparative analysis between the first and the
   second sample indicated that they form two different groups. The genetic
   differentiation level was higher among samples from the second capture
   compared to the first. It is probable that in subdivided populations,
   when restricted gene flow is sustained over time, the genetic drift
   leads to accentuate the differentiation among subpopulations. The
   spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that the dispersion range
   could occur around 500-550 m. Therefore, the probability of
   reinfestation by active dispersal of the insect could be reduced by
   implementing control and surveillance within an approximate radius of
   500-550 m around the infested area. Resumen Triatoma infestans
   (Hemiptera, Reduvidae) es el principal vector de laenfermedad de Chagas
   en America del Sur entre las latitudes 10 degrees y 46 degrees S.
   Elanalisis temporal de la estructura genetica a escala geografica fina
   puedeproporcionar informacion sobre la dinamica y el proceso evolutivo
   depoblaciones de T. infestans y unenfoque complementario para mejorar
   las estrategias del control vectorial. Elanalisis espacio-temporal de la
   estructura genetica de las poblaciones de T. infestans se realizo
   utilizando marcadoresde secuencias entre repeticiones simples (ISSR). Se
   detectaron un total de 242bandas polimorficas a partir de los 234
   individuos capturados en diferentescasas de la localidad de San Martin y
   en un area aledana (departamento deCapayan, provincia de Catamarca,
   Argentina) en octubre de 2007 y mayo de 2010.Se detectaron niveles
   significativos de diferenciacion genetica entre lossitios de recoleccion
   en ambas muestras temporales, incluidos los diferentessitios muestreados
   dentro de la misma casa. Estos resultados confirman un altogrado de
   subdivision en las poblaciones de T. infestans. El analisis comparativo
   entre la primera y la segunda muestraindico que forman dos grupos
   diferentes. El nivel de diferenciacion geneticafue mayor entre las
   muestras de la segunda captura en comparacion con laprimera. Es probable
   que en poblaciones subdivididas, cuando el flujo genico restringidose
   mantiene en el tiempo, la deriva genetica conduce a acentuar la
   diferenciacionentre subpoblaciones. El analisis de autocorrelacion
   espacial indico que elrango de dispersion podria ocurrir alrededor de
   500 a 550 m.
   Por lo tanto, laprobabilidad de reinfestacion por dispersion activa del
   insecto podriareducirse implementando el control y la vigilancia dentro
   de un radio aproximadode 500 a 550 m alrededor del area infestada.},

Abstract = {The global struggle to conserve as many species as possible with limited
   resources requires an improvement of our knowledge on the distribution
   of biodiversity. In Iran, the state of knowledge is poor for most groups
   of organisms, except few vertebrate groups and vascular plants. Reptiles
   are one of the best known, most diverse vertebrate groups in Iran, with
   a high rate of endemism (ca. 29\%), but distribution patterns and
   related environmental drivers remain poorly understood. In the present
   study, based on a large publicly available dataset, we use general
   additive modelling (GAM) to identify explanatory variables for species
   richness of reptiles in Iran. Results indicate heterogeneity parameters
   (range +entropy) as the variables with the highest explanatory values.
   Based on the grid cells of the predicted environmental richness, using
   hotspot analysis, we suggest seven hotspots of reptile diversity (HRDs)
   across the country. Our results corroborate the previously recognized
   HRDs and detect three additional ones, located alongside the major
   mountain ranges around the central deserts plateau, particularly in the
   Zagros Mountains. Four of the largest HRDs (ca. 90\%) situate within the
   Irano-Anatolian and Caucasus global biodiversity hotspot. In addition,
   our results reveal a large gap between identified HRDs and the current
   network of protected areas (PAs) in the country. While three of the
   detected HRDs in this study are partially touched (ca. 18\%) by the PA
   network, overall, these areas are only covered by less than 10\%.
   Therefore, the effectiveness of the current PAs for the protection of
   the reptile diversity of Iran is questionable.},

Abstract = {The barcoding of the mitochondrial COX1 gene has been instrumental in
   cataloguing the tree of life, and in providing insights in the
   phylogeographic history of species. Yet, this strategy has encountered
   difficulties in major clades characterized by large genomes, which
   contain a high frequency of nuclear pseudogenes originating from the
   mitochondrial genome (numts). Here, we use the meadow grasshopper
   (Chorthippus parallelus), which possesses a giant genome of similar to
   13 Gb, to identify mitochondrial genes that are underrepresented as
   numts, and test their use as informative phylogeographic markers. We
   recover the same full mitochondrial sequence using both whole genome and
   transcriptome sequencing, including functional protein-coding genes and
   tRNAs. We show that a region of the mitogenome containing the COX1 gene,
   typically used in DNA barcoding, has disproportionally higher diversity
   and coverage than the rest of the mitogenome, consistent with multiple
   insertions of that region into the nuclear genome. By designing new
   markers in regions of less elevated diversity and coverage, we identify
   two mitochondrial genes that are less likely to be duplicated as numts.
   We show that, while these markers show high levels of incomplete lineage
   sorting between subspecies, as expected for mitochondrial genes, genetic
   variation reflects their phylogeographic history accurately. These
   findings allow us to identify useful mitochondrial markers for future
   studies in C. parallelus, an important biological system for
   evolutionary biology. More generally, this study exemplifies how
   non-PCR-based methods using next-generation sequencing can be used to
   avoid numts in species characterized by large genomes, which have
   remained challenging to study in taxonomy and evolution.},

Abstract = {Coendou comprises the most speciose genus in Erethizontidae, with 15
   currently recognized species. Although several taxonomic studies in the
   last two decades have unveiled part of its diversity, the most
   widespread Neotropical taxon Coendou prehensilis has received limited
   attention. Here, we combined morphological and molecular datasets to
   infer the phylogenetic relationships of the species in the genus and
   revise the taxonomy of the C. prehensilis complex. We found four
   morphotypes and three well-supported monophyletic clades within C.
   prehensilis. These three clades represent valid species: C. prehensilis
   (restricted to the north of the Atlantic Forest), C. baturitensis
   (occurring in the eastern Amazonian and montane forests enclaves in the
   Caatinga), and C. longicaudatus (two subspecies, C. l. longicaudatus
   from the Amazon and C. l. boliviensis from Cerrado and Chaco).
   Furthermore, we recovered three morphologically diagnosable clades
   within Coendou, for which we assigned subgeneric names. Coendou
   (Coendou) comprises six species (C. baturitensis, C. longicaudatus, C.
   mexicanus, C. prehensilis, C. quichua, and C. rufescens), Coendou
   (Sphiggurus) includes five taxa (C. bicolor, C. insidiosus, C.
   nycthemera, C. speratus, and C. spinosus), and the third subgenus we
   named Coendou (Caaporamys) subgen. nov, comprising C. melanurus (type
   species), C. vestitus, C. pruinosus, C. ichillus, and C. roosmalenorum.},

Abstract = {Many studies have confirmed the impact of the environment on the brain.
   However, it is still controversial whether the cause of the change is
   phenotypically plastic or heritable. In this study, we studied
   morphological variations of the brain among Gambusia affinis obtained
   from 10 different populations in China. We found that the sizes of total
   brain and brain regions were affected by climatic gradients. For
   instance, there was a decrease in the volume of olfactory bulbs, optic
   tectum, corpus cerebelli, and total brain from north to south.
   Common-garden experiments indicated that the variations in the sizes of
   the hypothalamus and the total brain were heritable, while that of other
   brain regions were phenotypically plastic. Variation in brain morphology
   of wild fish supports the mosaic hypothesis. The common-garden
   experiments provide a reference for heritability estimates and
   phenotypic plasticity of brain volumes. In addition, our study has laid
   the foundation for in-depth research on the adaptive evolution of the
   brain of G. affinis.},

Abstract = {The diversity of freshwater leeches (Clitellata; Hirudinida) of Iran was
   estimated by employing both DNA barcoding and species delimitation
   methods. Phylogenetic relationships of arhynchobdellid (including
   Hirudinidae, Praobdellidae, Haemopidae, and Erpobdellidae) and
   rhynchobdellid (Glossiphoniidae) leeches were reconstructed, based on
   the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus, using both new sequence
   data and those available from GenBank. Our results suggest that each of
   Helobdella stagnalis (Linnaeus, 1758), Glossiphonia concolor (Aphathy,
   1888), Erpobdella borisi Cichocka \& Bielecki, 2015, Dina lineata (O.F.
   Muller, 1774), Hirudo orientalis Utevsky and Trontelj, 2005, Haemopis
   sanguisuga (Linnaeus, 1758), Limnatis paluda (Tennent, 1859), and two
   unidentified species of Dina and Trocheta (these did not find
   species-level matches in GenBank) are present in Iran. A potential case
   of phenotypic change in response to ecological adaptation was observed
   in E. borisi insofar as two genetically identical sub- and
   super-terranean morphotypes were distinguished. The glossiphoniids of
   Iran and Europe are admixed in the phylogenetic tree, revealing low COI
   variation and no divergence within species between the continents for
   these taxa.},

Abstract = {The first fossil representative of the cleroid family Trogossitidae is
   described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Microtrogossita qizhihaoi
   Li \& Cai gen. et sp. nov. is unique among Trogossitidae in the
   relatively widely separated procoxal and mesocoxal cavities, weakly
   asymmetrical antennal clubs, coarsely facetted eyes, coarse sculpture of
   dorsal and ventral surfaces of thorax in comparison with tiny body size,
   and the absence of spines along side margin of tibiae. Morphological
   characters of the fossil were analyzed together with representatives of
   44 extant genera of Cleroidea (Peltidae, Lophocateridae, and
   Trogossitidae) in a matrix of 93 characters. Microtrogossita qizhihaoi
   was resolved as a member of Trogossitini within Trogossitidae. The
   tribal composition of Trogossitidae is discussed in light of our
   re-analysis of a previously published four-gene dataset under a
   site-heterogeneous model. The recently described lophocaterid
   Mesolophocateres pengweii Yu, Leschen \& Slipinski syn. nov. from
   Burmese amber is suggested to be a junior synonym of Burmacateres

Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {The Neotropical fish genus Prochilodus includes five species occurring
   in the main drainages of the eastern Brazilian Shield: P. argenteus, P.
   costatus, P. lineatus, P. harttii, and P. vimboides. Multi and single
   locus phylogenies have questioned the monophyly of P. costatus and P.
   lineatus, and the biogeographic history of these species in the
   Brazilian Shield has never been explored. We characterized new
   mitogenomes for these species to reconstruct their evolutionary history,
   estimated the timing of Prochilodus cladogenesis, and discussed the
   implications of past geologic events on species diversification. The
   phylogeny supports the monophyly of both P. costatus and P. lineatus,
   and indicates a Miocene divergence of P. vimboides, much earlier than
   subsequent species diversification. The Early Pleistocene split of P.
   argenteus and P. harttii (similar to 2.1 million years ago-MYA) is
   hypothesized to be related to recent Quaternary reactivations of the Rio
   Aracuai Fault that promoted river captures between the eastern
   tributaries of the Sao Francisco basin and the upper Rio Jequitinhonha
   in the Serra do Espinhaco mountain range. The time-calibrated phylogeny
   also indicated a subsequent split of P. costatus and P. lineatus
   (similar to 1.1 MYA) likely due to Quaternary activities of the Upper
   Rio Sao Francisco crustal discontinuity and Estrela Fault that catalyzed
   river captures between the upper Rio Sao Francisco and the Rio Grande of
   the Parana basin in the Serra da Canastra mountain range. These results
   provide a temporal context for the diversification of Prochilodus and
   bring new insights to further study the historical biogeography of other
   riverine fish groups along the upland basins of the eastern Brazilian
   Shield.},

Abstract = {Freshwater pearl mussels (Bivalvia: Margaritiferidae) are among the most
   imperiled groups of animals globally. While the parasites and symbionts
   of the Margaritiferidae are rather poorly known, these mussels were
   thought to be free of parasitic mites (Acari: Unionicolidae:
   Unionicola). Here, we report on the discovery of a mite species being
   associated with the endangered freshwater pearl mussel Gibbosula
   laosensis (Lea, 1863) from Myanmar. This species, Unionicola
   (Gibbosulicola) sella subgen. \& sp. nov., morphologically resembles
   mites belonging to the subgenera Coelaturicola and Fulleratax (African
   and Southeast Asian groups, respectively). Our novel discovery expands
   the host range of Unionicola mites and reveals that all freshwater
   mussel families of the order Unionida host these aquatic mites. Our
   phylogenetic research and available published data reveal that the
   mussel-associated mite assemblage in Southeast and South Asia contains
   not less than 17 species and 8 subgenera. Currently, the regional
   taxonomic richness of this group seems to be largely underestimated. We
   found that mussel mites from Southeast Asia are narrow host specialists,
   which are known to occur in a single or a few closely related species
   belonging to one or two sister genera of freshwater mussels. Finally,
   our results indicate that mussel mites share generally restricted ranges
   and that their distribution patterns in Southeast Asia are largely
   congruent with the boundaries of biogeographic subregions delineated on
   the basis of phylogenetic studies of freshwater mussels.},

Abstract = {The genus Phrynocephalus Kaup, 1825, includes various species complexes.
   The Arabian species group (Ph. arabicus, Ph. ahvazicus, Ph.
   longicaudatus, and Ph. maculatus) is one of these which is distributed
   in southwest Asia. Phrynocephalus maculatus Anderson, 1872 is a member
   of the Ph. arabicus group that occurs only on the Iranian Plateau. In
   the present study, we aimed to evaluate the taxonomic relationships of
   Ph. maculatus, comparing it to other species in the Arabian group and
   conducting a genetic analysis of its various populations on the Iranian
   Plateau. For this, two mitochondrial gene fragments (16S rRNA and
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) were sequenced in different populations
   across its entire distributional range on the Iranian Plateau. The
   results indicated that a population of P. maculatus in Abarkouh is
   clearly genetically differentiated from other populations in Iran,
   whereas other populations show low levels of variability. In addition, a
   population from southern Pakistan showed a close relationship with Ph.
   lutensis Kamali \& Anderson, 2015 and is not clustered with Ph.
   maculatus populations. The taxonomic position of Ph. ahvazicus Melnikov,
   Melnikova, Nazarov, Rajabizadeh, Al-Johani, Amr \& Ananjeva, 2014 has
   not been confirmed, and we here consider it as a synonym of Ph. arabicus
   Anderson, 1894. Populations from southern Iraq (Basrah and Babylon
   provinces) belong to Ph. longicaudatus.},

Abstract = {Subterranean environments of Iran are severely understudied. Here, we
   advance the knowledge of Iranian cave biodiversity by following three
   goals: (i) to investigate Iranian caves for troglobiotic beetles; (ii)
   to understand the phylogenetic relationships and estimate the timing of
   Iranian cave colonization by Duvalius Delarouzee, 1859; and (iii) to
   comment on the current knowledge of the Iranian troglobiotic fauna to
   facilitate future research. Through field efforts and morphological
   examination, we describe two new Duvalius species from caves of Zagros
   Mts., Iran: the troglobiotic Duvalius nezelensis sp. nov. and the
   non-troglobiotic Duvalius achaemenius sp. nov. For phylogenetic
   analyses, we provide original sequences of two mitochondrial (COI, 16S)
   and two nuclear (18S, 28S) genes for three Duvalius species from the
   Zagros Mts., and combine them with published molecular datasets using
   other Duvalius species with relevant outgroup genera. Using Bayesian
   inference and maximum likelihood, we reconstruct a species-level
   phylogeny of Duvalius and closely related genera, then use BEAST to
   explore divergence times of major lineages. Our phylogenies recover a
   well-supported ``Zagros clade,{''} with its split from other congeners
   estimated at 9.7 Ma. Within the Zagros clade, the split of D. nezelensis
   and its sister group is estimated at 7.8 Ma, while the split of D.
   achaemenius and D. kileri is estimated to a recent 0.78 Ma. We provide
   some resolution in understanding the species richness of cave beetles in
   Iran and the timing of their subterranean colonization. However, our
   phylogenies confirm taxonomic problems as several genera are nested deep
   within the Duvalius tree.},

Abstract = {The Adriatic Sea and Adriatic Sea drainage system (or Adriatic region)
   is characterized by high levels of species richness. This especially
   applies to endemic fishes, as exemplified by the sand gobies. However,
   the diversity of this group is probably still underestimated. Several
   keys for gobiid identification, notably of the Adriatic region, have
   been proposed on the basis of morphological characters, but difficulties
   persist in species identification. Molecular phylogenies support the
   monophyly of the sand gobies, but relationships between genera and
   species remain poorly resolved. In this work, the diversity and
   evolutionary history of the Adriatic sand gobies (Pomatoschistus and
   Knipowitschia) were investigated by applying phylogenetic
   reconstructions, species delimitation tests, and molecular dating based
   on mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear rhodopsin 1 genes. The
   concatenation of both genes allowed, for the first time, the creation of
   a highly resolved phylogeny at the interspecific level. The generic
   diversity within the sand gobies is probably considerably higher than
   formerly assumed. Our results highlight cryptic diversity and suggest
   that new species remain to be described within Knipowitschia and
   Pomatoschistus. Most of all, our results emphasized the urgent need of a
   taxonomic revision of the sand gobies. Several past events were at the
   origin of sand goby diversification in the Adriatic region. It seems
   that glacial periods promoted the intraspecific diversification of the
   endemic species, whereas interglacial periods promoted the
   (re)colonization of the Adriatic Sea by more widespread species.},

Abstract = {The Lut Desert, southeastern Iran, regularly has the largest contiguous
   area of surface temperatures above 65 degrees C compared to anywhere
   else on Earth. Despite these harsh conditions, some specialized species
   thrive in this extreme habitat. Misonne's spider gecko, Rhinogecko
   misonnei de Witte, 1973 (Reptilia, Squamata, Gekkonidae) is an endemic
   species that is native to the central part of the Lut Desert. This
   research aimed to explore the dietary gut content and ecology of
   Misonne's spider gecko populations inhabiting the Lut Desert. A DNA
   metabarcoding approach was applied to obtain data from the stomach
   content of six collected specimens. A total of 147,451 amplicon reads
   representing a total of 94 OTU (=Operational Taxonomic Units) for the
   CO1-5P barcode region were sequenced. Of 94 OTUs, 50 (53.2\%)
   identically matched >= 97\% with BOLD and/or NCBI database and were
   identified at the genus level. Blasting in both databases revealed the
   presence of three phyla including Chordata (55.23\%), Arthropoda
   (44.72\%), and Annelida (0.05). 99.54\% of Chordata DNA belonged to
   Rhinogecko misonnei mainly coming from stomach tissue of the examined
   specimens. Within the arthropods, 87.64\% of the OTUs matched Insecta
   and 12.08\% Arachnida. Our findings indicate that Rhinogecko misonnei is
   a generalist gecko that feeds on a variety of food items. About 81\% of
   Rhinogecko food items in the central Lut are migratory insects that come
   from adjacent areas of the Lut District, although the arachnid food
   items originate from the central Lut. This study emphasizes the
   importance of the insect fauna of adjacent areas of the Lut Desert for
   the stability of the Desert food web.},

Abstract = {Dispersal-relevant traits may be subjected to spatial sorting in rapidly
   expanding populations, driving the evolution of dispersive phenotypes.
   This process has been largely documented in invasive species, and
   ascertaining its presence can have important implications for their
   management. The Asian common toad was accidentally introduced to
   Madagascar around 2010 and is a highly problematic invasive species.
   Exploring the morphology of this species offers the twofold opportunity
   to test the hypothesis of early onset of spatial sorting and to gather
   information on the dynamics of this unstudied biological invasion. For
   these purposes, we analyze morphological data of adult toads collected
   across the invasive range in Madagascar, and we test the effect of the
   distance from the introduction point on the relative size of head,
   radioulna and tibiofibula, and on body size and body condition of toads,
   respectively. We did not detect evidence of spatial sorting in the
   morphological traits analyzed. Instead, morphological variation was
   largely dependent on sex and body size of individuals. Sexual dimorphism
   was limited in relation to other populations in the native range, and
   body size did not vary across the invasive gradient, which could
   indicate that both adults and juveniles are currently contributing to
   the dispersal in this invasive species. We provide important baseline
   data for the long-term assessment of morphological variation in the
   invasive population, and we advocate for further investigations of
   spatial sorting in life history and behavioral traits.},

   12 new unambiguously optimized synapomorphies of Silverstoneia: (a)
   medial emargination on the upper and (b) lower labia, (c) distinct
   gamma-shaped crest in prenarial arena, (d) postnarial papillae oblique,
   (e) lateral ridge papillae keel-like, (f) dermal crest on buccal floor
   arena, (g) additional slip of the m. subarcualis obliquus inserting on a
   medial aponeurosis, (h) fibers of the m. subarcualis rectus I inserting
   on a medial aponeurosis, (i) fibers of the rectus cervicis inserting on
   a medial aponeurosis, (j) complete fusion of the suprarostral corpus and
   alae, (k) adrostral tissue mass with cartilaginous core, and (l)
   basihyal free. We also identify the fusion of suprarostral corpora above
   the distal line as a novel larval synapomorphy for Epipedobates.
   Finally, we discuss the ecomorphology and convergent evolution of
   funnel-mouthed tadpoles, which evolved at least seven times in six

Abstract = {During embryonic development of the Caspian thin-toed gecko migration,
   formation of myoblast and myosatellite cells occurs in the
   cranial-distal direction. Somite formation begins in the body part close
   to the skull and ends in the tail. The time of separation of somites
   from the proximal mesoderm depends on the temperature of the air and the
   substrate. Myoblast cells reach their targets and are connected, and the
   membranes in the area of their contact are destroyed. Myoblast's fusion
   creates myosymplasts. The intermediate stage is observed after the
   formation of small myosymplasts. After that, the chain shape of
   myosymplasts are transformed into an intermediate plaque form. At this
   intermediate stage, the number of a nucleus is small, the shape of the
   nucleus differs from each other, and the location of the nucleus varies.
   Afterward, the connection of the intermediate forms with each other and
   with myoblasts forms a rounded shape, where the initial development of
   myotubules takes place. A fully formed myotubular and myosatellite cells
   are surrounded by a basal membrane and shape a muscle fiber. The
   skeletal muscles of the adult Caspian thin-toed gecko are mainly
   composed of white fibers. Thus, it allows the gecko to move very fast in
   a short time. Due to the small number of mitochondria in the myotubes,
   oxygen gas demand is decreased and the body is prevented from
   overheating.},

Title = {DNA Barcoding and Phylogeny of Acari Species Based on ITS and COI
   Markers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Acari harbor numerous minute species of agricultural economic
   importance, mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Great efforts have
   been established by means of recovering morphological, molecular, and
   phylogenetic traits for species identification. Traditional
   identification still relies on external diagnostic characters, which are
   limited and usually exhibit large phenotypic plasticity within the
   species, rendering them useless for species delimitation and
   identification. We decided to increase the number of sequences of the
   Acari mitochondrial COI (Cytochrome C oxidase I) marker and ITS nuclear
   ribosomal DNA region for species identification in Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae. The molecular data allow us to establish species
   boundaries and phylogenetic relationships among several clades of Acari,
   mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Sequence comparisons between
   complete COI and the Acari mitochondrial COI, ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, and ITS2
   among all Acari sequences have demonstrated that the selected regions,
   even small, gave enough informative positions for both species'
   identification and phylogenetic studies. Analyses of both DNA regions
   have unveiled their use as species identification characters, with
   special emphasis on Acari mitochondrial COI for Tetranychidae and
   Phytoseiidae species in comparison with the Folmer fragment, which has
   been universally used as a barcode marker. We demonstrated that the
   Acari mitochondrial COI region is also a suitable marker to establish a
   barcode dataset for Acari identification. Our phylogenetic analyses are
   congruent with other recent works, showing that Acari is a monophyletic
   group, of which Astigmata, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Oribatida, and
   Prostigmata are also monophyletic.},

Abstract = {We examined morphometric differentiation in the highly polymorphic and
   taxonomically confusing Psammobates tentorius (tent tortoise) species
   complex in southern Africa, using morphological data together with
   previously published DNA sequence and microsatellite DNA data. We used
   the approximate Bayesian computation-based simulation analysis to test
   alternative phylogenetic hypotheses supported by different markers,
   using a total evidence dataset for the tent tortoise species complex.
   The results supported a scenario, which is better and more inclusive in
   explaining its genealogical history. Our total evidence-based Bayesian
   BPP species delimitation analysis (mtDNA + nDNA + morphology) suggested
   a seven species scheme should be applied to the P. tentorius species
   complex. Nonetheless, based on comparative results obtained from
   sequence, microsatellite, ecological niche, and morphological data, a
   four-species scheme (among the seven mtDNA clades) appears to be the
   best taxonomic solution for the systematic puzzle of the P. tentorius
   species complex, namely, ``C1 + C4 + C5 + C7,{''} ``C3,{''} ``C2,{''}
   and ``C6.{''} We detected several possible hybridizations between C1 and
   C2 in their intergradation zone that confirmed the possible cross-over
   between them. Lastly, we provide a summarized flow chart of the analyses
   carried out for determining the optimal taxonomic solution for this
   phenotypically difficult group, as it may also be useful for resolving
   complex taxonomic issues in other species groups.},

Abstract = {``Eleutherodactylus{''} bilineatus has long been an enigma. Recent
   phylogenetic analyses have recovered this species as part of a clade
   including Barycholos and Noblella, but the relationship among these
   groups still remains contentious. In this study, we test the
   phylogenetic position and reassess the taxonomic status of this
   long-term incertae sedis species. We use phylogenetic analyses of
   nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences and data for external
   morphology and osteology of ``E.{''} bilineatus and its related genera.
   We recover the species as an independent lineage forming a fully
   supported clade with Barycholos and Noblella. The combination of
   inferred relationships and morphological traits supports the erection of
   a new genus that we name and diagnose. Our analyses also recover a
   non-monophyletic Noblella and the species of the genus, although
   morphologically similar, are part of different clades: one including
   species from central Andes and the other one including species from
   northern Andes. Moreover, distribution patterns point out connections
   among distant biogeographical areas of South America and a widespread
   distribution of an ancestor for the clade including Barycholos, ``E.{''}
   bilineatus, and Noblella. We also compare the relationships among clades
   of Brachycephaloidea and, hence, the family and subfamily
   classifications in different studies. We show that the family
   classification is probably far from becoming stable, mostly due to
   arbitrary selections of hierarchy of the clades. However, we show that
   by assigning a family to each of the highly supported and frequently
   recovered clades would render a more stable taxonomy of
   Brachycephaloidea.},

Abstract = {The genetic structure of parasite populations is affected by various
   factors such as host-parasite interactions, life-history strategies, and
   the evolutionary histories of both interacting organisms. In this study,
   we investigated the distribution, prevalence, and population-genetic
   structure of Icosiella neglecta (Spirurida, Onchocercidae), a nematode
   parasite found in Ranidae frogs. We reported this parasite from eight
   species of water frogs (genus Pelophylax) in Europe, the Middle East,
   and Central Asia. Its prevalence across investigated localities varied
   from 3.03\% to 95.83\%. Based on nucleotide variation in a 28S ribosomal
   RNA gene, all investigated I. neglecta sequences formed a well-supported
   phylogenetic clade and were placed in the sister position to the genus
   Ochoterenella. Despite the substantial genetic variability in a
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) fragment (33 unique
   haplotypes recognized among 91 sequences), we found only weak
   population-genetic structure across the study area. There was no obvious
   association of COI haplotypes with geography, except haplotypes from
   eastern Turkey, Lebanon, and Iraq which formed a homogeneous, albeit
   only weakly differentiated group. The historical demographic analyses
   suggest that the species underwent a sudden and relatively recent
   population expansion. According to our results, we assume that the
   population-genetic structure of I. neglecta might be linked to the
   evolutionary history and dispersal of its dipteran vectors than water
   frog hosts.},

Title = {Understanding the real magnitude of the arachnid order Ricinulei through
   deep Sanger sequencing across its distribution range and phylogenomics,

Abstract = {Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders or tick beetles), considered one of the
   smaller arachnid orders, is an ancient clade whose affinities are still
   debated. With three recognized genera, short-range endemism, and strict
   fidelity to the landmasses that have seen them evolve for hundreds of
   millions of years, the group has emerged as a novel system to understand
   deep biogeographic processes. Here we undertake a combined approach
   using phylotranscriptomics and deep Sanger sequencing of 133 ricinuleid
   specimens to better understand their relationships, divergence times,
   and species ranges by using a series of species delimitation analyses.
   Our results support the monophyly of the three recognized genera,
   Ricinoides in Africa, Pseudocellus in North America, and Cryptocellus in
   Mesoamerica and South America. Ricinoides is further divided into two or
   three deep clades corresponding to different ancestral forest refugia,
   and the sampled Cryptocellus segregate into a Mesoamerican and a South
   American clade, but a new species from Tobago is the sister group to the
   Mesoamerican clade in the transcriptomic analysis and not part of the
   South American clade. Despite not being known from adults, but given the
   fact that this is the only Ricinulei species from the Lesser Antilles
   and its pivotal phylogenetic position, the species is here formalized as
   Cryptocellus tobagoensis Giribet \& Benavides sp. nov. Finally, species
   delimitation methods generally do well recognizing morphospecies, but
   they are unable to distinguish among some of them, suggesting the need
   for re-study of some of these species complexes and perhaps synonymy.},

Abstract = {The description of Vipera walser from the Northern Italian Alps as a new
   species (Ghielmi et al., 2016, Journal of Zoological Systematics and
   Evolutionary Research, 54, 161) was one of the most unexpected surprises
   of European herpetology in the 21st century. In mitochondrial (mt) DNA,
   it is closely related to a group of vipers only present in the Caucasus
   region and Northeastern Anatolia. However, its morphology is similar to
   the V. berus populations that inhabit nearby mountains in the
   Swiss-Italian Alps, which raises questions on its relationships and
   status. We thus sequenced five nuclear (nu) genes to determine the
   position of V. walser relative to V. berus and to the
   Caucasian/Northeastern Anatolian vipers in nuDNA. We also reanalyzed
   five previously sequenced mtDNA fragments. NuDNA markers recovered V.
   walser as closely related to Italian populations of V. berus and not to
   the Caucasian/Anatolian species, thus contradicting the mtDNA phylogeny.
   We checked that each of the five mtDNA fragments independently amplified
   by Ghielmi et al. (2016, Journal of Zoological Systematics and
   Evolutionary Research, 54, 161) produced individual gene trees
   compatible with the concatenated mtDNA phylogeny, thus excluding the
   hypothesis that NUMTs sequencing generated the mtDNA relationships
   reported by Ghielmi et al. (2016, Journal of Zoological Systematics and
   Evolutionary Research, 54, 161). Given the low level of nuclear
   differentiation between V. walser and the Italian population of V.
   berus, we argue that ancient admixture between V. berus and the
   ancestral population of V. walser is the most likely explanation for
   this case of cyto-nuclear discordance and we discuss the consequences of
   these results on the systematic status of V. walser.},

Abstract = {Atalophlebiinae (Ephemeroptera, Leptophlebiidae) is a mayfly subfamily
   present in temperate and mountainous areas of South America and
   Australia. We tested the hypothesis that both vicariance and dispersal
   related to the second phase of Gondwana breakup-which began in the Early
   Cretaceous and resulted in the separation between Madagascar and India
   from Antarctica and Australia-contributed to the origin,
   diversification, and shaped the current distribution of this group. The
   hypothesis was tested using Bayesian phylogenetic trees, fossil-based
   molecular dating, and ancestral range estimation to reconstruct the
   biogeography of the lineages within this group. The results suggested an
   origin in the late Gondwana supercontinent for Atalophlebiinae
   (85.76-136.63 mya) after a vicariant event during the Cretaceous period.
   Subsequently, the lineage diversified into a scenario that refers to a
   Gondwanic corridor formed by South America, Antarctica, and Australia.
   At the end of the separation of the continents that made up the
   Gondwanic corridor, speciation occurred within the current distribution
   areas. The diversity and current distribution of Atalophlebiinae were
   shaped by complex processes of vicariance, dispersal, and speciation
   within the Gondwanic corridor during the second phase of the
   supercontinent breakup. Mayflies have difficulty in crossing
   transoceanic barriers, which suggests that most living taxa are the
   result of more recent local ecological and historical processes.},

Title = {Historical biogeography of the Iberian Peninsula: multilocus phylogeny

Abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is one of the most ancient geological areas in
   Europe. Its complex orography is a consequence of several geological
   episodes related with two orogenic episodes that occurred from Late
   Devonian (Variscan orogeny) to the Cenozoic (Alpine orogeny). Unraveling
   the evolutionary history of strict freshwater fauna, such as leuciscid
   fishes, may contribute to our understanding of the paleogeographic
   history of a region and its configuration along time. Within the Iberian
   freshwater fish fauna, the genus Squalius is one of the oldest and most
   diversified leuciscids. Here, we used phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and
   ancestral area reconstruction approaches to infer relationships among
   Iberian drainages and the biogeographic history of these Squalius
   species, particularly of two of the most widely distributed species, S.
   carolitertii and S. pyrenaicus. Our results confirmed, in agreement with
   previous studies, an underestimation of the real diversity of Squalius
   in the Iberian Peninsula and identified divergent evolutionary lineages,
   highlighting the reticulate evolutionary history of the Iberian Squalius
   species. The ancestral reconstruction analyses indicated that several
   vicariance and dispersal processes occurred among different Squalius
   lineages, linked to the paleogeographic configuration of the Iberian
   Peninsula during the Cenozoic period.},

Abstract = {Some species of parasites use highly vagile organisms as definitive
   hosts, and this may influence the geographic distribution and historical
   diversification of both hosts and parasites, shaped by common
   biogeographic processes. Acanthocephalans are a group of endoparasites,
   some of which use highly vagile migratory birds as definitive hosts. The
   objective of the present work was to determine the evolutionary and
   biogeographic events shared by these taxa along the North American
   Central Migratory Flyway. A database with the records of Anatid and
   Rallid species and their acanthocephalans was compiled using previous
   publications and collections. Tanglegrams were constructed using the
   method of reconciled trees, and a general cladogram was constructed
   using the Brooks parsimony analysis. The results suggested that there is
   no cospeciation between the acanthocephalans and aquatic birds, and
   biotic evolution is shaped mainly by vicariance events for birds and
   dispersal events for acanthocephalans. Barriers seem to have been
   overcome by acanthocephalans but not by their hosts, placing them as
   generalist parasites and successful colonizers.},

Abstract = {The Crenicichla mandelburgeri species complex from the Middle Parana
   shows parallel evolution of ecomorphs to the unrelated Crenicichla
   missioneira species complex from the Uruguay River. In this article, we
   describe a new species pair (C. sp. Piray Guazu and C. sp. Piray Guazu
   Line) from the C. mandelburgeri species complex that has evolved a
   parallel morphological and ecological dichotomy to another species pair
   from the same species complex (Crenicichla ypo, Crenicichla yjhui) and
   also to species in the unrelated C. missioneira species complex (C.
   missioneira, Crenicichla celidochilus). The new species pair is endemic
   to a single tributary (the Piray Guazu) of the Middle Parana River where
   it is sympatric and partly syntopic. Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny shows
   the two new species as distantly related within the C. mandelburgeri
   species complex, each with a sister species in the Iguazu rather than in
   the neighbouring Parana river tributaries. Reduced genome representation
   ddRAD analyses of the nuclear genome demonstrate their close
   relationship, which is however complicated by the hybrid origin of one
   of the new species (C. sp. Piray Guazu Line). The hybrid origin of this
   species is demonstrated by sharing the ancestral genetic stock with its
   sympatric sister species (C. sp. Piray Guazu) while having an admixture
   from the widespread species C. mandelburgeri from the main Middle Parana
   channel. In this study we also review the role of biogeography and
   mitonuclear discordance during evolution of the whole C. mandelburgeri
   species complex.},

Abstract = {The Agamid lizard Trapelus ruderatus has a large distribution in western
   Asia. There is as yet neither a comprehensive molecular phylogeny nor
   morphological variation studies on populations of this species. In the
   present study, we aimed to evaluate the morphology and genetic
   attributes of this species from populations in Iran, Turkey, Syria, and
   Iraq. For the morphological examination, 18 characters (nine metric,
   eight meristic, and one ratio characters) were examined on all
   specimens. The populations were divided into four Operational Taxonomic
   Units (OTUs; three in Iran and one in Turkey). The Iraqi population was
   distinguished as Trapelus persicus by morphological characters.
   Morphological analyses confirmed that all OTUs could be considered as
   distinct and that the Turkey population is clearly separated from the
   Iranian populations. In the genetic component of the project, two
   mitochondrial (Cytb and ND2) gene fragments were used to reveal
   phylogenetic relationships among the populations. Molecular phylogenetic
   reconstruction showed five distinct clades (three in Iran, one in
   southeastern Turkey, and one in central-southern Turkey-western Syria).
   Iraqi populations clustered with T. persicus, with high genetic
   distances from all other populations, as seen using morphological data.
   Based on the molecular genetic analyses, southeastern Turkey and
   central-southern Turkey-Syrian populations are clearly distinct (8.4\%
   mean distance) and far from the type population in Iran. This suggests
   that they should be considered as different taxa. Iranian populations
   were differentiated into three major groups, the type population in Fars
   Province and two others in northwest and western Iran. The morphological
   and molecular genetic results gave a similar output with three Iranian
   populations having minor divergence, but being clearly separated from
   the population in Turkey. We suggest each of these groups should be
   considered as full species. According to divergence time estimation, T.
   ruderatus firstly diverged at 26.5 mya and subsequently diversified due
   to the uplifting of the Zagros Mountains and Anatolian Diagonal 15 mya.
   Subsequent aridification in the Central Iranian Plateau could also have
   contributed to the divergence of the Fars lineage 9.6 mya.},

Abstract = {Generalist species are often characterized by low habitat specialization
   and reduced genetic structure in their populations. Here, we tested this
   common assumption on golden jackals in Iran, a wide country with a
   highly heterogeneous landscape where this carnivore is assumed to be
   widespread, although little is known about the ecology and population
   genetics of this species. We investigate distribution patterns, habitat
   requirements, and niche breadth of golden jackals by using GIS
   techniques and ecological modeling over a total of 452 presence records.
   We then assessed genetic diversity and population structure by analyzing
   24 samples for 43 microsatellites. The observed distribution patterns
   show an extensive range across a wide climatic, ecological and
   altitudinal gradient, covering eight climate regions and 16 terrestrial
   ecoregions. Ecological modeling confirms high habitat plasticity of the
   golden jackal, with selection of mountainous areas with high slopes,
   moderate temperatures, and areas with low human population and activity
   while avoiding hyper-arid regions. Estimated values of niche breadth
   were high, indicating that is a generalist species in the study area.
   The observed genetic diversity was high, representing the highest value
   reported so far in this species. We found no signature of population
   structure, suggesting a single genetic cluster, as well as no evidence
   of hybridization with domestic dogs. Our results provide valuable
   ecological and genetic information on a widespread but poorly known
   carnivore, often disregarded in conservation strategies but under
   pressure from anthropogenic threats.},

Abstract = {The appreciation of cryptic biological diversity, and the pace at which
   it is recognized, has greatly increased with the use of molecular
   systematic techniques. The gekkonid genus Cyrtodactylus Gray, 1827 is
   one example of a group that has undergone a particularly rapid increase
   in recognized diversity due to molecular systematic studies. Many of
   these new species result from recognizing closely related but
   diagnosable lineages into sister taxa. Our study implements a
   multi-faceted approach to delimit cryptic Cyrtodactylus lineages on the
   Southeast Asian island of Borneo using morphological, ecological, and
   multilocus genetic data. We use multiple species delimitation models to
   assess species boundaries and identify clades that warrant further
   investigation. Unlike most morphologically cryptic species that have
   recently diverged, we find evidence of cryptic lineages being
   polyphyletic. Using multivariate statistical analyses, we show minimal
   phenotypic distinction between putative cryptic species within the C.
   pubisulcus complex. Despite not finding morphologically diagnostic
   characters, we demonstrate strong evidence for the specific recognition
   of C. hantu sp. nov. and C. miriensis sp. nov., which are currently
   considered conspecific with C. pubisulcus, from Sarawak, Malaysia. Our
   new concept for C. pubisulcus restricts the geographic range of the
   species to specific regions in western Sarawak, Malaysia, thus
   underscoring the need to conserve the limited remaining habitats of
   these species, as well as the considerable undescribed diversity across
   Borneo.},

Title = {Out of the trap: A new phytothelm-breeding species of Philautus and an

Abstract = {Bush frogs of the genus Philautus are a species-rich group of the Asian
   tree frogs Rhacophoridae, which are known for their diverse reproductive
   biology. Within Philautus, reproduction has been described via
   endotrophic tadpoles and by direct terrestrial development. Here, we
   provide results of phylogenetic analyses based on the most comprehensive
   sampling of Bornean Philautus to date. As a result of an integrative
   taxonomic study using mitochondrial and nuclear markers, along with
   morphological and bioacoustic data, we describe a spectacular new
   species of this genus from the island of Borneo. The ecology of the new
   species of Philautus is closely associated with the carnivorous pitcher
   plant, Nepenthes mollis. The unusually large eggs are laid in the fluid
   of the pitcher and the endotrophic tadpoles, characterized by reduced
   mouthparts, small oral orifice and large intestinal yolk mass, complete
   their development in this environment. Molecular data and synapomorphic
   larval characters support the sister group relationship of the new
   species to P. macroscelis: both belong to the early diverged lineages in
   the Philautus tree, whose phylogenetic relationships could not be fully
   resolved. The new record of endotrophic tadpoles challenges again the
   hypothesis that terrestrial direct development is the plesiomorphic mode
   in this genus. Further, we discuss the nature of the frog-plant
   interaction that could represent a new case of mutualism. The frog
   provides the plant with a source of nitrogen by depositing yolk-rich
   eggs in the liquid of the pitcher. The plant, on the other hand, offers
   an exclusively protected space for the development of tadpoles in a
   habitat that otherwise has few permanent bodies of water and many
   competing frog species.},

Title = {The Rufous Sengi is not Elephantulus-Multilocus reconstruction of

Abstract = {The evolutionary history of sengis (Macroscelidea), an order of
   Afrotheria, has been studied in last decades by molecular phylogenetic
   approaches. These studies proposed an evolutionary scenario for this
   group of mammals and, surprisingly, revealed the presence of two new
   genera, delimited and described in the last five years. However, most
   research has relied solely upon samples from Southern Africa, while the
   genetic information from East Africa and the Zambezian region was only
   fragmentary. Here, we provide the most complete multilocus phylogeny of
   the subfamily Macroscelidinae, using new material mainly from eastern
   Africa, Zambia, and Angola. In agreement with previous studies, we
   confirmed the presence of two major radiations in the group,
   corresponding to recently defined tribes Macroscelidini and
   Elephantulini. Contrary to previous studies, however, we provide clear
   genetic evidence that the widespread East African Rufous Sengi
   (Elephantulus rufescens) belongs to the recently delimited genus
   Galegeeska. This finding is in agreement with morphological traits and
   with general biogeographical patterns in sub-Saharan Africa. Revised
   divergence dating using a multispecies coalescent approach revealed much
   younger splits in Macroscelidea, compared with previous studies, with a
   majority of recent species appearing in the Plio-Pleistocene. The genus
   Galegeeska thus represents a typical mammalian genus of the Somali-Masai
   bioregion and its current diversity (at least two recognized species, G.
   revoilii and G. rufescens) arose during the Pleistocene climatic
   oscillations, which is in agreement with other studies of small mammals
   in this region.},

Abstract = {Yellow house bats (Scotophilus) have been known for centuries as a
   widespread genus of vesper bats in the Indomalayan Region. Despite this,
   their taxonomic status and phylogeographical patterns remain unclear due
   to differing criteria employed by early taxonomists and inconsistencies
   between morphological and molecular assessments. To address these
   issues, we undertook a comparative phylogeographic analysis of Asian
   Scotophilus spp. using integrated genetic and morphological analyses of
   samples collected across the region. These demonstrate that yellow house
   bats in Asia can be classified into just two widespread species, namely
   the smaller S. kuhlii (e.g., FA <= 53.1 mm, GLS <= 20.18 mm) and the
   larger S. heathii (e.g., FA >= 53.4 mm, GLS >= 20.85 mm), which occur in
   sympatry in different parts of the Indomalayan Region. Although these
   two sympatric species share similar eco-ethological preferences, they
   differ considerably in their geographic distributions and intraspecific
   variation in mtDNA sequences and morphological traits. These disparities
   were likely misinterpreted as indicating potential cryptic diversity in
   previous studies, whereas we suggest they are related to interspecific
   differences in sex-biased gene flow and phenotypic plasticity to adapt
   to varying environments. Our study highlights the importance of using
   multiple datasets to resolve taxonomic uncertainties and reconstruct
   demographic and phylogeographic histories of sympatric species.},

Abstract = {The study of avian species diversity and abundance at the Taunsa Barrage
   Ramsar site was carried out from September 2019 to March 2020. Taunsa
   Barrage is an important wetland for international and local migratory
   birds, including waterfowls, waders, and long-distance migrant avifauna.
   Data were collected by direct counts made on four-point transects
   representing a disturbance gradient due to humans and different
   habitats. Species diversity indices, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
   other statistical methods were used to analyze data. A total of 150
   avian species of 19 orders and 53 families were recorded. These included
   66 migrant species and 84 resident species. The spotting of ten globally
   threatened species also highlights the importance of wetland for avian
   species. On average, 1511 +/- 373 (mean +/- SD) species of birds were
   recorded every month. Shannon's diversity index indicated that Transect
   Point 2 had higher species diversity (H'=3.779), followed by Transect
   Points 3, 4, and 1 (H'=3.769, H'=3.491, and H'=3.457, respectively).
   Evenness index showed that birds evenly distributed in September
   (E=0.5584) than November (E=0.3109). ANOVA showed a significant
   difference (F=4.800, df=3, P=0.002) of avian diversity and abundance
   among the transect points. But there was no statistically significant
   interaction between months (F=1.23, df=6, P=0.233). The results showed
   that the Taunsa Barrage Ramsar site harbors plenty of resident migratory
   and threatened bird species. Hence, it is important to protect its
   habitat and need to protect avian diversity by overcoming major threats.},

Abstract = {Species with large distributions provide unique opportunities to test
   how geography has influenced biotic diversification. In this work, we
   aimed to explore the effect of geographic barriers on the distribution
   of the phenotypic and genetic variation of a spider species that is
   widespread in continental and insular America. We obtained an alignment
   of the mitochondrial locus Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) for 408
   individuals across the geographic range of Gasteracantha cancriformis.
   We used phylogenetics, population genetics, and morphology to explore
   the genetic and phenotypic variation of this species. We found five
   genetically differentiated and geographically structured populations.
   Three of them are distributed in continental America, separated by the
   Andes mountains, and two are in the Caribbean and Galapagos Islands.
   Some of these geographic clades shared haplotypes between them, which
   may be a consequence of dispersal. We detected at least 20 phenotypes of
   G. cancriformis, some of which were exclusive to a geographic region,
   while others occurred in multiple regions. We did not observe
   well-defined morphological differences across male genitalia. This
   evidence suggests that G. cancriformis is a widespread species with high
   phenotypic variation that should be explored in more depth.},

Abstract = {Recently published molecular and total evidence phylogenies of the
   mega-diverse rove beetle subfamily Aleocharinae defined a backbone for
   the greatly needed further detailed phylogenetic research and
   large-scale reclassification of this lineage. Given the enormous species
   diversity of Aleocharinae, wise taxon sampling is crucial for such
   research. To facilitate that and place future systematic investigations
   on a solid phylogenetic basis, here we provide a review of all 62
   current tribes of Aleocharinae based on information from 191 references,
   where we summarize all outstanding phylogenetic questions ever
   considered about each tribe. For each tribe, we provide current
   diagnoses as they are understood now and, where possible, we stress
   emerging monophyletic clades within or across the current legacy tribes
   and provide their diagnostic features too.},

Title = {Phylogenomics of the bumblebee catfishes (Siluriformes:

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Neotropical catfishes of the family Pseudopimelodidae comprise 53
   species allocated to seven genera widely distributed in South America
   from northwestern Colombia and Venezuela to Argentina and Uruguay.
   Intergeneric relationships based on morphology-based phylogenies are
   conflicting, and the interspecific relationships remain incipient. We
   conducted the first molecular phylogeny of the family by analyzing
   sequence data from ultraconserved elements (UCEs) of the genome for 33
   specimens of Pseudopimelodidae and 19 related taxa. Phylogenetic
   relationships were accessed by concatenated matrices using Bayesian
   inference and, maximum likelihood, and the coalescent approach by a
   species tree analysis. The phylogeny with 868 UCE loci and 906,689 bp
   strongly support the monophyly of Pseudopimelodidae, and the arrangement
   of two major subclades herein classified as subfamilies
   Pseudopimelodinae and the newly proposed Batrochoglaninae.
   Pseudopimelodinae is composed by Cruciglanis sister to Pseudopimelodus
   and Rhyacoglanis, whereas the new subfamily Batrochoglaninae is composed
   by Cephalosilurus and Lophiosilurus as sister to Batrochoglanis and
   Microglanis. Pseudopimelodinae is supported by five morphological
   synapomorphies and Batrochoglaninae supported by three such
   synapomorphies. The results of this study will surely guide future
   research aiming to delimit and describe species within the monophyletic
   groups.},
