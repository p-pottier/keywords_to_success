Abstract = {Cryptic diversity not only introduces confusion to taxonomic studies,
   but it also poses major challenges to conservation and environmental
   legislation. One such troubling group are the Mountain Dragons in the
   genus Diploderma in Southwest China. Previous studies have suggested
   that the genus contains considerable cryptic diversity, particularly in
   the D. flaviceps complex. Owing to taxonomic confusion, micro-endemic
   lineages are still neglected by the Chinese wildlife protection laws,
   despite their urgent conservation needs. Combining multivariate
   morphological and multi-locus phylogenetic data, we provide the first
   integrative systematic revision of the genus Diploderma. Specifically,
   we confirm that the six examined populations of D. cf. flaviceps from
   the upper Jinsha and Yalong River Valleys in Sichuan and Yunnan
   Provinces represent six cryptic, undescribed lineages, and we describe
   each of them as a new species. With the updated taxonomy and
   distribution information, we discuss the taxonomy of the D. flaviceps
   complex in Southwest China, provide an updated diagnostic key along with
   distributional ranges for all species of the genus, and discuss some of
   the suspicious records of other congeners in China. Lastly, we evaluate
   the IUCN status of each of the six new species and highlight the major
   challenges for Diploderma conservation in China due to delayed
   environmental legislation and misleading conservation assessments.},

Title = {Integrative taxonomy reveals two species and intraspecific

Abstract = {Modern taxonomy relies on the unified species concept and integrative
   approaches to delimit evolutionary coherent taxa. The western
   Mediterranean vipers within the Vipera latastei-monticola complex
   (Vipera latastei and Vipera monticola) have a rather old taxonomic
   history marked by the prevalence of morphological criteria in the
   recognition of taxonomic units. Recent phylogenetic inferences, however,
   contradict this taxonomic scenario, highlighting the need of integrative
   studies to properly evaluate the taxonomy of this complex. Here, we
   apply an integrative taxonomic approach, combining phylogeographic,
   morphological, and ecological analyses, to identify and describe
   evolutionary coherent taxonomic units within the Vipera
   latastei-monticola complex. Using dated mtDNA phylogenetic
   relationships, we spatially delimit two levels of evolutionary units,
   which are the subject of morphological and ecological comparisons. The
   first level corresponds to two Miocene vicariant clades, with
   considerable morphological distinctiveness that we identified as
   different species: V. latastei in the Iberian Peninsula, and V.
   monticola in North Africa. The second level corresponds to three
   Pliocene parapatric lineages within each of these species, which we
   recognized with subspecific status due to non-apparent geographic
   isolation and variable levels of phenotypic distinctiveness.
   Consequently, we propose distributional rearrangements in the previously
   recognized taxa, as well as define three new subspecies: Vipera latastei
   arundana ssp. nov. in southern Iberia, Vipera monticola atlantica ssp.
   nov. in the western High Atlas Mountains and Vipera monticola
   saintgironsi ssp. nov. in the eastern High Atlas, Middle Atlas, Rif,
   Tellian Atlas and Aures Mountains. Our proposed taxonomic scenario
   anticipates important outcomes for the conservation status of these
   Mediterranean taxa.},

Abstract = {Based on 1031 samples of grass snakes from Central Europe, we examine
   the recently reported occurrence of the southern subspecies of the
   barred grass snake (Natrix helvetica sicula) in southern Bavaria,
   Germany. Using 13 microsatellite loci and mtDNA coding for the cytb gene
   and the partial ND4 gene plus adjacent tRNAs, we show that N. h. sicula
   is restricted to a few river valleys (Inn, Isar, Loisach) in
   southernmost Bavaria and adjacent Tyrol, Austria. At the widening of the
   river valleys into the pre-Alpine plains, N. h. sicula hybridizes
   locally with the common grass snake (Natrix natrix) in a bimodal hybrid
   zone. Our study provides evidence that Central Europe was colonized by
   Natrix helvetica over two distinct immigration routes. In addition to
   the previously known western route of the nominotypical subspecies,
   leading to the colonization of the Rhine region, N. h. sicula crossed
   the Alps, most likely using the Brenner Pass and/or the Reschen Pass.
   Our study underlines that the Alps are not an impermeable biogeographic
   barrier, as often assumed. North of the Alps, the combination of
   geographic setting (occurrence of N. h. sicula in sheltered Alpine
   valleys) and population-density-dependent blocking of immigrants by the
   resident species (N. natrix), acting in concert with intrinsic genetic
   factors, prevented the formation of a geographically more extended
   hybrid zone. Unlike N. helvetica, the two subspecies of N. natrix
   hybridize north of the Alps broadly, in accordance with their better
   genetic compatibility. Many populations of the resident Central European
   subspecies (Natrix natrix natrix) have been ``genetically swamped{''} by
   Natrix natrix vulgaris immigrating from the Balkans. This led to the
   complete replacement of N. n. natrix by N. n. vulgaris in some regions,
   where today only the mtDNA of the nominotypical subspecies persists.},

Title = {Cryptic Marine Diversity in the Northern Arabian Gulf: An Integrative
   Approach Uncovers a New Species of Oyster (Bivalvia: Ostreidae), Ostrea
   oleomargarita},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Animal biodiversity is greatly underestimated in nontemperate marine
   regions, especially for intertidal benthic organisms such as oysters.
   Recent surveys in the northern Arabian Gulf suggest the presence of
   numerous unidentified species, some of which form shallow reef
   ecosystems while others are cryptic and found under rocks. In this
   study, we focused on small oysters from Kuwait, which show typical
   characteristics in common with the genus Ostrea except for the presence
   of lophine chomata that would link it to the genera Lopha, Dendostrea,
   and Alectryonella. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial and
   nuclear markers unambiguously placed the Kuwait oyster within the
   Ostreinae as a sister to the Japanese species Ostrea futamiensis. The
   hypothesis that the Kuwait oyster represents a new species was assessed
   with phylogenetic and species delimitation methods combined with a
   morphological assessment. Results corroborated the Kuwait oysters as a
   new species herein described as Ostrea oleomargarita Oliver, Salvi, and
   Al-Kandari, sp. nov. The phylogeny of the Ostreinae shows extensive
   disagreement between morphology-based genera and phylogenetic clades.
   The genus Ostrea is polyphyletic, and the form and distribution of
   taxonomic characters such as chomata are not as definitive as suggested
   in previous studies. This study, along with other recent investigations,
   confirmed the Arabian Gulf as a key region for discovering marine animal
   diversity and suggested a possible biogeographic divide between the
   Eastern and Western Indo-Pacific. A pattern that has been documented in
   a growing number of taxa and that warrants further research attention.},

Abstract = {The nudibranch genus Doto is taxonomically problematic in particular,
   and some species are described on the notion of strict monophagy. Here
   we perform species delimitation on NE Atlantic species, as well as
   placing them phylogenetically, using two markers: the mitochondrial COI
   and the nuclear H3. We also study the morphology of the species
   including radular ultrastructure and review food specificity. Specimens
   were first divided into potential species using ABDG on both markers,
   these groups were used as input species for species delimitation
   analyses using BPP, and analyses were performed with both markers
   combined and on H3 only. The analyses delimit 11 and eight species,
   respectively. With the exception of one species for which only COI was
   available, the differences are found in D. fragilis, which is split into
   three groups when COI is included and lumped into one with only H3. Doto
   hystrix is nested within these groups. We also found that specimens from
   Sweden seemingly close to D. maculata in external morphology have
   identical sequences as D. coronata. Analysis of food preferences of the
   species involved in the study contradicts the notion of strict monophagy
   within Doto.},

Abstract = {The Uropeltidae, a family of small, fossorial snakes endemic to south
   Asia, are characterized by highly modified head and tail morphology.
   Their secretive nature has led to a dearth of research regarding
   intraspecific variation in morphology and tail function. Linear
   morphometrics of external size and shape and scale counts were combined
   with 3D geometric morphometric analysis of high-resolution computed
   tomography scans of crania and bony tail-shields to assess intraspecific
   morphological variation in 35 specimens of Rhinophis philippinus.
   Cranial and tail-shield shape differences are slight and subtle, though
   both exhibited significant allometry. Significant sexual dimorphism was
   found only in numbers of ventral scales, numbers of subcaudal scales,
   and tail length. There is no evidence of sexual dimorphism in head,
   cranial or tail-shield shape and size. It is hypothesized that strong
   functional constraints, induced by head-first burrowing in R.
   philippinus, have led to strong stabilizing selection in head and
   cranial shape, with functional constraints outweighing any influence of
   sexual selection. Lack of tail-shield sexual dimorphism (despite strong
   tail length dimorphism) suggests a common function in both sexes, likely
   related to predator avoidance and defense.},

Title = {A New Interactive Web-Based Polytomous Key for Species Identification of

Abstract = {Pin nematodes of the genus Paratylenchus comprise 140 species. This
   group of nematodes is characterized by a quite homogeneous morphology
   and cosmopolitan distribution and is prevalent in cultivated and natural
   soil ecosystems. The present study describes the first interactive and
   illustrated web-assisted polytomous identification key for the genus
   Paratylenchus. The updated Paratylenchus species polytomous key was
   based on a wide list of 24 diagnostic characters generated for the 140
   species comprising this genus. Here we developed a web-assisted method
   to achieve an easy and accurate Paratylenchus species characterization
   that will greatly improve the identification of these plant-parasitic
   nematodes for many diagnostic laboratories and researchers. However,
   this identification needs to be completed with the use of molecular
   markers available for the species due to the existence of species
   complexes studied in former researches. This idea is pointed in the
   polytomous key in the specific species complexes up-to-know. In some
   cases, the presence in the soil as survival stage of few individuals in
   the fourth-stage juvenile (J4) required the use of molecular markers for
   species identification. We suggest the use of at least a fragment of
   mitochondrial COI gene for species identification or the combination of
   nuclear D2-D3 regions of the 28S rRNA and the COI to complement each
   marker. However, for some species complexes, the use of the D2-D3
   regions alone has not enough resolution to separate the putative species
   inside the species complex. Web-based polytomous key was constructed
   using the free software Xper3, for computers and mobile devices
   (smartphones, tablets, and pocket PCS).},

Abstract = {Morphological variation and active migration of sables (Martes zibellina
   Linnaeus, 1758) cause confusion in this species' intraspecific taxonomy.
   Four to 17 subspecies have been described thus far. In this study, we
   clarified sable population structure using 11 microsatellite loci in 665
   specimens from 33 sable populations. According to subspecies taxonomy,
   we expect to find four genetic groups. Our results confirmed the
   presence of two genetic groups in the territories of Western Siberia
   (subspecies Martes zibellina zibellina Linnaeus, 1758) and the Western
   Altai Mountains (subspecies Martes zibellina averini Bashanov, 1943).
   Another genetic group is formed by the populations of the Central
   Siberian Plateau and presumably represents the subspecies Martes
   zibellina yeniseensis Ognev, 1925. Previous descriptions of the area
   occupied by this subspecies include the mountain regions of Southern
   Siberia. We found a few genetic groups in the Baikal region, whereas
   only one subspecies Martes zibellina princeps Birula, 1918 had been
   described previously.},

Title = {Evidence for introgressive hybridization of wild black-necked pheasant

Abstract = {Hybridization with non-native-related taxa, especially with
   introgression, is a major conservation problem, as it may disturb local
   adaptations, resulting in population decline and biodiversity loss. It
   is important to identify hybrid individuals, which can be difficult to
   break up morphologically. Using morphometric and genetic approaches
   {[}multivariate analysis, microsatellites, and amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP)], this research attempts to classify the interaction
   and the prevalence of introgressive hybridization in four native
   pheasant subspecies of Phasianus colchicus with non-native P. c.
   torquatus. According to principal component analysis and canonical
   discriminant function results, hybrid individuals are placed between
   these two major groups of native and exotic birds. Also, we assessed the
   population structure, genetic variation, and gene flow between native
   subspecies and exotic pheasants using 16 microsatellite loci in 129
   samples. Our findings revealed that hybridization occurred between two
   native subspecies, P. c. talischensis and P. c. persicus, and exotic
   subspecies (P. c. torquatus). Observation of hybrids in P. c. persicus
   were almost three times higher than P. c. talischensis. The levels of
   the genetic variation within and among the natural populations were
   investigated using the AFLP markers method to identify hybrids. A total
   of 202 distinct bands were amplified using four primer combinations,
   with 179 of them being polymorphic. AMOVA analysis revealed a low degree
   of genetic differentiation among the populations. The hybrid samples
   were closely related to the P. c. talischensis and P. c. persicus
   populations, according to the UPGMA clusters and discriminant analysis
   of principal components. It appears that disruption of gene flow between
   pheasant populations in the Hyrcanian zone is a serious issue. The data
   from molecular markers prompted us to raise a concern about the genetic
   integrity in some native subspecies in the Iranian plateau. As a result,
   a clear cut-level can now be used to differentiate the hybrids, which is
   also supported by morphological evidence. A direct relationship was
   found between farmed pheasants and hybrid frequency. Farmed individuals
   should be closely monitored, and non-native taxa should not be released
   into the wild.},

Title = {The disjunct distribution of relict earthworm genera clarifies the early

Abstract = {The historical biogeography of the Lumbricidae, the main Palearctic
   earthworm family, may be linked to the paleogeography of their putative
   ancestral range in Iberia-southeastern France-Corsica-Sardinia. Although
   molecular phylogenetics has recently been used to analyze most endemic
   genera in this area, the genus Kritodrilus has not yet been studied. The
   generotype Kritodrilus calarensis and other closely related species
   inhabit southeastern France. However, other species from the Iberian
   Peninsula (e.g., Kr. osellai) have been assigned to Kritodrilus, the
   same for the Vindobonic (Hungarian-Austrian-Czech-Slovakian) Dendrobaena
   mrazeki. In order to unravel the paleobiogeographic, evolutionary, and
   taxonomic significance of Kritodrilus, the aforementioned species (and
   three potential relatives) were sequenced for seven molecular markers.
   Molecular phylogenetic inference recovered a clade of French Kritodrilus
   (including Et. setusmontanus) closely related to the Northwestern
   Iberian Galiciandrilus and Compostelandrilus, the latter being a sister
   clade to the Vindobonic species (described as a new genus).
   Time-calibrated phylogenetic inference estimated that these three clades
   diverged around 55 Ma. Ecological niche models for these clades were
   mainly influenced by the same environmental variables, but showed
   non-overlapping highly suitable areas (except for Kritodrilus).
   Ancestral area reconstruction inferred the origin of the Lumbricidae in
   Corsica-Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula, with eventual expansion
   eastwards toward France, Central Europe, and the Carpato-Balkanic area.
   For Kritodrilus and its relatives, this expansion may have been
   contemporaneous with the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. Later
   climatic changes may explain the strikingly disjunct ranges. This work
   highlights the evolutionary and biogeographic significance of these
   isolated earthworm lineages and the importance of their preservation.},

Abstract = {Integrative taxonomy based on multiple data sets plays an important role
   in species classification, especially in the case of cryptic species.
   Rhabdophis subminiatus is a colubrid snake with broadly geographical
   distribution, and two subspecies (Rhabdophis subminiatus subminiatus and
   Rhabdophis subminiatus helleri) are currently recognized within this
   species. Based on external morphological comparison, mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA)-based phylogeny, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
   phylogeny, and population structure analysis, we explored the
   intraspecific taxonomy of R. subminiatus. Phylogenetic analysis based on
   mtDNA and SNPs consistently uncovered two highly supported lineages
   separated by a large genetic distance, with SNP-based principal
   component analysis (PCA) and population structure analysis displaying
   similar results. Despite the fact that PCA based on morphological data
   did not show population differentiation, unlike the molecular data, we
   suggest that R. s. helleri should be elevated to the specific rank as
   Rhabdophis helleri based on all lines of evidence. The distributional
   boundary between the two species R. helleri and R. subminiatus is
   tentatively proposed.},

Title = {Borrowing the Pentatomomorpha tome from the DNA barcode library:

Abstract = {Pentatomomorpha (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) occurs worldwide with almost
   19,000 species within six superfamilies. Their wide morphological,
   behavioral, and ecological diversity is remarkable, making them subject
   of basic and applied studies. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (cox1) proposed as a DNA barcode for Metazoa is used in
   species discovery and identification, relying on threshold values to
   split intra- and interspecific sequences and a comprehensive library to
   accurate identification. Here, we scanned all the pentatomomorphan cox1
   sequences on Barcode of Life Data System library aiming to provide an
   overview of available data; verify barcoding gaps at generic level;
   infer individual empirical threshold values to distinguish congeneric
   species; and test efficiency of cox1 based on the Probability of Correct
   Identification (PCI) analysis. Our final dataset comprised 12,189
   sequences, covering five superfamilies, 32 families, 460 genera, and
   1068 species. The dataset abundance and composition were biased to
   families with economic importance, that is, Pentatomidae, Lygaeidae,
   Scutelleridae, Coreidae, and Rhyparochromidae. Barcode gaps were
   detected for most of the analyzed genera, reaffirming the efficiency of
   cox1 for Pentatomomorpha. We inferred threshold values for 131 genera
   and found a global PCI of 74.33\%, suggesting that one out of four
   analyzed species suffer from operational biases or hide cryptic species.
   We brought examples to illustrate how cox1 can be used to flag
   inconsistencies, refine, and shed light onto future studies on
   Pentatomomorpha. We emphasize the efficiency of cox1 as DNA barcode for
   these true bugs, advocating for its combined use with, for example,
   morphology in integrative approaches.},

Abstract = {The maintenance mechanisms of hybrid zones between two lineages/species
   and their gene flow dynamics are major topics for speciation studies.
   Elucidating these dynamics can help us to understand the process of
   speciation. The newt Cynops pyrrhogaster is distributed on the main
   islands of Japan and comprises five mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages.
   In this study, we surveyed the genetic relationship between two lineages
   (northern and central) around their boundary. We genotyped 202
   individuals from 24 populations using the mitochondrial cytochrome b
   gene and 12 microsatellite loci. MtDNA analysis revealed that the two
   lineages were distributed parapatrically to each other without
   coexistence, whereas the microsatellite analysis indicated the presence
   of a hybrid zone. The estimated dispersal rates were higher from both
   parental lineages to the hybrid populations than those in the opposite
   directions. These data indicate that the hybrid zone is a tension zone,
   which is maintained by an equilibrium between selection against hybrid
   individuals and the invasion of both parental individuals from adjacent
   areas. The two parental lineages are genetically moderately isolated
   from each other and appear to be biologically independent species. The
   overall dispersal rate was more pronounced in the south-to-north
   direction. More than 10 individuals having central type of mtDNA
   retained some genetic characteristics derived from the northern lineage,
   which can be regarded as genetic footprint of their northern lineage
   ancestor. These results suggest that the hybrid zone has shifted from
   south to north, resulting in replacing the range of the northern lineage
   to that of the central lineage.},

Abstract = {Bark beetle outbreaks and forest fires have imposed severe ecological
   damage and caused billions of dollars in lost resources in recent
   decades. The impact of such combined disturbances is projected to become
   more severe, especially as climate change takes its toll on forest
   ecosystems in the coming years. Here, we investigate the impact of
   multiple disturbances in a demographically heterogeneous tree
   population, using an age-structured difference equation model of bark
   beetle outbreaks and forest fires. We identify two dynamical regimes for
   beetle and fire dynamics. The model predicts that fire helps dampen
   beetle outbreaks not only by removing host trees but also by altering
   the demographic structure of forest stands. We show that a stand
   thinning protocol, which reduces the population size of the largest few
   juvenile classes by a small percentage, is able to significantly reduce
   beetle-induced tree mortality. Our research demonstrates one approach to
   capturing compound disturbances in a mathematical model.},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {501-523},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We present a simple mathematical model for the dynamics of a
   successional pioneer-climax system using difference equations. Each
   population is subject to inter- and intraspecific competition;
   population growth is dependent on the combined densities of both
   species. Nine different geometric cases, corresponding to different
   orientations of the zero-growth isoclines, are possible for this system.
   We fully characterize the long-term dynamics of the model for each of
   the nine cases, uncovering diverse sets of potential behaviors.
   Competitive exclusion of the pioneer species and of the climax species
   are both possible depending on the relative strength of competition.
   Stable coexistence of both species may also occur; in two cases, a
   coexistence state is destabilized through a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation,
   and an attracting invariant circle is born. The invariant circle
   eventually disappears into thin air in a heteroclinic or homoclinic
   bifurcation, leading to the sudden transition of the system to an
   exclusion state. Neither global bifurcation has been observed in a
   discrete-time pioneer-climax model before. The homoclinic bifurcation is
   novel to all pioneer-climax models. We conclude by discussing the
   ecological implications of our results.},

Title = {Exploring the dimensions of metapopulation persistence: a comparison of

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The spatial arrangement of habitat patches in a metapopulation and the
   dispersal connections among them influence metapopulation persistence.
   Metapopulation persistence emerges from a dynamic process, namely the
   serial extinctions and recolonizations of local habitat patches, while
   measures of persistence are typically based solely on structural
   properties of the spatial network (e.g., spatial distance between
   sites). Persistence estimators based on static properties may be unable
   to capture the dynamic nature of persistence. Understanding the shape of
   the distribution of extinction times is a central goal in population
   ecology. Here, we examine the goodness of fit of the power law to patch
   persistence time distributions using data on a foundational
   metapopulation system-the Glanville fritillary butterfly in the angstrom
   land islands. Further, we address the relationship between structural
   measures of metapopulation persistence (i.e., metapopulation capacity)
   and our temporal distributional fits to patch persistence times based on
   a power law. Patch persistence time distributions were well fit by a
   power law for the majority of semi-independent networks. Power law fits
   to persistence time distributions were related to metapopulation
   capacity, linking structural and temporal measures of metapopulation
   persistence. Several environmental variables and measures of network
   topology were correlated with both measures of metapopulation
   persistence, though correlations tended to be stronger for the
   structural measure of metapopulation persistence (i.e., metapopulation
   capacity). Together, our findings suggest that persistence time
   distributions are useful dynamic properties of metapopulations, and
   provide evidence of a relationship between metapopulation structure and
   metapopulation dynamics.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Although past work has considered how evolution and Allee effects each
   shape population spread, these factors have rarely been considered
   together. We develop an integrodifference equation model that tracks
   individuals of multiple dispersal types (i.e., short- and long-distance
   dispersers) of male and female individuals subject to a strong Allee
   effect due to mate-finding process. We use our model to explore how
   mutation between different dispersal types affects the rate of
   population spread, since this evolutionary mechanism has been shown to
   lead to both faster and slower spread in a previous individual-based
   model. We ask, under what conditions does mutation cause the population
   to spread faster (or slower) than it spreads without mutation (from the
   same initial conditions)? We find that mutation can both speed up and
   slow down invasions. Speeding up occurs in a relatively small range of
   parameter space near the Allee threshold of the population. Slowing down
   occurs across a broad range of parameters.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases affect many populations and it should be natural to
   avoid contacts with infected individuals to prevent contagion.
   Recognizability of infected individuals is essential for infection
   avoidance. In the case of sexually transmitted infections, such
   avoidance is accomplished by choosing a healthy mating partner. We find
   that different mating strategies arise as a consequence of evolution of
   infection avoidance. Considering infection avoidance as host willingness
   to accept infection risk upon encountering a potential yet infected
   mating partner, we show that evolutionary bistability occurs: either no
   avoidance evolves or a degree of avoidance is attained at which the host
   population ends up disease-free. In the latter case, evolutionary
   suicide may even occur so that the host population goes extinct.
   Infection avoidance may also be driven by a degree of infection
   visibility and therefore thought of as a parasite trait. In that case,
   parasite crypticity (and hence no avoidance) evolves provided there is
   no cost on the degree of infection (non-)visibility. Considering a
   virulence-visibility trade-off leads to parasite crypticity, too, and no
   virulence. On the other hand, an intermediate degree of infection
   visibility becomes an evolutionary attractor if a
   transmissibility-visibility trade-off is adopted, or when the
   transmissibility-visibility trade-off and the virulence-visibility
   trade-off act simultaneously.},

Title = {Estimation of the present status of the species based on the theoretical
   bounds of environmental noise intensity: An illustration through a big
   abundance data and simulation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sibly et al. (2005) described that most species have a fundamental
   characteristic to follow the theta-logistic growth trait with the convex
   downward trend. The fundamental yardstick of this research work builds
   under the deterministic setup, whereas the involvement of the external
   noise in any growth system is inevitable. But, the involvement of
   external affairs in any species growth can not be well judged only
   through its density dependence; it requires a further assessment. So, we
   frame the theta-logistic model with the stochastic analog in two
   directions, i.e., the discrete and continuous setup. The analysis of the
   discrete stochastic model is manifested by the bifurcation analysis,
   which shows that the attainment of the chaotic regime enhances with the
   increase in noise intensity level. Although the role of chaos in species
   extinction is debatable, a literature survey suggests that chaos with
   stochasticity accelerates the extinction of species. Similarly, in the
   case of the continuous version, we performed a theoretical study on the
   stochastic theta-logistic model to provide a critical value of the noise
   intensity parameter. This threshold magnitude acts as the sustainability
   criterion of any species environmental tolerability. In this connection,
   we use the data of four major taxonomic groups, i.e., Bird, Insect,
   Mammal, and Fish, from the GPDD database and classifies the species
   based on environmental sensitivity. The highly sensitive species have a
   low tolerance level, associated with the small magnitude of
   environmental noise intensity parameter. Moreover, the simulation
   prediction model on these four taxonomic classes also shows that the
   overall extinction probability of the considered birds in our research
   work is almost negligible for the current time window.},

Title = {Nonspreading solutions and patch formation in an integro-difference
   model with a strong Allee effect and overcompensation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 1},
Abstract = {Previous work involving integro-difference equations of a single species
   in a homogenous environment has emphasized spreading behavior in
   unbounded habitats. We show that, under suitable conditions, a simple
   scalar integro-difference equation incorporating a strong Allee effect
   and overcompensation can produce solutions where the population persists
   in an essentially bounded domain without spread despite the homogeneity
   of the environment. These solutions are robust in that they occupy a
   region of full measure in parameter space. We develop orbit diagrams
   showing various patterns of nonspreading solutions from stable
   equilibria, period-two, to higher periodicity. We show that from a
   relatively uniform initial density with small stochastic perturbations,
   a population consisting of multiple isolated patches can emerge. In
   ecological terms, this work suggests a novel endogenous mechanism for
   the creation of patch boundaries.},

Title = {Effects of noise correlation and imperfect data sampling on indicators
   of critical slowing down},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-142},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Critical slowing down-based early warning signals (EWSs) are well-known
   indicators that precede an approaching collapse in complex systems. To
   date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical
   transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated
   noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic
   transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed
   with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can
   advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously
   progresses the system's recovery. However, noise correlation does not
   have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic
   transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the
   occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening.
   Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the
   efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy
   of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However,
   temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated
   noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical
   to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {559-574},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Abrupt transitions leading to algal blooms are quite well known in
   aquatic ecosystems and have important implications for the environment.
   These ecosystem shifts have been largely attributed to nutrient dynamics
   and food web interactions. Contamination with heavy metals such as
   copper can modulate such ecological interactions which in turn may
   impact ecosystem functioning. Motivated by this, we explored the effect
   of copper enrichment on such regime shifts in planktonic systems. We
   integrated copper contamination to a minimal phytoplankton-zooplankton
   model which is known to demonstrate abrupt transitions between ecosystem
   states. Our results suggest that both the toxic and deficient
   concentration of copper in water bodies can lead to regime shift to an
   algal-dominated alternative stable state. Further, interaction with fish
   density can also lead to collapse of population cycles thus leading to
   algal domination in the intermediate copper ranges. Environmental
   stochasticity may result in state transition much prior to the tipping
   point and there is a significant loss in the bimodality on increasing
   intensity and redness of noise. Finally, the impending state shifts due
   to contamination cannot be predicted by the generic early warning
   indicators unless the transition is close enough. Overall the study
   provides fresh impetus to explore regime shifts in ecosystems under the
   influence of anthropogenic changes like chemical contamination.},

Title = {When growing pains and sick days collide: infectious disease can

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {All individuals transition through various life stages over the course
   of their development and nearly all organisms must contend with
   infectious disease at some point in their lives. Yet the intersection of
   these two universal features of life-stage structure and infectious
   disease-and their joint effects on population dynamics are poorly
   understood. Here, we develop a two-stage population model in which
   density dependence acts on juvenile maturation, and infectious disease
   affects either juveniles or adults via reduction in maturation,
   reproduction, or survival. In the absence of disease, this form of
   density dependence can generate persistent population oscillations. We
   examine whether infectious disease further accentuates these
   oscillations (by augmenting their amplitude) or stabilizes them (by
   reducing their amplitude). We find that, for moderate transmission rates
   (a proxy for disease incidence), disease can stabilize dynamics. In
   contrast, fast disease transmission is not generally stabilizing, which
   is, at least in part, due to disease overexploitation of the infectious
   class. Hydra effects are possible in the model due to density
   overcompensation and occur when disease increases juvenile mortality or
   decreases adult fecundity (but do not occur when disease augments adult
   mortality or reduces maturation). Slow maturation, large disease-free
   population size, and strong density-dependent population regulation can
   each lower the transmission rate required for the infectious disease to
   invade the population.},

Abstract = {Theory and empirical work suggest that coral reefs may exhibit
   alternative stable states of coral versus macroalgal dominance. However,
   it is unclear how dispersal of coral and macroalgae among reefs might
   impact this bistability and the resilience of the coral-dominated state.
   We develop a mathematical model to investigate how reef cover dynamics
   are affected by (1) coral and macroalgal dispersal between two reefs and
   (2) heterogeneous grazer abundances. We find that at low coral and
   macroalgal dispersal levels, a new type of stable state emerges with
   both coral and macroalgae present. Furthermore, we show that a reef
   abundant with coral and grazers can support a coral-dominated stable
   state in a second reef depauperate of grazers by dispersal of coral
   larvae. These results help explain previous empirical findings on reefs
   once thought to be incongruent with traditional coral-macroalgal
   alternative stable states theory-such as intermediate coral and
   macroalgal cover stable states and high coral-low grazing scenarios. Our
   findings indicate that changing dispersal levels (e.g., due to climate
   change, reef degradation) between reefs changes the possible stable
   states and the grazing rate at which the coral-dominated state is
   predicted to be stable. This work demonstrates the relevance of
   accounting for the level of dispersal among coral reefs or other
   bistable ecosystems when designing conservation management plans.},

Title = {Analysis of the invasion of a city by Aedes aegypti via mathematical

Volume = {15},

Pages = {65-80},

Abstract = {We analysed data from the invasion of a city by Aedes aegypti by using a
   series of models based on Fisher's reaction-diffusion equation with
   Richard's growth model and Bayesian statistics. The model that best
   explains the invasion of the city was defined through a step-by-step
   process of model selection based on a series of candidate models. As
   explanatory variables, we used the effect of urbanization type and
   climate variables on the parameters of Fisher's equation: carrying
   capacity (K), population growth rate (r), and the diffusion coefficient
   (D). The resulting model is a reaction-diffusion equation with a
   near-zero shape parameter, similar to a Gompertz-type growth. The
   population advance rate of 60.19 m/day allowed Aedes aegypti to fully
   occupy a medium-sized city in 5 months from the estimated date of
   colonization. We found that the carrying capacity was dependent on
   temperature and urbanization type. While the results are coherent with
   existing literature on this species, most of the theory on population
   dynamics of Aedes aegypti usually assumes a logistic growth instead of
   Gompertz population dynamics. This type of growth is faster than
   logistic at densities lower than the inflexion point but slower at
   higher densities. Therefore, it is possible that in a regime in which
   the K depends on the climate, Gompertz dynamics could stabilize the
   population of this species of mosquito faster than assumed by the
   existing theory.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of trait-based metacommunities have attracted much
   attention, but not much is known about how dispersal and spatial
   environmental variability mutually interact with each other to drive
   coexistence patterns and diversity. Here, we present a spatially
   explicit model of competition for two essential resources in a
   metacommunity on a one-dimensional environmental gradient. We find that
   both the strength of dispersal and the range of spatial environmental
   variability affect coexistence patterns, spatial structure, trait
   distribution, and local and regional diversity. Without dispersal,
   species are sorted according to their optimal growth conditions on the
   gradient. With the onset of dispersal, source-sink effects are
   initiated, which increases the effects of environmental filtering and
   interspecific competition and generates trait lumping, so that only a
   few species from an environment-defined trait range can survive.
   Interestingly, for very large dispersal rates, species distributions
   become spatially homogeneous, but nevertheless two species at the
   extreme ends of the trade-off curve can coexist for large environmental
   variability. Local species richness follows a classic hump-shaped
   dependence on dispersal rate, while local and regional diversity exhibit
   a pronounced peak for intermediate values of the environmental
   variability. Our findings provide important insights into the factors
   that shape the structure of trait-based metacommunities.},

Title = {Size-dependent fitness trade-offs of foraging in the presence of

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-189},

Abstract = {Prey species make choices about whether to employ costly predator
   avoidance behaviors throughout their growth and lifecycle. Here, we
   explore the effects of prey size at a given age (ontogenetic size) and
   prey growth on optimal behavior using a dynamic optimization model.
   Under the assumption that prey experience greatest predation risk at
   intermediate or large sizes, and that growth is fastest at intermediate
   or large sizes, we find that prey should generally forage when they are
   small in size and hide when they are larger due to a critical strategy
   switching size threshold. But this is dependent both on the mortality
   risks and on the rate of growth. Higher background mortality rates or
   lower predator-induced detection costs of foraging reduce the size at
   which prey switches from foraging to hiding. Rapid initial growth leads
   to decreased overall survival and a wider range of conditions under
   which the prey hides from the predator. As a test case, the model is
   parametrized with data and applied to understand differing risk-reducing
   behaviors between cannibal and non-cannibal Leptinotarsa decemlineata,
   Colorado potato beetle, larvae. The model predicts that a wide range of
   parameter values lead to differing behaviors of cannibals and
   non-cannibals of the same age due to differences in ontogenetic size. We
   also see that individuals with swifter early growth switch to hiding at
   larger sizes but will often have earlier strategy switching times. This
   increases survival of cannibals to the critical pupation size with the
   largest increases occurring when the baseline death rate is high. Our
   findings suggest that ecological factors that affect the rate of growth
   during development, even if final size is not affected, may have an
   important role in prey responses to predators.},

Title = {Should we account for mesozooplankton reproduction and ontogenetic

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Mesozooplankton play a key role in marine ecosystems as they modulate
   the transfer of energy from phytoplankton to large marine organisms. In
   addition, they directly influence the oceanic cycles of carbon and
   nutrients through vertical migrations, fecal pellet production,
   respiration, and excretion. Mesozooplankton are mainly made up of
   metazoans, which undergo important size changes during their life cycle,
   resulting in significant variations in metabolic rates. However, most
   marine biogeochemical models represent mesozooplankton as protists-like
   organisms. Here, we study the potential caveats of this simplistic
   representation by using a chemostat-like zero-dimensional model with
   four different Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton configurations in
   which the description of mesozooplankton ranges from protist-type
   organisms to using a size-based formulation including explicit
   reproduction and ontogenetic growth. We show that the size-based
   formulation strongly impacts mesozooplankton. First, it generates a
   delay of a few months in the response to an increase in food
   availability. Second, the increase in mesozooplankton biomass displays
   much larger temporal variations, in the form of successive cohorts,
   because of the dependency of the ingestion rate to body size. However,
   the size-based formulation does not affect smaller plankton or nutrient
   concentrations. A proper assessment of these top-down effects would
   require implementing our size-resolved approach in a 3-dimensional
   biogeochemical model. Furthermore, the bottom-up effects on higher
   trophic levels resulting from the significant changes in the temporal
   dynamics of mesozooplankton could be estimated in an end-to-end model
   coupling low and high trophic levels.},

Title = {Be different to be better: the effect of personality on optimal foraging
   with incomplete knowledge},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {575-587},

Abstract = {Many animal populations include a diversity of personalities, and these
   personalities are often linked to foraging strategy. However, it is not
   always clear why populations should evolve to have this diversity.
   Indeed, optimal foraging theory typically seeks out a single optimal
   strategy for individuals in a population. So why do we, in fact, see a
   variety of strategies existing in a single population? Here, we aim to
   provide insight into this conundrum by modelling the particular case of
   foraging seabirds, that forage on patchy prey. These seabirds have only
   partial knowledge of their environment: they do not know exactly where
   the next patch will emerge, but they may have some understanding of
   which locations are more likely to lead to patch emergence than others.
   Many existing optimal foraging studies assume either complete knowledge
   (e.g. Marginal Value Theorem) or no knowledge (e.g. Levy Flight
   Hypothesis), but here we construct a new modelling approach which
   incorporates partial knowledge. In our model, different foraging
   strategies are favoured by different birds along the bold-shy
   personality continuum, so we can assess the optimality of a personality
   type. We show that it is optimal to be shy (resp. bold) when living in a
   population of bold (resp. shy) birds. This observation gives a plausible
   mechanism behind the emergence of diverse personalities. We also show
   that environmental degradation is likely to favour shyer birds and cause
   a decrease in diversity of personality over time.},

Title = {Habitat loss causes long extinction transients in small trophic chains},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Transients in ecology are extremely important since they determine how
   equilibria are approached. The debate on the dynamic stability of
   ecosystems has been largely focused on equilibrium states. However,
   since ecosystems are constantly changing due to climate conditions or to
   perturbations driven by the climate crisis or anthropogenic actions
   (habitat destruction, deforestation, or defaunation), it is important to
   study how dynamics can proceed till equilibria. This article
   investigates the dynamics and transient phenomena in small food chains
   using mathematical models. We are interested in the impact of habitat
   loss in ecosystems with vegetation undergoing facilitation. We provide a
   dynamical study of a small food chain system given by three trophic
   levels: primary producers, i.e., vegetation, herbivores, and predators.
   Our models reveal how habitat loss pushes vegetation towards tipping
   points, how the presence of herbivores in small habitats could promote
   ecosystem's extinction (ecological meltdown), or how the loss of
   predators produce a cascade effect (trophic downgrading).
   Mathematically, these systems exhibit many of the possible local
   bifurcations: saddle-node, transcritical, Andronov-Hopf, together with a
   global bifurcation given by a heteroclinic bifurcation. The associated
   transients are discussed, from the ghost dynamics to the critical
   slowing down tied to the local and global bifurcations. Our work
   highlights how the increase of ecological complexity (trophic levels)
   can imply more complex transitions. This article shows how the
   pernicious effects of perturbations (i.e., habitat loss or hunting
   pressure) on ecosystems could not be immediate, producing extinction
   delays. These theoretical results suggest the possibility that some
   ecosystems could be currently trapped into the (extinction) ghost of
   their stable past.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Mutualisms (reciprocally beneficial heterospecific interactions) are
   thought as susceptible to exploitation by ``cheaters{''} receiving
   benefits from partners without fair return. Theoretical studies suggest
   that partner discrimination is one of the key mechanisms to prevent
   cheaters from prevailing, but recently, a paradox is suggested that
   costly partner discrimination might collapse as the result of decreasing
   in quality variation among potential partners imposed by partner
   discrimination itself. Here, I develop a simple general mathematical
   model that consists of two host strains
   (discriminators/indiscriminators) and two symbiont strains
   (cooperators/non-cooperators) to establish a framework for the
   coevolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. First, I present a basic model, a
   positive equilibrium of which is neutrally stable. Secondly, I derive a
   formula to describe how the equilibrium shifts with a change in
   arbitrary parameters: I show a counter-intuitive result that the
   equilibrium frequency of discriminator hosts decreases as discrimination
   efficiency increases. Finally, I examine how the equilibrium and its
   stability changes by adding dependence of fitness of symbionts or hosts
   on their own frequencies: I find that negative or positive frequency
   dependence makes the equilibrium asymptotically stable or unstable,
   respectively. I also find that mutation and immigration of symbionts
   always make the equilibrium asymptotically stable, even if it does not
   increase low-quality symbionts.},

Abstract = {Elasticity analysis is a key tool in the analysis of matrix population
   models, which describe the dynamics of stage-structured populations in
   ecology and evolution. Elasticities of the dominant eigenvalue of a
   matrix model to matrix entries obey certain symmetries. Yet not all
   consequences of these symmetries are fully appreciated, as they are
   sometimes hidden in mathematical detail. Here, we propose a method to
   reason about these symmetries directly by visual inspection of the life
   cycle graph that corresponds to the matrix model. We present two
   applications of this method, one in ecology and one in evolution. First,
   we prove several conjectures about elasticities that were obtained from
   purely numerical results and that can support population managers in
   decision-making under scarce demographic information. Second, we show
   how to identify candidates for invariant trade-offs in evolutionary
   optimal life cycles. The method extends to the elasticity analysis of
   non-dominant eigenvalues, of the stochastic growth rate and, in
   next-generation matrices, of the basic reproduction number.},

Abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) has long been recognized as a key factor
   in determining rates of spread in biological invasions. Two approaches
   for incorporating LDD in mathematical models of spread are mixed
   dispersal and heavy-tailed dispersal. In this paper, I analyze
   integrodifference equation (IDE) models with mixed-dispersal kernels and
   fat-tailed (a subset of the heavy-tailed class) dispersal kernels to
   study how short- and long-distance dispersal contribute to the spread of
   invasive species. I show that both approaches can lead to biphasic range
   expansions, where an invasion has two distinct phases of spread. In the
   initial phase of spread, the invasion is controlled by short-distance
   dispersal. Long-distance dispersal boosts the speed of spread during the
   ultimate phase, and can have significant effects even when the
   probability of LDD is vanishingly small. For fat-tailed kernels, I
   introduce a method of characterizing the ``shoulder{''} of a dispersal
   kernel, which separates the peak and tail.},

Abstract = {The enhanced or reduced growth of juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus
   masou masou) may result from climate changes to their environment and
   thus impact on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of their life-history
   choices. Male juveniles with status, i.e., if their body size is larger
   than a threshold, stay in the stream and become resident males
   reproducing for multiple years, while those with smaller status, i.e.,
   their body size is below the threshold, migrate to the ocean and return
   to the stream one year later to reproduce only once. Since juvenile
   growth is suppressed by the density of resident males, the fraction of
   resident males may stay in equilibrium or fluctuate wildly over a 2-year
   period. When the threshold value evolves, the convergence stable
   strategy may generate either an equilibrium or large fluctuations of
   male residents. If environmental changes occur faster than the rate of
   evolutionary adaptation, the eco-evolutionary dynamics exhibit a
   qualitative shift in the population dynamics. We also investigated the
   relative assessment models, in which individual life-history choices are
   made based on the individual's relative status within the juvenile
   population. The eco-evolutionary dynamics are very different from the
   absolute assessment model, demonstrating the importance of understanding
   the mechanisms of life history choices when predicting the impacts of
   climate change.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The transformation of ecosystems proceeds at unprecedented rates. Recent
   studies suggest that high rates of environmental change can cause
   rate-induced tipping. In ecological models, the associated rate-induced
   critical transition manifests during transient dynamics in which
   populations drop to dangerously low densities. In this work, we study
   how indirect evolutionary rescue-due to the rapid evolution of a
   predator's trait-can save a prey population from the rate-induced
   collapse. Therefore, we explicitly include the time-dependent dynamics
   of environmental change and evolutionary adaptation in an
   eco-evolutionary system. We then examine how fast the evolutionary
   adaptation needs to be to counteract the response to environmental
   degradation and express this relationship by means of a critical rate.
   Based on this critical rate, we conclude that indirect evolutionary
   rescue is more probable if the predator population possesses a high
   genetic variation and, simultaneously, the environmental change is slow.
   Hence, our results strongly emphasize that the maintenance of
   biodiversity requires a deceleration of the anthropogenic degradation of
   natural habitats.},

Title = {Host plant limitation of butterflies in highly fragmented landscapes},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-175},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Insect herbivores can be limited by host plants in two ways:
   density-dependent competition for food resources or density-independent
   search time limitation. Our understanding of density-dependent host
   plant limitation is relatively well developed and well integrated into
   conservation plans for at-risk insects. Search time limitation, a
   density-independent process, is much less well developed. Here, we
   explore both mechanisms using empirically based models of monarch
   butterfly population dynamics. These mechanisms differ fundamentally in
   their predictions: resource competition leads to matching of herbivore
   densities to host plant densities, and visible competition via
   consumption of host plants. Search time limitation leads to changes in
   population growth rate that can cause herbivore numbers to decline when
   host plant densities are constant. Search time limitation also implies
   that host plants can limit herbivores, even when many individual plants
   are uneaten. For monarch butterflies, our calculations suggest that many
   parts of North America have host plant densities below the threshold for
   search time limitation, which contrasts with the typical assumption of

Title = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics of autotomy},

Abstract = {The act of deliberately removing a body part-called autotomy-is a
   behavior that has appeared frequently across the tree of life. Though
   there are many possible functions for this behavior, it is often thought
   of first as a mechanism to escape predation. In a predator-prey
   interaction, autotomy can therefore confer significant benefits to the
   prey-particularly, the benefit of not being eaten-but it may also incur
   significant costs, including the energy expenditure required to regrow
   the body part and any additional consequences of losing the body part in
   the first place. In addition, the presence of autotomy may affect how
   predators choose to approach prey. Here, we put these costs and benefits
   into a game theory framework and analyze the evolutionary, ecological,
   and eco-evolutionary dynamics of autotomy, considering both predator and
   prey strategies. We also apply our model to an empirical example using
   existing data from porcelain crabs. We find a wide range of effects of
   autotomy on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the predators
   and prey, including the possibility that the prey become locked into
   performing autotomy by the predators and the possibility that autotomy
   can rescue predator-prey coexistence.},

Title = {Coexistence, dispersal and spatial structure in metacommunities: a
   stochastic model approach},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-302},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We propose a stochastic model for interacting species in a metacommunity
   in order to study the factors affecting the intensity of the
   competition/colonization trade-off as a coexistence mechanism in
   metacommunities. We particularly focus on the role of the number of
   local communities and the number of refuges for the inferior competitor.
   The stochastic component is associated with the dispersal process and is
   represented by Poisson random measures. Thus, this stochastic model
   includes two dynamic scales: a continuous one, which refers to the
   interactions among species, and a low frequency one, referring to
   dispersal following a Poisson scheme. We show the well-posedness of the
   model and that it is possible to study its long-term behavior using
   Lyapunov exponents; the extinction of a species is associated with a
   negative slope in the time trajectory of the Lyapunov exponent,
   otherwise, it is equal to zero. We show that the
   competition/colonization trade-off is a function of the dispersal rate
   of the inferior competitor, and that it becomes less intense as the
   number of local communities increases, while the opposite is true with
   an increase in the number of refuges for the inferior competitor. We
   also show that under a priority effect type of scenario, dispersal can
   reverse priority effects and generate coexistence. Our results emphasize
   the importance of coexistence mechanisms related to the topology of the
   system of local communities, and its relationship with dispersal, in
   affecting the result of competition in local communities.},

Title = {Sea-level rise can reverse the conditions that promote the spread of
   ecosystem engineers},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Climate change and its consequences such as sea-level rise will modify
   environmental gradients, altering the spatial spread and persistence of
   plant populations. However, ecosystem engineers can also modify
   environmental gradients. To quantify the potential interactive effects
   of climate change and ecosystem engineering on population spread rates,
   we develop a spatial model that explicitly focuses on feedbacks between
   coastal vegetation growth and the environmental gradient of marsh
   elevation. We use the model to determine how sea-level rise could change
   how ecosystem engineering affects the spread rate of marsh populations.
   The model demonstrates that low levels of ecosystem engineering can
   produce the highest population spread rates in the absence of sea-level
   rise in initially low-elevation marshes. However, higher rates of
   ecosystem engineering and initially higher elevation marshes produce the
   highest population spread rates in the presence of sea-level rise.
   Sea-level rise can therefore reverse the conditions that drive high
   rates of spatial spread: engineers with low rates of spatial spread
   prior to sea-level rise may spread faster as sea levels rise. This
   result suggests that sea-level rise may promote the spread of invasive
   ecosystem engineers that previously experienced low rates of spatial
   spread. Moreover, ecosystem engineering can serve as a mechanism for
   adaptation to climate-driven changes in environmental gradients.
   Ecosystem engineering has the potential to rescue both native and exotic
   plant populations from climate-driven decreases in habitat suitability.},

Title = {Individual heterogeneity affects the outcome of small mammal pest
   eradication},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {219-231},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. The eradication of invasive small mammal pests is a challenging
   undertaking, but is needed in many areas of the world to preserve
   biodiversity. Trapping and poisonous baits are some of the most
   widespread tools for pest control. Most of the models used to make
   predictions and to design effective trapping protocols assume that pest
   populations are behaviourally homogeneous and, in particular, that all
   individuals react the same way when confronted with a trap or bait. In
   this study, we analyse the effect of consistent variations in
   trappability across a pest population on the success of eradication and
   the time taken to be confident that eradication has occurred. 2. We
   present results obtained using both a simple, stochastic,
   individual-based model, and an analytical approach. Simulations were run
   using two different modelling techniques, one where individuals display
   consistent daily behaviour towards traps and one with variable daily
   behaviour. We then show how to use our model to detect and measure
   heterogeneity in a population using capture data. 3. Results show that
   neglecting individual heterogeneity in trappability leads to overly
   optimistic predictions for the efficacy of eradications operations. The
   presence of even a small proportion of relatively trap-shy individuals
   is shown to make eradication much more difficult 4. In this study we
   reveal how individual heterogeneity can affect capture probabilities and
   the outcome of pest eradications. Such information contributes towards
   improved pest management designs, needed by ecological operations making
   use of trapping systems.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {625-640},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Analyses of transient dynamics are critical to understanding infectious
   disease transmission and persistence. Identifying and predicting
   transients across scales, from within-host to community-level patterns,
   plays an important role in combating ongoing epidemics and mitigating
   the risk of future outbreaks. Moreover, greater emphases on
   non-asymptotic processes will enable timely evaluations of wildlife and
   human diseases and lead to improved surveillance efforts, preventive
   responses, and intervention strategies. Here, we explore the
   contributions of transient analyses in recent models spanning the fields
   of epidemiology, movement ecology, and parasitology. In addition to
   their roles in predicting epidemic patterns and endemic outbreaks, we
   explore transients in the contexts of pathogen transmission, resistance,
   and avoidance at various scales of the ecological hierarchy. Examples
   illustrate how (i) transient movement dynamics at the individual host
   level can modify opportunities for transmission events over time; (ii)
   within-host energetic processes often lead to transient dynamics in
   immunity, pathogen load, and transmission potential; (iii) transient
   connectivity between discrete populations in response to environmental
   factors and outbreak dynamics can affect disease spread across spatial
   networks; and (iv) increasing species richness in a community can
   provide transient protection to individuals against infection.
   Ultimately, we suggest that transient analyses offer deeper insights and
   raise new, interdisciplinary questions for disease research,
   consequently broadening the applications of dynamical models for
   outbreak preparedness and management.},

Abstract = {We consider the collective motion of animals in time-varying
   environments, using as a case the diel vertical migration of marine
   copepods. The animals are distributed in space such that each animal
   moves optimally, seeking regions which offer high growth rates and low
   mortalities, subject to costs on excessive movements as well as being in
   regions with high densities of conspecifics. The model applies to
   repeated scenarios such as diel or seasonal patterns, where the animals
   are aware of both current and future environmental conditions. We show
   that this problem can be viewed as a differential game of mean field
   type, and that the evolutionary stable solution, i.e., the Nash
   equilibrium, is characterized by partial differential equations, which
   govern the distributions and migration velocities of animals. These
   equations have similarities to equations that appear in the fluid
   dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid
   fluids. If the environment is constant, the ideal free distribution
   emerges as an equilibrium. We illustrate the theory with a numerical
   example of vertical migrations of oceanic copepods, where animals are
   attracted to nutrient-rich surface waters while repulsed from light
   during daytime due to the presence of visual predators, aiming to reduce
   both proximity to conspecifics and swimming efforts. For this case, we
   show that optimal movements are diel vertical migrations in qualitative
   agreement with observations of copepods.},

Title = {Herbivore population dynamics in response to plant allocation strategies},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {191-202},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {When herbivores feed, plants may respond by altering the quantity of
   edible biomass available to future feeders through mechanisms such as
   compensatory regrowth of edible structures or allocation of biomass to
   inedible reserves. Previous work showed that some forms of compensatory
   regrowth can drive insect outbreaks, but this work assumed regrowth
   occurred without any energetic cost to the plant. While this is a useful
   simplifying assumption for gaining preliminary insights, plants face an
   inherent trade-off between allocating energy to regrowth versus storage.
   Therefore, we cannot truly understand the role of compensatory regrowth
   in driving insect outbreaks without continuing on to more realistic
   scenarios. In this paper, we model the interaction between insect
   herbivores and plants that have a trade-off between compensatory
   regrowth and allocation to inedible reserves in response to herbivory.
   We found that the plant's allocation strategy, described in our model by
   parameters representing the strength of the overcompensatory response
   and the rates at which energy is stored and mobilized for growth,
   strongly affects whether herbivore outbreaks occur. Additional factors,
   such as the strength of food limitation and herbivore interference while
   feeding, influence the frequency of the outbreaks. Overall, we found a
   possible new role of overcompensation to promote herbivore fluctuations
   when it co-occurs with allocation to inedible reserves. We highlight the
   importance of considering trade-offs between tolerance mechanisms that
   plants use in response to herbivory by showing that new dynamics arise
   when different plant allocation strategies occur simultaneously.},

Title = {The regulating effect of growth plasticity on the dynamics of structured
   populations},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {95-113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plasticity is the extent to which life history processes such as growth
   and reproduction depend on the environment. Plasticity in individual
   growth varies widely between taxa. Nonetheless, little is known about
   the effect of plasticity in individual growth on the ecological dynamics
   of populations. In this article, we analyse a physiologically structured
   population model of a consumer population in which the individual growth
   rate can be varied between entirely plastic to entirely non-plastic. We
   derive this population level model from a dynamic energy budget model to
   ensure an accurate energetic coupling between ingestion, somatic
   maintenance, growth and reproduction within an individual. We show that
   the consumer population is either limited by adult fecundity or juvenile
   survival up to maturation, depending on the level of growth plasticity
   and the non-plastic individual growth rate. Under these two regimes, we
   also find two different types of population cycles which again arise due
   to fluctuation in, respectively, juvenile growth rate or adult
   fecundity. In the end, our model not only provides insight into the
   effects of growth plasticity on population dynamics, but also provides a
   link between the dynamics found in age- and size-structured models.},

Title = {Effects of predator novelty on intraguild predation communities with
   adaptive prey defense},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-163},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding coexistence within community modules such as intraguild
   predation (IGP), where an omnivore both preys on and competes with an
   intermediate consumer for a shared resource, has provided insight into
   the mechanisms that promote the persistence of complex food webs.
   Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to
   enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet
   to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have an accurate
   perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses,
   assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator.
   We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP
   coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense,
   whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response;
   and naivete toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to
   accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native
   predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs.
   The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of
   adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would
   persist in the absence of novelty and inducing unstable dynamics in
   previously stable regions of parameter space. Coexistence is predicted
   to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense than to
   naivete, and differentially leads to the exclusion of native predators
   in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low.
   Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a
   trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore
   exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy
   to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our analyses suggest that
   models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding
   predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has
   significant implications for food web dynamics.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {81-92},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dispersal is crucial in governing species response toward climate
   warming. Previous studies suggest that intermediate and
   density-dependent dispersal enables the functioning of a metacommunity,
   stabilizing populations at local and regional scales. Here, we consider
   a spatial ecological model with temperature-dependent traits to
   elucidate dispersal effects in stabilizing population dynamics under
   climate warming. Specifically, we analyze the effect of species
   temperature-dependent life-history traits on a metacommunity dynamics
   with diverse dispersal strategies (i.e., constant and density-dependent
   dispersal), tracked along with different dispersal rates of species
   (relative dispersal). At low and intermediate temperatures, different
   dispersal strategies synchronize or desynchronize the population
   dynamics depending upon dispersal rates. However, high temperatures
   completely synchronize the population trailing constant dispersal,
   weakening the stabilizing dynamics. Furthermore, density-dependent
   dispersal strongly affects the stability of metacommunity at high
   temperatures by increasing or decreasing spatial synchrony depending on
   dispersal rates. In metacommunities with many patches, conditional upon
   temperature, species abundance exhibits coexistence of synchronous and
   asynchronous oscillations, namely the chimera state. Overall, our
   results show that rising temperature may destabilize the dynamics by
   synchronizing populations; however, some dispersal mechanisms might
   impede the adverse outcomes.},

Title = {Examining the generality of the biphasic transition from
   niche-structured to immigration-structured communities},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that as immigration increases,
   ecological communities transition from a niche-structured regime to an
   immigration-structured regime. The niche-structured regime is the domain
   of classic niche models; the immigration-structured regime is the domain
   of island biogeography and related theories. A recent unified model
   predicted a biphasic species-area relationship (SAR) arising from the
   transition between the two regimes, but the generality and scope of this
   relationship remain unclear. Here we study the transition further to
   address three key questions: (1) Can MacArthur and Wilson's classic
   graphical paradigm of intersecting immigration and extinction curves be
   adapted to capture the niche-structured regime that occurs at
   low-immigration rates? (2) Do different ecological models predict a
   similar biphasic SAR? (3) Can the biphasic island SAR be reconciled with
   the classic triphasic SAR observed in mainland biogeography? On the
   first point, we find that the transition can be incorporated into
   MacArthur and Wilson's graphical paradigm by forcing the extinction
   curves sharply downwards at low species richness, reflecting the
   stabilizing effect of niche processes. On the second point, we confirm
   that a variety of simple ecological models produce qualitatively similar
   biphasic SARs. On the third point, we find that a unified model predicts
   an overall four-phase SAR with the second phase being a shallow
   niche-structured phase that is rarely observed in mainland SARs, which
   we hypothesize is because local communities on mainlands are usually in
   the immigration-structured regime.},

Abstract = {Ball-rolling dung beetles shape a portion of dung into a ball and roll
   it away from the dung pile for later burial and consumption. These
   beetles perform dances (rotations and pauses) atop their dung balls in
   order to choose an initial rolling direction and to correct their
   rolling direction (reorient). Previous mathematical modeling showed that
   dung beetles can use reorientation to move away from the dung pile more
   efficiently. In this work, we study whether reorientation can help
   beetles avoid competition (i.e., avoid having their dung balls
   captured), and if so, under what circumstances? This is investigated by
   implementing a model with two different type of beetles, a roller with a
   dung ball and a searcher which seeks to capture that dung ball. We show
   that reorientation can help rollers avoid searchers in a wide range of
   conditions, but that there are some circumstances in which rolling
   without reorienting can be a beetle's optimal strategy. We also show
   that rollers can minimize the probability that their dung ball is
   captured without making precise measurements of the time interval
   between dances or the angular deviation for dances.},

Title = {Noise can create or erase long transient dynamics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {685-695},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent theoretical work has highlighted several mechanisms giving rise
   to so-called long transient dynamics. These long transients
   tantalizingly appear to replicate dynamics seen in real systems-with one
   critical difference: ecological data is noisy, a reality theoretical
   work often ignores. In general, stochasticity is known to have important
   consequences: it can qualitatively alter model dynamics as well as
   impact our ability to infer underlying processes through statistical
   analysis. To explore the effect of stochasticity on qualitative model
   behavior and the implications for our ability to infer underlying
   mechanisms, we generated time series from a simple model of long
   transient behavior with multiplicative noise. We then examined whether
   noise qualitatively changes the expected dynamics of the system and the
   insights that four different statistical methods could provide about the
   underlying dynamics. We found that the expected duration of the long
   transient was significantly reduced in the stochastic model compared to
   the deterministic model. These transient dynamics arise for
   parameterizations very near to a bifurcation point in the deterministic
   model, and we also found that as we varied parameterizations to include
   two alternative stable states, stochasticity caused the population to
   jump from one basin of attraction to another, resulting in time series
   that suggest long transient dynamics. Despite challenges estimating the
   underlying model parameters, we illustrate that statistical inference on
   a single realization may still provide insight into the presence of a
   ghost attractor. Further, we highlight that inference improves, across
   parameterizations, for an increasing number of realizations of the
   process.},

Abstract = {One of the main factors that determines habitat suitability for sessile
   and territorial organisms is the presence or absence of another
   competing individual in that habitat. This type of competition arises in
   populations occupying patches in a metacommunity. Previous studies have
   looked at this process using a continuous-time modeling framework, where
   colonizations and extinctions occur simultaneously. However, different
   colonization processes may be performed by different species, which may
   affect the metacommunity dynamics. We address this issue by developing a
   discrete-time framework that describes these kinds of metacommunity
   interactions, and we consider different colonization dynamics. To
   understand potential dynamics, we consider specific functional forms
   that characterize the colonization and extinction processes of
   metapopulations competing for space as their limiting factor. We then
   provide a mathematical analysis of the models generated by this
   framework, and we compare these results to what is seen in nature and in
   previous models.},

Title = {Soil arthropods indicate the range of plant facilitation on the soil of
   Mediterranean drylands},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {303-319},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Drylands are ecosystems, where lack of rains imposes harsh conditions
   for the survival of organisms. These ecosystems are also susceptible to
   degradation and desertification. Their conservation depends on the
   understanding of the ecological functioning of vegetation and soil. In
   drylands, the vegetation is spatially structured as a mosaic of patches
   (vegetation) and interpatches (bare soil). This structure is a
   consequence of plant-plant interactions (facilitation and competition).
   Empirical data and modeling approaches reinforce the role of ecological
   facilitation for the maintenance of all organisms in drylands. However,
   the true range of facilitation is still poorly known. Here, we explored
   data of meso- and microarthropods living in soil, as bioindicators, to
   infer the range of facilitation provided by plants to soil. As dependent
   variables, we regard data of abundances and species richness collected
   in random patches (independent samples) and bare soil places. Data from
   patch size and distances between bare soil and patches were arranged in
   a single chute. Thus, one may consider a one-dimensional coordinate
   system, where zero is the border; negative coordinates are distances
   between bare soil and the border, while positive coordinates represent
   patch sizes. Discrete portions of this system are taken to calculate
   averages and variances of abundance and species richness. With these
   statistics, we investigate how soil communities vary across the patch
   border. Techniques of data transformation and signal analysis allowed us
   to reduce the data noise, reveal a continuous mean behavior, and fit a
   logistic function. Our findings indicate that soil communities change
   suddenly from simple patterns to numerous and diverse communities in
   bare soil regions. This abrupt change of fauna quantities, around 0.35
   and 0.5 m outside the patch border, means that the facilitation of
   vegetation on soil goes beyond the patch border. However, the abundance
   and richness of soil communities in bare soil are small in comparison to
   overall quantities of soil arthropods. Consequently, variations in
   quantities of arthropods on bare soil do not necessarily reflect the
   main role of these soil arthropods for soil functions, which mainly
   occurs under the patches. Also, we found a minimum patch size (radius
   approximate to 0.5 m) able to maintain high diverse communities in soil.
   Accordingly, our results reveal information that can be interpreted in
   terms of soil amelioration, and, therefore, it indicates the range of
   plant facilitation, and the minimum patch size able to produce soil
   amelioration. These findings provide objective values that can be
   employed to update the general understanding of the ecological dynamics
   of drylands,as well as to better plan restoration and conservation
   actions.},

Title = {Viewing communities as coupled oscillators: elementary forms from Lotka

Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ecosystems and their embedded ecological communities are almost always
   by definition collections of oscillating populations. This is apparent
   given the qualitative reality that oscillations emerge from
   consumer-resource interactions, which are the elementary building blocks
   for ecological communities. It is also likely always the case that
   oscillatory consumer-resource pairs will be connected to one another via
   trophic cross-feeding with shared resources or via competitive
   interactions among resources. Thus, one approach to understanding the
   dynamics of communities conceptualizes them as collections of
   oscillators coupled in various arrangements. Here we look to the
   pioneering work of Kuramoto on coupled oscillators and ask to what
   extent can his insights and approaches be translated to ecological
   systems. We explore the four ecologically significant coupling
   arrangements of the simple case of three oscillator systems with both
   the Kuramoto model and with the classical Lotka-Volterra equations. Our
   results show that the six-dimensional Lotka-Volterra systems behave
   strikingly similarly to that of the corresponding Kuramoto systems
   across all coupling combinations. This qualitative similarity in the
   results between these two approaches suggests that a vast literature on
   coupled oscillators may be relevant in furthering our understanding of
   ecosystem and community organization.},

   relationships},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {311-320},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It has been a century since the species-area relationship (SAR) was
   first proposed as a power law to explain how species richness scales
   with area. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of this
   predominant form. Apart from the power law, numerous empirical studies
   also report a semi-log form of the SAR, but very few have addressed its
   incidence. In this work, we test whether these relationships could
   emerge from the assembly of large random communities on island-like
   systems. The clustering of same-species individuals is central to our
   results, which we incorporate by modifying the self-interaction term in
   the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Our analysis demonstrates that
   the two most widely reported relationship forms can emerge due to
   differences in immigration rates and skewness towards weak interactions.
   We particularly highlight the incidence of the semi-log SAR for low
   immigration rates from a source pool, which is consistent with several
   previous empirical studies. The two SAR forms might show good fits to
   data over a large span of areas but a power-law overestimates species
   richness on smaller islands in remote archipelagoes.},

Abstract = {Consumers must track and acquire resources in complex landscapes. Much
   discussion has focused on the concept of a `resource gradient' and the
   mechanisms by which consumers can take advantage of such gradients as
   they navigate their landscapes in search of resources. However, the
   concept of tracking resource gradients means different things in
   different contexts. Here, we take a synthetic approach and consider six
   different definitions of what it means to search for resources based on
   density or gradients in density. These include scenarios where consumers
   change their movement behavior based on the density of conspecifics, on
   the density of resources, and on spatial or temporal gradients in
   resources. We also consider scenarios involving non-local perception and
   a form of memory. Using a continuous space, continuous time model that
   allows consumers to switch between resource-tracking and random motion,
   we investigate the relative performance of these six different
   strategies. Consumers' success in matching the spatiotemporal
   distributions of their resources differs starkly across the six
   scenarios. Movement strategies based on perception and response to
   temporal (rather than spatial) resource gradients afforded consumers
   with the best opportunities to match resource distributions. All
   scenarios would allow for optimization of resource-matching in terms of
   the underlying parameters, providing opportunities for evolutionary
   adaptation, and links back to classical studies of foraging ecology.},

Abstract = {We develop a compartment model inspired by producer-herbivore-microbe
   soil food webs and determine how the naturally occurring seasonal
   variation in producer and detrital quality affects microbial nutrient
   cycling and the feedback to primary production. We show that seasonal
   changes in the stoichiometric quality of the producer coupled with the
   efficiency of herbivore grazing could induce a switch in the
   stoichiometric signature and therefore the functioning of the microbial
   community. Microbial decomposers are responsible for the flux of
   essential nutrients through an ecosystem. Our model enables one to
   quantitatively understand the tipping points between bacterially or
   fungally dominated decomposer communities, and more generally, the
   complex relationships between microbial decomposers, primary production,
   and nutrient cycling.},

Title = {Indirect facilitation drives species composition and stability in
   drylands},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {189-203},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Dryland ecosystems are likely to respond discontinuously to gradual
   changes in environmental conditions. Direct facilitation between plants,
   whereby plants improve the local environmental conditions for others,
   has been shown to be a mechanism contributing to these discontinuous
   ecosystem transitions. Theoretical models describing dryland vegetation
   dynamics often consider a single plant species and one type of
   facilitation, namely direct facilitation. However, another type of
   facilitation-indirect facilitation-is widespread in dryland ecosystems
   as well; it is performed by plants protected against grazing, the
   nurses, when this protection extends to other plants growing in their
   neighbourhood that are deprived of such protection, the protegees.
   Little is known about the long-term effects of indirect facilitation on
   dryland dynamics. Here, we developed and analysed a theoretical model
   including two species-a nurse and a protegee-and indirect facilitation
   through grazing. We investigated the effects of indirect facilitation on
   species composition, species spatial clustering and the stability of
   dryland ecosystems. We showed that indirect facilitation through grazing
   enables the stable coexistence of the nurse and the protegee and allows
   the reversibility of the protegee extinction. Surprisingly, the strength
   of indirect facilitation affected neither the total nor the
   interspecific vegetation clustering. Our study highlights that spatially
   explicit grazing protection may affect species composition and the
   stability of dryland ecosystems and gives hints about how species
   interactions translate into spatial clustering.},

Abstract = {Marine microbial primary production is influenced by the availability
   and uptake of essential nutrients, including iron. Although marine
   microbes have evolved mechanisms to scavenge sub-nanomolar
   concentrations of iron, recent observations suggest that viruses may
   co-opt these very same mechanisms to facilitate infection. The
   ``Ferrojan Horse Hypothesis{''} proposes that viruses incorporate iron
   atoms into their tail fiber proteins to adsorb to target host receptors.
   Here, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach to consider the
   joint strategies of hosts and viruses in environments with limited
   nutrients (like iron). We analyze the bimatrix game and find that
   evolutionarily stable strategies depend on the stability and quality of
   nutrient conditions. For example, in highly stable iron conditions,
   virus pressure does not change host uptake strategies. However, when
   iron levels are dynamic, virus pressure can lead to fluctuations in the
   extent to which hosts invest in metabolic machinery that increases both
   iron uptake and susceptibility to viral infection. Altogether, this
   evolutionary game model provides further evidence that viral infection
   and nutrient dynamics jointly shape the fate of microbial populations.},

Title = {Modelling the evolution of naturally bounded traits in a population},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-268},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Eco-evolutionary models commonly assume that traits are normally
   distributed in a population, and that the trait bounds do not influence
   the adaptation of traits. However, recent empirical evidence suggests
   that at least some traits are not normally distributed, and there is
   theoretical support for the view that trait bounds can be fundamental to
   trait adaptation. These attributes suggest that a beta distribution,
   which can accommodate unbounded (i.e. normal), singly bounded (i.e.
   gamma) or doubly bounded (beta) trait distributions, may be an
   appropriate alternative assumption for eco-evolutionary models. We
   develop an evolutionary model that represents how the mean values of a
   population's traits change. Implementation of the model requires
   assumptions to be made regarding the relative fitness of the individuals
   in the population, and how their traits are distributed within natural
   bounds. We compare the numerical results of ``population{''} models that
   evolve a plant population and the means of its two traits using our
   eco-evolutionary equations with those of ``phenotype{''} models that
   evolve 10,000 phenotypes, each defined by a pair of trait values, of a
   plant population. The phenotype models do not assume any particular
   trait distribution or fitness, and allow phenotypes to wax and wane
   according to their ability to compete with other phenotypes in the
   population for a finite resource. Comparison of the trait distributions
   obtained by solving 3 coupled population odes with those obtained by
   solving 10,000 coupled phenotype odes reveals very good agreement
   between the approaches for each of four mortality functions. Further, it
   supports the ubiquity of the beta distribution in describing
   evolutionary processes in populations. An advantage of the simple
   population model is that it provides insights into why particular
   results are obtained, which augments the predictive power of the
   modelling, suggesting that in fact a simplified, abstracted modelling
   approach is sometimes preferable to the detailed, complicated
   alternative.},

Title = {Coherence in (meta)community networks},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {395-408},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In a general sense, a metacommunity can be considered as a network of
   communities, the coherence of which is based on characteristics that are
   shared by members of different communities, whatever forces were
   responsible (dispersal, migration, local adaptation, etc.). The purpose
   is to show that by basing the assessment of coherence on the degree of
   nestedness of one community within another with respect to the shared
   characteristics, coherence components can be identified within the
   network. To assess coherence, a measure of nestedness is developed, and
   its application to complex (variable) object differences (including
   multiple traits or characters) is investigated. A community network is
   then viewed as a graph in which the nodes represent the communities and
   the edges connecting nodes are weighted by the reverse of the degrees of
   nestedness between the corresponding communities. Given this framework,
   it is argued that a minimum requirement for a set of communities to be
   coherent is the existence of a spanning tree known from graph theory,
   i.e. a subgraph that connects all nodes through a cycle-free sequence of
   edges with positive weights. Of all spanning trees, minimum spanning
   trees (MST, or spanning trees with the minimum sum of edge weights) are
   most indicative of coherence. By expressing the degree of coherence as
   one minus the average weight of the edges of an MST, it is uniquely
   determined which communities form a coherent set at any given level of
   community distinctness. By this method, community networks can be broken
   down into coherence components that are separated at a specified
   distinctness level. This is illustrated in a worked example showing how
   to apply graph theoretical methods to distinguish coherence components
   at various threshold levels of object difference (resolution) and
   community distinctness. These results provide a basis for discussion of
   coherence gradients and coherence at various levels of distinctness in
   terms of MST-characteristics. As intuitively expected and analytically
   confirmed, coherence is a non-decreasing function of the object
   difference threshold, and the number of coherence components is a
   non-increasing function of both the object difference and the community
   distinctness thresholds.},

Title = {Robustness of life histories to environmental variability in complex
   versus simple life cycles},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {335-344},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Most animal species have a complex life cycle (CLC) with metamorphosis.
   It is thus of interest to examine possible benefits of such life
   histories. The prevailing view is that CLC represents an adaptation for
   genetic decoupling of juvenile and adult traits, thereby allowing life
   stages to respond independently to different selective forces. Here I
   propose an additional potential advantage of CLCs that is, decreased
   variance in population growth rate due to habitat separation of life
   stages. Habitat separation of pre- and post-metamorphic stages means
   that the stages will experience different regimes of environmental
   variability. This is in contrast to species with simple life cycles
   (SLC) whose life stages often occupy one and the same habitat. The
   correlation in the fluctuations of the vital rates of life stages is
   therefore likely to be weaker in complex than in simple life cycles. By
   a theoretical framework using an analytical approach, I have (1) derived
   the relative advantage, in terms of long-run growth rate, of CLC over
   SLC phenotypes for a broad spectrum of life histories, and (2) explored
   which life histories that benefit most by a CLC, that is avoid
   correlation in vital rates between life stages. The direction and
   magnitude of gain depended on life history type and fluctuating vital
   rate. One implication of our study is that species with CLCs should, on
   average, be more robust to increased environmental variability caused by
   global warming than species with SLCs.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Ecology and evolution under changing environments are important in many
   subfields of biology with implications for medicine. Here, we explore an
   example: the consequences of fluctuating environments on the emergence
   of antibiotic resistance, which is an immense and growing problem.
   Typically, high doses of antibiotics are employed to eliminate the
   infection quickly and minimize the time under which resistance may
   emerge. However, this strategy may not be optimal. Since competition can
   reduce fitness and resistance typically has a reproductive cost,
   resistant mutants' fitness can depend on their environment. Here we show
   conditions under which environmental varying fitness can be exploited to
   prevent the emergence of resistance. We develop a stochastic
   Lotka-Volterra model of a microbial system with competing phenotypes: a
   wild strain susceptible to the antibiotic, and a mutant strain that is
   resistant. We investigate the impact of various pulsed applications of
   antibiotics on population suppression. Leveraging competition, we show
   how a strategy of environmental switching can suppress the infection
   while avoiding resistant mutants. We discuss limitations of the
   procedure depending on the microbe and pharmacodynamics and methods to
   ameliorate them.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation promotes coexistence under competition for
   essential resources},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Intraspecific variation may be key to coexistence in diverse
   communities, with some even suggesting it is necessary for large numbers
   of competitors to coexist. However, theory provides little support for
   this argument, instead finding that intraspecific variation generally
   makes it more difficult for species to coexist. Here we present a model
   of competition where two species compete for two essential resources and
   individuals within populations vary in their ability to take up
   different resources. We found a range of cases where intraspecific
   variation expands the range of conditions under which coexistence can
   occur, which provides a mechanism that allows the ecologically neutral
   evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to become ecologically stable. We
   demonstrate that this result relies on nonlinearity in the function that
   describes how traits map onto ecological function. A sigmoid mapping
   function is necessary in order to model essential resources because it
   allows for variation in an unbounded trait while maintaining
   biologically realistic boundaries on uptake rates, and differs from
   other kinds of nonlinearity, which only unidirectionally increase or
   decrease ecological function. The sigmoid function's nonlinearity
   spreads individuals unevenly along the growth function, which allows
   positive growth contributions from some individuals to compensate for
   growth loses from others, akin to source-sink dynamics, leading to
   coexistence. In this way, intraspecific trait variation is able to
   amplify niche differences, thereby strengthening coexistence. We discuss
   empirical systems beyond competition for essential resources in which
   piecewise functions (i.e., thresholds) are important.},

Abstract = {Science is based on studying some aspects of the world while holding
   others constant. The assumptions of what can and cannot be ignored
   implicitly shape our understanding of the world around us. This truth is
   particularly evident when studying biology through mathematical models,
   where one must explicitly state assumptions during the process of model
   building. Although we often recognize that all models are ``wrong{''} in
   their assumptions, we often overlook the corollary that developing
   multiple models that are wrong in different ways can help us triangulate
   truth in our understanding. Theoretical biologists build models in the
   image of how they envision the world, an image that is shaped by their
   scientific identity, experiences, and perspectives. A lack of diversity
   in any of these axes handicaps our ability to understand biological
   systems through theory. However, we can overcome this by collectively
   recognizing our own assumptions, by understanding how perspective shapes
   the development of theory, and - most importantly - by increasing the
   diversity of theoretical biologists (in terms of identity, experiences,
   and perspectives). Combined, this will lead to developing theory that
   provides a richer understanding of the biological world.},

Title = {Selection and biodiversity change},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {367-379},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is a great need to understand how and why biodiversity, which we
   define as the variety of organisms found in a given place, changes over
   time. Current estimates suggest strikingly slow change in traditional
   measures of biodiversity. These estimates seem to contradict rapid
   shifts in the abundance of individual species and have led to a
   rethinking of the mechanisms shaping biodiversity. Conceptual models
   emphasise the role of competition among species or, more recently,
   selection on species identity (i.e. selection that favours some species
   at the expense of others). However, it is difficult to quantify how
   these mechanisms contribute to biodiversity change. To illustrate this
   point, we present cases where strong competition or selection on species
   identity leads to no biodiversity change. In view of this disconnect, we
   develop a new approach to studying biodiversity change using the Price
   equation. We show that biodiversity change responds to selection on
   species' rarity, rather than to either competition or selection on
   species identity. We then show how this insight can be used to quantify
   the effects of the mechanisms previously thought to influence
   biodiversity: (1) selection, (2) (ecological) drift, (3) immigration and
   (4) speciation. Our results suggest the connection between species'
   fates and their rarity is fundamental to understanding biodiversity
   change.},

Title = {Delayed maturity does not offset negative impact afflicted by
   ectoparasitism in salmon},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {429-443},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The negative effects of parasitism on host population dynamics may be
   mediated by plastic compensatory life-history changes in hosts. Theory
   predicts that hosts should shift their life-history towards early
   reproduction in response to virulent pathogens to maximize reproduction
   before death. However, for sublethal infections that affect growth,
   hosts whose fecundity is correlated with body size are predicted to
   shift towards delayed reproduction associated with larger body size and
   higher fecundity. This has been observed in Atlantic salmon and
   parasitic sea lice, via mark-recapture studies that recover mature fish
   from paired groups of control and parasiticide-treated smolts. We
   investigated whether such louse-induced changes to age at maturity can
   offset some of the negative effect of mortality on population growth
   rate in salmon using a structured population matrix model. Model results
   show that delayed maturity can partially compensate for reduced
   survival. However, this only occurs when marine survival is moderate to
   poor and growth conditions at sea are good. Also, the impact of delayed
   maturity on population growth when parameterizing the model with
   empirical data is negligible compared with effects of direct mortality.
   Our model thus suggests that management that works on minimizing the
   effect of sea lice from fish farms on wild salmon should focus mainly on
   correctly quantifying the effect of parasite-induced mortality during
   the smolt stage if the goal is to maximize population growth rate.},

Title = {Spatial heterogeneity of mortality and diffusion rates determines larval
   delivery to adult habitats for coastal marine populations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {525-541},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many benthic animals begin life with a planktonic larval stage during
   which coastal currents may move individuals far from shore. This trait
   is believed to allow individuals to develop away from nearshore
   predators and sibling competition, based on the assumption that
   mortality rates are weaker offshore. However, larvae developing offshore
   often fail to locate suitable coastal habitats. This results in a
   trade-off between nearshore mortality and offshore wastage with
   consequences for larval delivery to adult habitats that have not been
   fully appreciated. We use a reaction-diffusion model to show that when
   the nearshore larval mortality rate is high, larval supply can vary more
   than 10-fold with the offshore mortality rate. If this offshore rate is
   weak, then larval supply is maximized by an intermediate diffusion rate
   or larval duration. While a low-diffusivity coastal boundary layer
   typically improves the larval supply by decreasing wastage, it can also
   reduce the larval supply by preventing individuals from exploiting low
   offshore mortality rates. Finally, the cross-shore structure of the
   mortality rate may influence the alongshore transport of larvae by
   determining how far offshore they reside prior to settling, and,
   consequently, the alongshore currents they experience. Our observations
   contrast with the prior argument that larval supply decreases with
   diffusivity and larval duration due to wastage, and challenge the
   widespread decision to omit cross-shore heterogeneity from studies of
   alongshore movement. Scenarios in which spatial variability in the
   mortality rate has a large effect on recruitment are important both for
   understanding the biological consequences of the larval stage and from a
   modeling perspective.},

Title = {Trait correlations and landscape fragmentation jointly alter expansion
   speed via evolution at the leading edge in simulated range expansions},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-394},

Abstract = {Rapid evolution during range expansion is a key mechanism influencing
   species' ability to colonize new habitat. Understanding how selective
   processes alter expansion speed is thus critical to predicting both the
   spread of invasive species and responses to climate change. Theory
   predicts evolution of increased dispersal and fecundity at the leading
   edge of expansions. However, these traits are often negatively
   correlated, and what conditions might lead to one trait being favoured
   over the other are unclear. Further, while most theory assumes
   populations spread through homogeneously favourable environments, how
   selective processes acting on dispersal and fecundity alter expansion
   dynamics in patchy landscapes is not well understood. We investigated
   the role of landscape fragmentation and trait correlations in
   determining evolutionary trajectories at the leading edge of range
   expansions, and how these in turn alter expansion speed. We simulated
   populations with heritable trade-offs between dispersal and fecundity
   spreading through one-dimensional landscapes with varying degrees of
   fragmentation. We found that, in populations with a weak trade-off, the
   strongest dispersers were selected for at the leading edge. However, in
   highly fragmented landscapes and with a strong trade-off, fecundity was
   instead favoured. Expansion speed was strongly correlated with dispersal
   ability at the leading edge at all levels of patchiness, and variation
   in expansion speed across replicates increased with fragmentation and
   trade-off strength. Our findings demonstrate that evolution induced by
   both landscape structure and trait correlations can alter spread
   dynamics, and that selective processes imposed by spread per se may not
   always be dominant in influencing expansion speed.},

   idiosyncratic effects on local and regional population variabilities in
   meta-food chains},

Abstract = {While habitat loss is a known key driver of biodiversity decline, the
   impact of other landscape properties, such as patch isolation, is far
   less clear. When patch isolation is low, species may benefit from a
   broader range of foraging opportunities, but are at the same time
   adversely affected by higher predation pressure from mobile predators.
   Although previous approaches have successfully linked such effects to
   biodiversity, their impact on local and metapopulation dynamics has
   largely been ignored. Since population dynamics may also be affected by
   environmental disturbances that temporally change the degree of patch
   isolation, such as periodic changes in habitat availability, accurate
   assessment of its link with isolation is highly challenging. To analyze
   the effect of patch isolation on the population dynamics on different
   spatial scales, we simulate a three-species meta-food chain on complex
   networks of habitat patches and assess the average variability of local
   populations and metapopulations, as well as the level of synchronization
   among patches. To evaluate the impact of periodic environmental
   disturbances, we contrast simulations of static landscapes with
   simulations of dynamic landscapes in which 30 percent of the patches
   periodically become unavailable as habitat. We find that increasing mean
   patch isolation often leads to more asynchronous population dynamics,
   depending on the parameterization of the food chain. However, local
   population variability also increases due to indirect effects of
   increased dispersal mortality at high mean patch isolation, consequently
   destabilizing metapopulation dynamics and increasing extinction risk. In
   dynamic landscapes, periodic changes of patch availability on a
   timescale much slower than ecological interactions often fully
   synchronize the dynamics. Further, these changes not only increase the
   variability of local populations and metapopulations, but also mostly
   overrule the effects of mean patch isolation. This may explain the often
   small and inconclusive impact of mean patch isolation in natural
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Understanding the diversity of stakeholders involved in large scale
   forest restoration is essential to its success as restoration is
   fundamentally about people. Stakeholders may be categorized in different
   ways, recognizing that categories hide unique differences. When dealing
   with landscapes or large scales, stakeholders can be found at different
   spatial scales, and those involved in the restoration action may not
   necessarily be the ones benefitting or losing the most from restoration.
   In forest landscape restoration (FLR), each stakeholder may understand
   the approach differently, engage with it in diverse ways, be motivated
   by different benefits and may use it for different outcomes. The purpose
   of this contribution is to better understand how different stakeholders
   in FLR can be categorized and what motivates them to engage in
   restoration. Power dynamics among stakeholders shape decision-making
   related to large scale forest restoration but are often overlooked.
   Exploring some of the contextual specificities of FLR initiatives helps
   to define the range of issues associated with such dynamics among
   stakeholders. I propose to disaggregate `stakeholder engagement'
   focusing on five dimensions to better understand the different
   stakeholders engaged in FLR, and then apply it to one case study in
   Madagascar. Such an approach can support policymakers, project
   developers and managers, as well as other decisionmakers in designing
   more effective FLR interventions.},

Abstract = {Overabundant deer and other large herbivores can degrade ecosystems and
   hamper restoration efforts. We examined the recovery of forest
   understory vegetation and tree regeneration following intensive deer
   management at Duke Farms, a 1108-ha preserve in central New Jersey, USA,
   severely degraded by extremely high densities of deer (> 80 km(-2)) and
   non-indigenous plant species. A 2004 deer cull followed by sustained
   hunting pressure reduced deer densities to 3.8 km(-2) inside a 260-ha
   deer exclosure, and similar to 14 km(-2) outside. We monitored
   understory conditions between 2008 and 2019 in both areas using rapid
   presence/absence assessment techniques and compared stem density
   measures with regional and historical datasets to assess tree
   regeneration. Native vegetation rebounded rapidly, increasing in
   vertical density at browse height by 4.9\% per year inside the exclosure
   and 2.0\% outside, while non-native vegetation increased 3.0\% and 2.4\%
   per year, respectively. Larger (> 30 cm) native tree seedlings became
   12x and 5x more abundant inside and outside the exclosure, respectively,
   relative to nearby forests lacking aggressive deer management. Native
   shrubs and palatable herbs that were virtually eliminated before deer
   culling began, however, remain scarce. Our results demonstrate that
   reducing deer densities can enhance our ability to restore forested
   habitats, even in extremely degraded sites where the region as a whole
   remains severely impaired. Simple methods may be used to track these
   improvements, but both management and monitoring must be sustained, and
   forest understories may need to be augmented by actively planting native
   species and/or controlling non-native species to ultimately succeed.},

Title = {Spread of an Aquatic Invasive Plant, Iris pseudacorus, Following
   Replacement of a Hydraulic Structure},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {238-246},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are heavily modified by hydraulic structures
   (embankments, dams, dikes, causeways, etc.). International efforts to
   restore freshwater ecosystems, along with increased stress on hydraulic
   structures due to climate changeinduced flooding, extreme rain events,
   and sea-level rise, have resulted in increased incidences of breaching
   and removal of these structures. However, modification of hydraulic
   structures can facilitate the dispersal of aquatic invasive species.
   Such an unintended outcome became apparent following the replacement of
   an ageing earthen dam at Greenburn Lake (South Pender Island, British
   Columbia) that appears to have facilitated the spread of Iris
   pseudacorus (Yellow flag iris) into previously uninvaded wetland
   habitat. While best practices to prevent this plant's downstream
   dispersal were implemented, the observed spread offers several practical
   recommendations to mitigate this risk in similar projects. We recommend
   that aquatic invasive species be explicitly considered prior to
   construction as part of an environmental impact assessment.
   Specifically, the spread of I. pseudacorus could have been mitigated
   through 1) enhanced efforts to clean machinery and equipment, 2) timely
   off-site disposal of organic material and sediment containing
   reproductive propagules, 3) cutting and smothering of I. pseudacorus
   within the work area at minimum three months before construction, 4)
   shifting timing of construction to fit within ecologically defined work
   windows that minimize the spread of I. pseudacorus seeds, and 5) use of
   physical barriers to capture suspended and buoyant propagules. The
   utilization of similar methods may reduce the spread of aquatic invasive
   plants during the maintenance or removal of other hydraulic structures.},

Title = {Estimation of Future Native Grass Seed Demand for Restoring Oil and
   Gas-Energy Sprawl in West Texas, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {237-245},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adequate native grass seed supply is a fundamental requirement for
   restoring disturbances associated with oil and gas production in West
   Texas. Knowing the amount and cost of native seed needed would be useful
   to oil and gas operators, seed producers, and conservation planners. We
   used projections of potential land impacts from oil and gas development,
   typical seeding rates, and current market prices to estimate the native
   grass seed supplies necessary and seed cost for low, medium, and high
   potential land-alteration scenarios. We estimate that at least 1.0\% of
   the land area in the region has already been altered by oil and gas
   production, and that an additional 0.6-4.0\% will be impacted by oil and
   gas pad or pipeline construction by 2050. Native seed supply between
   112,000-600,000 kg (247,000-1,330,000 lbs.) of pure live seed (PLS) of
   native grasses valued between US \$10-57 million will be needed for
   restoration to occur on all sites. These estimates provide targets for
   collaborative efforts focused on developing restoration seed source
   capacity through partnerships between seed source developers, the
   seed-production industry, practitioners, and energy producers. Our
   estimates also illustrate potential cost-savings for energy developers
   if land impacts can be minimized.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Globally, grasslands are among the most degraded habitats, and within
   that category tallgrass prairies are especially threatened. To restore
   native species in tallgrass prairie, it is often necessary to
   concurrently remove exotic plant species while restoring the disturbance
   processes that many prairie taxa depend upon. Here, we coupled one
   herbicide application and seed mixture addition with tri-annual
   prescribed fire and annual cattle grazing to explore the consequences
   for floral resource (i.e., nectar-producing) plant communities and
   butterfly communities up to four years later. Each site was divided into
   three equally sized patches which were placed into either control,
   ``spray-only{''}, or ``spray-and-seed{''} treatment groups. We
   quantified both floral resource plant and butterfly communities in the
   year prior to herbicide application and the four years following that
   treatment. In the four years post-treatment, we found that floral
   resource abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time but did
   not significantly vary among treatments. No response to treatment was
   observed in butterflies, but butterfly abundance decreased while
   richness was stable and diversity increased over time, which may
   indicate that the changes to floral resources at the patch scale
   supported more speciose and diverse butterfly communities at the site
   scale. Butterfly abundance decreasing over time could be an effect of
   baseline management or unrelated regional factors. Regardless of whether
   either treatment benefited butterflies, we find support for a one-time
   herbicide application changing the floral community in desirable ways
   and at least not harming butterflies.},

Abstract = {Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations in New Hampshire were
   approaching historical low levels in the late 1990s when broadly
   supported oyster restoration projects were initiated. Since then, the
   state's collaborative program has conducted approximately 20 projects.
   Most consisted of constructing a hard substrate (usually mollusc shells)
   reef base then adding live juvenile oysters ({''}spat-on-shell{''})
   produced in remote setting tanks. Assessments conducted in 2013, 2015,
   and 2019 provided long-term (up to 13 years post-construction) data on
   success and identified potential improvements to the restoration
   protocol involving two design criteria: reef base and site location. All
   three long-term assessments found excessive base burial (sedimentation)
   at many sites, leading to attempts to balance base height, bottom area
   coverage, and available funds. The result for most projects was
   multiple, haphazardly positioned shell mounds extending 0.5 m above the
   bottom. The site location process initially focused on areas where
   oyster reefs occurred historically, but after the 2013 assessment and
   subsequent field experiments, the focus changed to identifying areas
   with the highest potential for recruitment from wild oysters. This
   research, which involved three natural reefs over two years, found 75\%
   of total recruitment occurred < 400 m from the natural reefs. Most
   current restoration projects center around these two design criteria:
   multiple shell mound structure and proximity to a healthy natural reef.
   The New Hampshire experience thus far confirms the emphasis by others on
   the value of long-term assessments, but as is the case in most areas,
   much remains to be learned and accomplished.},

   benefitted from the help of far too many individuals to list here. Most
   are named in the technical and other reports cited, and we again extend
   our thanks to all. The major early funding sources were the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-tration (NOAA) and the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) via state-level funds from the
   Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership (PREP) . After most federal
   funding sources dried up in the late 2000s, the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture through its Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the
   New Hampshire chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) , became the major
   funding sources for oyster restoration projects in New Hamp-shire. We
   thank Mark Zankel, Dave Patrick, Alix Laferriere and Brianna Group of
   TNC for their support and collaboration. We also thank Doug and Ken
   Anderson of Riverside and Pickering Marine and their talented staff, who
   constructed the reef shell bases on many of the projects; their skill
   and willingness to help has been essential. We also thank Justin
   Sunderlin and the folks at Granite State Minerals who kindly donated
   storage space and loading of seasoned shell used to construct many of
   the reef bases. Wayne Moniz of M\&W Livestock has consistently sup-plied
   quality seasoned surf clam shell used to construct the reef bases. The
   New Hampshire chapter of the Coastal Conservation Association donated
   seasoned oyster shell provided by local res-taurants-Robert's Maine
   Grill, Jumpin' Jay's Fish Cafe, Atlantic Grill, Newick's of Dover and of
   Concord, Sander's Fish Market, O Steaks and Seafood, Surf Restaurant,
   Martingale Wharf, Makris Lobster and Steak, and Riverworks-that provided
   the substrate (cultch) used in our remote setting tanks to produce
   spat-on-shell. Tonie Simmons and staff at Muscongus Bay Aquaculture have
   consistently provided ``eyed{''} oyster larvae used to produce the
   spat-on-shell for over 10 years; we very much appreciate their skill and
   efforts in supplying us with a high quality product year after year. We
   thank George Andreau and staff at Seaviewer Cameras for providing high
   quality underwater video systems that allow us to image our reefs. Andy
   Payne conducted thestatistical analysis of the overview data. Two
   anonymous review-ers substantially improved the manuscript. Finally, we

Abstract = {Asian tropical forests have among the highest rates of forest loss in
   the world. Ecological restoration is a vital step for biodiversity
   maintenance and climate change mitigation. For restoration practice,
   evaluation of species performance at early stages is crucial to avoid
   failure of the efforts and for screening species suitable to a region.
   Though the long-term performance of restoration plantings has been
   well-documented, few studies have evaluated the performance during the
   establishment of the planted saplings, especially in South and Southeast
   Asia. Restoration efforts in Northeast India, a region experiencing high
   forest loss, is limited by the lack of species-specific data on survival
   and growth. We compared inter-specific variation in seasonal survival
   and growth rates (diameter and height) for multiple native rainforest
   species from this region. We planted 3022 saplings of 50 species at a
   degraded open forest site. After 18 months, sapling survival varied
   between 9.1-94.3\% for 32 species, and only six species showed
   ``excellent{''} survival after 18 months. Eight out of 17 species that
   were tested for seasonal variation in survival showed significant
   differences in survival between seasons. While the diameter growth rate
   varied for species between seasons, the height growth rate was different
   between both species and season, but the interaction term between
   species and season was not significant. Certain animal-dispersed, medium
   to large-seeded primary forest species performed well and are vital for
   future restoration efforts in this region.},

Abstract = {Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) provide incentives to landowners
   to manage resources in ways that deliver ecosystem services, such as
   through restoration activities. Under a proliferation of initiatives to
   restore degraded lands, innovative institutional arrangements that
   promote ecological restoration are emerging. However, exclusion of the
   human factor is considered a limitation of restoration theory and
   practice, and recognition of men's and women's roles in restoring
   landscapes is largely neglected. As the United Nations Decade on
   Ecosystem Restoration commences, this study uses PES as an entry point
   to explore gender equity in restoration projects. Focused on the Mara
   North Conservancy in Kenya, the study presents a framework for which
   qualitative approaches including Process Net-map and intra-household
   interviews are applied to uncover drivers and constraints associated
   with processes of gender exclusion and inclusion. The results reveal
   that 1) power imbalances condition socio-economic outcomes of PES
   schemes by reinforcing historical inequities in land tenure, and that 2)
   governance structures exclude women from decision-making processes and
   from receiving direct PES benefits despite their labor contributions to
   restoration activities; while men incur financial costs that are not
   adequately accounted for under direct payments. The study demonstrates
   the potential to apply new methodologies and define indicators that
   enable the identification of complex social dimensions in ecological
   restoration. Critical reflection on whether the neglect of social
   aspects restrict the potential for ecological restoration to address the
   very same inequities that contribute to degradation of threatened
   landscapes is encouraged.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Social science is central to effective ecosystem restoration. It can
   enhance stakeholder-driven management practices; excavate assumptions
   about management strategies; and improve understanding of failures and
   successes from restoration efforts. In the Puget Sound of Washington
   State, social science is beginning to play a larger role in ecosystem
   recovery. In this paper, we use a governance-oriented science-policy
   framework to assess the ways in which social science has gained
   structural support in the Puget Sound. We then compare this analysis to
   responses from client users of Puget Sound restoration science to
   identify the extent to which they perceive governance support for social
   science integration. We found that the Puget Sound region has
   substantively enhanced the governance structure for integrating social
   science in restoration and partner agencies have improved their ability
   to engage in meaningful dialogue around social science needs.
   Nevertheless, existing top-down planning processes dominated by natural
   science perspectives often hinder its application.},

Abstract = {The restoration of riparian habitats aims to provide habitat for birds
   and other environmental benefits; yet the evaluation of long-term
   outcomes is rare. To address this knowledge gap, we used bird and
   vegetation data from Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS), in the southern
   San Francisco Bay Area, to assess the progress of two riparian
   revegetation projects (1987 Revegetation, 1993 Revegetation) over nearly
   two decades. Restoration success was measured by changes in 1)
   vegetation structure and composition, and 2) avian abundance, diversity,
   and community composition. We compared the two revegetated areas to a
   remnant riparian reference site and a managed floodplain overflow
   channel in three time periods (1996-1998, 2004-2006, 2012-2014) using
   ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and beta diversity analysis of avian community
   composition. Over time, the restored areas became more similar to the
   remnant riparian reference site in four of seven indices. The avian
   community became more similar across the habitat areas over time,
   although differences remained. Migratory birds declined across all
   habitat areas, while resident and wintering birds declined in one
   revegetated habitat only. Overall we found that different types of data
   told different stories, indicating both convergence with the reference
   site and ongoing differences. Our findings highlight the need for
   multifaceted approaches to evaluating restoration success.},

Abstract = {While attention has been paid largely to forest restoration, meeting
   global land restoration pledges will require scalingup restoration of
   ecosystem services on agricultural land. This paper contributes to the
   literature on restoration practice and agricultural technology adoption,
   by shifting the focus onto the farm and considering the role of
   intrahousehold dynamics in the uptake of farmland restoration practices.
   We examine the intrahousehold decisions and gender relations surrounding
   the trial of two on-farm restoration practices: tree planting and
   planting basins; with over 2,500 farmers in the eastern drylands of
   Kenya. Combining results from household surveys, interviews and focus
   group discussions, our findings reveal that decisions over the uptake of
   restoration practices, although usually initiated by women who attend
   agricultural workshops, are often discussed between husband and wife and
   that multiple social dimensions intersect to shape men's and women's
   interest in, contribution to, and benefit from different practices.
   Furthermore, our study demonstrates that these intrahousehold relations
   are, in turn, shaped by women's participation in innovation processes
   and broader societal changes, particularly the outmigration of rural
   men. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for improving the
   dissemination and uptake of on-farm restoration practices in eastern
   Kenya and achieving more inclusive and gender-equitable outcomes.},

Abstract = {The potential for soil seed banks to contribute to effective habitat
   restoration is not well understood, but seed bank activation could offer
   a cost-effective solution for vegetation establishment of degraded
   sites. Our study site had been affected by deforestation and aeolian
   contamination from copper smelting, resulting in significant erosion and
   large unvegetated patches. To evaluate the potential value of soil seed
   bank activation for restoring intermountain grasslands and mountain
   forests, we set up a greenhouse-scale seed bank experiment to test the
   effect of nutrient amendments previously utilized in field trials in the
   study area. We also tested the effect of native seed augmentation on
   diversity. Our results showed that the tested soils had a significant
   seed bank as 16 volunteer plant species emerged, of which ten were
   native and six were non-native. Nutrient amendments did not affect grass
   seedling numbers, but one treatment (the addition of biofertilizer)
   increased forb numbers. All treatments, except synthetic fertilizer
   increased the total aboveground biomass of the emerging seedlings.
   Native seed augmentation increased grass and forb seedling numbers, but,
   the impact of nutrient amendments changed with seed augmentation, and
   certain nutrient treatments even reduced seedling emergence. While
   biofertilizer combined with mycorrhizae did not affect grass or forb
   seedling numbers, it did increase plant biomass. Activating soil seed
   banks with nutrient additions may be a feasible approach for ecological
   restoration. However, there are significant differences among
   treatments. Further studies would be necessary to reveal the specific
   effects of nutrient addition on soil seed bank activation, especially in
   field settings.},

Title = {Stream Restoration Using Engineered Wood Structures Harvested from

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Modifications of our watersheds, starting with beaver extirpation and
   continuing through current land development practices (whether for
   agriculture, residential, commercial, or institutional uses), have
   negatively impacted our stream resources. Changed watershed hydrology
   has led to stream channel enlargement and isolation from stream valley
   and floodplain resources, with a cascade of resource degradation. Stream
   restoration-specifically restoration using engineered wood structures to
   restore the stream valley and floodplain connection-can sustainably
   reverse the cascade of degradation and regenerate natural processes that
   will continue to improve the system's ecological function over time.
   Wood has been used to enhance fish habitat in streams for decades, but
   it has largely served to augment the use of rock in stream restoration
   projects. Stream restoration using wood is gaining interest and
   acceptance following the publication of manuals such as ``Stream
   Restoration Using Large Wood{''} (Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Army
   Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center, 2016) and ``Low-Tech
   Process Based Restoration Manual{''} (Wheaton et al. 2019).},

Title = {Wetland Restoration in Typha-Dominated Braddock Bay of Lake Ontario},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {247-259},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The barrier beach at the Braddock Bay wetland on Lake Ontario was lost
   to erosion. Without the protective barrier, the area of vegetated
   wetland was reduced by wave attack. Lake-level regulation implemented in
   1960 resulted in cattail (primarily hybrid Typha x glauca), invasion and
   loss of sedge-grass meadow habitat. As part of the Rochester Embayment
   Great Lakes Area of Concern, Braddock Bay was targeted for restoration
   by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The plan included reducing coverage
   by cattails, construction of channels and potholes to improve wildlife
   access to the wetland, creation of spoil mounds along the channels to
   discourage growth of cattail while supporting the growth of sedge-grass
   meadow species, re-creation of the barrier beach, and construction of
   new emergent marsh. We collected vegetation data for three years
   following the 2016 construction activities. Post-restoration results
   showed that cattail cover decreased greatly across years in the cattail
   treatment areas, decreased in lower elevation constructed habitats, and
   gradually increased in higher elevation habitats. Opening of the canopy
   resulted in increased floating and submersed species, and constructed
   mounds hosted wet meadow species. Site-level weighted mean C is
   recommended for future data analyses, rather than FQAI or mean C,
   because it has no observed influence from species richness. Restoration
   results were affected by high lake levels in 2017, identified problems
   in seeding and planting, and meeting construction plans for some channel
   and pothole depths and mound elevations. Pre-restoration soil surveys
   are recommended to reduce construction problems, and adaptive management
   should include invasive species control.},

Title = {Assessing Social Equity in Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR)
   Interventions: Findings from Ghana},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},

Abstract = {Achieving social equity in land and forest restoration is a key
   objective of major international frameworks and commitments, including
   the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Meeting this objective requires
   consideration of key governance questions such as who makes decisions
   about what is restored, where, and how? And how do factors specific to
   local contexts influence which decisions are made, and, in turn, the
   distribution of benefits? Despite the demonstrated importance of social
   equity on project outcomes in many natural resource-based fields, there
   have to date been no assessments of social equity of farmer-managed
   natural regeneration (FMNR), an approach used mainly for restoring
   degraded agricultural land. Drawing on findings from community-based
   fieldwork in 2019-2020 in northeastern Ghana, this paper aims to fill
   this void. We address the following question: How do historical,
   socio-ecological, and political processes condition prospects for social
   equity in FMNR interventions? Key findings were: 1) Preexisting
   hierarchies in authority, control, and access over land and trees shaped
   decision-making in project design and the potential distribution of
   benefits from FMNR 2) FMNR, when implemented on farmland, generally
   aligned with local agroecological practices; but, when implemented to
   restore communal lands, it created tensions with local perceptions of
   equity as well as traditional land and natural resource management
   practices, and 3) The FMNR project reflected the continuing salience of
   dominant political and environmental discourses, which carry
   implications for restoring landscapes with FMNR. To support
   practitioners, we provide several recommendations for strengthening
   social equity of FMNR project designs.},

Title = {Three Approaches to Restoration and Their Implications for Social
   Inclusion},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {27-35},
Month = {MAR-JUN},
Abstract = {Building on the Bonn Challenge, the UN Decade advances global
   restoration on an unprecedented scale. Research increasingly points to
   the need for greater social inclusion in restoration projects, yet the
   approaches that favor such inclusion remain opaque in practice. In this
   paper, we identify three restoration approaches that figure in the
   international agenda and analyze these through the lens of social
   inclusion. We argue that: (1) restoration aimed at bringing ecosystems
   back to a previous state, or ``return{''} restoration, favors natural
   science at the landscape scale over social inclusion at the community
   scale; (2) restoration seeking to recreate functional ecosystems in
   locations away from where the degradation has occurred, or
   ``reorganization{''} restoration, fails to adequately address historical
   inequities and perpetuates legacies of exploitation; and (3)
   ``resilience{''} oriented restoration is promising but remains
   theoretical, and risks instrumentalizing marginalized communities and
   their lands as experimental sites for restoration. Though both
   ``return{''} and ``reorganize{''} restoration face substantial
   criticism, these approaches continue to play a central role in the major
   paradigms and practices that enliven the global restoration agenda. To
   improve prospects for social inclusion in the global restoration
   movement, we advance that the movement must evolve beyond
   productivity-based inclusion schemes and address the role that
   international initiatives play in perpetuating systems of exploitation.
   Finally, we argue that ``resilience{''} restoration offers the most
   promising pathway towards meaningful social inclusion when it can
   empower community members to participate in restoration as agents of
   change and co-experimenters.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The appropriate collection zone for seeds and transplants is a key
   concern for plant restoration ecology, with local sourcing thought to be
   the ``gold standard.{''} Local sourcing is based on the premise that
   most plant species are genetically adapted to the local environment
   through the action of natural selection, and that non-local ecotypes
   will disrupt this adaptation. However, a number of factors may allow
   practitioners to expand sourcing. These include genetic variation that
   is non-adaptive, phenotypic plasticity, climate change, disturbance, and
   a host of practical issues. These factors are reflected in the range of
   collection zone protocols that have been developed by practitioners,
   ranging from local sourcing to bypassing species identity in favor of
   function. In addition, phenotypic plasticity, because it allows a single
   genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental
   variation, may also allow for a broadened collection zone. Little is
   known about the degree of genetic variation and local adaptation for
   most plant species. More evidence-based sourcing could result from
   collaboration between researchers and practitioners, including tracking
   seed and plant sources, their performance at restoration sites, and
   conducting reciprocal transplant studies. Inferring the degree of gene
   flow based on morphological characters has also shown some promise for
   inferring genetic variation among populations. Research that includes
   more robust sampling of populations within species would lead to more
   precise estimates of gene flow in relation to plant traits.},

Abstract = {The networked tank/lake system of Bengaluru has been created by human
   intervention, with a documented history as far back as the 9th century
   C.E. The construction and maintenance of the tanks was overseen by local
   chieftains, and supported by local communities, further managed by
   caste-based and gender-based systems of manual labor. With urban
   expansion, the lakes lost their importance as the primary sources of
   water, leading to large scale degradation. Land-use transformations
   impacted the socio-ecological commons landscape, exacerbating
   marginalization in nature-dependent communities such as grazers and
   fishers due to loss of livelihoods. State initiatives coupled with
   community interventions helped in revival of some lakes in the past
   decade, though others remain severely degraded. Privileged and
   underprivileged caste groups describe a very different picture of the
   past, demonstrating rather divergent perspectives on the way in which
   urbanization and lake revival has impacted their lives. Based on a case
   study of selected lakes in Bengaluru, we establish how social inclusions
   and exclusions are manifested through decision making on lake
   management. We also seek to understand how these hierarchies have
   changed in response to urbanization, with aspirations towards a rhetoric
   of restoration, but a focus on urban greening and recreational
   aesthetics in practice. The impacts of urban transition and lake revival
   are shaped by differing power relationships manifested within the caste
   hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Trial plantings of Castanea dentata (American chestnut) are currently
   underway using reclaimed surface mines as reintroduction sites for
   hybrids bred for disease resistance to canker causing Cryphonectria
   parasitica (chestnut blight). Coalfields of the eastern US coincide with
   the species range, but little is known of its ecological interactions as
   it had largely been extirpated from the landscape by the 1940s.
   Non-native species such as Lespedeza cuneata (sericea lespedeza) have
   been planted extensively in the region for both agriculture and mine
   reclamation and often dominate disturbed sites to form novel systems in
   place of native forests. We investigated the influence of herbaceous
   species on BC2F3 chestnut hybrid establishment and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)
   root colonization on three surface mines in eastern Tennessee that were
   restored using methods to avoid soil compaction. Hybrid chestnut growth,
   vegetation density, and species composition surrounding each seedling
   was assessed after eight growing seasons. ECM fungi present on root
   samples was quantified and identified by DNA sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Sites differed significantly in
   herbaceous cover and seedling growth. Larger seedlings were found on the
   site that was comprised primarily of L. cuneata. Average ECM
   colonization was similar across sites, and groundcover vegetation
   diversity or L. cuneata did not influence ECM species richness. There
   was a difference in ECM community composition among the three sites with
   some fungi displaying subtle changes in species rank. Results suggest
   that in the absence of soil compaction, L. cuneata does not impede
   hybrid chestnut establishment or ECM root colonization in Appalachian
   afforestation projects.},

Title = {Comparison of the Absolute and Relative Difference Spectral Indices to

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Accurate information is needed about burn severity caused by fires to
   design strategies for ecosystem recovery. The Mediterranean zone of
   Chile holds a high level of plant endemism. In summer 2017, nearly half
   a million hectares were severely burnt by fire in this zone. In this
   paper, we assessed the performance of three spectral indices used in
   mapping burn severity (difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}dNBR],
   Relative difference Normalized Burn Ratio {[}RdNBR], and Relativized
   Burn Ratio {[}RBR]) on fragmented populations of the endangered ruil
   tree Nothofagus alessandrii, an endemic species of central Chile. The
   indices were obtained from Sentinel 2 images and their results
   contrasted with field measurements of severity recorded using the
   Composite Burn Index (CBI). The indices estimated the severity
   categories with a high overall accuracy obtained from error matrices and
   reaching values of 77.3, 76.0 and 69.3\% for RdNBR, RBR, and dNBR,
   respectively. The surface estimated for the categories without damage
   (ND), low (L), and medium (M) were greater for the RdNBR and RBR indices
   than for the dNBR, while an opposite tendency was observed for the high
   severity category (H). Our results properly described the spatial
   variability of burn severity. This information may be useful for
   creating and managing plans for the recovery of highly fragmented and
   threatened deciduous ecosystems such as those dominated by ruil. We
   suggest that strategies for recovery or restoration should be oriented
   to the high fire severity zones, where reproductive individuals were
   lost, and the successful seedling recruitment is expected to diminish.},

Title = {Relationships between Overstory and Understory Components of Young
   Natura and Reconstructed Boreal Aspen Stands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {A clonal tree species, Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) typically
   regenerates from root suckers following forest fire but is also capable
   of reproducing via small, wind-dispersed seeds. On land reclaimed
   following oil sands mining in northeastern Alberta, aspen forests are
   naturally regenerating from seed in contrast to nearby fire-origin
   stands that are regenerating, predominantly, from root suckers. This
   study compares relationships between developing canopies and understory
   vegetation communities for aspen stands originating from forest fire and
   from land reclamation activities utilizing forest floor-mineral mix
   (FFMM) and peat-mineral mix (PMM) cover soils. Across all stand types,
   understory biomass was negatively related to canopy stem density,
   indicating competitive interactions are beginning to structure the
   vegetation six years following disturbance. However, several understory
   components exhibited differential responses to developing forest
   canopies in natural and reclaimed sites. Positive correlations between
   overstory and understory components in fire-origin stands were driven by
   native flora while negative correlations on PMM reclamation soils were
   driven by non-native species. On FFMM reclamation soils both positive
   correlations with native species and negative correlations with
   non-native species were seen. The negative relationships point to
   non-native forbs inhibiting the establishment or growth of aspen
   seedlings on reclamation sites. In contrast, native species were
   associated with greater canopy densities in fire-origin stands where an
   open seed bed was not required for establishment. Although precise
   mechanisms are difficult to determine, it is clear that after six years
   of growth, different processes are influencing plant community
   development in reclaimed versus fire-origin boreal aspen stands.},

Title = {Biochar Application and Soil Transfer in Tree Restoration: A
   Meta-Analysis and Field Experiment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {158-167},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Harsh conditions hinder the establishment of trees in restoration of
   forests. Management options to increase survival such as watering or
   shading may be costly or infeasible. However, low-cost techniques like
   soil amendment with biochar (which enhances growth environment) and soil
   transfers (which introduces beneficial microbes) may increase
   establishment success. To assess the potential effects of biochar and
   forest soil transfers on woody plants performance we followed a
   two-pronged approach. We conducted a meta-analysis on the use of biochar
   on woody plants in various restoration contexts. We also carried out a
   field experiment where tree seedlings of Quercus rubra were transplanted
   in three restoration settings. Seedlings were planted under four
   treatments: soil inoculation and biochar (SB), only biochar (BC), only
   soil inoculation (SI), and control (C). We then monitored seedlings
   growth and survival.
   Results from the meta-analysis suggest positive effects of biochar on
   woody plant biomass, with an overall effect size of 0.03 +/- 0.03 (mean
   +/- SD) overall. However, effects varied widely among the genera
   analyzed and were negative for Quercus (-0.04 +/- 0.002). In our field
   experiment, although we did not find significant differences among
   treatments, highest survival probability resulted under SI (mean +/- SD,
   0.11 +/- 0.03) and lowest under C (0.04 +/- 0.02). There was no effect
   of treatment on seedling biomass. Results from our two analyses indicate
   that the use of either, or both, soil amendment techniques may not be
   effective in all systems, therefore, these should be tailored to suit
   the focal species and ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands emphasizes the ``wise use{''} of
   wetlands by conserving the ecological character of wetlands while
   managing the socio-economic value these landscapes hold for different
   stakeholders. Reviewing the Convention obligations, resolutions, and
   guidelines through a feminist political ecology lens, we find them to be
   overtly simplistic and technocratic. A deliberately generic framing of
   socio-ecological interrelations and of economic trade-offs between
   wetland uses and users obscures broader political and social contexts
   which shape complex nature-society interrelations in the use,
   management, and governance of wetlands. Poverty, the cultural
   significance of wetlands-particularly for indigenous communities-and
   gender equality have only recently been considered in wetlands
   management and governance guidelines and interventions. These recent
   additions provide little insight on the power imbalances which shape
   plural values, meanings, experiences, and voices in wetlands use and
   governance, especially for the most marginalized of wetlands users. We
   welcome the call for a ``reformulation{''} of a socio-ecological
   approach to managing and governing wetlands, but caution that unless
   wetlands governance structures and processes are re-politicized, changes
   in policies and approaches will likely remain rhetorical.},

Title = {Plant, Avian, and Butterfly Response to a Native-Grassland Restoration
   in Southern Texas},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Non-native, invasive grasses can pose a threat to biodiversity in the
   southern U.S. Pennisetum ciliare (buffelgrass) is an example of an
   introduced invasive grass that has established in southwestern
   rangelands and negatively influenced biodiversity. Since its
   introduction, millions of hectares in the southwestern U.S. have been
   planted with, or invaded by, buffelgrass. Buffelgrass can form
   monocultures that not only reduce biodiversity but can also change
   ecosystem processes. Native-grassland restorations may be able to
   mitigate such negative impacts of non-native grasses. We con-ducted a
   study to document the response of herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs)
   and wildlife (grassland breeding birds, grassland wintering birds, and
   butterflies) to a 118-ha grassland restoration (involving prescribed
   fire, multiple discing and herbicide applications, and native-plant
   seeding) in La Salle County, Texas during 2013-2019. In general, we
   documented a numerical increase for all three taxa (native plants,
   birds, and butterflies) in species richness and relative abundance on
   the restoration site compared to a control. Our results suggest that
   native-grassland restoration is possible in a landscape dominated by
   buffelgrass. These restoration efforts can increase plant and wildlife
   diversity, although the time and expense required to achieve such
   responses are great.},

Title = {Nurse Rocks as a Minimum-Input Restoration Technique for the Cactus
   Opuntia basilaris},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-63},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much plant recruitment in deserts occurs in shaded microsites below
   canopies of mature perennial plants. Absence of ``nurse plants{''} from
   disturbed sites often hinders ecological recovery. Given uncertainty and
   expense of directly restoring live plants in deserts, we explored using
   abiotic structures-nurse rocks- as a restoration option for
   reestablishing Opuntia basilaris (beavertail pricklypear) on a disturbed
   site in the Sonoran Desert, of the U.S. Wild populations at this site
   were strictly associated with large varnished surface rocks. To examine
   whether rocks functioned similarly as nurses for O. basilaris
   recruitment in disturbed and undisturbed reference habitats, we
   transplanted 30 rooted individuals each into habitat in which large
   varnished surface rocks were removed and into nearby undisturbed
   habitat. Within habitats, half the individuals were transplanted into
   open (no rocks) or rock (rocks surrounding transplants) microsites. In
   the first 15 months after planting, which had average precipitation,
   transplant survival did not differ between microsite types in either
   habitat but functional measures were influenced positively by nurse
   rocks. Nurse rocks sharply increased vegetative growth in 91.7\% of
   transplants in undisturbed habitat and in flowering occurrence in 28.6\%
   of transplants in disturbed habitat. Nurse rocks became even more
   important during extreme drought as the experiment progressed. By 27
   months after planting, 2x (disturbed habitat) and 8x (undisturbed
   habitat) more transplants survived with nurse rocks compared to without.
   As a low-cost technique utilizing on-site material, nurse rocks show
   promise for enhancing revegetation success on disturbed desert sites,
   especially during drought.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Within environmental fields and the broader public, there is increasing
   recognition that former industrial lands and other anthropogenic
   landscapes can provide wildlife habitat, particularly for highly mobile
   wildlife such as birds and insects. Enhancing the habitat quality of
   such variable environments can be complex when balancing restoration
   needs with the needs of wildlife already using these settings. This case
   study presents the restoration of a high-profile 34 ha (85 acre)
   grassland along the Hudson River in New York State, seeded in the 1990s
   atop a former landfill. The project's central challenge entailed
   addressing widespread invasive exotic vegetation that had colonized the
   grassland, without impacting grassland nesting birds of conservation
   concern actively using the site. This article describes the design
   approach used and key aspects of installation and management.
   Incorporation of crowdsourced data, stakeholder involvement,
   specification preparation, weed control strategies, and vegetation
   establishment are discussed along with the site's unique history and its
   potential to inform future public engagement.},

Abstract = {Encroachment of Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass), a non-native
   perennial grass species, challenges land managers in the southwestern
   United States due to its tendency to increase fire frequency and
   displacement of natives. In areas characterized by disturbance, E.
   lehmanniana displaces Agave palmeri (Palmer's agave), an ecologically
   and socioculturally significant native plant species in the Sonoran
   Desert. We explored strategies to enhance short-term A. palmeri
   establishment using a greenhouse experiment. We assessed survival and
   growth responses of transplanted A. palmeri exposed to a variety of
   manipulated variables, including biotic (agave size at planting and E.
   lehmanniana competition) and abiotic (simulated precipitation and
   surface litter). We found a significant increase in A. palmeri biomass
   in the absence of E. lehmanniana in the high and medium watering
   treatments compared to agave in the presence of clipped E. lehmanniana
   neighbors. The presence of E. lehmanniana did not significantly affect
   A. palmeri biomass in the low water treatment. In the medium and low
   watering treatments, A. palmeri with litter had nearly twice the biomass
   as those without litter. The absence of E. lehmanniana with the high
   watering treatment and litter resulted in the largest agave biomass. For
   improved A. palmeri growth (and likely its survival) in restoration
   projects, we recommend supplemental watering and litter addition.
   Removal of E. lehmanniana is also suggested (by hand if possible);
   however, this species could operate as a nurse plant for agaves.},

Title = {Assessing the Social Benefits of Tree Planting by Smallholders in
   Vietnam: Lessons for Large-Scale Reforestation Programs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},

Month = {MAR-JUN},
Abstract = {In recent decades, Vietnam has embarked on several ambitious projects,
   including restoration of coastal mangroves and the expansion of national
   forest cover through large-scale tree planting efforts. Much of the work
   is being carried out by individual households, who now likely control a
   majority of planted productive forest land. Yet despite the strong role
   for smallholders, questions have been raised about the social benefits
   of their participation, and insufficient attention has been paid to
   whether these programs are truly aimed at restoration or more narrowly
   at plantation development only. This paper assesses several of Vietnam's
   recent tree-planting projects against the Society for Ecological
   Restoration's standards, particularly around social benefits, and
   concludes that Vietnam is failing on most measures, ranging from
   stakeholder engagement to natural capital benefits. Overall,
   smallholders mostly view the tree planting projects in terms of
   financial benefits from short rotation cycles for pulp and woodchip
   mills, which offer low value, few social benefits, and little ecological
   restoration potential. The paper argues that Vietnam would benefit from
   more engaged restoration activities that pay attention to social
   benefits for smallholders, ensuring more long-term sustainability for
   both people and forests.},

   Restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION},

Volume = {39},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) frames restoration as
   a momentous nature-based solution for achieving many of the ecological,
   economic, and social objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development
   Goals. Yet, a critical void lies at the heart of this agenda: the lack
   of attention to social and political dimensions of nature and
   restoration initiatives. At this critical juncture, urgent attention is
   needed to the power and politics that shape the values, meanings, and
   science driving restoration; and to the uneven experiences of these
   processes as national restoration pledges touch down in diverse and
   unequal contexts. In this introduction to the special issue on
   ``Restoration for Whom, by Whom?{''}, we critically examine the social
   inclusivity of restoration agendas, policies, and practices as these
   unfold across ecological and geographic scales. We argue that feminist
   political ecology (FPE), with its focus on gendered power relations,
   scale integration, and historical awareness, and its critique of the
   commodification of nature, offers a valuable lens through which to
   examine the socio-political and economic dynamics of restoration. Taking
   an FPE perspective, we elucidate how the ten papers comprising the
   special issue challenge mainstream narratives of environmental
   sustainability and suggest more grounded and nuanced ways forward for
   inclusive restoration initiatives. In conclusion, we highlight the
   urgency of addressing the systemic fault lines that create exclusions in
   restoration policies and practice; and the need to legitimize the plural
   voices, values, situated knowledges, and paths to sustainably transform
   degraded landscapes.},

Abstract = {Local people must be at the center of restoring landscapes. This paper
   adapts the popular Restoration Opportunity Assessment Methodology
   (ROAM), which helps show where land can be restored in a given area by
   growing trees or protecting forests, to the economically poor yet
   resource-rich Sidhi District of Madhya Pradesh in India. By employing an
   intersectional adaptive governance lens and including the perspectives
   of people and organizations throughout the larger social landscape, we
   analyzed the multiple benefits landscape restoration can have on
   ecosystem services, social inclusion, the economy, and local
   livelihoods. These participatory methods and tools draw attention to the
   critical socio-economic components of restoration. The findings indicate
   that different social groups, like powerful men and marginalized women,
   have different restoration goals (even for tree species selection). They
   also show that investing in restoration can create thousands of jobs and
   secure thousands of rural livelihoods. Analyses that produce these
   socioeconomic insights can inform implementation strategies that are
   both inclusive and actionable on the ground. They can also identify
   roadblocks, like unclear land tenure and resource rights, which can
   impede restoration. Most importantly, these inclusive strategies can
   ensure that local people serve as more than passive beneficiaries. They
   place them in their appropriate role as the central stakeholders driving
   implementation.},

Title = {Implications of a cheliceral axial duplication in Tetragnatha versicolor

   development},

Abstract = {The homology of the arachnid chelicera with respect to other head
   appendages in Panarthropoda has long been debated. Gene expression data
   and the re-interpretation of early transitional fossils have supported
   the homology of the deutocerebrum and its associated appendages,
   implying a homology between primary antennae (mandibulates), chelicerae
   (euchelicerates), and chelifores (sea spiders). Nevertheless,
   comparatively little is known about the mechanistic basis of
   proximo-distal (PD) axis induction in chelicerates, much less the basis
   for cheliceral fate specification. Here, we describe a new cheliceral
   teratology in the spider Tetragnatha versicolor Walckenaer, 1841, which
   consists on a duplication of the PD axis of the left chelicera
   associated with a terminal secondary schistomely on the fang of the
   lower axis. This duplication offers clues as to potential shared
   mechanisms of PD axis formation in the chelicera. We review the state of
   knowledge on PD axis induction mechanisms in arthropods and identify
   elements of gene regulatory networks that are key for future functional
   experiments of appendage development in non-insect model systems. Such
   investigations would allow a better understanding of PD axis induction
   of modified and poorly studied arthropod limbs (e.g., chelicerae,
   chelifores, and ovigers).},

Volume = {231},

Abstract = {Most morphological studies focus on adult specimens, or if developmental
   studies are pursued, especially in Euarthropoda, they focus on embryonic
   development. Araneae (spiders) is one of these groups, in consequence
   with understudied post-embryonic development. Here we present aspects of
   the post-embryonic stages of different species of Mesothelae, sister
   group to the remaining spiders (when fossil species are not taken into
   account). We used different imaging methods and measured different
   external morphological structures to detect possible ontogenetic
   changes. One structure exhibiting post-embryonic changes is the
   chelicera. Here the significant change occurs between the last immature
   stage and the adult, yet only in males. For the spinnerets, we could not
   detect ontogenetic changes, but instead a high variability in length and
   width, probably due to their lack of pivot joints between the elements.
   The strongest morphological change during ontogeny occurred on the
   sternum, which begins with a rather roundish shape in the first stage
   and changes to being fairly elongate in shape in the last immature
   stages and the adult. This specific sternum shape only occurs in adults
   of mesothelan spiders, while opisthothelan spiders have a broader
   sternum also in the adult. We discuss our results in an evolutionary
   context, also taking into account recent finds of fossil spiders.},

Abstract = {The morphology and physiology of the oogenesis have been well studied in
   the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus. However, the molecular
   interactions that regulate the process of egg formation, key for the
   reproductive cycle of the vector, is still largely unknown. In order to
   understand the molecular and cellular basis of the oogenesis, we
   examined the function of the gene Bicaudal C (BicC) during oogenesis and
   early development of R. prolixus. We show that R. prolixus BicC
   (Rp-BicC) gene is expressed in the germarium, with cytoplasmic
   distribution, as well as in the follicular epithelium of the developing
   oocytes. RNAi silencing of Rp-BicC resulted in sterile females that lay
   few, small, non-viable eggs. The ovaries are reduced in size and show a
   disarray of the follicular epithelium. This indicates that Rp-BicC has a
   central role in the regulation of oogenesis. Although the follicular
   cells are able to form the chorion, the uptake of vitelline by the
   oocytes is compromised. We show evidence that the polarity of the
   follicular epithelium and the endocytic pathway, which are crucial for
   the proper yolk deposition, are affected. This study provides insights
   into the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte development and show
   that Rp-BicC is important for de developmental of the egg and,
   therefore, a key player in the reproduction of this insect.},

Abstract = {Fox genes encode transcription factors that contain a DNA binding
   domain, the forkhead domain, and are known from diverse animal species.
   The exact homology of the Fox genes of different species is debated and
   this makes inferences about the evolution of the Fox genes, and their
   duplications and losses difficult. We have performed phylogenetic
   analyses of the Fox gene complements of 32 panarthropod species. Our
   results confirm an ancestral complement of FoxA, FoxB, FoxC, FoxD, FoxF,
   FoxG, FoxJ1, FoxJ2/3, FoxK, FoxL1, FoxL2, FoxN1/4, FoxN2/3, FoxO, FoxP,
   and FoxQ2 in the Arthropoda, and additionally FoxH and FoxQ1 in the
   Panarthropoda (including tardigrades and onychophorans). We identify a
   novel Fox gene sub-family, that we designate as FoxT that includes two
   genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Circadianly Regulated Gene (Crg-1) and
   forkhead domain 3F (fd3F). In a very recent paper, the same new Fox gene
   sub-family was identified in insects (Lin et al. 2021). Our analysis
   confirms the presence of FoxT and shows that its members are present
   throughout Panarthropoda. We show that the hitherto unclassified gene
   CG32006 from the fly Drosophila melanogaster belongs to FoxJ1. We also
   detect gene losses: FoxE and FoxM were lost already in the panarthropod
   ancestor, whereas the loss of FoxH occurred in the arthropod ancestor.
   Finally, we find an ortholog of FoxQ1 in the bark scorpion Centruroides
   sculpturatus, confirmed not only by phylogenetic analysis, but also by
   forming an evolutionarily conserved gene cluster with FoxF, FoxC, and
   FoxL1. This suggests that FoxQ1 belongs to the ancestral Fox gene
   complement in panarthropods and also in chelicerates, but has been lost
   at the base of the mandibulate arthropods.},

Abstract = {Gene expression and translation in plant mitochondria remain poorly
   understood due to the complicated transcription of its mRNA. In this
   study, we report the 5' and 3' RNA extremities and promoters of five
   mitochondrial genes, atp1, atp4, atp6, atp9, and cox3. The results
   reveal that four genes (atp1, atp4, atp6, and cox3) are transcribed from
   multiple initiation sites but with a uniform transcript at the 3' end,
   indicating that heterogeneity of the 5' end is a common feature in the
   transcription of kenaf mitochondrial genes. Furthermore, we found that
   the transcription initiation sites of these four genes are significantly
   different in UG93A, UG93B, and the F-1 hybrid. These data indicate that
   nuclear loci and unknown transcription factors within the mitochondria
   of different cytoplasmic types may be involved in mitochondrial
   transcription. Promoter architecture analysis showed that the promoter
   core sequences are conserved in the kenaf mitochondrial genome but are
   highly divergent, suggesting that these elements are essential for the
   promoter activity of mitochondrial genes in kenaf. Our results reveal
   that the heterogeneity of the 5' end and uniformity at the 3' end are
   common transcriptional features of mitochondrial genes. These data
   provide essential information for understanding the transcription of
   mitochondrial genes in kenaf and can be used as a reference for other
   plants.},

Abstract = {The anterior-posterior axis is a central element of the body plan and,
   during amniote gastrulation, forms through several transient domains
   with specific morphogenetic activities. In the chick, experimentally
   proven activity of signalling molecules and transcription factors lead
   to the concept of a `global positioning system' for initial axis
   formation whereas in the (mammotypical) rabbit embryo, a series of
   morphological or molecular domains are part of a putative
   `three-anchor-point model'. Because circular expression patterns of
   genes involved in axis formation exist in both amniote groups prior to,
   and during, gastrulation and may thus be suited to reconcile these
   models, the expression patterns of selected genes known in the chick,
   namely the ones coding for the transcription factors eomes and tbx6, the
   signalling molecule wnt3 and the wnt inhibitor pkdcc, were analysed in
   the rabbit embryonic disc using in situ hybridisation and placing
   emphasis on their germ layer location. Peripheral wnt3 and eomes
   expression in all layers is found initially to be complementary to
   central pkdcc expression in the hypoblast during early axis formation.
   Pkdcc then appears - together with a posterior-anterior gradient in wnt3
   and eomes domains - in the epiblast posteriorly before the emerging
   primitive streak is marked by pkdcc and tbx6 at its anterior and
   posterior extremities, respectively. Conserved circular expression
   patterns deduced from some of this data may point to shared mechanisms
   in amniote axis formation while the reshaping of localised gene
   expression patterns is discussed as part of the `three-anchor-point
   model' for establishing the mammalian body plan.},

Abstract = {Cotton cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has been extensively studied;
   however, information regarding its molecular mechanisms has not yet been
   disclosed. Therefore, to explore the molecular mechanism of pollen
   abortion of cotton CMS line H276A, transcript profiles of 30
   mitochondrial protein-encoding genes at tetrad stage were conducted with
   northern blot and a differential expression gene cox3 was identified.
   Quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that
   the expression level of cox3 in the CMS line H276A was 0.39-fold
   compared to its maintainer line H276B. In addition, the immunoblot
   analysis revealed that the amount of COX3 protein was decreased to
   59.38\% in CMS line H276A. The 5` and 3` terminals of the transcript of
   cox3 in two materials were determined simultaneously with circularized
   RNA reverse-transcribed PCR (CR-RT-PCR). The data indicated that seven
   5` end of transcript of cox3 in H276A
   (-451/-464/-465/-467/-471/-472/-508 respect to ATG) were identified
   which were different from that of H276B (-411/-412). A total of 15
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was detected by clone sequencing
   analysis of upstream of cox3. To our knowledge, we are the first to
   comprehensively analyze the transcripts of the mitochondrial genome in
   the cotton CMS line and to identify the 5` and 3` terminals of the
   transcript of cox3 in cotton. Our data will provide a framework for a
   better understanding of molecular mechanisms of CMS and mitochondrial
   gene expression in cotton.},

Abstract = {Germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) known as germination markers are
   encoded by multigene families in several plant species, including
   barley. To date, functional analysis has revealed germins and GLPs are
   involved in diverse processes such as embryonic development and stress
   responses. The aim of this study was the analysis of barley germins and
   GLPs. In this study, 80 putative germins and GLPs have been identified
   in barley by using known 17 germins and GLP sequences. Analysis of
   germins and GLPs showed all germins and GLPs are distributed on all
   seven chromosomes that most of them spread through chromosome 3, 4 and 7
   with 16, 18 and 12 proteins on each, respectively. The protein sizes
   varied between 185 and 335 amino acids, with an average length of 225
   aa. Twelve conserved motifs were found. While germin motifs 1 and 3 were
   detected in all germins and GLPs, some motifs were found to be related
   to signalization. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction analysis
   demonstrated some GLPs are associated with RAB6-interacting golgin,
   oligopeptide transmembrane transporter activity, beta-glucuronidase
   activity, protein N-linked glycosylation, multi-pass membrane protein,
   and proteins containing zinc finger (Znf) domain and RING (really
   interesting new gene)-type zinc finger domains. Our findings suggest
   that barley germins and GLPs may have diverse functions that make them
   important candidates for crop improvement.},

Abstract = {A polka-dotted fruit fly, Drosophila guttifera, has a unique
   pigmentation pattern on its wings and is used as a model for evo-devo
   studies exploring the mechanism of evolutionary gain of novel traits. In
   this species, a morphogen-encoding gene, wingless, is expressed in
   species-specific positions and induces a unique pigmentation pattern. To
   produce some of the pigmentation spots on wing veins, wingless is
   thought to be expressed in developing campaniform sensillum cells, but
   it was unknown which of the four cell types there express(es) wingless.
   Here we show that two of the cell types, dome cells and socket cells,
   express wingless, as indicated by in situ hybridization together with
   immunohistochemistry. This is a unique case in which non-neuronal SOP
   (sensory organ precursor) progeny cells produce Wingless as an inducer
   of pigmentation pattern formation. Our finding opens a path to
   clarifying the mechanism of evolutionary gain of a unique wingless
   expression pattern by analyzing gene regulation in dome cells and socket
   cells.},

   distinctive characteristics. At the same time, this new data has been
   gradually clarifying ancestral operating mechanisms. The silk moth,
   Bombyx mori, is a lepidopteran insect and, as a representative of the
   order, has many unique characteristics found in early embryonic
   development that have not been identified in other insect groups.
   Herein, some of these characteristics are introduced and discussed in

Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},

Abstract = {In this period of climate change, it is of major importance to increase
   knowledge about the mechanisms by whose plants adapt to their
   environment. Tandem gene arrays (TAG) are overrepresented in the pool of
   tandem duplicates involved in stress response and are consequently of
   special interest. Nevertheless, until recently, addressing questions
   about individual genes or fine regulations in such structures was very
   difficult due to the close arrangement of the genome, almost preventing
   the production of targeted simple or multiple mutants. The CRISPR/Cas9
   new tool offers new opportunities as the setting of gene deletion
   strategies in various genetic backgrounds. Here, we used this technology
   on the cold acclimation CBF pathway in different accessions of
   Arabidopsis thaliana with the same set of guide RNAs. Deleted lines free
   of T-DNA have been produced for simple or multiple copies of CBF genes
   and evaluated for cold tolerance after acclimation. Expression levels of
   CBF genes and five COR genes have also been analyzed. Our data suggest
   first that two or three missing CBF genes are necessary to induce a
   strong reduction in cold tolerance and secondly that most deletions have
   a low impact on the expression of remaining CBF copies which contradicts
   the previous hypothesis in the literature. Our results thus show that
   the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion strategy is a useful performance tool to
   investigate how tandem gene arrays work.},

Abstract = {Hoxa2 genes provide critical patterning signals during development, and
   their regulation and function have been extensively studied. We report a
   previously uncharacterized significant sequence divergence of a highly
   conserved hindbrain hoxa2b enhancer element in the family syngnathidae
   (pipefishes, seahorses, pipehorses, seadragons). We compared the hox
   cis-regulatory element variation in the Gulf pipefish and two species of
   seahorse against eight other species of fish, as well as human and
   mouse. We annotated the hoxa2b enhancer element binding sites across
   three species of seahorse, four species of pipefish, and one species of
   ghost pipefish. Finally, we performed in situ hybridization analysis of
   hoxa2b expression in Gulf pipefish embryos. We found that all syngnathid
   fish examined share a modified rhombomere 4 hoxa2b enhancer element,
   despite the fact that this element has been found to be highly conserved
   across all vertebrates examined previously. Binding element sequence
   motifs and spacing between binding elements have been modified for the
   hoxa2b enhancer in several species of pipefish and seahorse, and that
   the loss of the Prep/Meis binding site and further space shortening
   happened after ghost pipefish split from the rest of the syngnathid
   clade. We showed that expression of this gene in rhombomere 4 is lower

Abstract = {Melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), which is expressed in the terminally
   differentiated sebaceous gland, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).
   MC5R exists mostly in mammals but is completely lost in whales; only the
   relic of MC5R can be detected in manatees, and phenotypically, they have
   lost sebaceous glands. Interestingly, whales and manatees are both
   aquatic mammals but have no immediate common ancestors. The loss of MC5R
   and sebaceous glands in whales and manatees is likely to be a result of
   convergent evolution. Here, we find that MC5R in whales and manatees are
   lost by two different mechanisms. Homologous recombination of MC5R in
   manatees and the insertion of reverse transcriptase in whales lead to
   the gene loss, respectively. On one hand, in manatees, there are two
   ``TTATC{''} sequences flanking MC5R, and homologous recombination of the
   segments between the two ``TTATC{''} sequences resulted in the partial
   loss of the sequence of MC5R. On the other hand, in whales, reverse
   transcriptase inserts between MC2R and RNMT on the chromosome led to the
   loss of MC5R. Based on these two different mechanisms for gene loss in
   whales and manatees, we finally concluded that MC5R loss might be the
   result of convergent evolution to the marine environment, and we
   explored the impact on biological function that is significant to
   environmental adaptation.},

Abstract = {The core molecular mechanisms of dorsal organizer formation during
   gastrulation are highly conserved within the chordate lineage. One of
   the key characteristics is that Nodal signaling is required for the
   organizer-specific gene expression. This feature appears to be
   ancestral, as evidenced by the presence in the most basally divergent
   chordate amphioxus. To provide a better understanding of the evolution
   of organizer-specific gene regulation in chordates, we analyzed the
   cis-regulatory sequence of amphioxus Chordin in the context of the
   vertebrate embryo. First, we generated stable zebrafish transgenic
   lines, and by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, characterized in
   detail the expression pattern of GFP driven by the cis-regulatory
   sequences of amphioxus Chordin. Next, we performed a 5'deletion analysis
   and identified an enhancer sufficient to drive the expression of the
   reporter gene into a chordate dorsal organizer. Finally, we found that
   the identified enhancer element strongly depends on Nodal signaling,
   which is consistent with the well-established role of this pathway in
   the regulation of the expression of dorsal organizer-specific genes
   across chordates. The enhancer identified in our study may represent a
   suitable simple system to study the interplay of the evolutionarily
   conserved regulatory mechanisms operating during early chordate
   development.},

Title = {Exploring the roles of FGF/MAPK and cVG1/GDF signalling on mesendoderm
   induction and convergent extension during chick primitive streak
   formation},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {232},

Abstract = {During primitive streak formation in the chick embryo, cells undergo
   mesendoderm specification and convergent extension at the same time and
   in the same cells. Previous work has implicated cVG1 (GDF3) as a key
   factor for induction of primitive streak identity and positioning the
   primitive streak, whereas FGF signalling was implicated in regulating
   cell intercalation via regulation of components of the WNT-planar cell
   polarity (PCP) pathway. FGF has also been reported to be able to induce
   a primitive streak (but lacking the most axial derivatives such as
   notochord/prechordal mesendoderm). These signals emanate from different
   cell populations in the embryo, so how do they interact to ensure that
   the same cells undergo both cell intercalation and acquire primitive
   streak identity? Here we begin to address this question by examining in
   more detail the ability of the two classes of signals in regulating the
   two developmental events. Using misexpression of inducers and/or
   exposure to inhibitors and in situ hybridisation, we study how these two
   signals regulate expression of Brachyury (TBXT) and PRICKLE1 as markers
   for the primitive streak and the PCP, respectively. We find that both
   signals can induce both properties, but while FGF seems to be required
   for induction of the streak by cVG1, it is not necessary for induction
   of PRICKLE1. The results are consistent with cVG1 being a common
   regulator for both primitive streak identity and the initiation of
   convergent extension that leads to streak elongation.},

Abstract = {Axis formation is one of the most important events occurring at the
   beginning of animal development. In the ascidian egg, the
   antero-posterior axis is established at this time owing to a dynamic
   cytoplasmic movement called cytoplasmic and cortical reorganisation.
   During this movement, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and
   maternal mRNAs (postplasmic/PEM RNAs) are translocated to the future
   posterior side. Although accumulating evidence indicates the crucial
   roles played by the asymmetrical localisation of these organelles and
   the translational regulation of postplasmic/PEM RNAs, the organisation
   of ER has not been described in sufficient detail to date owing to
   technical difficulties. In this study, we developed three different
   multiple staining protocols for visualising the ER in combination with
   mitochondria, microtubules, or mRNAs in whole-mount specimens. We
   defined the internally expanded ``dense ER{''} using these protocols and
   described cisterna-like structures of the dense ER using focused ion
   beam-scanning electron microscopy. Most importantly, we described the
   dynamic changes in the colocalisation of postplasmic/PEM mRNAs and dense
   ER; for example, macho-1 mRNA was detached and excluded from the dense
   ER during the second phase of ooplasmic movements. These detailed
   descriptions of the association between maternal mRNA and ER can provide
   clues for understanding the translational regulation mechanisms
   underlying axis determination during ascidian early embryogenesis.},

Abstract = {The origin, diversification, and secondary loss of sexually dimorphic
   characters are common in animal evolution. In some cases, structurally
   and functionally similar traits have evolved independently in multiple
   lineages. Prominent examples of such traits include the male-specific
   grasping structures that develop on the front legs of many dipteran
   insects. In this report, we describe the evolution and development of
   one of these structures, the male-specific ``sex brush.{''} The sex
   brush is composed of densely packed, irregularly arranged modified
   bristles and is found in several distantly related lineages in the
   family Drosophilidae. Phylogenetic analysis using 250 genes from over
   200 species provides modest support for a single origin of the sex brush
   followed by many secondary losses; however, independent origins of the
   sex brush cannot be ruled out completely. We show that sex brushes
   develop in very similar ways in all brush-bearing lineages. The dense
   packing of brush hairs is explained by the specification of bristle
   precursor cells at a near-maximum density permitted by the lateral
   inhibition mechanism, as well as by the reduced size of the surrounding
   epithelial cells. In contrast to the female and the ancestral male
   condition, where bristles are arranged in stereotypical, precisely
   spaced rows, cell migration does not contribute appreciably to the
   formation of the sex brush. The complex phylogenetic history of the sex
   brush can make it a valuable model for investigating coevolution of
   sex-specific morphology and mating behavior.},

   without pupation. The annual life cycle of most aphids includes both an
   asexual (viviparous) and a sexual (oviparous) phase. Sexual reproduction
   only occurs once per year and is followed by many generations of asexual
   reproduction, during which aphids propagate exponentially with
   telescopic development. Here, we discuss the potential links between
   viviparous embryogenesis and derived developmental features in the pea
   aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, particularly focusing on germline
   specification and axis determination, both of which are key events of
   early development in insects. We also discuss potential evolutionary
   paths through which both viviparous and oviparous females might have
   come to utilize maternal germ plasm to drive germline specification.
   This developmental strategy, as defined by germline markers, has not
   been reported in other hemimetabolous insects. In viviparous females,
   furthermore, we discuss whether molecules that in other insects
   characterize germ plasm, like Vasa, also participate in posterior
   determination and how the anterior localization of the hunchback
   orthologue Ap-hb establishes the anterior-posterior axis. We propose
   that the linked chain of developing oocytes and embryos within each
   ovariole and the special morphology of early embryos might have driven
   the formation of evolutionary novelties in germline specification and
   axis determination in the viviparous aphids. Moreover, based upon the
   finding that the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is closely associated
   with germ cells throughout embryogenesis, we propose presumptive roles
   for B. aphidicola in aphid development, discussing how it might regulate
   germline migration in both reproductive modes of pea aphids. In summary,
   we expect that this review will shed light on viviparous as well as
   oviparous development in aphids.},

Abstract = {The zinc finger-containing transcription factor Gli3 is a key mediator
   of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In vertebrates, Gli3 has widespread
   expression pattern during early embryonic development. Along the
   anteroposterior axes of the central nervous system (CNS), dorsoventral
   neural pattern elaboration is achieved through Hh mediated
   spatio-temporal deployment of Gli3 transcripts. Previously, we and
   others uncovered a set of enhancers that mediate many of the known
   aspects of Gli3 expression during neurogenesis. However, the potential
   role of Gli3 associated enhancers in trait evolution has not yet
   received any significant attention. Here, we investigate the
   evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated CNS-specific enhancers that
   have been reported so far. A subset of these enhancers has undergone an
   accelerated rate of molecular evolution in the human lineage in
   comparison to other primates/mammals. These fast-evolving enhancers have
   acquired human-specific changes in transcription factor binding sites
   (TFBSs). These human-unique changes within subset of Gli3 associated
   CNS-specific enhancers were further validated as single nucleotide
   polymorphisms through 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 data. This work not
   only infers the molecular evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated
   enhancers but also provides clues for putative genetic basis of the
   population-specificity of gene expression regulation.},

Pages = {27-37},

Abstract = {In the arthropod model species Drosophila melanogaster, a dipteran fly,
   segmentation of the anterior-posterior body axis is under control of a
   hierarchic gene cascade. Segmental boundaries that form morphological
   grooves are established posteriorly within the segmental expression
   domain of the segment-polarity gene (SPG) engrailed (en). More important
   for the development of the fly, however, are the parasegmental
   boundaries that are established at the interface of en expressing cells
   and anteriorly adjacent wingless (wg) expressing cells. In Drosophila,
   both segmental and transient parasegmental grooves form. The latter are
   positioned anterior to the expression of en. Although the function of
   the SPGs in establishing and maintaining segmental and parasegmental
   boundaries is highly conserved among arthropods, parasegmental grooves
   have only been reported for Drosophila, and a spider (Cupiennius salei).
   Here, we present new data on en expression, and re-evaluate published
   data, from four distantly related spiders, including Cupiennius, and a
   distantly related chelicerate, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Gene
   expression analysis of en genes in these animals does not corroborate
   the presence of parasegmental grooves. Consequently, our data question
   the general presence of parasegmental grooves in arthropods.},

Abstract = {The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway has been widely associated to the
   reestablishment of anteroposterior body polarities in the embryonic
   development and regeneration in animals. For instance, in annelids,
   cellular proliferation, wound healing, and blastema development can be
   affected when this pathway is disrupted. However, very little is known
   about the genetic regulatory processes involved in these anomalies.
   Here, we investigate the morphological effects of 1-azakenpaullone, a
   pharmacological inhibitor of GSK3 beta that is supposed to over-activate
   the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, during the anterior and posterior
   regeneration of the annelid Syllis malaquini. The results showed that
   high concentrations of 1-azakenpaullone affect the stages of blastema
   differentiation and resegmentation. Therefore, GSK3 beta-associated gene
   regulatory networks are candidate to investigate the genetic mechanisms
   involved in the regular course of S. malaquini regeneration.},

Abstract = {Johnston's organ has been shown to act as an antennal auditory organ
   across a spectrum of insect species. In the hemimetabolous desert locust
   Schistocerca gregaria, Johnston's organ must be functional on hatching
   and so develops in the pedicellar segment of the antenna during
   embryogenesis. Here, we employ the epithelial cell marker Lachesin to
   identify the pedicellar domain of the early embryonic antenna and then
   triple-label against Lachesin, the mitosis marker phosphohistone-3, and
   neuron-specific horseradish peroxidase to reveal the sense-organ
   precursors for Johnston's organ and their lineages. Beginning with a
   single progenitor at approximately a third of embryogenesis, additional
   precursors subsequently appear in both the ventral and dorsal pedicellar
   domains, each generating a lineage or clone. Lineage locations are
   remarkably conserved across preparations and ages, consistent with the
   epithelium possessing an underlying topographic coordinate system that
   determines the cellular organization of Johnston's organ. By
   mid-embryogenesis, twelve lineages are arranged circumferentially in the
   pedicel as in the adult structure. Each sense-organ precursor is
   associated with a smaller mitotically active cell from which the
   neuronal complement of each clone may derive. Neuron numbers within a
   clone increase in discrete steps with age and are invariant between
   clones and across preparations of a given age. At mid-embryogenesis,
   each clone comprises five cells consolidated into a tightly bound
   cartridge. A long scolopale extends apically from each cartridge to an
   insertion point in the epithelium, and bundled axons project basally
   toward the brain. Comparative data suggest mechanisms that might also
   regulate the developmental program of Johnston's organ in the locust.},

Abstract = {Mechanical influencers have long been shown to affect mature bone. Bone
   mechanosensation is a key feature that allows the skeleton to adapt to
   environmental constraints. In this study, we describe the response of
   immature, developing bones to a mechanical stimulus. To do so, zebrafish
   larvae at different stages of development were exposed to whole-body
   vibration (WBV) at a low frequency of 20 Hz, for up to 4 days. Whole
   mount Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining revealed age-related and
   bone type-specific defects. Specifically, the parhypural and hypural 1
   caudal fin endoskeletal elements were affected when the exposure to WBV
   started early during their development. We show that these WBV-induced
   parhypural and hypural 1 patterning defects are triggered by a
   Sox9-independent pathway, potentially by reducing the distance
   separating adjacent chondrogenic condensations in the developing tail
   skeleton. The remaining hypurals were unaffected by the WBV treatment.
   Altogether, our results indicate that, upon exposure to vibration,
   chondrogenic cell progenitors can react to mechanical stimuli early
   during their development, which ultimately affects the skeletal
   patterning of the growing zebrafish larvae. These findings open a new
   research avenue to better understand the cellular processes involved in
   developing, patterning, and maintaining skeletal tissue.},

Abstract = {Spiders have emerged as one of the leading model organisms in many
   research fields due to their compelling biology. Often, scientific
   investigations involving the use of spiders face inevitable problems
   associated with the lack of specimens from laboratory stock, resulting
   in difficulties in yielding reproducible investigations for predictive
   research. Thus, several species of well-studied spiders, including
   Parasteatoda tepidariorum, have been successfully bred for such
   purposes. Crossopriza lyoni is a Haplogyne spider, globally distributed
   and widespread in human inhabitants, prompting interest in various
   studies over the last decades. Despite its scientific importance, no
   laboratory-bred C. lyoni has been documented. Therefore, we describe a
   successful captive breeding system of the species under controlled
   conditions to establish a laboratory stock culture. Methods for mating
   induction, egg collection and segregation, artificial embryo incubation,
   and colony husbandry are discussed. The technique presented is a simple
   and low-cost approach that is reliable for C. lyoni propagation in the
   laboratory over several generations.},

Abstract = {The distance Wagner procedure of Farris (American Naturalist, 1972, 106,
   645), in its original or random addition sequence form, is a rapid
   method of tree construction. The original formulation did not allow for
   refinement of tree hypotheses via common trajectory search operations
   (e.g. SPR, TBR). Here, the distance Wagner method is extended to allow
   for refinement of initial trees produced via the four-point condition
   (Mathematics and the Archeological and Historical Sciences, Edinburgh
   University Press, Edinburgh, 1974). The performance of the extended
   distance Wagner as a heuristic search procedure is evaluated with
   several unaligned sequences and combined source datasets within the
   parsimony framework. Distance Wagner both with and without refinement is
   shown to be a rapid and useful heuristic method to generate initial
   trees for further, character-based, analysis.},

Title = {Historical biogeography of Tetrastigma (Vitaceae): Insights into
   floristic exchange patterns between Asia and Australia},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Biodiversity exchanges across the Malesian region, linking the distinct
   biotas of Asia and Australia, have long attracted the curiosity of
   biologists. Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) has a wide distribution in Asia
   through the Sunda archipelago to Australia and provides a good case to
   elucidate floristic exchange between Asia and Australia. Tetrastigma
   species have fleshy fruits that are consumed by birds, representing a
   lineage with a predictable dispersal across island chains. We herein
   estimate the divergence times and reconstruct the biogeographic history
   of Tetrastigma with intensive taxon sampling (96 of approximately 120
   species; >80\%) using 10 chloroplast loci. The biogeographic history of
   Tetrastigma was reconstructed with 4-area and 6-area divisions by
   delineating the Sunda region into one or three areas of endemism based
   on a phylogenetic bioregionalization analysis and the geological history
   of Malesia. The 4-area division shows that Tetrastigma originated in
   continental Asia and diverged from the recently segregated genus
   Pseudocayratia in the early Eocene (49.43 Ma). Dispersal from
   continental Asia might have started in the late Eocene but mainly
   occurred in the last 10 Myr. Continental Asia is indicated to be the
   most important source area while Sunda is the biggest sink, with 16 of
   the 27 dispersal events inferred from continental Asia to Sunda. Only
   seven dispersal events are inferred arriving in the Sahul plate and one
   reverse dispersal from Sahul back to Asia. The 6-area division suggests
   that the Philippines have been an active junction between Asia and
   Australia. The biogeographic history of Tetrastigma illustrates an
   asymmetric floristic exchange between Asia and Australia in this genus,
   which has been facilitated by the formation of terrestrial connections
   in the late Miocene and the expansion of wet tropical forests across
   Wallace's Line and beyond.},

Title = {Evolution of the strikingly diverse submandibular muscles in Anura},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {489-517},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The most ventral muscles of the head (the mm. submentalis,
   intermandibularis, and interhyoideus) provide support to the gular
   region and lift the buccal floor during ventilation and feeding. These
   muscles show limited variation in most gnathostomes, but in Anura they
   exhibit a surprising diversity. The few studies that have explored this
   character system highlighted its potential as a source of phylogenetic
   information. In this paper we explored the diversity of this character
   system studying specimens of 567 anuran species and reviewing published
   data to cover a total of 1321 species, belonging to 53 of the 54
   currently recognized anuran families, as well as caudates and
   caecilians. We defined 27 discrete characters including the number of
   muscle bellies, supplementary layers, hypertrophy and diversity of
   elastic fibres, and pigmentation, among others, and optimized them on a
   comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis. We recognized 223 unambiguously
   optimized synapomorphies for numerous clades on different scales,
   including three for Anura and many for suprafamiliar clades with poor
   phenotypic support. Finally, we discussed the evolution of this highly
   diverse character system, including homology, development, and its
   functional role in vocalization and feeding. Interestingly, the striking
   levels of variation in some structures contrast with the amount of
   phylogenetic inertia, allowing us to recognize several general patterns.
   Supplementary elements of the m. intermandibularis evolved first as
   broad layers occuring in more than half of extant anuran species and
   then concentrated forming discreet bellies in several clades. The
   anterior portion of the gular region is not sexually dimorphic, and is
   likely related to ventilation and tongue protraction. Conversely, the
   diversity of the m. interhyoideus is strongly linked to vocal sacs,
   which are present only in adult males, suggesting the presence of two
   independent modules.},

Title = {The oldest Gondwanan fossil of Leiinae (Diptera, Mycetophilidae):
   Phylogenetic and evolutionary implications},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 8},
Abstract = {A fossil Mycetophilidae from the Aptian Crato Formation-Cretomanota
   gondwanica gen. nov., sp. nov.-is described, which is the first
   mycetophilid from the Crato Formation and corresponds to the oldest
   known fossil leiine and only the second Gondwanan fossil mycetophilid
   described so far. Cretomanota gondwanica and both species of Alavamanota
   Blagoderov and Arillo were added as terminals to the data matrix of a
   general phylogenetic analysis of the Mycetophilidae, and both fit into
   the Leiinae. Alavamanota is monophyletic, sister to the clade composed
   by Cretomanota and the extant genus Manota Williston. The biology of the
   extant members of this fungivorous family corroborates the
   reconstruction of the Crato palaeoenvironment as including woodlands
   with humid habitats and microhabitats. The presence of a Cretaceous
   member of the tribe Manotini at low latitudes in South America
   reinforces the hypothesis that the clade with all manotines except
   Leiella Edwards corresponds to a Lower Cretaceous offshoot from a group
   in southern Gondwana expanding its distribution to more northern areas
   into the Gondwana and into Laurasia.},

Title = {Unraveling the evolutionary history of the snakefly family Inocelliidae

Abstract = {Inocelliidae is one of the two extant families of the holometabolan
   order Raphidioptera (snakeflies), with the modern fauna represented by
   seven genera and 44 species. The evolutionary history of the family is
   little-known. Here we present the first phylogenetic and biogeographical
   analyses based on a worldwide sampling of taxa and datasets combined
   with morphological characters and mitochondrial genomes, aiming to
   investigate the intergeneric phylogeny and historical biogeography of
   Inocelliidae. The phylogenetic inference from the combined analysis of
   morphological and molecular data recovered the sister-group relationship
   between a clade of (Negha + Indianoinocellia) + Sininocellia and a clade
   of Fibla + the Inocellia clade (interiorly nested by Amurinocellia and
   Parainocellia). Amurinocellia stat.r. and Parainocellia stat.r. et
   emend.n. are relegated to subgeneric status within Inocellia, whereas a
   newly erected subgenus of Inocellia, Epinocellia subgen.n., accommodates
   the former Parainocellia burmana (U. Aspock and H. Aspock, 1968) plus a
   new species Inocellia (Epinocellia) weii sp.n. Further, the Inocellia
   crassicornis group constitutes the nominotypical subgenus Inocellia
   stat.n., but the Inocellia fulvostigmata group is paraphyletic.
   Diversification within Inocelliidae is distinguished by an Eocene
   divergence leading to extant genera and a Miocene radiation of species.
   A biogeographical scenario depicts how the diverse inocelliid fauna from
   East Asia could have originated from western North America via dispersal
   across the Beringia during the early Tertiary, and how the Miocene
   ancestors of Inocellia could have accomplished long-distance dispersals
   via the Tibet-Himalayan corridor or eastern Palaearctic to western
   Palaearctic. Our results shed new light specifically on the evolution of
   Inocelliidae and, in general, the Raphidioptera.},

Title = {New troodontid theropod specimen from Inner Mongolia, China clarifies
   phylogenetic relationships of later-diverging small-bodied troodontids

Abstract = {A new troodontid (LH PV39) recovered from the Upper Cretaceous
   Wulansuhai Formation, Inner Mongolia, China, is described, highlighting
   the dorsoventrally compressed sacral centra. The completely fused
   neurocentral junctions indicate that LH PV39 had reached adulthood at
   the time of death, but its size is nevertheless 20\% smaller than that
   of the sympatric Philovenator, demonstrating that it is the second
   small-bodied troodontid recovered from the Wulansuhai Formation.
   Phylogenetic analyses scoring LH PV39 using different strategies and
   performed with different algorithms unambiguously recovered it as a
   troodontid. While the parsimony-based analysis scoring LH PV39 as an
   independent OTU with all of its available characteristics included
   recovered it as a basal troodontid, the Bayesian analysis suggests a
   closer relationship of LH PV39 to Almas and an unnamed troodontid from
   Ukhaa Tolgod, Mongolia (MPC-D100/1126+D100/3500). Body size analysis
   confirmed a single trend of gigantism throughout the evolution of
   troodontids, and suggests that the Late Cretaceous troodontids evolved
   in two directions: (i) several size-independent characteristics evolved
   while retaining the small sizes that are typical of the Early Cretaceous
   relatives, resulting in the Late Cretaceous small-bodied troodontids;
   and (ii) size-dependent characteristics (e.g., the elongation of the
   rostrum) evolved accompanying the size increase, resulting in
   large-bodied derived troodontids. The mosaic features of the Late
   Cretaceous small-bodied troodontids place them intermediate between
   their Early Cretaceous basal relatives and the Late Cretaceous
   large-bodied taxa in a well-resolved phylogeny, which is crucial for
   understanding the size and morphological evolution of troodontids.},

Title = {Diversity, host specificity and biogeography in the Cladocorynidae

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {The hydrozoan family Cladocorynidae inhabits tropical to temperate
   waters and comprises the two genera Pteroclava and Cladocoryne.
   Pteroclava lives in association with some octocorals and hydrozoans,
   whereas Cladocoryne is more generalist in terms of substrate choice.
   This work provides a thorough morpho-molecular reassessment of the
   Cladocorynidae by presenting the first well-supported phylogeny of the
   family based on the analyses of three mitochondrial and four nuclear
   markers. Notably, the two nominal genera were confirmed to be
   monophyletic and both morphological and genetic data led to the formal
   description of a new genus exclusively associated with octocorals,
   Pseudozanclea gen. nov. Maggioni \& Montano. Accordingly, the diagnosis
   of the family was updated. The ancestral state reconstruction of
   selected characters revealed that the symbiosis with octocorals likely
   appeared in the most recent common ancestor of Pteroclava and
   Pseudozanclea. Additionally, the presence of euryteles aggregation in
   the polyp stage and the exumbrellar nematocyst pouches with euryteles
   represent synapomorphies of all cladocorynid taxa and probably emerged
   in their most recent common ancestor. The analysis of several Pteroclava
   krempfi colonies from Indo-Pacific and Caribbean localities associated
   with several host octocorals revealed a high intra-specific genetic
   variability. Single- and multi-locus species delimitations resulted in
   three to five species hypotheses, but the statistical analysis of
   morphometric data showed only limited distinction among the clades of P.
   krempfi. However, P. krempfi clades showed differences in both host
   specificity, mostly at the octocoral family level, and geographic
   distribution, with one clade found exclusively in the Caribbean Sea and
   the others found in the Indo-Pacific.},

Title = {Geographical sampling bias on the assessment of endemism areas for
   marine meiobenthic fauna},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {571-585},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Species distribution patterns are constrained by historical and
   ecological processes in space and time, but very often the species range
   sizes are geographical sampling biases resulting from unequal sampling
   effort. One of the most common definitions of endemism is based on the
   ``congruence of distributional areas{''} criterion, when two or more
   species have the same distributional limits. By acknowledging that
   available data of marine meiobenthic species are prone to geographical
   sampling bias and that can affect the accuracy of the biogeographical
   signals, the present study combines analyses of inventory incompleteness
   and recognition of spatial congruence of Gastrotricha, Kinorhyncha,
   meiobenthic Annelida and Tardigrada in order to better understand the
   large-scale distribution of these organisms in coastal and shelf areas
   of the world. We used the marine bioregionalization framework for
   geographical operative units to quantify the inventory incompleteness
   effect (by modelling spatial predictions of species richness) and to
   recognize areas of endemism. Our models showed that the difference
   between observed and expected species richness in the Southern
   Hemisphere is much higher than in the Northern Hemisphere. Parsimony
   Analysis of Endemicity delimited 20 areas of endemism, most found in the
   Northern Hemisphere. Distribution patterns of meiobenthic species are
   shown to respond to events of geographical barriers and abiotic
   features, and their distribution is far from homogeneous throughout the
   world. Also, our data show that ecoregions with distinct biotas have at
   least some cohesion over evolutionary time. However, we found that
   inventory incompleteness may significantly affect the explanatory power
   of areas of endemism delimitation in both hemispheres. Yet, whereas
   future increases in sampling efforts are likely to change the spatial
   congruence ranges in the Southern Hemisphere, patterns for the Northern
   Hemisphere may prove to be relatively more resilient.},

Abstract = {The Cenozoic Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of the
   Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau (HTP) are among the most important geological
   events in the world. They have affected the diversification of regional
   biota of many taxonomic groups on and around the HTP. However, the exact
   timing and model of the collision and uplift events and speciation on
   and around the HTP are still in debate. The Himalayas group of Scytodes
   spitting spiders (Araneae: Scytodidae) are distributed at high
   elevations of the HTP and northern Indochina. Here, we reconstruct a
   dated molecular phylogeny for pan-Himalayan Scytodes spiders, including
   the Himalayas group, with full geographical sampling of the species from
   the HTP and Indochina. We test a hypothesis to explain that the rich
   montane biodiversity of the region is uplift-driven diversification-that
   orogeny drives rapid in situ speciation of the resident Scytodes
   lineages. Our findings revealed that the separation of the Himalayas
   clade from the Myanmar clade took place during the middle Oligocene,
   reflecting the final collision of India with Eurasia. The deep
   divergences among three clades (the Himalayas, the Myanmar and the
   Indochina clades) occurred from the middle Eocene to the middle
   Oligocene, corresponding to two early uplift events of the HTP. The
   evolutionary split between the Himalayas + Myanmar and Indochina clades
   were simultaneous with the rapid lateral extrusion of Indochina by the
   initial Himalayan uplift around the Eocene. This study highlights the
   importance of the diversification of dispersal-limited, high-elevation
   invertebrates as independent lines of evidence to reflect key tectonic
   events in the Himalayan-Indochina region, supporting the stepwise model
   for the Indian-Eurasian collision and uplift of HTP.},

Title = {The role of Anatolia in the origin of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot
   illustrated by land snails in the genus Oxychilus},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Several taxa that are distributed in the Caucasus and/or the adjacent
   Pontic Mountains also have representatives in the East Mediterranean
   region. These disjunctions could have been caused by long-distance
   dispersal or be the result of extinctions in Central Anatolia caused by
   the aridification of the Anatolian Plateau during the Pliocene. We
   studied the Longiphallus-Hiramia group of Oxychilus as an example
   showing such distribution patterns. Phylogenetic analyses of the
   Oxychilus species previously classified in Longiphallus, Hiramia and
   related subgenera resulted in a new delimitation of these taxa and the
   recognition of Anatoloxychilus Neiber, Walther \& Hausdorf n. subgen. as
   an additional clade. Based on phylogenetic and population genetic
   analyses, O. reticulatus from Mingrelia is revalidated and the
   populations from the Pontic Mountains previously identified with O.
   mingrelicus koutaisanus are recognised as a distinct species. Three
   species pairs of the Longiphallus-Hiramia group with deep splits
   predating the aridification of the Anatolian Plateau during the Pliocene
   show disjunctions between the Caucasus/Pontic region and the
   Mediterranean. The majority of taxa with such a distribution pattern
   probably had more continuous distributions before the aridification
   started. The relationships between the Hiramia species from the
   Caucasus, the Pontic Mountains and the East Mediterranean highlight the
   importance of the Anatolian land as a source area for the colonisation
   of the Caucasus region. The dating of the divergences of the Caucasian
   Hiramia species in the middle to late Miocene indicated that they
   colonised the Caucasus when it was still an island in the Paratethys Sea
   and that their divergence was triggered by the orogenesis of the Greater
   Caucasus. A common pattern within the Caucasus region, also found in
   Hiramia, is the separation of taxa in the north-western Greater Caucasus
   from taxa inhabiting the southern slopes of the central Greater
   Caucasus.},

Title = {Phylogeny and biogeography of the northern temperate genus Dracocephalum

Abstract = {The northern temperate genus Dracocephalum consists of approximately 70
   species mainly distributed in the steppe-desert biomes of Central and
   West Asia and the alpine region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).
   Previous work has shown that Dracocephalum is not monophyletic and might
   include Hyssopus and Lallemantia. This study attempts to clarify the
   phylogenetic relationships, diversification patterns, and the
   biogeographical history of the three genera (defined as Dracocephalum
   s.l.). Based on a sampling of 66 taxa comprising more than 80\% from
   extant species of Dracocephalum s.l., morphological, phylogenetic
   (maximum parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference based on nuclear
   ITS and ETS, plastid rpl32-trnL, trnL-trnF, ycf1, and ycf1-rps15, and
   two low-copy nuclear markers AT3G09060 and AT1G09680), molecular dating,
   diversification, and ancestral range estimation analyses were carried
   out. Our results demonstrate that both Hyssopus and Lallemantia are
   embedded within Dracocephalum and nine well-supported clades can be
   recognized within Dracocephalum s.l. Analyses of divergence times
   suggest that the genus experienced an early rapid radiation during the
   middle to late Miocene with major lineages diversifying within a
   relatively narrow timescale. Ancestral area reconstruction analyses
   indicate that Dracocephalum s.l. originated in Central and West Asia and
   southern Siberia, and dispersed from Central and West Asia into the QTP
   and adjacent areas twice independently during the Pliocene. The
   aridification of the Asian interior possibly promoted the rapid
   radiation of Dracocephalum within this region, and the uplift of the QTP
   appears to have triggered the dispersal and recent rapid diversification
   of the genus in the QTP and adjacent regions. Combining molecular
   phylogenetic and morphological evidence, a revised infrageneric
   classification of Dracocephalum s.l. is proposed, which recognizes nine
   sections within the genus.},

Abstract = {Halting biodiversity decline is one of the most critical challenges for
   humanity, but monitoring biodiversity is hampered by taxonomic
   impediments. One impediment is the large number of undescribed species
   (here called ``dark taxon impediment{''}) whereas another is caused by
   the large number of superficial species descriptions, that can only be
   resolved by consulting type specimens ({''}superficial description
   impediment{''}). Recently, Sharkey et al. (2021) proposed to address the
   dark taxon impediment for Costa Rican braconid wasps by describing 403
   species based on COI barcode clusters ({''}BINs{''}) computed by BOLD
   Systems. More than 99\% of the BINs (387 of 390) were converted into
   species by assigning binominal names (e.g. BIN ``BOLD:ACM9419{''}
   becomes Bracon federicomatarritai) and adding a minimal diagnosis
   (consisting only of a consensus barcode for most species). We here show
   that many of Sharkey et al.'s species are unstable when the underlying
   data are analyzed using different species delimitation algorithms. Add
   the insufficiently informative diagnoses, and many of these species will
   become the next ``superficial description impediment{''} for braconid
   taxonomy because they will have to be tested and redescribed after
   obtaining sufficient evidence for confidently delimiting species. We
   furthermore show that Sharkey et al.'s approach of using consensus
   barcodes as diagnoses is not functional because it cannot be applied
   consistently. Lastly, we reiterate that COI alone is not suitable for
   delimiting and describing species, and voice concerns over Sharkey et
   al.'s uncritical use of BINs because they are calculated by a
   proprietary algorithm (RESL) that uses a mixture of public and private
   data. We urge authors, reviewers and editors to maintain high standards
   in taxonomy by only publishing new species that are rigorously delimited
   with open-access tools and supported by publicly available evidence.},

Title = {Somewhere I belong: phylogeny and morphological evolution in a
   species-rich lineage of ectoparasitic flatworms infecting cichlid fishes},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 30},
Abstract = {A substantial portion of biodiversity has evolved through adaptive
   radiation. However, the effects of explosive speciation on species
   interactions remain poorly understood. Metazoan parasites infecting
   radiating host lineages could improve our knowledge because of their
   intimate host relationships. Yet limited molecular, phenotypic and
   ecological data discourage multivariate analyses of evolutionary
   patterns and encourage the use of discrete characters. Here, we assemble
   new molecular, morphological and host range data widely inferred from a
   species-rich lineage of parasites (Cichlidogyrus, Platyhelminthes:
   Monogenea) infecting cichlid fishes to address data scarcity. We infer a
   multimarker (28S/18S rDNA, ITS1, COI mtDNA) phylogeny of 58 of 137
   species and characterize major lineages through synapomorphies inferred
   from mapping morphological characters. We predict the phylogenetic
   position of species without DNA data through shared character states, a
   morphological phylogenetic analysis, and a classification analysis with
   support vector machines. Based on these predictions and a cluster
   analysis, we assess the systematic informativeness of continuous
   characters, search for continuous equivalents for discrete characters,
   and suggest new characters for morphological traits not analysed to
   date. We also model the attachment/reproductive organ and host range
   evolution using the data for 136 of 137 described species and
   multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). We show that
   discrete characters not only can mask phylogenetic signals, but also are
   key for characterizing species groups. Regarding the attachment organ
   morphology, a divergent evolutionary regime for at least one lineage was
   detected and a limited morphological variation indicates host and
   environmental parameters affecting its evolution. However, moderate
   success in predicting phylogenetic positions, and a low systematic
   informativeness and high multicollinearity of morphological characters
   call for a revaluation of characters included in species
   characterizations.},

Title = {Diversification of the phytophagous lineages of true bugs (Insecta:

Abstract = {More than 95\% of phytophagous true bug (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) species
   belong to four superfamilies: Miroidea (Cimicomorpha), Pentatomoidea,
   Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea (all Pentatomomorpha). These iconic groups of
   highly diverse, overwhelmingly phytophagous insects include several
   economically prominent agricultural and silvicultural pest species,
   though their evolutionary history has not yet been well resolved. In
   particular, superfamily- and family-level phylogenetic relationships of
   these four lineages have remained controversial, and the divergence
   times of some crucial nodes for phytophagous true bugs have hitherto
   been little known, which hampers a better understanding of the
   evolutionary processes and patterns of phytophagous insects. In the
   present study, we used 150 species and concatenated nuclear and
   mitochondrial protein-coding genes and rRNA genes to infer the
   phylogenetic relationships within the Terheteroptera (Cimicomorpha +
   Pentatomomorpha) and estimated their divergence times. Our results
   support the monophyly of Cimicomorpha, Pentatomomorpha, Miroidea,
   Pentatomoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea. The
   phylogenetic relationships across phytophagous lineages are largely
   congruent at deep nodes across the analyses based on different datasets
   and tree-reconstructing methods with just a few exceptions. Estimated
   divergence times and ancestral state reconstructions for feeding habit
   indicate that phytophagous true bugs explosively radiated in the Early
   Cretaceous-shortly after the angiosperm radiation-with the subsequent
   diversification of the most speciose clades (Mirinae, Pentatomidae,
   Coreinae, and Rhyparochromidae) in the Late Cretaceous.},

Title = {Areas of endemism of Lauraceae: new insights on the biogeographic

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Using Lauraceae as a study case, we aimed in this article to: (i)
   delimit areas of endemism in the Espinhaco Range, Brazil; (ii) compare
   these areas of endemism with those previously delimited, as well as with
   the centres of endemism; (iii) evaluate the association between areas of
   endemism and vegetation types; and (iv) classify the areas of endemism
   according to the International Code of Area Nomenclature (ICAN). Based
   on a recent survey of 99 species from the Espinhaco Range, our dataset
   consisted of 34 endemic species belonging to nine genera. Following
   previous studies, we performed parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE)
   using a grid square size of 0.5o x 0.5o. We delimited four areas of
   endemism of Lauraceae: (i) Antonio dos Santos, (ii) Conceicao do Mato
   Dentro, (iii) Itambe do Mato Dentro, and (iv) Rio de Contas; and
   confirmed six previously delimited areas of endemism: (i) Southern MG,
   (ii) Southern Mountains Complex, (iii) Conceicao do Mato Dentro, (iv)
   Diamantina Plateau, (v) Serra do Cabral, and (vi) Chapada Diamantina.
   The areas of endemism Conceicao do Mato Dentro, Serra do Cabral,
   Diamantina, and Serra do Cipo were classified as subdistricts in the
   Diamantina Plateau district of the Southern Espinhaco province. We
   summarized and mapped all areas of endemism corresponding to the
   provinces, districts, and subdistricts that cover the Espinhaco Range.
   Areas of endemism and centres of endemism are contrasted. Finally, we
   highlight that the biogeographic studies along this mountain range
   should embrace higher taxa with representative species in different
   types of vegetation in order to enrich the majority of the endemism
   studies mainly concentrated on the campo rupestre. Unusual distribution
   patterns, diversity of vegetation types, and the presence of restricted
   species and monophyletic groups open up opportunities to carry out
   integrative studies concerning the biogeographic regionalization of the
   ER at multiple spatio-temporal scales.},

Title = {Parsimony analysis of phylogenomic datasets (II): evaluation of PAUP{*},

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {126-146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines the implementation of parsimony methods in the
   programs PAUP{*}, MEGA and MPBoot, and compares them with TNT. PAUP{*}
   implements standard, well-tested algorithms, and flexible search
   strategies and options for handling trees; its main drawback is the lack
   of advanced search algorithms, which makes it difficult to find most
   parsimonious trees for large and complex datasets. In addition,
   branch-swapping can be much slower than in TNT for datasets with large
   numbers of taxa, although this is only occasionally a problem for
   phylogenomic datasets given that they typically have small numbers of
   taxa. The parsimony implementation of MEGA has major drawbacks. MEGA
   often fails to find parsimonious trees because it does not perform all
   possible branch swapping subtree pruning regrafting (SPR)/tree
   bisection-reconnection (TBR) rearrangements. It furthermore fails to
   properly handle ambiguity or multiple equally parsimonious trees, and it
   uses the same addition sequence for all bootstrap replicates. The latter
   yields values of group support that depend on the order in which taxa
   are listed in the dataset. In addition, tree searches are very slow and
   do not facilitate the exploration of different starting points (as
   random seed is fixed). MPBoot searches for optimal trees using the
   ratchet, but it is based on SPR instead of TBR (and only evaluates by
   default a subset of the SPR rearrangements). MPBoot approximates
   bootstrap frequencies by first finding a sample of trees and then
   selecting from those trees for every replicate, without performing a
   tree-search. The approximation is too rough in many cases, producing
   serious under- or overestimations of the correct support values and, for
   most kinds of datasets, slower estimations than can be obtained with
   TNT. In addition, bootstrapping with PAUP{*}, MEGA or MPBoot can
   attribute strong supports to groups that have no support at all under
   any meaningful concept of support, such as likelihood ratios or Bremer
   supports. In TNT, this problem is decreased by using the strict
   consensus tree to represent each replicate, or eliminated entirely by
   using different approximations of the Bremer support.},

Abstract = {In maximum likelihood (ML), the support for a clade can be calculated
   directly as the likelihood ratio (LR) or log-likelihood difference (S,
   LLD) of the best trees with and without the clade of interest. However,
   bootstrap (BS) clade frequencies are more pervasive in ML phylogenetics
   and are almost universally interpreted as measuring support. In addition
   to theoretical arguments against that interpretation, BS has several
   undesirable attributes for a support measure. For example, it does not
   vary in proportion to optimality or identify clades that are rejected by
   the evidence and can be overestimated due to missing data. Nevertheless,
   if BS is a reliable predictor of S, then it might be an efficient
   indirect method of measuring support-an attractive possibility, given
   the speed of many BS implementations. To assess the relationship between
   S and BS, we analyzed 106 empirical datasets retrieved from TreeBASE.
   Also, to evaluate the degree to which S and BS are affected by the
   number of replicates during suboptimal tree searches for S and
   pseudoreplicates during BS estimation, we randomly selected 5 of the 106
   datasets and analyzed them using variable numbers of replicates and
   pseudoreplicates, respectively. The correlation between S and BS was
   extremely weak in the datasets we analyzed. Increasing the number of
   replicates during tree search decreased the estimated values of S for
   most clades, but the magnitude of change was small. In contrast,
   although increasing pseudoreplicates affected BS values for only
   approximately 40\% of clades, values both increased and decreased, and
   they did so at much greater magnitudes. Increasing
   replicates/pseudoreplicates affected the rank order of clades in each
   tree for both S and BS. Our findings show decisively that BS is not an
   efficient indirect method of measuring support and suggest that even
   quite superficial searches to calculate S provide better estimates of
   support.},

Abstract = {Marchantiopsida (complex thalloid liverworts) are one of the earliest
   lineages of embryophytes (land plants), and well-known for their air
   pores and chambers, pegged rhizoids, and absence of organellular RNA
   editing sites. Despite their importance to an understanding of early
   embryophyte evolution, many key nodes within this class remain poorly
   resolved, owing to the paucity of genetic loci previously available for
   phylogenetic analyses. Here, we sequenced 54 plastomes, representing 28
   genera, nearly all families, and all orders of Marchantiopsida. Based on
   these plastomes, we present a hypothesis of deep relationships within
   the class, and make the first investigations of gene contents and
   synteny. Overall, the Marchantiopsida plastomes were well-conserved,
   with the exception of the genus Cyathodium that has plastomes with
   higher GC content, fewer single sequence repeats (SSRs), and more
   structural variations, implying that this genus might possess RNA
   editing sites. Abundant repetitive elements and six highly divergent
   regions were identified as suitable for future infrafamilial taxonomic
   studies. The phylogenetic topology of Sphaerocarpales, Neohodgsoniales
   and Blasiales within Marchantiopsida was essentially congruent with
   previous studies but generally we obtained higher support values. Based
   on molecular evidence and previous morphological studies, we include
   Lunulariales in Marchantiales and suggest the retention of narrowed
   delimitation of monotypic families. The phylogenetic relationships
   within Marchantiales were better resolved, and 13 monophyletic families
   were recovered. Our analyses confirmed that the loss of intron 2 of ycf3
   is a synapomorphy of Marchantiidae. Finally, we propose a new genus,
   Asterellopsis (Aytoniaceae), and present an updated classification of
   Marchantiopsida. The highly supported phylogenetic backbone provided
   here establishes a framework for future comparative and evolutionary
   studies of the complex thalloid liverworts.},

Title = {Phylogeny of gracillariid leaf-mining moths: evolution of larval

Volume = {38},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Gracillariidae is the most taxonomically diverse cosmopolitan
   leaf-mining moth family, consisting of nearly 2000 named species in 105
   described genera, classified into eight extant subfamilies. The majority
   of gracillariid species are internal plant feeders as larvae, creating
   mines and galls in plant tissue. Despite their diversity and ecological
   adaptations, their phylogenetic relationships, especially among
   subfamilies, remain uncertain. Genomic data (83 taxa, 589 loci) were
   integrated with Sanger data (130 taxa, 22 loci), to reconstruct a
   phylogeny of Gracillariidae. Based on analyses of both datasets combined
   and analyzed separately, monophyly of Gracillariidae and all its
   subfamilies, monophyly of the clade ``LAMPO{''} (subfamilies:
   Lithocolletinae, Acrocercopinae, Marmarinae, Phyllocnistinae, and
   Oecophyllembiinae) and relationships of its subclade ``AMO{''}
   (subfamilies: Acrocercopinae, Marmarinae, and Oecophyllembiinae) were
   strongly supported. A sister-group relationship of Ornixolinae to the
   remainder of the family, and a monophyletic leaf roller lineage
   (Callicercops Vari + Parornichinae) + Gracillariinae, as sister to the
   ``LAMPO{''} clade were supported by the most likely tree. Dating
   analyses indicate a mid-Cretaceous (105.3 Ma) origin of the family,
   followed by a rapid diversification into the nine subfamilies predating
   the Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction. We hypothesize that advanced
   larval behaviours, such as making keeled or tentiform blotch mines,
   rolling leaves and galling, allowed gracillariids to better avoid larval
   parasitoids allowing them to further diversify. Finally, we stabilize
   the classification by formally re-establishing the subfamily ranks of
   Marmarinae stat.rev., Oecophyllembiinae stat.rev. and Parornichinae
   stat.rev., and erect a new subfamily, Callicercopinae Li, Ohshima and
   Kawahara to accommodate the enigmatic genus Callicercops.},

Abstract = {``Candidatus Sulcia muelleri{''} (Sulcia) is a diverse lineage of
   intracellular nutritional endosymbiotic bacteria strictly associated
   with auchenorrhynchous hemipteran insects. Sulcia has undergone
   long-term codiversification with its insect hosts but the phylogeny of
   these endosymbionts, their relationships to other bacteria, and the
   extent of their occurrence within various groups of Auchenorrhyncha
   remain inadequately explored. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of
   Sulcia and related bacteria were performed to elucidate its position
   relative to other members of Phylum Bacteroidetes and the degree of
   congruence to the phylogeny of its auchenorrhynchous hosts. Maximum
   likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses of Flavobacteriales
   based on genomic data from 182 bacterial strains recover a monophyletic
   Sulcia within a larger clade of flavobacterial insect endosymbionts,
   closely related to Weeksellaceae. Molecular divergence time analysis of
   Sulcia dates the origin of Sulcia at approximately 339.95 million years
   ago (Myr) and the initial divergence within Sulcia at approximately
   256.91 Myr but these are considered underestimates due to the tendency
   for endosymbionts to evolve at higher rates compared to their
   free-living relatives. Screening of 96 recently sequenced hemipteran
   transcriptomes revealed that 73 of these species, all Auchenorrhyncha,
   harbored Sulcia. Phylogenetic analysis of 131 orthologous genes plus 16S
   rRNA for 101 Sulcia strains, representing six fulgoroid families and all
   the families of Cicadomorpha except Tettigarctidae, recover largely
   congruent phylogenies between Sulcia and Auchenorrhyncha. The phylogeny
   of Sulcia strongly supports the superfamily relationships Fulgoroidea +
   (Cicadoidea + (Cercopoidea + Membracoidea)). Relationships within
   individual superfamilies are also largely concordant, with the few areas
   of apparent incongruence between Sulcia and insect genes attributable to
   low branch support in one or both datasets. These results suggest that
   analysis of Sulcia phylogeny may contribute to resolution of contentious
   aspects of Auchenorrhyncha phylogeny.},

Abstract = {We describe two new species of Lophocoronidae: Acanthocorona hedida
   Zhang, Shih and Engel sp. n. and Acanthocorona venulosa Zhang, Shih and
   Engel sp. n., and an undetermined specimen from mid-Cretaceous Kachin
   amber. Phylogenetic analysis of basal lepidopteran lineages, including
   three extinct families, was undertaken. The analysis supported monophyly
   of Glossata although internal relationships remain controversial.
   Acanthocorona and Lophocorona form a monophyletic group. It is likely
   that short and simply structured proboscides of Acanthocorona were used
   to sip water droplets, pollination drops from gymnosperms, nectar from
   early flowers, or sap from injured leaves. Both retracted and extended
   ovipositors are preserved in the material reported here, revealing their
   morphology and indicating that these Cretaceous lophocoronids inserted
   eggs into the tissues of their host plants.},

Title = {A reconsideration of inapplicable characters, and an approximation with
   step-matrix recoding},

Abstract = {Evidence for phylogenetic analysis comes in the form of observed
   similarities, and trees are selected to minimize the number of
   similarities that cannot be accounted for by homology (homoplasies).
   Thus, the classical argument for parsimony directly links homoplasy with
   explanatory power. When characters are hierarchically related, a first
   character may represent a primary structure such as tail
   absence/presence and a secondary (subordinate) character may describe
   tail colour; this makes tail colour inapplicable when tail is absent. It
   has been proposed that such character hierarchies should be evaluated on
   the same logical basis as standard characters, maximizing the number of
   similarities accounted for by secondary homology, i.e. common ancestry.
   Previous evaluations of the homology of a given ancestral reconstruction
   contain the unintuitive quantity ``subcharacters{''} (number of regions
   of applicability). Rather than counting subcharacters, this paper
   proposes an equivalent but more intuitive formulation, based on counting
   the number of changes into each separate state. In this formulation,
   x-transformations, the homoplasy for the reconstruction is simply the
   number of changes into the state beyond the first, summed over all
   states. There is thus no direct connection between homoplasy and number
   of steps, only between homoplasy and extra steps. The link between the
   two formulations is that, for any region of applicability of any
   character, a subcharacter can be interpreted as the change into the
   state that is plesiomorphic in that region. Although some authors have
   claimed that the equivalence between maximizing explanatory power and
   minimizing independent originations of similar features (i.e. the
   standard justification of parsimony) does not hold for inapplicable
   characters, evaluating homoplasy with x-transformations clearly connects
   the two sides of that equation. Furthermore, as the evaluation with
   x-transformations provides a direct count and a straightforward
   interpretation of homoplasy, it extends naturally into implied
   weighting, and sheds light on problems with additive, step-matrix or
   continuous characters. It also allows deriving transformation costs for
   recoding hierarchies as step-matrix characters (where recoded states
   correspond to permissible combinations of states in primary and
   secondary characters), so that homology of the original observations is
   properly measured. Those transformation costs set the cost of gaining
   the primary structure to the maximum difference between ``present{''}
   states plus cost of loss, and difference between ``present{''} states to
   the sum of user-defined transformation costs between secondary features.
   With such recoding, invoking multiple independent derivations of the
   structure and similar features will cost as many extra ``steps{''} as
   the instances of similarities (in both original characters) that are not
   being homologized. The step-matrix recoding also can take into account
   nested dependences. We present a simple convention for naming
   characters, which TNT can use to automatically convert the original data
   into a step-matrix form and set the proper transformation costs.
   Finally, the basic elements for handling inapplicable characters in the
   context of maximum-likelihood inference are outlined, and some
   quantitative comparisons between different approaches to inapplicables
   are provided.},

Title = {Distribution patterns of Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the
   Americas: an analysis based on networks and endemicity},

Abstract = {Triatominae, commonly known as kissing bugs, are a group of
   approximately 150 species of hematophagous reduviids, some of which are
   vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas
   disease. Distributional patterns of triatomines have been studied based
   on macroecological and historical biogeographic approaches, but the
   definition of distributional patterns and areas of endemism are yet to
   be defined based on objective criteria. We used two methods to identify
   biogeographic units in the Triatominae: the endemicity analysis based on
   an optimality criterion (NDM/VNDM software) and a network approach aimed
   to simplify and highlight the underlying structure in species
   distributions (Infomap Bioregions). Information on species distributions
   was obtained from a data paper, comprising 21 815 records for 135
   triatomine species occurring in the Americas. The resulting areas of
   each method were clustered using a meta consensus criterion based on
   dissimilarities and interpreted as recurrent areas. The NDM areas show a
   nested structure, presenting greater restrictions to the inclusion of
   species in a given area, requiring broad sympatry. In contrast,
   bioregions emphasize spatial patterns with better-delimited areas and
   species occurrences do not need to be highly congruent. When areas were
   clustered based on their species composition two clear patterns arose
   from both methods: (i) areas within the southern Amazon and southeast
   South America, especially in the Chacoan subregion, formed a cluster,
   and (ii) areas north of the Amazon, Pacific, Mesoamerica, Mexican
   transition zone and Nearctic formed another cluster. Moreover, within
   each of these two clusters, there was a latitudinal gradient of the
   areas in the Americas showing spatial similarity between the areas found
   in both methods. Results of both methods show well-bound areas
   separating the triatomine fauna in the Brazilian subregions, resulting
   in the recognition of areas corresponding to the biomes Chaco, Pampa,
   Cerrado, and Caatinga, and, to a lesser extent, the Atlantic Forest. (c)

Abstract = {The systematics of Megalopodidae is not adequately known, in spite of it
   being a relatively small group of phytophagous beetles. The first
   phylogenetic analysis of Megalopodidae with a comprehensive generic
   representation (25 genera of 30 described, 10 subgenera and 77 species)
   is undertaken. A parsimony analysis under equal and implied weights was
   carried out based on 147 adult and larval morphological characters.
   Subfamilies Palophaginae and Zeugophorinae were recovered as
   monophyletic, by contrast with Megalopodinae, which proved to be
   paraphyletic. Atelederinae are proposed as a new subfamily. Also, three
   tribes and three subtribes within Megalopodinae are proposed:
   Leucasteini trib.n., Sphondyliini trib.n. and Megalopodini, the latter
   including Macrolophina subtrib.n., Temnaspidina subtrib.n. and
   Megalopodina. The genera Macrolopha, Kuilua, Poecilomorpha, Temnaspis,
   Antonaria, Agathomerus, Megalopus and Bothromegalopus were recovered as
   non-monophyletic. New delimitations of the polyphyletic genera
   Poecilomorpha and Macrolopha are proposed, Clythraxeloma is resurrected,
   and the subgenera of Agathomerus are suppressed. The following new
   combinations are proposed: Kuilua apicata (Fairmaire), K. nyassae
   (Jacoby), Poecilomorpha cribricollis (Pic), P. minuta (Pic),
   Clythraxeloma assamensis (Jacoby), C. bipartita (Lacordaeri), C.
   discolineata (Pic), C. downesii (Baly), C. gerstaeckeri (Westwood), C.
   laosensis (Pic), C. maculata (Pic), C. mouhoti (Baly), C. nigrocyanea
   (Motschulsky), C. pretiosa (Reineck), Temnaspis tricoloripes (Pic) and
   Barticaria faciatus (Dalman). Clythraxeloma cyanipennis Kraatz is a
   restored combination. Distribution patterns of Megalopodidae largely
   conform to the breakup of Gondwanaland, with its main clades having
   particular distributions: Andean-Australian (Palophaginae), Ethiopian
   (Leucasteini, Sphondyliini, and Macrolophina), Neotropical (Ateledrinae
   and Megalopodina) and Ethiopian-Oriental-Palaearctic (Temnaspidina the
   result of a secondary expansion. Zeugophorinae present a worldwide
   distribution, except for the Neotropical and Andean regions, which may
   be the result of geodispersal. The findings of the present study also
   shed light on groups with taxonomic issues, where phylogenetic analyses
   are strongly needed.},

Abstract = {We analyzed patterns of complexity and simplicity in holometabolan
   insects using parsimony and maximum-likelihood. By contrast with other
   groups of arthropods (and most other groups of animals), insects have
   undergone a stepwise process of structural simplification in their
   evolution. The megadiverse Holometabola are characterized mainly by
   structurally simplified larvae, which differ strongly from the adults in
   their morphology and usually also in their life habits. Although smaller
   groups such as Neuropterida have largely maintained their structural
   complexity in adults and immature life stages, a series of reductions
   occurred with the appearance and diversification of Coleopterida,
   Mecopterida and especially Antliophora. Parasitic Strepsiptera or fleas
   display conspicuous patterns of reduction in different life stages and
   body regions, and high degrees of simplification also occur in groups
   with short-lived adults. Larvae living in moist substrates display
   far-reaching structural simplifications and also morphological
   uniformity, especially in the species-rich Diptera, but also in other
   groups. Liquid feeding leads to correlated simplifications and
   innovation of adult head structures, especially of the mouthparts.
   Functional or anatomical dipterism leads to an optimization of the
   flight apparatus in most holometabolous groups, which is correlated with
   reductions in one of the pterothoracic segments, and coupled (e.g. by
   hamuli), partly reduced or transformed wings (e.g. halteres). In
   flightless groups, the pterothoracic skeleto-muscular apparatus is
   strongly simplified. In the abdomen of adult females a stepwise
   reduction of the lepismatoid ovipositor occurs. By contrast, the male
   genital apparatus often undergoes an extreme diversification. Our
   evaluations revealed a highly correlated complexity between larval and
   adult stages.},

Title = {When phylogenetics met biogeography: Willi Hennig, Lars Brundin and the
   roots of phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Willi Hennig's (Beitr. Ent. 1960, 10, 15) Die Dipteren-Fauna von
   Neuseeland als systematisches und tiergeographisches Problem applied a
   phylogenetic approach to examine the distributional patterns exhibited
   by the Diptera of New Zealand. Hennig showed how phylogenetic trees may
   be used to infer dispersal, based on the progression and deviation
   rules, and also discussed the existence of vicariance patterns. The most
   important author who applied Hennig's phylogenetic biogeography was Lars
   Brundin, when analysing the phylogenetic relationships of two taxa of
   Chironomidae (Diptera) and using them to examine the biogeographic
   relationships of Australia, New Zealand, South America and South Africa.
   The relevance of Brundin's contribution was noted by several authors, as
   it began the cladistic or vicariance approach to biogeography, that
   implies the discovery of vicariance events shared by different
   monophyletic groups. Both phylogenetic and cladistic biogeography have a
   place in contemporary biogeography, the former for analysing taxon
   biogeography and the latter when addressing Earth or biota biogeography.
   The recent use of the term ``phylogenetic biogeography{''} to refer to a
   posteriori methods of cladistic biogeography is erroneous and should be
   avoided.},

Title = {Parsing a plethora of pollen: the role of pollen size and shape in the
   evolution of Boraginaceae},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204-226},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pollen, the microgametophyte of seed plants, has an important role in
   plant reproduction and, therefore, evolution. Pollen is variable in, for
   example, size, shape, aperture number; these features are particularly
   diverse in some plant taxa and can be diagnostic. In one family,
   Boraginaceae, the range of pollen diversity suggests the potential
   utility of this family as a model for integrative studies of pollen
   development, evolution and molecular biology. In the present study, a
   comprehensive survey of the diversity and evolution of pollen from 538
   species belonging to 72 genera was made using data from the literature
   and additional scanning electron microscopy examination. Shifts in
   diversification rates and the evolution of various quantitative
   characters were detected, and the results revealed remarkable
   differences in size, shape and number of apertures. The pollen of one
   subfamily, Boraginoideae, is larger than that in Cynoglossoideae. The
   diversity of pollen shapes and aperture numbers in one tribe,
   Lithospermeae, is greater than that in the other tribes. Ancestral
   pollen for the family was resolved as small, prolate grains that bear
   three apertures and are iso-aperturate. Of all the tribes, the greatest
   number of changes in pollen size and aperture number were observed in
   Lithospermeae and Boragineae, and the number of apertures was found to
   be stable throughout all tribes of Cynoglossoideae. In addition, the
   present study showed that diversification of Boraginaceae cannot be
   assigned to a single factor, such as pollen size, and the increased rate
   of diversification for species-rich groups (e.g. Cynoglossum) is not
   correlated with pollen size or shape evolution. The palynological data
   and patterns of character evolution presented in the study provide
   better resolution of the roles of geographical and ecological factors in
   the diversity and evolution of pollen grains of Boraginaceae, and
   provide suggestions for future palynological research across the family.},

Title = {Analysis of endemism of world arthropod distribution data supports
   biogeographic regions and many established subdivisions},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {559-570},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We analyzed 769 242 occurrence records for 115 424 species of
   terrestrial arthropods, from three biodiversity repositories (Global
   Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Natural History Museum,
   London, and ``Sistema de Informacao Distribuido para Colecoes
   Biologicas{''} (SpeciesLink)), to test the use of global-scale data
   points for quantitative assessments of areas of endemism. The data
   include Insecta (105,941 species), Arachnida (7984 species), Myriapoda
   (1229) and terrestrial crustaceans (270 Branchiopoda). The species were
   assigned to 14 543 higher taxonomic groups because such groups often
   characterize larger areas of endemism. Putative areas of endemism were
   visualized as sets of cells displaying unique groups of species without
   the assumption of hierarchical relationships. Yet, the use of 10 degrees
   grid cells recovered many large areas broadly corresponding to
   biogeographic Regions (Nearctic, Neotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic,
   Afrotropical, Australian, Oceanian and Oriental) albeit with the limits
   poorly defined. An analysis of 5 degrees grids resulted in 306 sets
   included in the different biogeographic Realms: Afrotropical,
   Australian, Madagascan, Nearctic, Neotropical, Oceanian, Oriental,
   Palaearctic, Saharo-Arabian and Sino-Japanese. The Panamanian Realm
   comprises 89 partly overlapping sets, crossing the Nearctic and
   Neotropical boundaries. A total of 7338 species of Insecta were endemic
   to some areas (Sino-Japanese, Afrotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic,
   among others), followed by Arachnida (412 spp) and 105 species in other
   clades ranked as ``classes{''}. Six sets were supported only by genera,
   except for Panamanian sets that were supported by genera and families.
   Many of the species in the dataset are included in IUCN red lists, but
   probably most of those have distributions more restricted than global
   areas of endemism; only 102 appear as endemic to some area (Neartic,
   Madagascan, Panamanian, Afrotropical, among others). The results show
   that data from global databases can be used to identify areas of
   endemism on a worldwide basis but-owing to their incompleteness-only at
   a relatively coarse level. At the level of resolution currently allowed
   by such databases, such global studies are only complementary to studies
   where areas are determined subjectively by systematists (instead of
   actual point records), or studies using point records in datasets for
   specific taxonomic groups curated and compiled by specialists.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny and evolution of Calaphidinae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-186},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Calaphidinae is the second-largest subfamily in the family Aphididae.
   Despite their species diversity and some taxonomic controversy, no
   phylogenetic studies have been conducted on them thus far. Herein, we
   report the first molecular phylogeny of Calaphidinae and two related
   lineages, Phyllaphidinae and Saltusaphidinae, based on five genes (3418
   bp) for 126 taxa. Maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian
   inference phylogenetic analyses were performed on the multilocus
   dataset. Divergence time estimation, biogeographical reconstruction,
   ancestral host plant reconstruction and PhyloType analyses were
   performed to identify evolutionary trends in Calaphidinae. Our
   phylogenetic results lead to several conclusions: Phyllaphidinae is a
   sister group to Calaphidinae s.l.; Calaphidinae is paraphyletic with
   respect to the former ``Saltusaphidinae{''}; the ingroup clade was
   subdivided into nine newly recognized lineages; and three subtribes of
   Calaphidinae (Monaphidina, Calaphdina and Panaphidina) and many genera
   were not recovered as monophyletic. A new classification is proposed
   with eight tribal divisions that reflect our phylogenetic results,
   including three new tribes (Pterocallidini trib.n., Pseudochromaphidini
   trib.n. and Shivaphidini trib.n.) and three new statuses (Saltusaphidini
   stat.n., Therioaphidini stat.n. and Myzocallidini stat.n.). The
   ancestral reconstruction results imply that the ingroup taxa's common
   ancestor originated in the Eastern Palaearctic and might have fed on
   Fagaceae in the Late Cretaceous. Later, multiple host shifts and an
   expanding geographical distribution led to the current species diversity
   of Calaphidinae. Our reconstructions suggest that species
   diversification cannot solely be explained by speciation via host shifts
   and that geographical isolation probably also played a key role. Our
   results provide new insight into the natural classification and history
   of the host plant associations and biogeography of Calaphidinae s.l.},

Title = {Highly diversified mitochondrial genomes provide new evidence for
   interordinal relationships in the Arachnida},

Abstract = {Arachnida is an exceptionally diverse class in the Arthropoda,
   consisting of 20 orders and playing crucial roles in the terrestrial
   ecosystems. However, their interordinal relationships have been debated
   for over a century. Rearranged or highly rearranged mitochondrial
   genomes (mitogenomes) were consistently found in this class, but their
   various extent in different lineages and efficiency for resolving
   arachnid phylogenies are unclear. Here, we reconstructed phylogenetic
   trees using mitogenome sequences of 290 arachnid species to decipher
   interordinal relationships as well as diversification through time. Our
   results recovered monophyly of ten orders (i.e. Amblypygi, Araneae,
   Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones, Ricinulei,
   Sarcoptiformes, Scorpiones and Solifugae), while rejecting monophyly of
   the Trombidiformes due to the unstable position of the Eriophyoidea. The
   monophyly of Acari (subclass) was rejected, possibly due to the
   long-branch attraction of the Pseudoscorpiones. The monophyly of
   Arachnida was further rejected because the Xiphosura nested within
   arachnid orders with unstable positions. Mitogenomes that are highly
   rearranged in mites but less rearranged or conserved in the remaining
   lineages point to their exceptional diversification in mite orders;
   however, shared derived mitochondrial (mt) gene clusters were found
   within superfamilies rather than interorders, confusing phylogenetic
   signals in arachnid interordinal relationships. Molecular dating results
   show that arachnid orders have ancient origins, ranging from the
   Ordovician to the Carboniferous, yet have significantly diversified
   since the Cretaceous in orders Araneae, Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes,
   and Trombidiformes. By summarizing previously resolved key positions of
   some orders, we propose a plausible arachnid tree of life. Our results
   underline a more precise framework for interordinal phylogeny in the
   Arachnida and provide new insights into their ancient evolution.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {We recently published a method to infer ancestral landmark-based shape
   ontogenies that takes into account the possible existence of changes in
   developmental timing. Here we describe SPASOS, a software to perform
   that analysis. SPASOS is an open-source Windows program written in C.
   Input data include landmark coordinates for each specimen -with the
   corresponding information about developmental timing- and a phylogenetic
   tree showing the relationships among the species sampled. As output, the
   program produces image files for an easy visualization of the results
   and data files useful for post-processing. The program incorporates an
   interpolating function, based on weighting moving averages, which allows
   analysis of data with scarce information along the ontogenetic
   trajectory. An empirical evaluation of this function showed its
   suitability to fill in incomplete ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we
   present the results of a reanalysis in SPASOS of a published dataset,
   where changes in developmental timing were originally inferred by
   considering PCA scores as shape variables. Both approaches retrieved the
   same four largest changes in developmental timing, but differed in the
   ancestral shapes inferred.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny of the tropical wandering spiders (Araneae,
   Ctenidae) and the evolution of eye conformation in the RTA clade},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Tropical wandering spiders (Ctenidae) are a diverse group of cursorial
   predators with its greatest species richness in the tropics.
   Traditionally, Ctenidae are diagnosed based on the presence of eight
   eyes arranged in three rows (a 2-4-2 pattern). We present a molecular
   phylogeny of Ctenidae, including for the first time representatives of
   all of its subfamilies. The molecular phylogeny was inferred using five
   nuclear (histone H3, 28S, 18S, Actin and ITS-2) and four mitochondrial
   (NADH, COI, 12S and 16S) markers. The final matrix includes 259
   terminals, 103 of which belong to Ctenidae and represent 28 of the
   current 49 described genera. We estimated divergence times by including
   fossils as calibration points and biogeographic events, and used the
   phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to reconstruct the evolution of the eye
   conformation in the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade. Ctenidae
   and its main lineages originated during the Paleocene-Eocene and have
   diversified in the tropics since then. However, in some analyses
   Ctenidae was recovered as polyphyletic as the genus Ancylometes Bertkau,
   1880 was placed as sister to Oxyopidae. Except for Acantheinae, in which
   the type genus Acantheis Thorell, 1891 is placed inside Cteninae, the
   four recognized subfamilies of Ctenidae are monophyletic in most
   analyses. The ancestral reconstruction of the ocular conformation in the
   retrolateral tibial apophysis clade suggests that the ocular pattern of
   Ctenidae has evolved convergently seven times and that it has originated
   from ocular conformations of two rows of four eyes (4-4) and the ocular
   pattern of lycosids (4-2-2). We also synonymize the monotypic genus
   Parabatinga Polotov \& Brescovit, 2009 with Centroctenus Mello-Leitao,
   1929. We discuss some of the putative morphological synapomorphies of
   the main ctenid lineages within the phylogenetic framework offered by
   the molecular phylogenetic results of the study.},

Abstract = {RAD sequencing yields large amounts of genome-wide data at a relatively
   low cost and without requiring previous taxon-specific information,
   making it ideal for evolutionary studies of highly diversified and
   neglected organisms. However, concerns about information decay with
   phylogenetic distance have discouraged its use for assessing
   supraspecific relationships. Here, using Double Digest Restriction
   Associated DNA (ddRAD) data, we perform the first deep-level approach to
   the phylogeny of Zodarion, a highly diversified spider genus. We explore
   the impact of loci and taxon filtering across concatenated and
   multispecies coalescent reconstruction methods and investigate the
   patterns of information dropout in reference to both the time of
   divergence and the mitochondrial divergence between taxa. We found that
   relaxed loci-filtering and nested taxon-filtering strategies maximized
   the amount of molecular information and improved phylogenetic inference.
   As expected, there was a clear pattern of allele dropout towards deeper
   time and mitochondrial divergences, but the phylogenetic signal remained
   strong throughout the phylogeny. Therefore, we inferred topologies that
   were almost fully resolved, highly supported, and noticeably congruent
   between setups and inference methods, which highlights overall
   inconsistency in the taxonomy of Zodarion. Because Zodarion appears to
   be among the oldest and most mitochondrially diversified spider genera,
   our results suggest that ddRAD data show high potential for inferring
   intra-generic relationships across spiders and probably also in other
   taxonomic groups.},

Abstract = {Baripus is a ground beetle genus endemic to southern South America,
   currently distributed across grassland and shrub habitats in mountain
   and lowland regions. The species of this genus are known to have been
   affected by the Andean orogeny and the climate changes that occurred
   during this process. In this study, we seek to understand how the
   orogeny of the Andes may have led to changes in the climatic niches of
   the species of Baripus over time. We integrated former ecological and
   historical biogeographic hypotheses, exploring the use of parsimony
   optimization of phylogenetically structured climate variables and
   ancestral character state reconstruction methods. We then performed
   regression analyses of the optimized climatic niche variables within the
   phylogenetic tree of Baripus. We were able to infer significant climatic
   niche constraints, and niche changes that provide new insights to the
   existing knowledge, supporting former ecological and biogeographic
   hypotheses for this genus. Such trends in climatic niche could be
   explained by the rain shadow effect caused by the Andean uplift as well
   as with other climate shifts associated with temperature and
   precipitation swings that occurred in this region from the Middle
   Miocene to the Pliocene.},

Title = {Phylogenetic value of jaw elements of lacertid lizards (Squamata:

Abstract = {Several extinct species are known from the family Lacertidae, but due to
   poor preservation, many of them are based on single bones. Here, we
   compare phylogenetic signals of disarticulated premaxillae, maxillae and
   dentaries of lacertids from four French Oligocene localities (Coderet,
   La Colombiere, Roqueprune 2, Mas de Got B). We identified five
   morphotypes among the premaxillae, six among the maxillae, and ten among
   the dentaries. These morphotypes were scored as individual taxa per
   locality into three separate character matrices with the same 246
   characters, one matrix for each jaw element. Subsequently, the
   phylogenetic position of the morphotypes was tested using maximum
   parsimony. The consensus trees with the dentaries and the maxillae found
   a large polytomy including all taxa except the outgroup taxon Gekko
   gecko. The consensus tree with the premaxillae showed a considerably
   more resolved topology but found all morphotype taxa outside Lacertidae.
   In a second step, we compared the constitution of our three datasets and
   the morphotype taxa. Our results suggest that a combination of
   convergent characters and missing data led to the outgroup position of
   the premaxilla morphotype taxa. The poor resolution of the maxillae
   strict consensus is likely a consequence of their fragmentary
   preservation. For the dentaries, a high amount of missing data due to
   the high number of morphotype taxa most likely caused the poor tree
   resolution. Indeed, tests with fewer morphotypes found tree resolutions
   comparable to the premaxilla data. When linking the morphotypes, five
   possible lacertid ``species{''} were found. Comparison with already
   known French Oligocene lacertid species points to a slightly higher
   species richness of Lacertidae at that time than known before. Reliable
   species classification based on phylogeny only seems possible when
   combining the jaw elements or in association with other cranial and
   postcranial material, putting some doubt on species identifications
   based on single bones.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Sesiids are a diverse group of predominantly diurnal moths, many of
   which are Batesian mimics of Hymenoptera. However, their diversity and
   relationships are poorly understood. A multi-gene phylogenetic analysis
   of 48 North American sesiid species confirmed the traditional taxonomic
   tribal ranks, demonstrated the paraphyly of Carmenta and Synanthedon
   with respect to several other genera and ultimately provided minimal
   phylogenetic resolution within and between North American and European
   groups. Character support from each gene suggested inconsistency between
   the phylogenetic signal of the CAD gene and that of the other four
   genes. However, removal of CAD from subsequent phylogenetic analyses did
   not substantially change the initial phylogenetic results or return
   Carmenta and Synanthedon as reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting that
   it was not impacting the overall phylogenetic signal. The lack of
   resolution using genes that are typically informative at the species
   level for other lepidopterans suggests a surprisingly rapid radiation of
   species in Carmenta/Synanthedon. This group also exhibits a wide range
   of mimicry strategies and hostplant usage, which could be fertile ground
   for future study.},

Title = {Plastid phylogenomics provides novel insights into the infrafamilial

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {717-727},

Abstract = {The polygrammoids (Polypodiaceae) are the most species-rich and
   diversified epiphytic fern lineages, and hold an important role to
   understand the deep diverging events and rapid adaptation to changing
   environments in the plant tree of life. Despite progress in the
   phylogeny of this group of ferns in previous multilocus phylogenetic
   studies, uncertainty remains especially in backbone relationships among
   closely related clades, and the phylogenetic placement of recalcitrant
   species or lineages. Here, we investigated the deep phylogenetic
   relationships within Polypodiaceae by sampling all major lineages and
   using 81 plastid genomes (plastomes), of which 70 plastomes were newly
   sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technology. Based on
   parsimony, maximum-likelihood, Bayesian and multispecies coalescent
   analyses of genome skimming data, we achieved a better resolution of the
   backbone phylogeny of Polypodiaceae. Using simulated data matrices, we
   detected that potential phylogenetic artefacts, such as long-branch
   attraction and insufficient taxonomic sampling, may have a confounding
   impact on the incongruence of phylogenetic inferences. Furthermore, our
   phylogenetic analyses offer greater resolution than previous multilocus
   studies, providing a robust framework for future phylogenetic
   implications on the subfamilial taxonomy of Polypodiaceae. Our
   phylogenomic study not only demonstrates the advantage of a
   character-rich plastome dataset for resolving the recalcitrant lineages
   that have undergone rapid radiation, but also sheds new light on
   integrative explorations understanding the evolutionary history of large
   fern groups in the genomic era.},

Abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in
   humans in 2002. Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original
   animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses
   are the most likely origin. The emergence of the Middle East respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted
   lineages. However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies
   hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans
   and Artiodactyla. Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent
   of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history
   of zoonotic transmission events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic
   analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of
   Orthocoronavirinae. We used gene annotations to align orthologous
   sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality
   criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups
   to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among
   ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses
   are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses.
   Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a
   comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans.
   Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the
   phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted
   coronaviruses.},

Title = {A phylotranscriptomic framework for flesh fly evolution (Diptera,
   Calyptratae, Sarcophagidae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Volume = {37},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Sarcophagidae (flesh flies) comprise a large and widely distributed
   radiation within the Calyptratae (Diptera). Larval feeding habits are
   ecologically diverse and include sarcosaprophagy, coprophagy, herbivory,
   invertebrate and vertebrate predation, and kleptoparasitism. To
   elucidate the geographic origin and evolution of flesh fly life-history,
   we inferred a backbone phylogeny based on transcriptomic data from 26
   sarcophagid species covering all three subfamilies plus 15 outgroups.
   The phylogeny was inferred using maximum parsimony and maximum
   likelihood methods based on a series of supermatrices, one set with
   overall information content improved by MARE (2290 loci), one set with
   100\% gene coverage for all included species (587 loci), and the last
   set including mitochondrial and nuclear genes (589 loci) and additional
   taxa. In order to obtain a more detailed hypothesis, we utilized the
   supertree approach to combine results from the present study with
   previously published hypotheses. This resulted supertree covers 84 of
   the one hundred currently recognized sarcophagid genera and formed the
   basis for the ancestral state reconstructions. The monophyletic
   Sarcophagidae is well-supported as sister to \{Mystacinobiidae +
   Oestridae\}, and relationships at the subfamily level are inferred as
   \{Sarcophaginae, (Paramacronychiinae + Miltogramminae)\}. The
   Sarcophagidae and each subfamily originated in the Americas, with
   Sarcophaginae diversifying mainly in the Neotropics, whereas the major
   radiation of both Miltogramminae and Paramacronychiinae occurred in the
   Palaearctic. Sarcosaprophagy is reconstructed as the ancestral larval
   feeding habit of the family Sarcophagidae and each subfamily. The
   ancestral sarcophagid larva probably utilized dead invertebrates as
   food, and the food spectrum expanded together with the diversification
   of breeding strategies. Particularly, kleptoparasitism in Miltogramminae
   is derived from sarcosaprophagy and may be seen as having derived from
   the breeding biology of `lower' miltogrammines, the larvae of which feed
   on buried vertebrate carrion.},

Abstract = {A species complex is an assemblage of closely related species with
   blurred boundaries, and from which species could arise from different
   speciation processes and/or a speciation continuum. Such a complex can
   provide an opportunity to investigate evolutionary mechanisms acting on
   speciation. The Chrysanthemum zawadskii species complex in China, a
   monophyletic group of Chrysanthemum, consists of seven species with
   considerable morphological variation, diverse habitats and different
   distribution patterns. Here, we used Hyb-Seq data to construct a
   well-resolved phylogeny of the C. zawadskii complex. Then, we performed
   comparative analyses of variation patterns in morphology, ecology and
   distribution to investigate the roles of geography and ecology in this
   complex's diversification. Lastly, we implemented divergence time
   estimation, species distribution modelling and ancestral area
   reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of this complex. We
   concluded that the C. zawadskii complex originated in the Qinling-Daba
   mountains during the early Pliocene and then spread west and northward
   along the mountain ranges to northern China. During this process,
   geographical and ecological factors imposing different influences
   resulted in the current diversification and distribution patterns of
   this species complex, which is composed of both well-diverged species
   and diverging lineages on the path of speciation.},

Title = {Parsimony analysis of phylogenomic datasets (I): scripts and guidelines

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We discuss here the use of TNT (Tree Analysis using New Technology) for
   phylogenomic analysis. For such data, parsimony is a useful alternative
   to model-based analyses, which frequently utilize models that make
   unrealistic assumptions (e.g. low heterotachy), struggle with high
   levels of missing data, etc. Parsimony and model-based methods often
   yield trees with few topological differences, which can then be analyzed
   further in order to investigate whether these few topological
   differences are due to undesirable analysis artefacts. This is
   facilitated by the greater speed and computational efficiency of
   parsimony, which allow for a more in-depth analysis of datasets. We here
   briefly describe the computationally most efficient and versatile
   parsimony software, TNT, which can be used for phylogenetic and
   phylogenomic analyses. In particular, we describe and provide a series
   of scripts that are specifically designed for the analysis of
   phylogenomic datasets. This includes scripts for concatenation of gene
   data files in different formats, generation of plots and datasets with
   different levels of gene/taxon occupancy, calculation of different
   support measures and phylogenetic reconstruction based on concatenated
   matrices and single genes. The execution of the scripts is also
   demonstrated with video clips (). Lastly, we describe the main commands
   and functions that enable efficient phylogenomic analyses in TNT.},

Abstract = {We examined the impact of successive alignment quality-control steps on
   downstream phylogenomic analyses. We applied a recently published
   phylogenomics pipeline that was developed for the Angiosperms353
   target-sequence-capture probe set to the flowering plant order
   Celastrales. Our final dataset consists of 158 species, including at
   least one exemplar from all 109 currently recognized Celastrales genera.
   We performed nine quality-control steps and compared the inferred
   resolution, branch support, and topological congruence of the inferred
   gene and species trees with those generated after each of the first six
   steps. We describe and justify each of our quality-control steps,
   including manual masking, in detail so that they may be readily applied
   to other lineages. We found that highly supported clades could generally
   be relied upon even if stringent orthology and alignment quality-control
   measures had not been applied. But separate instances were identified,
   for both concatenation and coalescence, wherein a clade was highly
   supported before manual masking but then subsequently contradicted.
   These results are generally reassuring for broad-scale analyses that use
   phylogenomics pipelines, but also indicate that we cannot rely
   exclusively on these analyses to conclude how challenging phylogenetic
   problems are best resolved.},

Abstract = {The sequential breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea since the Middle
   Jurassic is one of the crucial factors that has driven the
   biogeographical patterns of terrestrial biotas. Despite decades of
   effort searching for concordant patterns between diversification and
   continental fragmentation among taxonomic groups, increasing evidence
   has revealed more complex and idiosyncratic scenarios resulting from a
   mixture of vicariance, dispersal and extinction. Aquatic insects with
   discreet ecological requirements, low vagility and disjunct
   distributions represent a valuable model for testing biogeographical
   hypotheses by reconstructing their distribution patterns and temporal
   divergences. Insects of the order Megaloptera have exclusively aquatic
   larvae, their adults have low vagility, and the group has a highly
   disjunct geographical distribution. Here we present a comprehensive
   phylogeny of Megaloptera based on a large-scale mitochondrial genome
   sequencing of 99 species representing >90\% of the world genera from all
   major biogeographical regions. Molecular dating suggests that the deep
   divergence within Megaloptera pre-dates the breakup of Pangaea.
   Subsequently, the intergeneric divergences within Corydalinae
   (dobsonflies), Chauliodinae (fishflies) and Sialidae (alderflies) might
   have been driven by both vicariance and dispersal correlated with the
   shifting continent during the Cretaceous, but with strikingly different
   and incongruent biogeographical signals. The austral distribution of
   many corydalids appears to be a result of colonization from Eurasia
   through southward dispersal across Europe and Africa during the
   Cretaceous, whereas a nearly contemporaneous dispersal via northward
   rafting of Gondwanan landmasses may account for the colonization of
   extant Eurasian alderflies from the south.},

   disjunct Thuja occidentalis-Thuja koraiensis group. Our results
   suggested that the observed topological discordance among the gene trees
   as well as the cytonuclear discordance is mainly due to incomplete
   lineage sorting, probably facilitated by the fast diversification of
   Thuja around the Early Miocene and the large effective population sizes
   of ancestral lineages. Furthermore, approximately 20\% of the T.
   sutchuenensis nuclear genome is derived from an unknown ancestral
   lineage of Thuja, which might explain the close resemblance of its cone
   morphology to that of an ancient fossil species. Overall, our study
   demonstrates that single genes may not resolve interspecific
   relationships for disjunct taxa, and that more reliable results will
   come from hundreds or thousands of loci, revealing a more complex
   evolutionary history. This will steadily improve our understanding of
   their origin and evolution.},

Title = {Combined phylogenetic analysis of Pleurodema (Anura: Leptodactylidae:
   Leiuperinae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-319},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The genus Pleurodema comprises 15 species distributed through the
   Neotropical region, from sea level up to 5000 m.a.s.l. A total-evidence
   analysis of Pleurodema is provided based on the parsimony criterion. The
   combined dataset included morphometric, phenotypic, and DNA evidence (34
   taxa, 4441 characters). The parsimony analysis yielded one
   most-parsimonious tree. Pleurodema was recovered as a well-supported
   clade composed of two major subclades. One subclade has an identical
   topology to that of previous analyses, the P. brachyops Clade (P. alium,
   P. borellii, P. brachyops, P. cinereum, P. diplolister, and P.
   tucumanum). The other subclade includes the remaining nine species of
   the genus, exhibiting a topology different from that of previous
   studies. According to the present phylogeny, this second lineage is
   formed by the P. nebulosum Clade (P. guayapae + P. nebulosum), P.
   marmoratum, the re-defined P. thaul Clade (P. bufoninum, P.
   somuncurense, P. thaul) and the P. bibroni Clade (P. bibroni, P.
   cordobae, P. kriegi). The reproductive modes of Pleurodema represent a
   unique combination of features within Leiuperinae, including three
   egg-clutch structures, two types of amplexus, and lack of vocalization.
   Also, some species of Pleurodema have been considered fossorial, because
   they are capable of digging with their hind-limbs and remaining in
   self-made burrows during dry seasons. The evolution of characters
   associated with reproductive biology and fossoriality is discussed in
   light of the obtained results.},

Title = {A molecular phylogeny of Thuridilla Bergh, 1872 sea slugs (Gastropoda,
   Sacoglossa) reveals a case of flamboyant and cryptic radiation in the
   marine realm},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Abstract = {The genus Thuridilla Bergh, 1872 comprises mostly tropical sap-sucking
   sea slugs species with flamboyantly coloured forms. However, the
   potential for cryptic or pseudocryptic species masked by convergent or
   polymorphic colour patterns has not been tested using molecular
   characters. In this study, we sampled 20 of the 23 recognized worldwide
   species and performed the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic
   analysis of the genus to date using a multi-locus approach combining two
   mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rRNA) and two nuclear
   (Histone H3, 28S rRNA) genes using maximum likelihood, maximum-parsimony
   and Bayesian criteria. Three molecular species delimitation methods
   (ABGD, GMYC, bPTP) and the morphology of radular teeth were additionally
   used to aid in species delimitation. Our analyses supported 35 species
   within Thuridilla, of which more than one-third (13) are part of a
   single radiation here named the Thuridilla gracilis (Risbec, 1928)
   species-complex. This complex includes T. gracilis, T. splendens (Baba,
   1949), T. bayeri (Er. Marcus, 1965), and T. ratna (Er. Marcus, 1965),
   plus nine additional undescribed species. All 13 species are
   distinguishable by radular characters, external morphology and their
   DNA. The detection of this radiation led diversity of Thuridilla to be
   underestimated by about 25\% and provides a new comparative system for
   studying the role of colour patterns in marine diversification.},

Abstract = {Comprising about 82\% of the extant fern species diversity, Polypodiales
   are generally believed to have diversified in the Late Cretaceous. We
   estimated the divergence times of Polypodiales using both penalized
   likelihood and Bayesian methods, based on a dataset consisting of 208
   plastomes representing all 28 families and 14 fossil constraints
   reflecting current interpretations of fossil record. Our plastome
   phylogeny recovered the same six major lineages as a recent nuclear
   phylogeny, but the position of Dennstaedtiineae was different. The
   present phylogeny showed high resolution of relationships among the
   families of Polypodiales, especially among those forming the
   Aspleniineae. The divergence time estimates supported the most recent
   common ancestor of Polypodiales and its closest relative dating back to
   the Triassic, establishment of the major lineages in the Jurassic, and a
   likely accelerated radiation during the late Jurassic and the Early
   Cretaceous. The estimated divergence patterns of Polypodiales and
   angiosperms converge to a scenario in which their main lineages were
   established simultaneously shortly before the onset of the Cretaceous
   Terrestrial Revolution, and further suggest a pre-Cretaceous hidden
   history for both lineages. The pattern of simultaneous diversifications
   shown here elucidate an important gap in our understanding of the
   Terrestrial Revolution that shaped today's ecosystems.},

Title = {Burrowing into the forest: Phylogeny of the Asian forest scorpions

Abstract = {Asian forest scorpions (Scorpionidae Latreille, 1802: Heterometrinae
   Simon, 1879) are distributed across South and Southeast Asia. All are
   fossorial, constructing burrows under stones or in open ground, in
   habitats differing in precipitation and vegetation cover, from
   rainforests and tropical deciduous forests to savanna and scrubland. The
   systematics of these scorpions has long been confused due to bad
   taxonomy and the absence of a phylogenetic framework. Although the
   monophyly of the group was previously confirmed as part of broader
   phylogenetic analyses based on exemplar species, the only quantitative
   analysis of species-level variation to date was based on overall
   similarity. This contribution presents the first species-level
   phylogenetic analysis of Asian Scorpionidae, based on 186 morphological
   characters and 4188 aligned base-pairs of DNA sequence data from two
   nuclear and three mitochondrial loci for 132 terminals including all 41
   ingroup species and four outgroup species. Simultaneous analyses of the
   morphological and molecular datasets with parsimony, Maximum Likelihood
   and Bayesian Inference provided the framework for a revised
   classification presented elsewhere. In order to understand how
   adaptation following dispersal into new habitats has driven the
   morphological diversification of Asian forest scorpions, species were
   scored for 10 characters concerning morphology and burrow architecture,
   which contributed to an ensemble index of adaptation to habitat aridity.
   Species were classified into three ecomorphotypes based on the index,
   and ancestral state reconstruction of ecomorphotypes performed on the
   phylogeny. A pattern was recovered in which lineages and species
   occurring in different habitats on a continuum from wet (evergreen
   forest) to dry (savanna, scrubland) exhibited characters presumed to be
   adaptive and hence responsible for driving scorpion diversification.},

Title = {Evolution of cephalic structures in extreme myrmecophiles: a lesson from
   Clavigeritae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae)},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {335-358},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Pselaphinae is a large subfamily, comprising over 10 000 species of the
   megadiverse Staphylinidae (rove beetles). A remarkable feature of this
   group is the extreme structural diversity of different body regions,
   especially the head and its appendages. Within Pselaphinae, Clavigeritae
   stand out as a clade of highly specialized myrmecophiles. We examined
   internal and external head structures of the clavigerite species
   Diartiger kubotai Nomura, using state-of-the-art techniques. The
   cephalic morphology indicates in a phylogenetic context that the loss of
   eyes in some Clavigeritae was the latest of major evolutionary changes.
   We compiled the largest set of morphological data ever scored for the
   subfamily, comprising 155 characters of the head. Parsimony analyses and
   Bayesian inference yielded a similar phylogenetic pattern, largely
   congruent with results published previously. We retrieved Pselaphinae as
   a clade, and Faronitae as sister to all remaining groups of the
   subfamily. Faronitae are followed by a ``Euplectitae grade{''} and
   non-monophyletic Goniaceritae, Batrisitae and Pselaphitae. Clavigeritae
   are monophyletic, but have evolved within the pselaphite grade. The
   enigmatic Colilodion Besuchet, recently shifted from Clavigeritae to a
   paraphyletic Pselaphitae, was placed as sister to extant clavigerites
   based on an array of cephalic synapomorphies. The current classification
   of Pselaphinae is unstable and deep changes should be made maintaining
   only monophyletic units, whereas most of the supertribes are
   paraphyletic. Characters of the head, with a concentration of mouthparts
   and sensory structures, and essential parts of the digestive tract and
   the nervous system, are highly informative phylogenetically. Study of
   internal structures, presently still at a very preliminary stage,
   obviously is essential for understanding the evolution of Pselaphinae.
   Future genetic investigations may reveal mechanisms behind the unique
   structural megadiversity in this exceptional group of rove beetles.},

Title = {Phylogeny and biogeography of the ancient spider family Filistatidae
   (Araneae) is consistent both with long-distance dispersal and vicariance
   following continental drift},
Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Filistatids, the crevice weavers, are an ancient family of cribellate
   spiders without extant close relatives. As one of the first lineages of
   araneomorph spiders, they present a complicated mixture of primitive and
   derived characters that make them a key taxon to elucidate the phylogeny
   of spiders, as well as the evolution of phenotypic characters in this
   group. Their moderate diversity (187 species in 19 genera) is
   distributed mainly in arid and semi-arid subtropical zones of all
   continents, except Antarctica. The objective of this paper is to
   generate a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for this family to
   advance the understanding of its morphological evolution and
   biogeography, as well as lay the basis for a natural classification
   scheme. By studying the morphology using optical and electronic
   microscopy techniques, we produced a matrix of 302 morphological
   characters coded for a sample of 103 species of filistatids chosen to
   represent the phylogenetic diversity of the family. In addition, we
   included sequences of four molecular markers (COI, 16S, H3 and 28S; 3787
   aligned positions) of 70 filistatid species. The analysis of the data
   (morphological, molecular, and combined) consistently indicates the
   separation of the Filistatidae into two subfamilies, Prithinae and
   Filistatinae, in addition to supporting several groups of genera:
   Filistata, Zaitunia and an undescribed genus from Madagascar; Sahastata
   and Kukulcania; all Prithinae except Filistatinella and Microfilistata;
   Antilloides and Filistatoides; a large Old World group including Pritha,
   Tricalamus, Afrofilistata, Labahitha, Yardiella, Wandella and putative
   new genera; and a South American group formed by Lihuelistata, Pikelinia
   and Misionella. Pholcoides is transferred to Filistatinae and
   Microfilistata is transferred to Prithinae, and each represents the
   sister group to the remaining genera of its own subfamily. Most genera
   are valid, although Pikelinia is paraphyletic with respect to
   Misionella, so we consider the two genera as synonyms and propose a few
   new generic combinations. Considering the new phylogenetic hypothesis,
   we discuss the evolution of some morphological character systems and the
   biogeography of the family. The ages of divergence between clades were
   estimated using a total-evidence tip-dating approach by including
   fossils of Filistatidae and early spider clades; this approach resulted
   in younger age estimates than those obtained with traditional
   node-dating. Filistatidae is an ancient family that started diversifying
   in the Mesozoic and most genera date to the Cretaceous. Clades
   displaying transcontinental distributions were most likely affected by
   continental drift, but at least one clade shows unequivocal signs of
   transoceanic long-distance dispersal.},

Abstract = {Pericopina is divided into 36 genera, with the greatest diversity
   recorded in the Neotropics. Studies on the taxonomy and systematics of
   pericopines are scarce, and one of the few phylogenetic hypotheses
   available in the literature places some Afro-Indo-Malayan lineages among
   the Neotropical representatives. Through a survey of adult morphological
   characters, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships in Pericopina
   including Nyctemera and other Afro-Indo-Malayan genera as putative
   members of this subtribe. Additionally, we tested the monophyly of
   Dysschema, a key genus to understanding the evolutionary patterns of the
   extreme sexual dimorphism and polychromatism in Pericopina. Our
   cladistic analysis, based on 162 morphological characters, suggests that
   Pericopina is a polyphyletic group. Xenosoma is the only genus among the
   Neotropical pericopines related to the Afro-Indo-Malayan species;
   Scearctia is closely related to Lithosiini, and Pteroodes shows
   morphological similarities with Phaegopterina. Additionally, Seileria is
   a new junior subjective synonym of Thyrgis. The monophyly of Dysschema
   is supported only if the monotypic genera Myserla and Are are included.
   These are herein designated new synonyms of Dysschema. Our findings
   suggest that intersexual polychromatism and intersexual polymorphism for
   wing characters have arisen multiple times in the evolutionary history
   of Pericopina. Intersexual polychromatism is also widely distributed
   within Dysschema, perhaps representing a derived feature with multiple
   origins in the genus.},

Abstract = {Extinct organisms provide crucial information about the origin and time
   of origination of extant groups. The importance of morphological
   phylogenetics for rigorously dating the tree of life is now widely
   recognized and has been revitalized by methodological developments such
   as the application of tip-dating Bayesian approaches. Traditionally,
   molecular clocks have been node calibrated. However, node calibrations
   are often unsatisfactory because they do not allow the fossil age to
   inform about phylogenetic hypothesis. The introduction of tip
   calibrations allow fossil species to be included alongside their living
   relatives, and the absence of molecular sequence data for these taxa to
   be remedied by supplementing the sequence alignments for living taxa
   with phenotype character matrices for both living and fossil taxa.
   Therefore, only phylogenetic analyses that take into account
   morphological characters can incorporate both fossil and extant species.
   Herein we present an unprecedented morphological dataset for a vast
   group of glirid rodents, to which different phylogenetic methodologies
   have been applied. We have compared the tree topologies resulting from
   traditional parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches and calculate
   stratigraphic congruence indices for each. Bayesian tip-dated clock
   methods seem to outperform parsimony with our dataset. The strict
   consensus tree recovered by tip dating invalidates the classic
   classification and allows dates to be proposed for the divergence and
   origin of the different clades.},

Title = {Combined data analysis of fossil and living mammals: a Paleogene sister

Abstract = {The Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary, one of Earth's five major
   extinction events, occurred just before the appearance of Placentalia in
   the fossil record. The Gobi Desert, Mongolia and the Western Interior of
   North America have important fossil mammals occurring just before and
   after the KPg boundary (e.g. Prodiacodon, Deltatheridium) that have yet
   to be phylogenetically tested in a character-rich context with molecular
   data. We present here phylogenetic analyses of >6000 newly scored
   anatomical observations drawn from six untested fossils and added to the
   largest existing morphological matrix for mammals. These data are
   combined with sequence data from 27 nuclear genes. Results show the
   existence of a new eutherian sister clade to Placentalia, which we name
   and characterize. The extinct clade Leptictidae is part of this
   placental sister clade, indicating that the sister clade survived the
   KPg event to co-exist in ancient ecosystems during the Paleogene
   radiation of placentals. Analysing the Cretaceous metatherian
   Deltatheridium in this character-rich context reveals it is a member of
   Marsupialia, a finding that extends the minimum age of Marsupialia
   before the KPg boundary. Numerous shared-derived features from multiple
   anatomical systems support the assignment of Deltatheridium to
   Marsupialia. Computed tomography scans of exquisite new specimens better
   document the marsupial-like dental replacement pattern of
   Deltatheridium. The new placental sister clade has both Asian and North
   American species, and is ancestrally characterized by shared derived
   features such as a hind limb modified for saltatorial locomotion.},

Title = {Mitogenome phylogeny reveals Indochina Peninsula origin and

Journal = {CLADISTICS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Asian potamid subfamily Potamiscinae is the most species-rich group
   of primary freshwater crabs in the world, and a large number of these
   (318 species in 52 genera) are found in China where they exhibit a
   remarkably high rate of endemism. However, the evolutionary history and
   phylogenetic relationships of this subfamily is still poorly understood
   and the hypothesis that the Chinese potamids originated in the Indochina
   Peninsula has yet to be tested using a modern phylogeographic
   reconstruction and molecular dating methods. Here we analyze the
   phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history of the Chinese
   potamiscines based on whole mitogenomes of 72 species of Asian
   freshwater crabs representing 65\% of the potamiscine genera found in
   China, including new mitogenome sequences for 57 species. The
   mitogenomic phylogeny generated four separate clades: Southwest China
   (SWC), Indochina-Southwest China (ISWC), Central China (CC), and South
   China-adjacent Islands (SCI). Our results suggest that the Chinese
   potamiscine fauna most likely originated in Indochina during the Eocene.
   The establishment of the East Asian monsoon during the Eocene/Oligocene
   resulted in major climate changes that coincide with the local
   diversification of the CC and SCI clades. In addition, diversification
   of two other clades (ISWC and SWC) may have been driven by past large
   scale environmental changes taking place at that time such as increased
   local precipitation and expanding freshwater habitats associated with
   the uplifting of the Hengduan Mountains. In addition, our phylogenies
   did not support monophyly for six currently recognized potamiscine
   genera, highlighting the need for further taxonomic revisions of this
   fauna. The broad taxonomic sampling and well-supported molecular
   phylogenies used here allow for the updating of our understanding of the
   evolutionary origins and diversification of the potamiscine freshwater
   crabs in China.},

Title = {Female terminalia morphology and cladistic relations among Tok-Tok

Journal = {CLADISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tok-tokkies are one of the most iconic lineages within Tenebrionidae. In
   addition to containing some of the largest darkling beetles, this tribe
   is recognized for its remarkable form of sexual communication known as
   substrate tapping. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships within
   the group remain poorly understood. This study investigates the
   usefulness of female terminalia morphology for delimiting Sepidiini and
   reconstructing relationships among it. Data on the structure of the
   ovipositors, genital tubes and spicula ventrali have been generated for
   >200 species representing 28 Pimeliinae tribes. This dataset was used in
   a comparative analysis at the subfamilial level, which resulted in
   recognition of several unique features of tok-tokkie terminalia.
   Additionally, new features linking phenotypically challenging tribes
   also were recovered (Cryptochilini + Idisiini + Pimeliini). Secondly, 23
   characters linked to the structure of female terminalia were defined for
   tok-tok beetles. Cladistic analysis demonstrates the nonmonophyletic
   nature of most of the recognized subtribes. The morphological dataset
   was analysed separately and in combination with available molecular data
   (CAD, Wg, cox1, cox2, 28S). All obtained topologies were largely
   congruent, supporting the following changes: Palpomodina Kaminski \&
   Gearner subtr.n. is erected to accommodate the genera Namibomodes and
   Palpomodes; Argenticrinis and Bombocnodulus are transferred from
   Hypomelina to Molurina; 153 species and subspecies previously classified
   within Psammodes are distributed over three separate genera (Mariazofia
   Kaminski nom.n., Piesomera stat.r., Psammodes sens.n.). Psammodes
   sklodowskae Kaminski \& Gearner sp.n. is described. Preliminary
   investigation of the ovipositor of Mariazofia basuto (Koch) comb.n. was
   carried out with the application of microcomputed tomography,
   illuminating the muscular system as a reliable reference point for
   recognizing homologous elements in highly modified ovipositors.},

Abstract = {A new phylogenetic comparative method called DUALCOR is presented to
   evaluate the evolutionary response of a character to non-evolving
   external factors, such as environmental variables. The method treats the
   character as a typical evolving feature of an organism that is
   reconstructed on a given tree, whereas the external factor is treated as
   unrelated to the phylogeny. DUALCOR first calculates the
   correlation/regression between the observed values of the character and
   the external factor; then it maps the character onto the phylogeny,
   shuffles the changes among branches, and re-evolves the character to
   yield new terminal values uncorrelated with the observed values of the
   external factor, allowing users to examine whether the observed degree
   of correlation can be attained at random. This is repeated n (say, 999)
   times, thereby using the dual nature of characters to construct a
   permutation test that is shown to satisfy requirements of Generalized
   Monte Carlo procedures. In addition, we provide an empirical example
   with a reverse test where the external variable (features determined
   largely by non-heritable factors) is the dependent variable.},
