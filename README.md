# Keywords to success: a practical guide to maximise the visibility and impact of academic papers

This repository contains the data, code, and other materials used for this project. We recommend navigating those documents using the knitted page, at https://p-pottier.github.io/keywords_to_success/

Below is a description of the architecture of the different folders. Please don't hesitate to contact Patrice Pottier (p.pottier@unsw.edu.au) if you need assistance navigating these documents. We highly recommend contacting us if you are to re-use our data or analyses in future studies.
